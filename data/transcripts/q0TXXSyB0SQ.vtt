numerous recommendations
 
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 align:start position:0%
these reports have been sent to all
 
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and should be
 
00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 align:start position:0%

found in our public website please
 
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
inform me and I will seek to rectify

number two second iteration Ten Years

Later in 2012 there was a house
 
00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
committee on the redress of grievances
 
00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
because I spoke of this committee at
 
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
some length last week I will give only a
 
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
Bare Bones comment now there was a
 
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 align:start position:0%
report from representative Paul
 
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 align:start position:0%
ingridson chair there was an additional
 
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
report originally published in the house
 
00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 align:start position:0%
Journal of March 21
 
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
2012. finally there exists a legal
 
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
analysis by The Honorable Charles G
 
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
Douglas III then house legal counsel
 
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
dated April 28 2015.
 
00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 align:start position:0%
these three items have been sent to all
 
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and should be
 
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
available on our website to members of
 
00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
the public should any of these three
 
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
reports not be found in our public
 
00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 align:start position:0%
website please inform me and I will seek
 
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
to rectify this problem now I am calling
 
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
attention to all of these previous
 
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 align:start position:0%
iterations for the following reasons
 
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
first it will be very helpful for
 
00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
committee members to read these reports
 
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
both now and periodically as we progress
 
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
with our work
 
00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 align:start position:0%
second it will demonstrate
 
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
that because of the complexities of the
 
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.390 align:start position:0%
that because of the complexities of the
law

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 align:start position:0%
the question of the degree to which
 
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
Arbiters should have discretion and the
 
00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
fact that although all divorce custody
 
00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
alimony and child support cases have
 
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
things in common each case is unique
 
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
so a
 
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all law rule or protocol
 
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
may be somewhat difficult to craft
 
00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
notice how the previous committees
 
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
wrestled with all of this as we will be
 
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.690 align:start position:0%
wrestled with all of this as we will be
wrestling

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
wrestling
 
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 align:start position:0%
and third reason for calling attention
 
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
to these past reports
 
00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 align:start position:0%
that while each iteration of looking at
 
00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
the court had similarities to each of
 
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
the others each committee approached and
 
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
is approaching the matter somewhat
 
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.030 align:start position:0%
is approaching the matter somewhat
differently

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
differently
 
00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 align:start position:0%
this diversity of style and methodology
 
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 align:start position:0%
to me is helpful it's a good thing
 
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
I'm glad we're all looking at this in
 
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
different ways therefore one committee
 
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
does not really comprise the entire body
 
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
even of present investigation we have
 
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
these other things as precedents that
 
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
inform us
 
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
second introductory matter of today
 
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
emails text letters phone calls
 
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 align:start position:0%
as the existence of this committee
 
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 align:start position:0%
becomes more widely known
 
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
communication with either me as the
 
00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759 align:start position:0%
chairman or with all of us the committee
 
00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 align:start position:0%
is increasing
 
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 align:start position:0%
I much appreciate those who understand
 
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
and cooperate with the ground rules I've
 
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
laid down for conveying of information
 
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
to us
 
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
these people realize as much as they
 
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
would like a do-over on their trial or a
 
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
listening ear that commiserates
 
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 align:start position:0%
we if we are to accomplish our goals
 
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
need information provided in a certain
 
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.810 align:start position:0%
need information provided in a certain
way

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 align:start position:0%
I especially appreciate those who
 
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 align:start position:0%
understand it and by the way those who
 
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
filled out pink cards and now said can I
 
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
be put off another week I don't think
 
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
I'm ready to do it in the format you
 
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
wish thank you that gives what you say
 
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
and I also appreciate all the thank yous
 
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
that are coming already that is
 
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 align:start position:0%
comforting as we do our work
 
00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 align:start position:0%
but because of the growing volume of
 
00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.469 align:start position:0%
but because of the growing volume of
communication

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
communication
 
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
and the fact that everyone on our
 
00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 align:start position:0%
committee has other things to do in the
 
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 align:start position:0%
legislature at home and for some of us
 
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 align:start position:0%
at our day job or jobs
 
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
we can devote only so much time to the
 
00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
communication sent to us
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
for me and I know in talking with some
 
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 align:start position:0%
of you on the committee that means
 
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.450 align:start position:0%
of you on the committee that means
prioritizing

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
prioritizing
 
00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
what comes to us
 
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself top priority is
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
communication from someone who hasn't
 
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
communicated with us before or who has
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
done it but only once
 
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
what those folks send is new information
 
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
or else
 
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 align:start position:0%
in a follow-up communication back from
 
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
us clarification is made to a question
 
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
about more information
 
00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:51.539 align:start position:0%
it also means an increase increasing
 
00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:54.290 align:start position:0%
it also means an increase increasing
unlikelihood

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.300 align:start position:0%
unlikelihood
 
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
of reading
 
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.529 align:start position:0%
of reading
everything

00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:57.539 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
especially Communications from the hands
 
00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:02.819 align:start position:0%
full of people who seek to address US
 
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
frequently we've heard you
 
00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979 align:start position:0%
sometimes these communications come
 
00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
every day or two
 
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
and have demonstrated those people
 
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:13.380 align:start position:0%
cannot or will not adhere to sticking to
 
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
the kinds of things we choose to hear
 
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
my time devoted to this special
 
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
committee is insufficient to attend to
 
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
lectures on how this committee is doing
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
our job wrongly
 
00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:27.539 align:start position:0%
and it is insufficient to attend to
 
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
extremely long reviews of entire cases
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
including personal attacks I don't have
 
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
the time for that
 
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps there may be someday another
 
00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:39.419 align:start position:0%
committee that works differently
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
and would welcome all of these things
 
00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:44.099 align:start position:0%
but this is not that committee
 
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
and then finally the third introductory
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
matter I have been asked to read every
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
week the document entitled notice and
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
disclaimer so here goes again
 
00:07:56.689 --> 00:07:56.699 align:start position:0%
the special committee on the Family
 
00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
Division of the Circuit Court was formed
 
00:08:00.529 --> 00:08:00.539 align:start position:0%
to investigate allegations of
 
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
irregularities including failure to
 
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
follow or enforce statutes unwarranted
 
00:08:09.409 --> 00:08:09.419 align:start position:0%
waiver of or failure to follow court
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
rules delay in rendering decisions
 
00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:14.759 align:start position:0%
denial of due process and other
 
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:16.740 align:start position:0%
procedural issues
 
00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:18.539 align:start position:0%
the committee will conduct hearings
 
00:08:20.809 --> 00:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
relative to the process of the Family
 
00:08:23.089 --> 00:08:23.099 align:start position:0%
Division of the circuit court and may
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
make recommendations for future
 
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.930 align:start position:0%
make recommendations for future
legislation

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:08:28.969 --> 00:08:28.979 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the committee is to
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
discover areas where changes in
 
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
procedures or changes in law regarding
 
00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:36.419 align:start position:0%
the Family Division of the Circuit Court
 
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
might be made the purpose of this
 
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:40.740 align:start position:0%
special committee
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
is not to retry the cases of citizens
 
00:08:45.769 --> 00:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
who disagree with the outcome of
 
00:08:45.779 --> 00:08:47.389 align:start position:0%
who disagree with the outcome of
litigation

00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
members of the public will be given
 
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify and present
 
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
information to the committee because of
 
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
the numbers of people who may wish to
 
00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
testify there may be a time limit
 
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
imposed on each person testifying
 
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
which is permissible under house rule
 
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.670 align:start position:0%
which is permissible under house rule
100.

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
100.
 
00:09:07.449 --> 00:09:07.459 align:start position:0%
appropriate subject matter for Testimony
 
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
will be limited to specific instances of
 
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
where there seem to be irregularities in
 
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
process procedure or adherence to rules
 
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
and statutes
 
00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:21.899 align:start position:0%
those testifying about subject matter
 
00:09:25.009 --> 00:09:25.019 align:start position:0%
related to a court case or who submit
 
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
documentation related to a court case
 
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
should know that both of these will be
 
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:33.300 align:start position:0%
made part of the public record therefore
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
subject matter that is either
 
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
confidential or may be under seal should
 
00:09:41.329 --> 00:09:41.339 align:start position:0%
not be discussed or submitted to the
 
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
committee as disclosure of such matters
 
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
would be a violation of Statute or court
 
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.570 align:start position:0%
would be a violation of Statute or court
order

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
order
 
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
and let me add as I did last time the
 
00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:53.459 align:start position:0%
committee has no way of knowing
 
00:09:56.269 --> 00:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
when a person is testifying whether that
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
person is violating these things or not
 
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
the burden in maybe any future
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
punishment of violating is solely on you
 
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
and not on the committee so you'll have
 
00:10:06.829 --> 00:10:06.839 align:start position:0%
to censor yourself
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
and then finally the committee reserves
 
00:10:11.329 --> 00:10:11.339 align:start position:0%
the right not to accept written or oral
 
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
testimony or materials
 
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
that would in its judgment violate all
 
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
the foregoing
 
00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
so with that in mind we continue
 
00:10:25.009 --> 00:10:25.019 align:start position:0%
listening to folks from various
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
organizations and as I pointed out 20
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
years ago they were actually part of the
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
committee this time I chose not to do it
 
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
that way but instead invite them to come
 
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
and make a presentation
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
and in my schedule I have down Office of
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
the child advocate
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
so with that person or persons please
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.829 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:54.769 --> 00:10:54.779 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at my scheduler
 
00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:02.220 align:start position:0%
well okay that's not what I have it is
 
00:11:06.889 --> 00:11:06.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.810 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:13.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
there is no one else scheduled for today
 
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:19.980 align:start position:0%
is that correct um Christina
 
00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.590 align:start position:0%
is that correct um Christina
this

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
all right yeah sure we've got a few
 
00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:24.779 align:start position:0%
people who are
 
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
um who have turned in some pink cards
 
00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.290 align:start position:0%
um who have turned in some pink cards
um

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:32.449 --> 00:11:32.459 align:start position:0%
all right the chair recognizes Dale
 
00:11:32.459 --> 00:11:36.889 align:start position:0%
all right the chair recognizes Dale
Savoy

00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:36.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
who wonderfully has presented all the
 
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
specific information that we have
 
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
requested on the back of the very same
 
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
I I tried to be accommodating well you
 
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.069 align:start position:0%
I I tried to be accommodating well you
know

00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
so and actually I you know I also uh
 
00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:56.519 align:start position:0%
said that I would get you the
 
00:11:59.810 --> 00:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
information in terms of uh uh
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
all the statistics on fatherless homes
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
I'm still working on that I didn't
 
00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:05.220 align:start position:0%
realize it that you were going to be
 
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
doing these meetings every week so uh I
 
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:09.660 align:start position:0%
don't have that as of yet but I I do
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
have the information okay you got five
 
00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
minutes for your presentation and when
 
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
you're finished with that
 
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
um we will be archiving your card and
 
00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:20.700 align:start position:0%
and so on so when more information comes
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
to us we can attach that perfect so I
 
00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify
 
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.389 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify
um

00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
when I mentioned my views for for uh
 
00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
granting my my children's Mother uh
 
00:12:32.279 --> 00:12:33.530 align:start position:0%
granting my my children's Mother uh
custody

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
custody
 
00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
um and limiting my my visitation to them
 
00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:38.389 align:start position:0%
um and limiting my my visitation to them
um

00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
that was based on uh oral testimony that
 
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
that she had provided at the time the
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
time in the judge responded to but uh in
 
00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:49.940 align:start position:0%
the actual uh final order if I may read
 
00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
uh there were some suggestions by the
 
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
Father the parties could follow a
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
nesting agreement which is we would we
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
would switch off the kids would stay in
 
00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
the house we would switch off which
 
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:02.700 align:start position:0%
seems reasonable to me at the time Court
 
00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:04.740 align:start position:0%
does not find this proposal appropriate
 
00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
there has been tension between the
 
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
parties in the past with Father
 
00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
exhibited behavior that described as
 
00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:11.519 align:start position:0%
Intense or even
 
00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
controlling during the marriage
 
00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
no examples given there was not that
 
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
there was nothing that would exhibit
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
that other than my uh intensity in the
 
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:23.220 align:start position:0%
courtroom at the suggestion that I
 
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
should have my kids taken away from me
 
00:13:28.129 --> 00:13:28.139 align:start position:0%
and I think the Judge actually used that
 
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:30.660 align:start position:0%
and that's where that's coming from and
 
00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:32.700 align:start position:0%
how she Justified that
 
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:39.949 --> 00:13:39.959 align:start position:0%
and goes on to say
 
00:13:41.329 --> 00:13:41.339 align:start position:0%
there have been times where this
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
intensity was also visited upon the
 
00:13:44.569 --> 00:13:44.579 align:start position:0%
children a manner of commuting to them
 
00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:45.959 align:start position:0%
example telling the oldest daughter
 
00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
which they're not mentioning she was an
 
00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:49.860 align:start position:0%
adult at the time that she needed to get
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
her together uh
 
00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
I think most people would agree that's
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
that's hardly an intense situation where
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
it would be considered child abuse and
 
00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
oh by the way we were alone and my other
 
00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
children were not in proximity at the
 
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
time that event occurred
 
00:14:06.769 --> 00:14:06.779 align:start position:0%
um she also goes on to reference their
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
involvement by the police in the past uh
 
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
that was an incident where uh my my one
 
00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:14.220 align:start position:0%
of my children was having an issue in
 
00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
school with they were making decisions
 
00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
about it and I wanted to be a party to
 
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
the that process while my ex did not
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
agree with that and upon my immediate
 
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:30.060 align:start position:0%
exiting of her presence she called the
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
police on me and she actually used that
 
00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
as leverage in that in that hearing
 
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
and the judge requested I don't know if
 
00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:40.740 align:start position:0%
the judge saw the footage of of that
 
00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
interaction because the the police had
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
cameras and I think you would find that
 
00:14:48.829 --> 00:14:48.839 align:start position:0%
what you would see mostly in that is is
 
00:14:51.889 --> 00:14:51.899 align:start position:0%
my uh
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
a high degree of sadness in that I was
 
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
not able to
 
00:14:57.769 --> 00:14:57.779 align:start position:0%
participate in these kinds of decisions
 
00:14:59.689 --> 00:14:59.699 align:start position:0%
in my kids lives
 
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
and that did that did affect my kids as
 
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
they got older going through it's you
 
00:15:06.769 --> 00:15:06.779 align:start position:0%
know this this goes into the part where
 
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
removing fathers from these situations
 
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
and it affected my own kids is really
 
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
negative on kids
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
and that needs to be driven home to the
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
court and
 
00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
listening to your your conversation of
 
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
the the prior meeting to the one that I
 
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
was able to attend you talked about
 
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
uh either laws being broken or rules
 
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
being violated in in the courtroom well
 
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that in this case that any
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
law or rules was violated the courts
 
00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:40.860 align:start position:0%
right now are the judges are basically
 
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
given a blanket coverage under best
 
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:45.660 align:start position:0%
interest of the children and under best
 
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:47.220 align:start position:0%
interests of the children the judge
 
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
feels for whatever reason it's in the
 
00:15:53.569 --> 00:15:53.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
there's little there's little you can do
 
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
under the law
 
00:15:59.210 --> 00:15:59.220 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
00:16:02.689 --> 00:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
to hold the judge accountable for any
 
00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:04.139 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:16:07.069 --> 00:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
inappropriate decision making
 
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
because you're really up to it's up to
 
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
the judge
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
the word I'm looking for uh
 
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
discretion they are given a tremendous
 
00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
amount of description under best
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
interest of the children
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of being able to make these
 
00:16:26.449 --> 00:16:26.459 align:start position:0%
kinds of decisions
 
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure how effective if you're
 
00:16:32.569 --> 00:16:32.579 align:start position:0%
limited to law breaking or rule breaking
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
how effective can this panel possibly be
 
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
if that's if you're under this situation
 
00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:42.779 align:start position:0%
I'd be curious to get a response from
 
00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:45.959 align:start position:0%
from this Committee in terms of how
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
outside of rules and law breaking
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
what would you be able to do
 
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
anyone on the committee have a question
 
00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.750 align:start position:0%
anyone on the committee have a question
the

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
representative law
 
00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Savoy uh now you spoke of
 
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:15.900 align:start position:0%
your adult daughter and and what are the
 
00:17:17.689 --> 00:17:17.699 align:start position:0%
how many children and what were their
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
ages I have four kids at that time so
 
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
they they're roughly two years apart so
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
my youngest would have been um
 
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
follow up there were three there were
 
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
three other children that were not
 
00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:38.700 align:start position:0%
adults and their age were
 
00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:41.700 align:start position:0%
um so that would have been uh 16 14 and
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
12 roughly okay great thank you
 
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.120 align:start position:0%

thank you for um taking my question
um

00:18:00.669 --> 00:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:03.900 align:start position:0%
you understand that we are not an
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
appellate court
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you for for acknowledging
 
00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
that what we are trying to do is
 
00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
determine what it would be appropriate
 
00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:20.460 align:start position:0%
for the legislative branch to do
 
00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
um in terms of identifying difficulties
 
00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:26.700 align:start position:0%
and finding uh ways to address those
 
00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.370 align:start position:0%
and finding uh ways to address those
difficulties

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
difficulties
 
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:36.059 align:start position:0%
ever uh
 
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
write or contact the judicial conduct
 
00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.010 align:start position:0%
write or contact the judicial conduct
committee

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
most of my
 
00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
when I was uh going through this whole
 
00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
trial most of my interaction was was my
 
00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
peers and
 
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
friends family that have gone through
 
00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:56.220 align:start position:0%
this process and many of them have tried
 
00:18:59.090 --> 00:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
to do that and almost to a person
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
anybody that did do that anybody I
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
communicated felt that it was completely
 
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.090 align:start position:0%
communicated felt that it was completely
useless

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
useless
 
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
and when you think about hey the judges
 
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.289 align:start position:0%
and when you think about hey the judges
have

00:19:09.289 --> 00:19:09.299 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
such a degree of discretion with in
 
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
terms of of
 
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.150 align:start position:0%
terms of of
um

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
best interest of the children how can
 
00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:20.220 align:start position:0%
you possibly uh affect any kind of
 
00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.190 align:start position:0%
you possibly uh affect any kind of
change

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
I mean just this example alone the judge
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
decided based on my conduct in the
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
courtroom that I was an intense person
 
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
an overly intense person and not
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
justified her limiting my access to my
 
00:19:37.679 --> 00:19:40.010 align:start position:0%
justified her limiting my access to my
children

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:42.049 --> 00:19:42.059 align:start position:0%
and and I think if you played that audio
 
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
footage to to the general public they
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
would agree that that makes no sense
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
a father
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
showing intensity for wanting to
 
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
participate in their kids life it would
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
normally be a good thing
 
00:19:57.409 --> 00:19:57.419 align:start position:0%
but in a court setting for whatever
 
00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:01.860 align:start position:0%
reason they view that as a negative
 
00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:03.900 align:start position:0%
they want you to go into that courtroom
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
be very restrained
 
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
matter of fact and bring no emotion into
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
it at all well that's I got to tell you
 
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
if personally that's very difficult to
 
00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:18.169 align:start position:0%
if personally that's very difficult to
do

00:20:18.169 --> 00:20:18.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:21.620 align:start position:0%
so if I go before the the you know this
 
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
committee what would I possibly be able
 
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
to say or do
 
00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
that would have any kind of effective
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
anything that they could work on the
 
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
judge has discretion
 
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.630 align:start position:0%
judge has discretion
for

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
best interest of the children when you
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
read through the through the family
 
00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:40.860 align:start position:0%
courts all right thank you very much for
 
00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
answering my question thank you
 
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth
 
00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
Mr Savoy for taking my question
 
00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:52.140 align:start position:0%
um in your criticism of the Court's
 
00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.150 align:start position:0%
um in your criticism of the Court's
order

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
order
 
00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
um I'm not clear that I have your
 
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
language correctly but I think you said
 
00:20:59.570 --> 00:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
they Court based its rejection of the
 
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
nesting proposal that you had based on
 
00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
your controlling and aggressive behavior
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
uh intense Behavior well in combination
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
with we're going through a divorce so
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
there's contention there between okay so
 
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
so my question is generally the court
 
00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
made a conclusion and it backed it up by
 
00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
those observations so is your in terms
 
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
of what they wrote I can't speak to what
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
she felt she could write and and was
 
00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
justifiable when you look at the final
 
00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:33.620 align:start position:0%
order what she did wrote had to do with
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh my intensity if you will
 
00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:39.059 align:start position:0%
so my question is is your testimony that
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
there was not any evidence in the record
 
00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
that you did have the aggressive or
 
00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:45.900 align:start position:0%
intense Behavior or you wanted the judge
 
00:21:48.289 --> 00:21:48.299 align:start position:0%
to provide examples of what that type of
 
00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:51.059 align:start position:0%
testimony was so it's at best you could
 
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
say it was hearsay from from my ex
 
00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
there was nothing it was basically just
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
he's intense
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
and there was nothing there was no
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
examples given other than
 
00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:04.740 align:start position:0%
the conversation I had with my oldest
 
00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:07.980 align:start position:0%
daughter that was the only example given
 
00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
and if that's the worst thing that I
 
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
have done
 
00:22:15.049 --> 00:22:15.059 align:start position:0%
I would be an exemplary father
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
just follow up so I know you didn't have
 
00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:20.039 align:start position:0%
an attorney but you were you are you
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
aware I don't know of filing Motions
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
like a motion for clarification or
 
00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
motion for reconsideration or finding a
 
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
fact and rulings of law that would have
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
clarified that I did provide
 
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
um my case number on the on the pin card
 
00:22:36.409 --> 00:22:36.419 align:start position:0%
so if you look at that I did try
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
multiple occasions um for one thing if
 
00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:41.940 align:start position:0%
if it's not if your your emotions are
 
00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
not written the way the court
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
likes or deems appropriate for that
 
00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
emotion so if I could just dismissed on
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
that alone because what I was just
 
00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
specifically because we're looking at um
 
00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:55.860 align:start position:0%
you know problems or irregular irregular
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
irregularities yeah process so you
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
criticize the court order and and said
 
00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
that you didn't think the basis of their
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
conclusion was correct so I'm just
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
asking for that specific court order did
 
00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
you file any pleading that would have
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
clarified or confirmed your you know
 
00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
feeling like the court had been
 
00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
arbitrary in that ruling well certainly
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
not at the time no I felt you know I I
 
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.649 align:start position:0%
not at the time no I felt you know I I
just

00:23:21.649 --> 00:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say assume but I
 
00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
concluded based on the the information
 
00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:28.980 align:start position:0%
provided that in the absence of other
 
00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
testimony or or any real
 
00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:33.590 align:start position:0%
testimony or or any real
um

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
cases or scenarios where you would
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
consider that to be intense or you know
 
00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
anything in the realm of abusive uh
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
none of that was presented
 
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
so for me
 
00:23:51.289 --> 00:23:51.299 align:start position:0%
trying to uh
 
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
so when you get when you're given uh the
 
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
case you're you're basically assigned to
 
00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:57.179 align:start position:0%
a specific Judge and you're with that
 
00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
judge until this thing concludes I am
 
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
still going through with this judge so
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so you've answered it you did
 
00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:07.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
in other aspects of it but not
 
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
specifically having to do with this
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:24:14.159 --> 00:24:15.110 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
um

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
any other questions uh representative
 
00:24:17.159 --> 00:24:19.430 align:start position:0%
any other questions uh representative
ball

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
ball
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Pearson um could you
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
tell me if there was anyone in the
 
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
courthouse who was there to help you
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
fill out any paperworks or help direct
 
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
you through the process
 
00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:32.039 align:start position:0%
thank you you had no lawyer you were
 
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
litigant pro se
 
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
okay was your wife uh she had she had a
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
lawyer yes
 
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
okay because sometimes we hear judges
 
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
bend over backwards to help litigan's
 
00:24:45.529 --> 00:24:45.539 align:start position:0%
Pro Se especially when the other party
 
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
has legal counsel uh that actually
 
00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:50.820 align:start position:0%
probably that did happen to an extent at
 
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
the beginning of of the this whole thing
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
where I had a trial I actually told I
 
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
actually asked the judge the fact that I
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
don't have the the fact that I don't
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
have a lawyer will it impact the overall
 
00:25:06.529 --> 00:25:06.539 align:start position:0%
outcome of this thing and I you know if
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
you get the Oriole test the or the oral
 
00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
recording of that those hearings you'll
 
00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
hear that where I actually
 
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
Express concern about that to the judge
 
00:25:18.409 --> 00:25:18.419 align:start position:0%
and the judge felt at the time that it
 
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:20.700 align:start position:0%
it would not impact her overall view
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and and this is a leading
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
question but I think it actually is more
 
00:25:27.169 --> 00:25:27.179 align:start position:0%
clarifying what I thought I heard lead
 
00:25:27.179 --> 00:25:28.610 align:start position:0%
clarifying what I thought I heard lead
away

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:30.539 align:start position:0%
I won't have to declare you a hostile
 
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:32.220 align:start position:0%
witness to do this it's my committee
 
00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.529 align:start position:0%
witness to do this it's my committee
okay

00:25:33.529 --> 00:25:33.539 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:33.539 --> 00:25:34.310 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:39.289 --> 00:25:39.299 align:start position:0%
is it your testimony that you believe
 
00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
your wife made numbers of accusations
 
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
against you on various things that were
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
accepted but did not have proof of those
 
00:25:51.289 --> 00:25:51.299 align:start position:0%
allegations uh
 
00:25:54.169 --> 00:25:54.179 align:start position:0%
yes from my perspective she didn't
 
00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
actually she didn't actually have to
 
00:25:58.990 --> 00:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
they go in knowing her attorney I'm sure
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely made clear to her all we got
 
00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
to do is basically show any kind of
 
00:26:06.529 --> 00:26:06.539 align:start position:0%
issue of any kind you don't have to
 
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
really in terms of the oral all she did
 
00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
was say I'm afraid and she was shedding
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
some a little bit of tears and that was
 
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
all it took
 
00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you okay good and
 
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:18.900 align:start position:0%
that's helpful yeah so
 
00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:20.820 align:start position:0%
and and when you
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
when you talk to other individuals in
 
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
terms of having gone through this
 
00:26:27.409 --> 00:26:27.419 align:start position:0%
as well they will tell you a very
 
00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
similar story they don't they don't
 
00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
really have to provide much in the way
 
00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:33.740 align:start position:0%
the the court system is set up
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
inherently biased towards mother getting
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
the kids and they're going to make sure
 
00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
that that is going to be the outcome
 
00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
okay good thank you that's all I need
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
for an answer
 
00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
um do we have anyone else
 
00:26:51.649 --> 00:26:51.659 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
um and if I could speak to msdaya I
 
00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
don't know if I've already asked you to
 
00:26:59.210 --> 00:26:59.220 align:start position:0%
do this but if I didn't I am now and if
 
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
not I'm patient some states I have been
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
reading extensively in law books on
 
00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
family law
 
00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
uh some states seem to have a built-in
 
00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
um leaning I I won't use the word bias
 
00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:19.220 align:start position:0%
it's a loaded word but leaning towards
 
00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
moms get the kids that's the default
 
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
position almost automatically other
 
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
states don't seem to have that
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
and have a more it could go either way
 
00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:35.090 align:start position:0%
and have a more it could go either way
mentality

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
mentality
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering if you could do a
 
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
little bit of research to find out a
 
00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:42.900 align:start position:0%
what New Hampshire is on paper because I
 
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
think I know what it may be in practice
 
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
and what a handful of other states might
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
do that could inform New Hampshire
 
00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:53.940 align:start position:0%
because if it's for the benefit of the
 
00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:54.950 align:start position:0%
because if it's for the benefit of the
kids

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
kids
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
that's begs multiple questions the
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
answer to which one of those questions
 
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
is maybe it isn't automatic default to
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
one parent or the other so if you could
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
take that liberal arts question and then
 
00:28:12.169 --> 00:28:12.179 align:start position:0%
turn it into real language and do some
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
research I'd appreciate that thank you
 
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
so much and now the chair recognizes a
 
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:22.140 align:start position:0%
so much and now the chair recognizes a
presentation

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:22.150 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:25.930 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:25.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
I'm a little surprised I guess by
 
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.210 align:start position:0%
I'm a little surprised I guess by
um

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:35.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:37.799 align:start position:0%
the question that you just asked because
 
00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
my experience limited on children and
 
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
family law
 
00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:48.620 align:start position:0%
but also on Judiciary is that
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
are in our rsas and I would believe in
 
00:29:00.169 --> 00:29:00.179 align:start position:0%
our um
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
one would hope in the training uh that
 
00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:09.860 align:start position:0%
new judges experience and I fear that by
 
00:29:15.049 --> 00:29:15.059 align:start position:0%
you asking the question that the way
 
00:29:18.769 --> 00:29:18.779 align:start position:0%
that you did without our hearing
 
00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:22.100 align:start position:0%
from the courts for example and others
 
00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
you might have given an impression that
 
00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:28.740 align:start position:0%
I don't think is accurate of you
 
00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.289 align:start position:0%
I don't think is accurate of you
prejudging

00:29:30.289 --> 00:29:30.299 align:start position:0%
prejudging
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
that situation and so I wonder if we
 
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:37.140 align:start position:0%
might back off a little bit on that
 
00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:38.269 align:start position:0%
might back off a little bit on that
um

00:29:38.269 --> 00:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
on that directive that you just gave to
 
00:29:43.549 --> 00:29:43.559 align:start position:0%
our wonderful staff people given part of
 
00:29:45.889 --> 00:29:45.899 align:start position:0%
the charge to the committee is to
 
00:29:48.409 --> 00:29:48.419 align:start position:0%
investigate allegations this is one of
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
the allegations that I've been hearing
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
for years
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
it may prove to be unfounded I'm not
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
prejudicing prejudicing
 
00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
the outcome of my researchers
 
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:04.919 align:start position:0%
research good I'm just raising the
 
00:30:06.649 --> 00:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much and I could
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
well be informed of all of the things of
 
00:30:12.769 --> 00:30:12.779 align:start position:0%
which you speak and would love to to be
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you but thank you for raising that
 
00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
00:30:18.769 --> 00:30:18.779 align:start position:0%
and now we have a presentation from the
 
00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
good morning Cassandra Sanchez child
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%

00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:41.399 align:start position:0%

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.389 align:start position:0%

everyone

00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:52.580 align:start position:0%
sure Lissa is
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
l-i-s-s-a last name massio m-a-s-c-i-o
 
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
good morning so I am here today to
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
present on the office of the child
 
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
advocate in our overlap with the courts
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
it is quite important to note as many of
 
00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
you may know we are independent
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
oversight agency over executive branch
 
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
child serving agencies which includes
 
00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
dcyf and DHHS as well as the provider
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
agencies that contract with them
 
00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:32.700 align:start position:0%
then I can lead into what our
 
00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
limitations are because I would like to
 
00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
make it very clear for this room we do
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
have limitations in our oversight we do
 
00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:40.860 align:start position:0%
not have oversight over the courts we do
 
00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
not have oversight over Casa and we do
 
00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
not have oversight over gals although we
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
do interact with these entities on a
 
00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:50.940 align:start position:0%
regular basis particularly in our
 
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
oversight role in looking at dcyf cases
 
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
we do not have the ability to make
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
recommendations or review the work of
 
00:31:59.930 --> 00:31:59.940 align:start position:0%
those entities
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
rather we work closely with them in
 
00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
trying to partner and educate those
 
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
entities so what I can share is that
 
00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
the office has spent time building
 
00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
relationships with a judicial system so
 
00:32:13.149 --> 00:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
we attend regular judges trainings
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
offering information about the office as
 
00:32:18.049 --> 00:32:18.059 align:start position:0%
well as trends that we see in the office
 
00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
that impact the children of New
 
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:20.570 align:start position:0%
that impact the children of New
Hampshire

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
we also participate on the model Court
 
00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
committee where again we have the
 
00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:27.539 align:start position:0%
opportunity to share Trends and to work
 
00:32:30.289 --> 00:32:30.299 align:start position:0%
and influencing the courts and making
 
00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:32.700 align:start position:0%
positive progress that's going to focus
 
00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799 align:start position:0%
on the best interests of children
 
00:32:36.889 --> 00:32:36.899 align:start position:0%
we are a partner in that we do not have
 
00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:38.220 align:start position:0%
the oversight or review of that
 
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
committee either
 
00:32:42.649 --> 00:32:42.659 align:start position:0%
and with the Casas and gals we work to
 
00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
partner with them to offer trainings to
 
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:46.380 align:start position:0%
those entities much like the trainings
 
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
that we offer to the judges
 
00:32:51.409 --> 00:32:51.419 align:start position:0%
my office does receive complaints in
 
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
regards to court issues parental divorce
 
00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.389 align:start position:0%
regards to court issues parental divorce
cases

00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:32:58.810 --> 00:32:58.820 align:start position:0%
and because we do not have jurisdiction
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
we are not able to offer
 
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:04.140 align:start position:0%
much support and advice from the office
 
00:33:07.549 --> 00:33:07.559 align:start position:0%
we may refer out to another entity or we
 
00:33:09.049 --> 00:33:09.059 align:start position:0%
will have to share that it is not our
 
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction therefore we cannot assist
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
them on that case
 
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
we do not have a great data system
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
that's able to for us we try to go back
 
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
and look in our data system to find how
 
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:23.640 align:start position:0%
many of these we receive per year our
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
system is not ideal for analyzing that
 
00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
kind of data so we were not able to pull
 
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
in the few that we were able to look
 
00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
closely on some case examples I can
 
00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:34.919 align:start position:0%
highlight some of the examples that we
 
00:33:36.649 --> 00:33:36.659 align:start position:0%
have heard in regards to issues with the
 
00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:38.519 align:start position:0%
court the parents have called in but
 
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
again these are not cases that we have
 
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
provided any guidance or review of
 
00:33:45.409 --> 00:33:45.419 align:start position:0%
and so when those that we did Paul we
 
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
had a number of them that were ongoing
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
divorce or parenting cases
 
00:33:54.409 --> 00:33:54.419 align:start position:0%
some of which included dcyf
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
where either one parent or the other was
 
00:33:58.850 --> 00:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
calling into Central intake calling
 
00:34:01.009 --> 00:34:01.019 align:start position:0%
allegations in against the other parents
 
00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
we've had a number of cases that have
 
00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
had that issue we will inform them on
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
the dcyf process and what it means to
 
00:34:10.369 --> 00:34:10.379 align:start position:0%
have an open assessment and have them
 
00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
entering the home and reviewing the home
 
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
but that's education is the minimal that
 
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
we will offer on those cases
 
00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:18.599 align:start position:0%
we have also had some with complaints
 
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
about gals where parents have shared
 
00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:23.220 align:start position:0%
that they feel one parent is favored
 
00:34:25.609 --> 00:34:25.619 align:start position:0%
with the gal over another
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
um some even providing at the call in
 
00:34:31.129 --> 00:34:31.139 align:start position:0%
providing documentation either emails or
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
some other documentation they may have
 
00:34:34.609 --> 00:34:34.619 align:start position:0%
with the gals where there's information
 
00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:36.599 align:start position:0%
that agal may have gone to one family
 
00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:39.260 align:start position:0%
home to assess that home not the other
 
00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
constant communication with one parent
 
00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:43.980 align:start position:0%
not necessarily the other
 
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
and those that we have seen there's we
 
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
have not seen a preference of
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
a mother over a father we have heard
 
00:34:53.089 --> 00:34:53.099 align:start position:0%
both sets
 
00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
pretty equally
 
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
and again we are counseling them out on
 
00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:58.140 align:start position:0%
those ones educating whenever possible
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
sending them to the correct entities for
 
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
complaints if they do have complaints
 
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
against the gals or the judge judges
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
decision we send them to the correct
 
00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
what I can share that we are aware of
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
and have reviewed quite thoroughly and
 
00:35:19.069 --> 00:35:19.079 align:start position:0%
many of you may be aware of as well is
 
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts OCA had an opportunity
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
to do a report on Harmony Montgomery
 
00:35:26.569 --> 00:35:26.579 align:start position:0%
case and looking at the concerns that
 
00:35:29.089 --> 00:35:29.099 align:start position:0%
that arose in Massachusetts before
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
Harmony came to New Hampshire and one
 
00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
aspect that they did highlight was the
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
issue with
 
00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
the the judge sending the child across
 
00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:38.940 align:start position:0%
state lines without full information
 
00:35:41.569 --> 00:35:41.579 align:start position:0%
about the child's needs and and what
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
would truly be in the child's best
 
00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
interest and feeling that in that case
 
00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
specifically the lack of judicial
 
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
oversight and oversight over some of the
 
00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:53.579 align:start position:0%
attorneys and
 
00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:56.220 align:start position:0%
um in that case I believe there was not
 
00:35:58.370 --> 00:35:58.380 align:start position:0%
a casa but gal so the oversight over
 
00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
those entities they felt was lacking and
 
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
that is something that we have discussed
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
with them and and we continue to explore
 
00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:07.140 align:start position:0%
but again it's not with currently within
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
our jurisdiction and speaking to our our
 
00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
partners in Massachusetts they currently
 
00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:14.820 align:start position:0%
have a similar like Committee in which
 
00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
they're going to be further exploring
 
00:36:19.089 --> 00:36:19.099 align:start position:0%
that issue and how they can either
 
00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
stretch oversight or how there can be
 
00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
some processes in place to ensure this
 
00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:27.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen to children in the future
 
00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
could you suspend for the member to ask
 
00:36:32.569 --> 00:36:32.579 align:start position:0%
a question absolute thank you I've just
 
00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:40.140 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is that that was
 
00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:43.380 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts court system it was
 
00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:45.260 align:start position:0%
not the New Hampshire court system
 
00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
correct what it does highlight for us is
 
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
a question about the oversight of Courts
 
00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
and those proceedings not that we've
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
made any specific recommendations to New
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but something that in
 
00:36:59.390 --> 00:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
reviewing such a high profile case it's
 
00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
important for our office to look at the
 
00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
recommendations that they had coming out
 
00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
of that report and one of the large
 
00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:07.740 align:start position:0%
recommendations they had was to look at
 
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
their judicial system
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you yes you may continue thank you
 
00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:16.670 align:start position:0%
thank you yes you may continue thank you
absolutely

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
um so I've also noticed in my time and I
 
00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
believe I heard the last time when
 
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
director ribsom spoke
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
um on behalf of dcyf in this Arena here
 
00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
um there was a lot of talk about
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
trainings for parents attorneys and that
 
00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
is something that I have engaged in
 
00:37:34.849 --> 00:37:34.859 align:start position:0%
conversations with others especially in
 
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
regards to the model Court committee and
 
00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
really talking about what training do
 
00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
parent attorneys get and there is
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
agreement by many folks that engage in
 
00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:46.140 align:start position:0%
that committee that we do need more
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
skilled attorneys available for parents
 
00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:50.220 align:start position:0%
so I would agree with director ribson on
 
00:37:52.609 --> 00:37:52.619 align:start position:0%
that recommendation that attorneys that
 
00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
have a specialty in the family court
 
00:37:58.130 --> 00:37:58.140 align:start position:0%
issues in understanding child abuse and
 
00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
neglect laws specifically as well as
 
00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
some understanding in Psychology and
 
00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
children's best interests would be ideal
 
00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:07.740 align:start position:0%
so really
 
00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:10.740 align:start position:0%
finding a way in which we can build up a
 
00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:12.780 align:start position:0%
pool of attorneys that can do this work
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
and then provide extensive training to
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
that group of attorneys so they can best
 
00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:19.380 align:start position:0%
support their clients in those cases
 
00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
it's this wonderful idea progressed to
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
an outline or a proposal yet
 
00:38:29.569 --> 00:38:29.579 align:start position:0%
because it's a wonderful idea not yet no
 
00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
it's coming though right I hope so I
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
haven't been having a lot of discussions
 
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
about it so I do hope so yes thank you
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
and I recognize another aspect that he
 
00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
that director ribson spoke about when he
 
00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
was here before the group that I have
 
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
had experience working with so I did
 
00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
want to share my personal experience
 
00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:47.820 align:start position:0%
working with this model
 
00:38:50.089 --> 00:38:50.099 align:start position:0%
much like New Jersey Massachusetts had a
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
model where some of the public
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
defender's offices would have a social
 
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
worker on staff
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
and that social worker would work to
 
00:38:59.810 --> 00:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
support the parent would work with the
 
00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
agency and really understanding what
 
00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
change they were looking for from the
 
00:39:05.589 --> 00:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
parent and then ensuring whatever
 
00:39:08.089 --> 00:39:08.099 align:start position:0%
providers or treatment recommendations
 
00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:10.140 align:start position:0%
were going to be made were not only a
 
00:39:11.569 --> 00:39:11.579 align:start position:0%
good fit for the parent but we're also
 
00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
going to meet the needs of the agency
 
00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
and so they were a great neutral party
 
00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
in between to help tie the case together
 
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
and in my experience I would see cases
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
Move Along more quickly because parents
 
00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
were willing to take the advice of a
 
00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:26.220 align:start position:0%
neutral social worker and their
 
00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
recommendations rather than an agency
 
00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:29.940 align:start position:0%
where there's that very complex
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
relationship what a great idea how far
 
00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:35.700 align:start position:0%
is this towards a proposal
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
again the same space as the other it's
 
00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
it's in discussions at this point not a
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
proposal um we do understand in those
 
00:39:44.329 --> 00:39:44.339 align:start position:0%
that have discussed these options that
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
it will take funding because it will
 
00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
require specific staff in place
 
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
um and specifically when talking about
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
social workers in these positions we
 
00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
have a shortage of social workers in
 
00:39:55.609 --> 00:39:55.619 align:start position:0%
other places in New Hampshire and so we
 
00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
have to be very mindful of anything that
 
00:39:58.849 --> 00:39:58.859 align:start position:0%
is going to be a proposal to be built
 
00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
out that the staff will be available
 
00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
first so that we are not pulling from
 
00:40:04.849 --> 00:40:04.859 align:start position:0%
our other mental health supports in the
 
00:40:04.859 --> 00:40:06.230 align:start position:0%
our other mental health supports in the
community

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
remind me not to give you the address of
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:14.820 align:start position:0%
we're all looking for helpers I know
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
and another aspect that is is I just
 
00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring it to the attention of
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
this committee that we have heard is
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
becoming more complicated
 
00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
over the recent year or so
 
00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
is that the courts have been abled
 
00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:40.740 align:start position:0%
through the Superior Court are now able
 
00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
to provide Guardians to children that
 
00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
are in dcyf custody
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
and but the Guardians aren't necessarily
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
the placement option and so we've heard
 
00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
a handful of calls about that issue
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
because the Guardians are attempting to
 
00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:56.460 align:start position:0%
work with the agency but in a different
 
00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:57.900 align:start position:0%
role because they are not the person
 
00:40:59.450 --> 00:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
who's been found to be abusive and
 
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
neglectable of the child and then the
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
courts don't know how much access to
 
00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:06.900 align:start position:0%
give these Guardians and so we hear that
 
00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
they are often sent
 
00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
back and forth between different courts
 
00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
the court that gave them the
 
00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:13.740 align:start position:0%
Guardianship and the judge over that
 
00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:17.460 align:start position:0%
ruling and then the dcyf court where
 
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
they are a party to the case but then
 
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
are being told that they're limited
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
while the other judge is telling them
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
they are the guardian and they have
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
right to certain information so this is
 
00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
something that's new in New Hampshire
 
00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
and something just to be aware of that
 
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:33.900 align:start position:0%
there is the option for there to be a
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
guardian but also children to be removed
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
from their biological parents or their
 
00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
yes representative Macbeth I just
 
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
wondered if um the child advocate would
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
clarify for everyone the difference
 
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
between a guardian and a guardian ad
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
litem yes thank you yes so the guardian
 
00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
is it's typically a relative or a family
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
friend who arrives at court and is
 
00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
presenting to the court that the child
 
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
does not have a parent caregiver and is
 
00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
looking to take over the parent
 
00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
caregiver role and so they are in some
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
way linked to the child and they are
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
able through this court guardianship
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
they are able to request records and
 
00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
make decisions on behalf of the children
 
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
typically when we think of guardian we
 
00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
would think of somebody who goes to the
 
00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
court gets the guardianship of the child
 
00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
and the child resides in their home and
 
00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:33.060 align:start position:0%
so it's very similar the difference now
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
is that they're allowed to be Guardian
 
00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
without the child
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
living in their home and on those cases
 
00:42:41.569 --> 00:42:41.579 align:start position:0%
there is still a guardian at Litem who
 
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
is assigned to meet with a child family
 
00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
system and bring forth to the court what
 
00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:51.020 align:start position:0%
is in the best interest of that child
 
00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:53.960 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
thank you in the in the example that you
 
00:42:59.150 --> 00:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
just gave us
 
00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:00.170 align:start position:0%
just gave us
um

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
with two different judges and two
 
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:06.180 align:start position:0%
different courts are each of those
 
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
judges in the family court
 
00:43:11.569 --> 00:43:11.579 align:start position:0%
yes but they could be different areas
 
00:43:14.809 --> 00:43:14.819 align:start position:0%
because the Guardian could be going to
 
00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
one court and the dcyf is going to
 
00:43:19.609 --> 00:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
another court because of where the
 
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
parent is residing at the time that
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
they're going into court sometimes they
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
can be different judges in the same
 
00:43:24.839 --> 00:43:26.569 align:start position:0%
can be different judges in the same
court

00:43:26.569 --> 00:43:26.579 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:29.220 align:start position:0%
follow-up if I could just follow up so
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
that this is
 
00:43:32.809 --> 00:43:32.819 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:43:35.569 --> 00:43:35.579 align:start position:0%
an example of
 
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
um an obvious
 
00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:38.510 align:start position:0%
um an obvious
um

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
area to consider for recommendations
 
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
about what the family court
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
might consider doing in order to
 
00:43:52.609 --> 00:43:52.619 align:start position:0%
better meet the needs of the citizens of
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
the state and that would be coordination
 
00:43:59.930 --> 00:43:59.940 align:start position:0%
in that case yes yes I mean here similar
 
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
in some of the parenting or divorce
 
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
cases where they may become dcyf
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
involved while they already have this
 
00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
other case and process and then a family
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
is sent to one court or judge to deal
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
with their dcyf case and another court
 
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
or judge to manage the parenting plan
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
and divorce parenting decisions and so I
 
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
do believe that taking a look at that
 
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
and if there is a way to incorporate if
 
00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
there is already a parent in case or
 
00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:37.079 align:start position:0%
divorce case open and it is a similar
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
judge to hear the dcyf case it would
 
00:44:41.569 --> 00:44:41.579 align:start position:0%
reduce the
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
missing information going back and forth
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
between the courts and reduce the amount
 
00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
of times that the families have to go to
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
courts because they could have court in
 
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
the same week for two different types of
 
00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:55.380 align:start position:0%
hearings if I could follow you may thank
 
00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
you so
 
00:45:00.589 --> 00:45:00.599 align:start position:0%
would there be any benefit
 
00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
to the family court having a policy
 
00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:06.890 align:start position:0%
to the family court having a policy
of

00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:45:11.569 --> 00:45:11.579 align:start position:0%
uh one family one judge
 
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
yes I do believe that would benefit the
 
00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
family as well as the children
 
00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.470 align:start position:0%
family as well as the children
specifically

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
um really having a good understanding
 
00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
especially when we're talking about
 
00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect being looked at in the
 
00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:25.980 align:start position:0%
courts if that is not understood by a
 
00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
court that is putting into place
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
parenting plans we worry about putting
 
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
children in at-risk situations because
 
00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
that Court does not hold the same
 
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
information that the other court holds
 
00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:37.460 align:start position:0%
around the abuse and neglect
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
procedural things to the clerks this
 
00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:42.660 align:start position:0%
could be something to be noted as a
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
point it already is thank you if I may
 
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
have been having having worked as an
 
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
attorney in both of these Arenas I was a
 
00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:50.940 align:start position:0%
dcyf prosecutor and I also worked in the
 
00:45:52.609 --> 00:45:52.619 align:start position:0%
private family law sector for quite a
 
00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:53.700 align:start position:0%
long time
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
they have that policy but essentially
 
00:45:59.150 --> 00:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
family court is two completely separate
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
courts the dcyf realm and then the
 
00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
parenting realm so each of those
 
00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
different Realms do have that policy I
 
00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
believe Mr Savoy just testified as well
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
in a divorce case you typically are
 
00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
assigned one judge the same judge stays
 
00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:14.940 align:start position:0%
with you through your whole parenting
 
00:46:17.329 --> 00:46:17.339 align:start position:0%
divorce case same thing happens in dcyf
 
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
cases it is the one judge who is
 
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
handling a dcyf case again for that
 
00:46:25.069 --> 00:46:25.079 align:start position:0%
continuity but even though they're both
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
under the guise of the family court they
 
00:46:29.809 --> 00:46:29.819 align:start position:0%
are separate courts so you can have one
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
family that has a one judge parenting
 
00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:35.460 align:start position:0%
case one judge dcyf case and it is very
 
00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:36.770 align:start position:0%
case one judge dcyf case and it is very
confusing

00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
um uh dcyf judge will typically
 
00:46:43.609 --> 00:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
um maybe enter a temporary parenting
 
00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
order in order to close a dcyf case but
 
00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:47.460 align:start position:0%
then yes the whole thing goes back to
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
some other judge thank you very much for
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
that if I could you are telling us the
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
way things are
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
what we are interested in is the way
 
00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:04.740 align:start position:0%
things should be
 
00:47:07.609 --> 00:47:07.619 align:start position:0%
um which isn't necessarily it might be
 
00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
but isn't necessarily the way things are
 
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
so you've helped to clarify the way
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
things are
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the way things end up
 
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
being is the best possible way in the
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
interests of all the citizens of the
 
00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
states so and we have noted this now on
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
what will be a list of discussion topics
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
when we get the various slices of cases
 
00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:37.140 align:start position:0%
from various people and put them in
 
00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
their appropriate folders and then open
 
00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:41.460 align:start position:0%
the folders one at a time this will be
 
00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
one we will open we will invite people
 
00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
from both aspects of family court to be
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
here and a couple of other folks and
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
we'll just chew into it to see if we
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
want to make recommendations whether to
 
00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
keep what we have or make a change and
 
00:47:57.650 --> 00:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
just to throw another Wrinkle In if
 
00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:00.020 align:start position:0%
there is a domestic violence situation
 
00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:02.460 align:start position:0%
layered over on top that is potentially
 
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
another judge in court Who's involved
 
00:48:10.609 --> 00:48:10.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:14.089 --> 00:48:14.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:17.329 --> 00:48:17.339 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth thank you and
 
00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:19.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
um so this is it's my understanding
 
00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:23.220 align:start position:0%
right now that the judges that would
 
00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
have these individual cases in the silos
 
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
the protocols don't allow them to reach
 
00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:29.700 align:start position:0%
out and talk to each other correct so it
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
would have to take the party that may
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
not have an attorney to move to join
 
00:48:35.809 --> 00:48:35.819 align:start position:0%
those cases so the protocol or the
 
00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:37.740 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be looking at that
 
00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
the judges themselves through whatever
 
00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
kind of um you know computerizing
 
00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
looking up families and trying to make
 
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
connections they themselves would be
 
00:48:49.069 --> 00:48:49.079 align:start position:0%
able to connect and try to work out who
 
00:48:50.809 --> 00:48:50.819 align:start position:0%
should be handling what part of the case
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
or the entire case is that kind of a
 
00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:54.780 align:start position:0%
recommendation we're looking for or is
 
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
that something that we need to ask the
 
00:48:58.550 --> 00:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
judicial I would ask the judicial for my
 
00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
recollection the judges can certainly
 
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
see all of the cases in the court system
 
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
I don't believe they're prohibited from
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
communicating but I don't know how
 
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
regularly happens I would defer to the
 
00:49:14.569 --> 00:49:14.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
and the other question to know if you
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
could proceed
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative long has a question
 
00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:23.750 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
you stated that uh you're you you are
 
00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
involved in judge training when it comes
 
00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
to the best interests of the child
 
00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
yes okay and in those conversations in
 
00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
those conversations is there a topic on
 
00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
gender neutral
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh care for the child
 
00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:46.140 align:start position:0%
the ability for
 
00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:48.900 align:start position:0%
um you know a gender neutral care for
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
the child
 
00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:52.740 align:start position:0%
so that is a great question no there is
 
00:49:54.829 --> 00:49:54.839 align:start position:0%
not right now that is not something that
 
00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:56.460 align:start position:0%
we incorporate into the trainings that
 
00:49:59.390 --> 00:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
we have we are typically one small
 
00:50:01.849 --> 00:50:01.859 align:start position:0%
aspect of larger trainings that they
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
interact with so given the
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
amount of time that we have to gather
 
00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
all the judges together and have an
 
00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to train we don't get to a
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
breadth of topics that cover all of best
 
00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:15.300 align:start position:0%
interests of children although ideally
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
that that would be wonderful so no
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
that's not currently in the training
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
that we provide
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
but it is something that I believe is
 
00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:24.660 align:start position:0%
very important for the judges to be well
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
aware of because we are seeing a lot of
 
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
needs for that with our children today
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
and if I may just confirm what I thought
 
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
I heard also is
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
when you get calls uh with respect to
 
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
divorces uh you're you're seeing a
 
00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
balance with men and women uh with
 
00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:46.740 align:start position:0%
respect to custody we get calls from
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
both parents um and we do not have I'm
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
just in trying to look at some of them
 
00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
quickly we do not have a larger amount
 
00:50:58.010 --> 00:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
of fathers calling as we do mothers it's
 
00:51:00.829 --> 00:51:00.839 align:start position:0%
it's quite equal and there is custody
 
00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
going in both ways on those thank you
 
00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:05.030 align:start position:0%
going in both ways on those thank you
yes

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:07.740 align:start position:0%
thank you um I will I'm trying to pull
 
00:51:10.849 --> 00:51:10.859 align:start position:0%
up the parental responsibility RSA which
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
guides charges there's about 13
 
00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
enumerated ones and our statutes are due
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
instruct judges to be gender neutral
 
00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:19.980 align:start position:0%
that there's no preference to give no
 
00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:21.900 align:start position:0%
preference to either
 
00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
um sex that doesn't mean that the judges
 
00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't look at who's had the
 
00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
traditional responsibility of that or
 
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
who's able to look at that going forward
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
but and I will I will provide those I
 
00:51:32.809 --> 00:51:32.819 align:start position:0%
think those are important and I will
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
send those out afterwards if I can't
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
pull them up now but so our statutes do
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
they say that that doesn't mean that you
 
00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:39.180 align:start position:0%
know their protocols don't say that all
 
00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
I don't have much more to share
 
00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:48.900 align:start position:0%
um again our jurisdiction is quite
 
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
limited when taking a look at the courts
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
um so we did want to come here today and
 
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
be able to present what we do have for
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
you but also to make sure we could
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
clarify that aspect because there is a
 
00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:00.839 align:start position:0%
misconception that we have the ability
 
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
to intervene in court cases that are
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
divorce parenting cases only that do not
 
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
have a dcyf component to them
 
00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:52:16.849 --> 00:52:16.859 align:start position:0%
anything else yes please thank you madam
 
00:52:20.089 --> 00:52:20.099 align:start position:0%
chair any uh question for you Ms Sanchez
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh specifically you spoke of this I call
 
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
it alleged model Court committee and
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
that you both or maybe just one of you
 
00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:29.809 align:start position:0%
that you both or maybe just one of you
attend

00:52:29.809 --> 00:52:29.819 align:start position:0%
attend
 
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
would that be correct one or both
 
00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
um Melissa is new to the staff so she
 
00:52:36.349 --> 00:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
will be attending in the near future but
 
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
up until this point I have attended or
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
other others within the office so the
 
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
previous associate child advocate would
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
also attend prior okay one follow-up
 
00:52:49.069 --> 00:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
Madam chair uh then specific to your
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
statement of what the office of child
 
00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:53.700 align:start position:0%
advocate does and a lot of it being that
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
you don't have oversight over the
 
00:52:57.290 --> 00:52:57.300 align:start position:0%
various components that when folks come
 
00:52:59.329 --> 00:52:59.339 align:start position:0%
to you then what is it that you bring to
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
the table
 
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
that we can utilize in changing the
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
parameters of operation
 
00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
and we can get it done while we're young
 
00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:10.380 align:start position:0%
because it's a serious matters of
 
00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
families being affected today
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
is if there's new rules or regulation
 
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
not regulations rules of performance in
 
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
the court do we need a consolidation as
 
00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
referred to to have a one one family one
 
00:53:24.049 --> 00:53:24.059 align:start position:0%
Court one judge
 
00:53:24.059 --> 00:53:25.670 align:start position:0%
Court one judge
or

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
what have you learned if anything
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
from the model Court committee
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
from the model Court committee uh we we
 
00:53:35.809 --> 00:53:35.819 align:start position:0%
talk often in the role of my office on
 
00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:38.220 align:start position:0%
that medical model Court committee is to
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
ensure that when we're talking about
 
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
court improvements we're keeping the
 
00:53:43.549 --> 00:53:43.559 align:start position:0%
children at the focus and at the center
 
00:53:44.809 --> 00:53:44.819 align:start position:0%
of that when we're talking about
 
00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
parenting and any form and so my role is
 
00:53:51.049 --> 00:53:51.059 align:start position:0%
really to ensure that any new protocols
 
00:53:52.609 --> 00:53:52.619 align:start position:0%
or procedures they may be looking at
 
00:53:55.010 --> 00:53:55.020 align:start position:0%
have the children's best interest in
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
mind in in them we've also learned that
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's quite important to have children
 
00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
involved in court proceedings whenever
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
possible so that's another aspect that
 
00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
is not happening everywhere all the time
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
right now but is something that is
 
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
encouraged to happen is to have the
 
00:54:14.809 --> 00:54:14.819 align:start position:0%
children be able to meet with judges and
 
00:54:17.089 --> 00:54:17.099 align:start position:0%
understand what is happening what we
 
00:54:18.829 --> 00:54:18.839 align:start position:0%
know is that children oftentimes are
 
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
left out of that process but they know
 
00:54:22.609 --> 00:54:22.619 align:start position:0%
something is happening they know there
 
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
is some kind of Court proceeding or
 
00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
there is some back and forth about what
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
their future holds and they need to have
 
00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:30.180 align:start position:0%
more of a voice at that table
 
00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:33.660 align:start position:0%
and Casas and jals are great and have
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to do that but there are
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
also times where it is better to be
 
00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
heard from the child themselves and not
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
rely on an adult because we do
 
00:54:44.809 --> 00:54:44.819 align:start position:0%
understand that although they have a
 
00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:46.740 align:start position:0%
role to fulfill which is the best
 
00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
interest of children
 
00:54:50.329 --> 00:54:50.339 align:start position:0%
it is subjective because it is somebody
 
00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
else reviewing what is in the best
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
interest of that child is not the child
 
00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:56.940 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of themselves so that
 
00:54:59.450 --> 00:54:59.460 align:start position:0%
has been one topic of discussion in that
 
00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:01.130 align:start position:0%
has been one topic of discussion in that
Arena

00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
Arena
 
00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:02.940 align:start position:0%
um as well as what I had talked about
 
00:55:04.790 --> 00:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
the the difficulties of these different
 
00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:07.140 align:start position:0%
courts and interacting and understanding
 
00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:09.300 align:start position:0%
that it adds a lot of complexities to
 
00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
the family system and to ensuring that
 
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
all the information is getting to the
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
judges when parents are going to
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
different courts is all the information
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
carrying over accurately one final
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh relative to what the the previous uh
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
contributor Mr Savoy stated and that was
 
00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
the and I say so-called because you just
 
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
changed the debating platform is who do
 
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
we hear from not the parents but from
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
the kids
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
and to achieve that the best interest of
 
00:55:41.329 --> 00:55:41.339 align:start position:0%
the children do we need that to take
 
00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:43.980 align:start position:0%
place in Rules of Evidence or in rules
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
of the Court
 
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:48.839 align:start position:0%
so it needs to incorporate it does of
 
00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
course need to have the component of the
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
parent piece so in in that committee my
 
00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:54.900 align:start position:0%
role specifically is a focus on the
 
00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:56.220 align:start position:0%
children but there are others that come
 
00:55:58.849 --> 00:55:58.859 align:start position:0%
to the table with a background in
 
00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:01.140 align:start position:0%
um prosecutors for parents
 
00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
um and as well as parents attorneys
 
00:56:04.609 --> 00:56:04.619 align:start position:0%
coming to the table and it's really
 
00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:06.420 align:start position:0%
important to have all aspects of that
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
coming together because my goal does
 
00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:10.140 align:start position:0%
need to be focused on ensuring that
 
00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
children's best interests is kept in
 
00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:14.339 align:start position:0%
that regard but of course we have
 
00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:15.900 align:start position:0%
parents rights that are important that
 
00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
we need to respect in this state so
 
00:56:19.130 --> 00:56:19.140 align:start position:0%
there's another entity that is at the
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
table to speak on that regard and that's
 
00:56:23.089 --> 00:56:23.099 align:start position:0%
why we need a well-rounded Committee of
 
00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:25.859 align:start position:0%
of folks that all engage in this work at
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
different levels to come together and
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
that that is what's happening right now
 
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
with that group one last one
 
00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:36.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for your patience uh Trini
 
00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
martial then uh basically thank you for
 
00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
taking the job by the way
 
00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
you're on the front lines on this is
 
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
what would do you have a recommendation
 
00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
at this early point on what a
 
00:56:48.849 --> 00:56:48.859 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence or rules of Court
 
00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
change or recommendation from you could
 
00:56:54.109 --> 00:56:54.119 align:start position:0%
help us as we change the parameters of
 
00:56:54.119 --> 00:56:55.309 align:start position:0%
help us as we change the parameters of
operation

00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
operation
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
going forward I think there are a lot of
 
00:57:00.049 --> 00:57:00.059 align:start position:0%
entities that can speak to that
 
00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:01.740 align:start position:0%
um their Rules of Evidence do not apply
 
00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
in the Family Division
 
00:57:04.609 --> 00:57:04.619 align:start position:0%
um the protocols that have been
 
00:57:06.349 --> 00:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
discussed that are being discussed by
 
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
the model court is I think where most of
 
00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
this would be found although as
 
00:57:13.970 --> 00:57:13.980 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth stated uh the
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
rsas around both the Family Division
 
00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
private parenting cases and 169c the RSA
 
00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:22.380 align:start position:0%
relating to abuse and neglect cases
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
first and foremost is best interest of
 
00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:27.980 align:start position:0%
the children in both of those statutes
 
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
as far as taking evidence from children
 
00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:34.380 align:start position:0%
I I think probably the judicial system
 
00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:36.180 align:start position:0%
would want to address that within their
 
00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
protocols I know some courts do speak to
 
00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:42.780 align:start position:0%
children in Chambers take letters it's
 
00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:43.730 align:start position:0%
children in Chambers take letters it's
really

00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:43.740 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
depends on the judge so again I think
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
that's something the model Court
 
00:57:49.849 --> 00:57:49.859 align:start position:0%
discusses as far as consistency amongst
 
00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
all the courts how those Protocols are
 
00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
written and then I know attorney Baker
 
00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
was here last week I used to work for
 
00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
her and
 
00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:00.119 align:start position:0%
um how the new judges are trained to
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
make sure it's consistent because I
 
00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
think that is a trend we also see is
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
just simply
 
00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
because it's discretion of a judge is
 
00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
going to depend on your judge so it does
 
00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
feel like a lack of consistency I think
 
00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
for people across the state thank you
 
00:58:19.549 --> 00:58:19.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh do you have
 
00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
data on uh judges that speak with
 
00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:29.150 align:start position:0%
data on uh judges that speak with
children

00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:58:31.849 --> 00:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
or receive letters you don't have that
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
we do not know
 
00:58:37.789 --> 00:58:37.799 align:start position:0%
um but as as Melissa explained
 
00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
we hear from certain course that this is
 
00:58:43.849 --> 00:58:43.859 align:start position:0%
what they do so we don't have the exact
 
00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:45.540 align:start position:0%
judges it will just be this court
 
00:58:47.329 --> 00:58:47.339 align:start position:0%
operates in this way and we think that
 
00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:50.940 align:start position:0%
best practice and so how do we then
 
00:58:52.370 --> 00:58:52.380 align:start position:0%
spread that that's more discussed in
 
00:58:53.809 --> 00:58:53.819 align:start position:0%
that model the model committee meeting
 
00:58:56.329 --> 00:58:56.339 align:start position:0%
in that way thank you representative
 
00:58:56.339 --> 00:58:58.670 align:start position:0%
in that way thank you representative
katab

00:58:58.670 --> 00:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
katab
 
00:59:00.349 --> 00:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:01.799 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:04.140 align:start position:0%
are you aware could you just give an
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
example of any of the courts that are
 
00:59:08.089 --> 00:59:08.099 align:start position:0%
allowing the children to speak just I
 
00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:09.660 align:start position:0%
think it would be nice to know an
 
00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
example of it and maybe be able to get
 
00:59:13.609 --> 00:59:13.619 align:start position:0%
some information you know us as a
 
00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:15.780 align:start position:0%
committee to see how it's working for
 
00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:16.789 align:start position:0%
committee to see how it's working for
them

00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
um you know how they've implemented to
 
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:22.380 align:start position:0%
know to make it you know not to be at
 
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
the discretion of the judge and not and
 
00:59:25.849 --> 00:59:25.859 align:start position:0%
to be more uniform and consistent can
 
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
you just give us any example that you're
 
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
aware of any court that you know that
 
00:59:30.589 --> 00:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
may currently be doing that just so we
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
may be able to you know gather some
 
00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:34.140 align:start position:0%
information from them on how they're
 
00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:35.460 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
00:59:37.789 --> 00:59:37.799 align:start position:0%
I don't have any specifics of the exact
 
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
courts that are doing it I would send
 
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
that question back to the judicial
 
00:59:43.789 --> 00:59:43.799 align:start position:0%
committee I believe that they would have
 
00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
a better understanding of it
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
um often I lead leave the specifics of
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
what court is doing what
 
00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
um to judge Ashley and rather focus on
 
00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:55.980 align:start position:0%
with her whether it's effective or is
 
01:00:00.289 --> 01:00:00.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
you may continue
 
01:00:04.450 --> 01:00:04.460 align:start position:0%
that is all that I have you may finish
 
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming wonderful thank you
 
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair could I just ask
 
01:00:14.890 --> 01:00:14.900 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth to give us the
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
RSA to which
 
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
she referred that I think would
 
01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:22.740 align:start position:0%
I gather would answer a number of the
 
01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:25.140 align:start position:0%
questions that were raised today yes
 
01:00:27.289 --> 01:00:27.299 align:start position:0%
Madam Vice chair you may ask her that
 
01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:29.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you so I did find it so it's um
 
01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.730 align:start position:0%
thank you so I did find it so it's um
RSA

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:33.740 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
461a6 the determining of parental rights
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
and responsibility best interest so then
 
01:00:42.829 --> 01:00:42.839 align:start position:0%
um Roman number one lists the 13 or
 
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:45.780 align:start position:0%
whatever criteria and then when it gets
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
down to Roman number three this is the
 
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
section that I'd refer to it's just a
 
01:00:54.049 --> 01:00:54.059 align:start position:0%
sentence long if I may read it it says
 
01:00:55.609 --> 01:00:55.619 align:start position:0%
in determining parental rights and
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
responsibilities under this section
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
including residential responsibility the
 
01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
court shall not apply a preference for
 
01:01:03.289 --> 01:01:03.299 align:start position:0%
one parent over the other because of the
 
01:01:05.690 --> 01:01:05.700 align:start position:0%
sex of the child sex of the parent or
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
the financial resources of a parent
 
01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
in what subsection is that that is Roman
 
01:01:15.049 --> 01:01:15.059 align:start position:0%
numeral three three of 461 A6 yes okay
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
good thank you
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:26.329 --> 01:01:26.339 align:start position:0%
we have scheduled we have scheduled for
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
next week in terms of people coming
 
01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:30.780 align:start position:0%
before us at 9 30 the New Hampshire Bar
 
01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:33.299 align:start position:0%
Association and at 10 15 the New
 
01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:35.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance people I
 
01:01:37.609 --> 01:01:37.619 align:start position:0%
think if I'm correct
 
01:01:42.109 --> 01:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
I am thank you representative McMahon
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
um just I want to ask uh Macbeth on that
 
01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:48.900 align:start position:0%
on the section section three if you
 
01:01:51.069 --> 01:01:51.079 align:start position:0%
could just read that one more time
 
01:01:54.289 --> 01:01:54.299 align:start position:0%
two-way Claire wanted to ask a
 
01:01:56.809 --> 01:01:56.819 align:start position:0%
clarification on that so thank you just
 
01:01:58.609 --> 01:01:58.619 align:start position:0%
let me you want me to read that Roman
 
01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
numeral three yeah okay
 
01:02:00.359 --> 01:02:02.890 align:start position:0%
numeral three yeah okay
yes

01:02:02.890 --> 01:02:02.900 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
in determining the rights and
 
01:02:07.789 --> 01:02:07.799 align:start position:0%
responsibility under this section so I
 
01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
remember I said section number one lists
 
01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
those 13 criterias
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
um that the court or considerations so
 
01:02:15.049 --> 01:02:15.059 align:start position:0%
in determining the parental rights and
 
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
responsibility under this section
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
including residential responsibility the
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
court shall not apply a preference for
 
01:02:23.809 --> 01:02:23.819 align:start position:0%
one parent over the other because of the
 
01:02:26.089 --> 01:02:26.099 align:start position:0%
sex of the child the sex of the parent
 
01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
or the financial resources of a parent
 
01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:31.980 align:start position:0%
okay and so you know what I wanted to
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
ask your guidance on this is
 
01:02:37.789 --> 01:02:37.799 align:start position:0%
does that come under the quote judge's
 
01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
discretion on whether to carry out that
 
01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
that specific black leaded law
 
01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:46.370 align:start position:0%
that specific black leaded law
determination

01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
so I could give you my interpretation of
 
01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
it um but I think it'd be better if we
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
talk directly to
 
01:02:56.329 --> 01:02:56.339 align:start position:0%
um you know the court but the statute
 
01:02:57.770 --> 01:02:57.780 align:start position:0%
which we wrote this committee your
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
committee wrote it says
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
um the court shall not apply a
 
01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
preference for one parent over the other
 
01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
based on the sex of the child the sex of
 
01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
the parents so to me that is pretty a
 
01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
directive that they shall not do that so
 
01:03:14.809 --> 01:03:14.819 align:start position:0%
usually that that that that that would
 
01:03:17.089 --> 01:03:17.099 align:start position:0%
eliminate the discretion again but when
 
01:03:19.490 --> 01:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
you go back up to those 13
 
01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:20.210 align:start position:0%
you go back up to those 13
um

01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:20.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:21.660 align:start position:0%
criteria and I'm not going to read them
 
01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
all but it's you know the relationship
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
that each parent has with a child then B
 
01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:27.180 align:start position:0%
is the ability to the parent to ensure
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
the child receives clothing Medical Care
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
shelter the developmental needs of the
 
01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
child the quality of the adjustment to
 
01:03:34.609 --> 01:03:34.619 align:start position:0%
the school so you've got you know like
 
01:03:38.569 --> 01:03:38.579 align:start position:0%
13 or 10 of those things that that are
 
01:03:41.089 --> 01:03:41.099 align:start position:0%
subjective but as far as when the court
 
01:03:43.609 --> 01:03:43.619 align:start position:0%
applies you know
 
01:03:46.849 --> 01:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
just solidly I mean says it shall not
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
based on sex so but I think we should
 
01:03:51.049 --> 01:03:51.059 align:start position:0%
talk to them
 
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:00.049 --> 01:04:00.059 align:start position:0%
not um the chair recognizes Greg
 
01:04:00.059 --> 01:04:03.170 align:start position:0%
not um the chair recognizes Greg
Lombardo

01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:05.210 --> 01:04:05.220 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr Lombardo thank you for
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
yeah press press the
 
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
there you go all right
 
01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
again uh I am Greg Lombardo I'm a
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
divorced father with two little kids
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
ages three and four my daughter's almost
 
01:04:23.930 --> 01:04:23.940 align:start position:0%
five I've had 50 50 equal shared
 
01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:25.140 align:start position:0%
parenting since the beginning of my
 
01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:26.150 align:start position:0%
parenting since the beginning of my
divorce

01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
divorce
 
01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:29.700 align:start position:0%
parenting plan established with a 223
 
01:04:32.089 --> 01:04:32.099 align:start position:0%
equals shared parenting plan
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
however I am forced to pay full
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
guideline child support
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
I Supply the exact same for my children
 
01:04:41.450 --> 01:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
as the mother does except health and
 
01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
dental insurance which is compensated
 
01:04:47.569 --> 01:04:47.579 align:start position:0%
for in the child support calculations so
 
01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
right now I do kind of pay for half of
 
01:04:49.799 --> 01:04:52.130 align:start position:0%
right now I do kind of pay for half of
everything

01:04:52.130 --> 01:04:52.140 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:53.210 align:start position:0%
everything
um

01:04:53.210 --> 01:04:53.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:55.140 align:start position:0%
the judge totally disregarded that I
 
01:04:57.650 --> 01:04:57.660 align:start position:0%
have the exact equal burden of child
 
01:04:59.329 --> 01:04:59.339 align:start position:0%
rearing as the mother does
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
or the fact that she supplies nothing
 
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
for the children when they are with me
 
01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
50 of the time
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
the judge stating although parenting
 
01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:09.180 align:start position:0%
schedule is a shared one it does not
 
01:05:11.089 --> 01:05:11.099 align:start position:0%
reduce wife's fixed costs of child
 
01:05:11.099 --> 01:05:13.190 align:start position:0%
reduce wife's fixed costs of child
rearing

01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
rearing
 
01:05:17.690 --> 01:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
the most recent uniform support order
 
01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
has my income at one thousand one 168
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
dollars more than her income my child
 
01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:26.540 align:start position:0%
support payment is
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
1144 dollars the net result has her
 
01:05:32.089 --> 01:05:32.099 align:start position:0%
having one thousand one hundred twenty
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
dollars per month more income than me
 
01:05:38.329 --> 01:05:38.339 align:start position:0%
the court also states that she needs
 
01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
guideline child support to be able to
 
01:05:42.049 --> 01:05:42.059 align:start position:0%
afford to provide the children with the
 
01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:43.980 align:start position:0%
same or similar lifestyle as the husband
 
01:05:45.770 --> 01:05:45.780 align:start position:0%
can provide
 
01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
the court makes no notion or recognition
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
that inherently they have swapped our
 
01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
income almost completely
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
now I cannot afford to supply the
 
01:05:55.609 --> 01:05:55.619 align:start position:0%
children with the same or similar
 
01:05:58.730 --> 01:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
lifestyle as the mother can provide
 
01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:01.799 align:start position:0%
the court also failed to add the child
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
support amount into her income when
 
01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:05.180 align:start position:0%
attempting to justify its decision
 
01:06:07.609 --> 01:06:07.619 align:start position:0%
stating the net result of the above
 
01:06:10.130 --> 01:06:10.140 align:start position:0%
modification is that the husband will
 
01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
pay child support of
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
1144 and 433 dollars a month for daycare
 
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
for a total monthly payment of 1576.
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
after paying support in daycare he will
 
01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
now have three thousand six hundred
 
01:06:28.849 --> 01:06:28.859 align:start position:0%
twenty in monthly
 
01:06:31.789 --> 01:06:31.799 align:start position:0%
income to pay his and
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
his and the children's expenses
 
01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
wife will paid daycare of 433 a month
 
01:06:41.049 --> 01:06:41.059 align:start position:0%
and thereafter will now have
 
01:06:44.329 --> 01:06:44.339 align:start position:0%
3595 in monthly income to pay her and
 
01:06:45.890 --> 01:06:45.900 align:start position:0%
the children's expenses
 
01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
the equity of this result is obvious is
 
01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
what it says
 
01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:52.430 align:start position:0%
what it says
um

01:06:52.430 --> 01:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
as you can see they never added what I
 
01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
pay her back into her income so now she
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
does have more than me
 
01:06:59.690 --> 01:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
using the Child Support guideline
 
01:07:02.089 --> 01:07:02.099 align:start position:0%
worksheet that was used to figure my
 
01:07:02.099 --> 01:07:02.870 align:start position:0%
worksheet that was used to figure my
payment

01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
payment
 
01:07:04.609 --> 01:07:04.619 align:start position:0%
provides information that could be
 
01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
easily used to make it better and more
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
justifiable child support payment
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
especially when having 50 50 equal
 
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
shared parenting
 
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
the worksheet breaks down our incomes
 
01:07:17.329 --> 01:07:17.339 align:start position:0%
and expenses and creates both of us a
 
01:07:19.849 --> 01:07:19.859 align:start position:0%
parental support obligation amount my
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
obligation is that 1144 and hers
 
01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:26.819 align:start position:0%
obligation is at 785
 
01:07:30.109 --> 01:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
and some change if you were to use a net
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
the difference way of figuring child
 
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
support would put me at a payment of 359
 
01:07:40.849 --> 01:07:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
the net result would have me making
 
01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:46.140 align:start position:0%
486 dollars per month more than her
 
01:07:50.890 --> 01:07:50.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:53.930 --> 01:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
4873 per month in her income after
 
01:07:57.170 --> 01:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
receiving support at 4 387.
 
01:07:59.690 --> 01:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
I believe that this income is a lot more
 
01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:00.770 align:start position:0%
I believe that this income is a lot more
fair

01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
fair
 
01:08:02.569 --> 01:08:02.579 align:start position:0%
leaving the higher earning parents still
 
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
earning slightly higher while still
 
01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
paying a fair amount in child support
 
01:08:07.849 --> 01:08:07.859 align:start position:0%
per month
 
01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
and one thing that has been also brought
 
01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:13.740 align:start position:0%
to my attention is how
 
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
um having these heavy child support
 
01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
payments when you have a child's
 
01:08:19.789 --> 01:08:19.799 align:start position:0%
children even close to 50 of the time
 
01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
creates an environment where neither
 
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
parent wants to better themselves due to
 
01:08:25.849 --> 01:08:25.859 align:start position:0%
not wanting to possibly pay more in
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
child support or receive Less in support
 
01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
trapping families like mine into
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
essentially staying neutral when we
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
should be growing and bettering
 
01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
ourselves for the benefit of our
 
01:08:36.239 --> 01:08:37.309 align:start position:0%
ourselves for the benefit of our
children

01:08:37.309 --> 01:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
having a sliding scale parenting
 
01:08:42.169 --> 01:08:42.179 align:start position:0%
time versus support payment or net the
 
01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
difference model to create the child
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
support payment would also both
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
would allow both parents to better
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
themselves without being penalized by
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
doing so
 
01:08:59.090 --> 01:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you thank
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um thank you Mr Lombardo
 
01:09:06.530 --> 01:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm wondering specifically how
 
01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:07.370 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm wondering specifically how
um

01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:09.900 align:start position:0%
the court has to do this when you
 
01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
disagree with the child support payments
 
01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
what does the appeal process look like
 
01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
can you tell me a little bit more about
 
01:09:18.289 --> 01:09:18.299 align:start position:0%
that and have you seen any issues with
 
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
that appeal process
 
01:09:22.669 --> 01:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
um I've after every I've
 
01:09:24.169 --> 01:09:24.179 align:start position:0%
it's been going on for three years I've
 
01:09:25.490 --> 01:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
been to the courts every chance I get
 
01:09:26.749 --> 01:09:26.759 align:start position:0%
trying to fight this since it was
 
01:09:28.610 --> 01:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
established early on
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
and no matter what I kind of say in my
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
appeal it just goes back to that like
 
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
that she still has the burden of child
 
01:09:37.849 --> 01:09:37.859 align:start position:0%
rearing and I believe it's actually
 
01:09:39.169 --> 01:09:39.179 align:start position:0%
states to
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
um that even having your child 50 of the
 
01:09:43.809 --> 01:09:43.819 align:start position:0%
time does not
 
01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
justify a deviation from child support
 
01:09:48.289 --> 01:09:48.299 align:start position:0%
payments or full guideline child support
 
01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
payments it's basically up to the judge
 
01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:51.110 align:start position:0%
payments it's basically up to the judge
to

01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:09:54.530 --> 01:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
decide if if you qualify which my judge
 
01:10:00.169 --> 01:10:00.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
01:10:05.689 --> 01:10:05.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
I guess I'd like to ask the chair of
 
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
children and family it's my
 
01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
understanding that it is the legislature
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
that in fact has worked very diligently
 
01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
over the years to try to
 
01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:25.370 align:start position:0%
over the years to try to
um

01:10:25.370 --> 01:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
come up with the right formula
 
01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
for uh child support So if it's not
 
01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:35.950 align:start position:0%
for uh child support So if it's not
working

01:10:35.950 --> 01:10:35.960 align:start position:0%
working
 
01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
would that not be a problem for the
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
legislature rather than the judicial
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
branch we would first have to stipulate
 
01:10:47.649 --> 01:10:47.659 align:start position:0%
that it is the legislature's
 
01:10:52.189 --> 01:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility and I have the book here
 
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
and I'll go looking through it and if it
 
01:10:58.189 --> 01:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
is not the legislature's responsibility
 
01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
we go in One Direction here as a special
 
01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
committee but if we discover it is our
 
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility then we can discuss that
 
01:11:08.169 --> 01:11:08.179 align:start position:0%
for possible legislation
 
01:11:10.490 --> 01:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm wondering if you
 
01:11:16.669 --> 01:11:16.679 align:start position:0%
would be willing if you redacted your
 
01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
names and the bank account numbers to
 
01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
provide a copy of your financial
 
01:11:21.530 --> 01:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
affidavit and the child support
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
worksheet because it's my understanding
 
01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
that they're things like housing
 
01:11:28.370 --> 01:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
expenses and other debts that are maybe
 
01:11:30.649 --> 01:11:30.659 align:start position:0%
considered and also the existence of
 
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
other adults living in the household
 
01:11:34.010 --> 01:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
that are contributing that do factor
 
01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
into your child support calculations so
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful when we were
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
analyzing this what's what's Equitable
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
um if we could see really you know what
 
01:11:45.050 --> 01:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
other factors might have gone into the
 
01:11:47.149 --> 01:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
child support calculation yes I I have
 
01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
some of them with me today I was
 
01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
planning to hand in but I can also get
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
more what you're looking for
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful
 
01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.450 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful
um

01:11:56.450 --> 01:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:59.689 --> 01:11:59.699 align:start position:0%
it gives us all the more strength in
 
01:11:59.699 --> 01:12:01.490 align:start position:0%
it gives us all the more strength in
arguing

01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
arguing
 
01:12:03.649 --> 01:12:03.659 align:start position:0%
one thing or another when we have the
 
01:12:05.330 --> 01:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
documents in our hand it's not that we
 
01:12:07.850 --> 01:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
distrust people right it's it's it gives
 
01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
us more oomph behind us thank you
 
01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:13.140 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
01:12:15.169 --> 01:12:15.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you Mr
 
01:12:15.179 --> 01:12:16.669 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you Mr
Lombardo

Lombardo
 
01:12:16.679 --> 01:12:18.410 align:start position:0%
Lombardo
um

01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
we do have retained bills on this
 
01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
subject matter so yeah there there may
 
01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:25.070 align:start position:0%
subject matter so yeah there there may
be

01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:12:27.229 --> 01:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
some benefit there for you um with
 
01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
respect to extra curricular activities
 
01:12:31.729 --> 01:12:31.739 align:start position:0%
for the children I know they're still
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
young Maybe for One
 
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
does the mother
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
have you know like dance lessons or or
 
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
any lessons or what have you and and do
 
01:12:44.450 --> 01:12:44.460 align:start position:0%
you have
 
01:12:48.290 --> 01:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
extra things you do with the children
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
um right now
 
01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
look being so young they don't like I
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
don't we kind of do stuff together like
 
01:12:55.729 --> 01:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
my kids just started t-ball my daughter
 
01:12:57.890 --> 01:12:57.900 align:start position:0%
last year played soccer and we just
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
split those costs 50 50.
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
dude so there's nothing in our parenting
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
plan that establishes what she's
 
01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
supposed to be paying for with her
 
01:13:09.649 --> 01:13:09.659 align:start position:0%
guideline child support so she has been
 
01:13:12.169 --> 01:13:12.179 align:start position:0%
refusing to pay for or enrolled my kids
 
01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
in anything unless I pay for half of it
 
01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:16.140 align:start position:0%
up until recently where I'm taking her
 
01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
back to court again now she's starting
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
to try to
 
01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
like pay for things on her own and prove
 
01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
that she's been using this money
 
01:13:25.970 --> 01:13:25.980 align:start position:0%
you know towards the children when in
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
fact I have evidence you know stating
 
01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:36.900 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you so
 
01:13:38.570 --> 01:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony and we'll we'll
 
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
accept your documents and um please
 
01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
understand that they become part of the
 
01:13:46.010 --> 01:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
public record okay so if that part of it
 
01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
is a problem what I have done in my
 
01:13:51.229 --> 01:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
other committee before is I have read
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
over things to a test that what is
 
01:13:57.470 --> 01:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
alleged is in fact on the document but
 
01:14:01.130 --> 01:14:01.140 align:start position:0%
uh once it comes in it it's anybody can
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
look at it okay I'm just gonna read
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
through my stuff real quick and then
 
01:14:09.169 --> 01:14:09.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:20.930 --> 01:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
and just remember the ground rules here
 
01:14:26.209 --> 01:14:26.219 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a slice of a case in
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
which there is an alleged
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
violation or problem or whatever so that
 
01:14:38.169 --> 01:14:38.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
I'm uh
 
01:14:43.370 --> 01:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
2009 I was called by the local police
 
01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
department in my town saying there was a
 
01:14:46.729 --> 01:14:46.739 align:start position:0%
restraining order
 
01:14:48.410 --> 01:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
on me
 
01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
okay I asked why
 
01:14:52.729 --> 01:14:52.739 align:start position:0%
so you just can't go home there's one
 
01:14:54.770 --> 01:14:54.780 align:start position:0%
been pulled
 
01:14:58.189 --> 01:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
so automatically
 
01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
your 14th Amendment due process for
 
01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
every American in this country
 
01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
is eliminated
 
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
of the federal government can't do
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
anything until you have your due process
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
where you get to face your accuser in a
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:29.810 --> 01:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
I showed up 10 days later after I filed
 
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
the petition was asked by our attorney
 
01:15:44.570 --> 01:15:44.580 align:start position:0%
to tell the court about all the violence
 
01:15:48.050 --> 01:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
emotional physical verbal that she
 
01:15:50.930 --> 01:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
suffered over the years with me
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
her answer to the court was I'm trying
 
01:15:56.270 --> 01:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:58.130 --> 01:15:58.140 align:start position:0%
I raised my hand
 
01:16:00.770 --> 01:16:00.780 align:start position:0%
pro se litigant
 
01:16:03.290 --> 01:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
said your honor I've never harmed my
 
01:16:08.090 --> 01:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
the judge said he'd give a decision by
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
noon time
 
01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
I waited in the court all day they said
 
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
come back Monday
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
so I came back Monday and I was handed
 
01:16:25.130 --> 01:16:25.140 align:start position:0%
a decision that it was a credible threat
 
01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
to my own family
 
01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
I do have the 9-1-1 call that was made
 
01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
which is a matter of public record
 
01:16:45.490 --> 01:16:45.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
while I'm pulling this up I just want to
 
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
let you know that the New Hampshire
 
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:05.090 --> 01:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:08.630 --> 01:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:14.209 --> 01:17:14.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:20.090 --> 01:17:20.100 align:start position:0%

01:18:30.649 --> 01:18:30.659 align:start position:0%
calls 9-1-1 but you don't need the
 
01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:50.330 align:start position:0%

no

01:19:58.430 --> 01:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:03.890 --> 01:20:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
yeah obviously there are no restraining
 
01:20:08.330 --> 01:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:12.890 --> 01:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
yes you've gone over here a lot of times
 
01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
so could you wrap it up in about 30
 
01:20:19.610 --> 01:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
okay well there's supposed to be one
 
01:20:23.930 --> 01:20:23.940 align:start position:0%
judge for one case and one Court that's
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire mandate I've had eight
 
01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
different judges sign off two marital
 
01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
Masters two gals
 
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
a visitation center that I was had to go
 
01:20:37.370 --> 01:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
to see my daughter
 
01:20:39.950 --> 01:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
after 10 months of not seeing my
 
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
daughter at all after she had a nervous
 
01:20:46.130 --> 01:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
breakdown was on suicide watch because
 
01:20:48.890 --> 01:20:48.900 align:start position:0%
all she kept asking everybody if she
 
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
wants a father in her life sir thank you
 
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and we appreciate it
 
01:20:57.169 --> 01:20:57.179 align:start position:0%

01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
and the chair now recognizes John Kelly
 
01:21:11.810 --> 01:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
he has written testimony that he's going
 
01:21:20.570 --> 01:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
good morning John Kelly conquered
 
01:21:29.090 --> 01:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
a man goes to the toy store to buy a
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
birthday gift for his granddaughter
 
01:21:33.290 --> 01:21:33.300 align:start position:0%
a sales lady brings him to the Barbies
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
and she says this is Barbie goes to the
 
01:21:39.530 --> 01:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
beach this costs 29.95 and this is Bobby
 
01:21:41.689 --> 01:21:41.699 align:start position:0%
Barbie goes to medical school
 
01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
she costs 29.95
 
01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:46.980 align:start position:0%
and this is Barbie gets a divorce she
 
01:21:49.010 --> 01:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
costs five hundred dollars
 
01:21:51.709 --> 01:21:51.719 align:start position:0%
why the difference oh this comes with
 
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
Ken's Carr and Ken's house and Ken's
 
01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.990 align:start position:0%
Ken's Carr and Ken's house and Ken's
401k

01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
401k
 
01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
that joke spoke to me
 
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
because in my divorce court experience I
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
saw the courts divide families into
 
01:22:11.209 --> 01:22:11.219 align:start position:0%
winners and losers and I was a loser
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
I also felt the sting of gender bias the
 
01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
best legal advice I got was that I
 
01:22:21.050 --> 01:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
should not expect to be treated fairly I
 
01:22:24.169 --> 01:22:24.179 align:start position:0%
was the wrong gender
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
I was lucky my losses were mostly
 
01:22:31.490 --> 01:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
Financial I lost my life savings I lost
 
01:22:32.930 --> 01:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
my retirement
 
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
and I lost my faith in the courts
 
01:22:39.890 --> 01:22:39.900 align:start position:0%
but I did not lose a child or my freedom
 
01:22:45.530 --> 01:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
or my will to live as others have
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
how can the family courts earn public
 
01:22:50.689 --> 01:22:50.699 align:start position:0%
confidence including mine
 
01:22:53.570 --> 01:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
from my own experience as well as my
 
01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
conversations with other people who have
 
01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:56.330 align:start position:0%
conversations with other people who have
been

01:22:56.330 --> 01:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:22:59.330 --> 01:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
affected by the family courts I have
 
01:23:01.010 --> 01:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
four suggestions
 
01:23:03.770 --> 01:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
the First Reform is to establish a
 
01:23:07.250 --> 01:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
mechanism by which the public May test
 
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
the courts for gender bias perhaps
 
01:23:11.689 --> 01:23:11.699 align:start position:0%
something as simple as tracking the
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
percentage of times a judge rules in
 
01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
favor of male or female litigants and
 
01:23:19.729 --> 01:23:19.739 align:start position:0%
making that information public as part
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
of a Job review
 
01:23:24.169 --> 01:23:24.179 align:start position:0%
in addition the public needs an
 
01:23:26.630 --> 01:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
independent board to investigate
 
01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
complaints of judicial bias this should
 
01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
not be judges judging their colleagues
 
01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
it must be an independent body
 
01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
another necessary reform for the courts
 
01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
is to take perjury seriously
 
01:23:46.370 --> 01:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
perjury is crime it should be treated as
 
01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
a crime
 
01:23:50.209 --> 01:23:50.219 align:start position:0%
closely related to the issue of perjured
 
01:23:53.209 --> 01:23:53.219 align:start position:0%
testimony is the strategy of filing a
 
01:23:55.610 --> 01:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
false report of domestic violence or
 
01:23:58.729 --> 01:23:58.739 align:start position:0%
child abuse in order to gain the upper
 
01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
hand in a divorce proceeding
 
01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
this strategy is devastating not only
 
01:24:06.530 --> 01:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
for the falsely accused but it also
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
undermines The credibility of real
 
01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:09.890 align:start position:0%
undermines The credibility of real
victims

01:24:09.890 --> 01:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
victims
 
01:24:13.010 --> 01:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
filing a false report should be treated
 
01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
as a crime
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
and the falsely accused should be
 
01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
entitled to damages
 
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
number three
 
01:24:23.810 --> 01:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
under the current system parents fight
 
01:24:25.370 --> 01:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
over children
 
01:24:28.010 --> 01:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
this is bad for the courts bad for The
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers Who fund the courts
 
01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
bad for the parents and especially bad
 
01:24:35.209 --> 01:24:35.219 align:start position:0%
for the children
 
01:24:37.850 --> 01:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
the only ones who benefit are the
 
01:24:44.030 --> 01:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:47.270 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:50.450 --> 01:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
a solution to this problem is for
 
01:24:53.209 --> 01:24:53.219 align:start position:0%
legislators to pass a rebuttable
 
01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
presumption of shared parenting
 
01:24:58.130 --> 01:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
and then to ensure that the family
 
01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
courts follow the law
 
01:25:04.250 --> 01:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
a fourth problem is the Court's lack of
 
01:25:07.490 --> 01:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
respect for prenuptial agreements
 
01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
I lost my life savings because our
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
prenuptial agreement was not written
 
01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:13.550 align:start position:0%
prenuptial agreement was not written
down

01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
Mark Twain once said that an oral
 
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
contract is not worth the paper it's
 
01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
written on
 
01:25:21.410 --> 01:25:21.420 align:start position:0%
that's a funny line but it does not
 
01:25:24.229 --> 01:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
solve the problem in New Hampshire oral
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
contracts especially contracts like mine
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
which were corroborated by uh years of
 
01:25:34.970 --> 01:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
documentation and witness testimony
 
01:25:38.930 --> 01:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
oral contracts are valid except for
 
01:25:41.330 --> 01:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
prenuptial agreements
 
01:25:43.970 --> 01:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
that must change
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
I have a suggestion divorce lawyers will
 
01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
not like it but it is good for everyone
 
01:25:50.689 --> 01:25:50.699 align:start position:0%
else we can make divorce less
 
01:25:53.930 --> 01:25:53.940 align:start position:0%
adversarial and less profitable by
 
01:25:56.810 --> 01:25:56.820 align:start position:0%
requiring a filed prenuptial agreement
 
01:25:58.970 --> 01:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
as a condition for getting a marriage
 
01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:00.050 align:start position:0%
as a condition for getting a marriage
license

01:26:00.050 --> 01:26:00.060 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:26:02.209 --> 01:26:02.219 align:start position:0%
this requirement means that couples will
 
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
negotiate while they have a Cooperative
 
01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:05.330 align:start position:0%
negotiate while they have a Cooperative
relationship

01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
before the courts have turned them into
 
01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:10.129 align:start position:0%
before the courts have turned them into
adversaries

01:26:10.129 --> 01:26:10.139 align:start position:0%
adversaries
 
01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
I I I I I mean that as a signal that I'm
 
01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:22.490 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:30.950 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
yes sir are you willing to take
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%

01:26:58.430 --> 01:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
it's been 20 years depending on how you
 
01:27:01.070 --> 01:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
measure it but the um
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
the actual day in court was
 
01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:10.510 --> 01:27:10.520 align:start position:0%

01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
this case arose from a domestic incident
 
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
on May 20th 2017 when the child in
 
01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
question Benjamin van billiard was six
 
01:28:51.770 --> 01:28:51.780 align:start position:0%
months old and had since that time been
 
01:28:53.149 --> 01:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
living at home with his mother and
 
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
father Mary waidola and Benjamin I mean
 
01:28:58.189 --> 01:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
Brian van billiard the purpose of this
 
01:29:00.169 --> 01:29:00.179 align:start position:0%
letter is to bring to your attention the
 
01:29:01.729 --> 01:29:01.739 align:start position:0%
evidence that was provided against Mary
 
01:29:04.189 --> 01:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
that attorney Finney and Brian van
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
billiard knew to be false this false
 
01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
evidence resulted in the honorable Judge
 
01:29:10.850 --> 01:29:10.860 align:start position:0%
decision to Grant Brian van billiard a
 
01:29:12.890 --> 01:29:12.900 align:start position:0%
no contact order between the child and
 
01:29:14.689 --> 01:29:14.699 align:start position:0%
full parental custody of the child until
 
01:29:16.910 --> 01:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
the next hearing
 
01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:17.750 align:start position:0%
the next hearing
um

01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
Mary had no representation at the time
 
01:29:24.169 --> 01:29:24.179 align:start position:0%
as it was an ex parte motion and being
 
01:29:25.850 --> 01:29:25.860 align:start position:0%
unaware of the process and just acting
 
01:29:28.189 --> 01:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
in good faith about the restraining
 
01:29:29.450 --> 01:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
order in place between her and Brian
 
01:29:31.490 --> 01:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
attorney Finney and Brian knowingly
 
01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
presented perjured testimony to during
 
01:29:36.169 --> 01:29:36.179 align:start position:0%
the ex parte hearing with the intent of
 
01:29:38.090 --> 01:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
discrediting her motion Brian and
 
01:29:39.770 --> 01:29:39.780 align:start position:0%
attorney Finney succeeded in this and
 
01:29:41.450 --> 01:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
Brian's objection to the ex parte
 
01:29:43.729 --> 01:29:43.739 align:start position:0%
requesting a no contact order was
 
01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
granted and Mary was and and he was also
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
Brian was also granted full custody of
 
01:29:51.050 --> 01:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
Benjamin Until the family courts would
 
01:29:52.629 --> 01:29:52.639 align:start position:0%
review the matter
 
01:29:55.729 --> 01:29:55.739 align:start position:0%
I have some attachments of Ryan's
 
01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
objection to the ex parte motion this is
 
01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
dated June 9th at 11 49 meaning that
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
Mary filed her ex-arte motion of relief
 
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
before 11 49 on June 9th
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
on July 7 2017 the Court held the
 
01:30:16.669 --> 01:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
hearing on the petitioner's emergency ex
 
01:30:18.649 --> 01:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
parte motion it was during this hearing
 
01:30:21.470 --> 01:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
that Brian van billiard and his Council
 
01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:24.729 align:start position:0%
that Brian van billiard and his Council
attorney

01:30:24.729 --> 01:30:24.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:26.930 --> 01:30:26.940 align:start position:0%
Catherine Finney I just want to make
 
01:30:28.970 --> 01:30:28.980 align:start position:0%
sure her name is stated that Council
 
01:30:30.890 --> 01:30:30.900 align:start position:0%
attorney Catherine Finney stated that
 
01:30:33.290 --> 01:30:33.300 align:start position:0%
Mary y Dolla filed her ex parte motion
 
01:30:35.570 --> 01:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
as a way to avoid having no visitation
 
01:30:39.550 --> 01:30:39.560 align:start position:0%
rights in the no contact order
 
01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:42.430 align:start position:0%
rights in the no contact order
618-2017

01:30:42.430 --> 01:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
618-2017
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
dv00074 now this case number is not the
 
01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
case number cited on the on the ex parte
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
motion that would be
 
01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.610 align:start position:0%
motion that would be
um

01:30:52.610 --> 01:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:56.649 --> 01:30:56.659 align:start position:0%
that would be sorry
 
01:30:59.350 --> 01:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
435 2017
 
01:31:03.290 --> 01:31:03.300 align:start position:0%
cr795 so we go from a civil
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
a civil ex parte on on a domestic
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
violence to now we find ourselves in a
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
family court on July 7th as it regards
 
01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:13.850 align:start position:0%
family court on July 7th as it regards
to

01:31:13.850 --> 01:31:13.860 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
um the baby Benjamin van billiard who is
 
01:31:18.110 --> 01:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
now seven months old and has had no
 
01:31:19.850 --> 01:31:19.860 align:start position:0%
contact with his mother for 21 straight
 
01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:21.470 align:start position:0%
contact with his mother for 21 straight
days

01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:24.709 align:start position:0%
days
um

01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
so attorney Finney alleges that Mary
 
01:31:29.570 --> 01:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
filed this ex parte motion as a way to
 
01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
avoid having no visitation rights
 
01:31:33.890 --> 01:31:33.900 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the no contact order that
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
had not existed at that time of Mary
 
01:31:38.209 --> 01:31:38.219 align:start position:0%
filing the documentation I'm providing
 
01:31:40.189 --> 01:31:40.199 align:start position:0%
shows this to be false and that Brian
 
01:31:42.290 --> 01:31:42.300 align:start position:0%
and his counsel knowingly lied and took
 
01:31:44.209 --> 01:31:44.219 align:start position:0%
advantage of the lack of reputation of
 
01:31:46.189 --> 01:31:46.199 align:start position:0%
my sister on that day on the morning of
 
01:31:49.129 --> 01:31:49.139 align:start position:0%
June 9 2017 I accompanied Mary to the
 
01:31:52.129 --> 01:31:52.139 align:start position:0%
10th District division in Brentwood at
 
01:31:54.050 --> 01:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
or around 10 o'clock and the purpose was
 
01:31:56.810 --> 01:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
to file the ex parte against the
 
01:32:01.729 --> 01:32:01.739 align:start position:0%
protective order 435 2017 cr795 this
 
01:32:03.470 --> 01:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
request for Relief stated that Brian was
 
01:32:05.209 --> 01:32:05.219 align:start position:0%
falsely interpreting the order of
 
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
protection to prevent contact between
 
01:32:09.770 --> 01:32:09.780 align:start position:0%
the child Benjamin and Mary the mother
 
01:32:11.930 --> 01:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
so that is
 
01:32:11.940 --> 01:32:12.770 align:start position:0%
so that is
um

01:32:12.770 --> 01:32:12.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
anyway so those are I've already
 
01:32:16.370 --> 01:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
presented you so the request for the
 
01:32:18.110 --> 01:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
relief stated that Brian was doing that
 
01:32:20.090 --> 01:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
and that we would like to have a move up
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
our court date on on case number 435
 
01:32:26.689 --> 01:32:26.699 align:start position:0%
2017 and that Mary would be able to
 
01:32:30.290 --> 01:32:30.300 align:start position:0%
expose to the court that this protective
 
01:32:31.970 --> 01:32:31.980 align:start position:0%
order between the parents was borrowing
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
was allowing him to borrow contact from
 
01:32:35.570 --> 01:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
the child because
 
01:32:37.610 --> 01:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
she could not hold him accountable she
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
could not contact him on this order of
 
01:32:41.810 --> 01:32:41.820 align:start position:0%
protection it only States Brian van
 
01:32:43.370 --> 01:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
billiard's name the additional
 
01:32:45.229 --> 01:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
protective Parties number two number
 
01:32:49.310 --> 01:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
three number four are filled in N A not
 
01:32:51.470 --> 01:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
um I also have a current copy of that
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
where you can see Brian van billiard's
 
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
name is the only name that is that has
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
the protective order so nobody else is
 
01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
Mary is barred from having contact with
 
01:33:04.250 --> 01:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
so at that point that was the 21 days
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
later that Mary had not seen her child
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
we nobody in my family had seen my
 
01:33:10.729 --> 01:33:10.739 align:start position:0%
newborn nephew the ex parte Mary filed
 
01:33:12.890 --> 01:33:12.900 align:start position:0%
clearly states that it was this court
 
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
date what 435 and not court case 618 as
 
01:33:18.610 --> 01:33:18.620 align:start position:0%
attorney Finney
 
01:33:20.990 --> 01:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
misrepresented so at this time we were
 
01:33:23.090 --> 01:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
on the courts I was there as a witness
 
01:33:25.790 --> 01:33:25.800 align:start position:0%
the other order did not exist and Brian
 
01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
had not yet filed it Brian arrived
 
01:33:29.689 --> 01:33:29.699 align:start position:0%
afterwards while we were there he was
 
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
served his paper at 11 30 and shortly
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
after this
 
01:33:37.129 --> 01:33:37.139 align:start position:0%
um he was then began the proceedings to
 
01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
file the protective order between the
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
child and my sister so it is only
 
01:33:44.930 --> 01:33:44.940 align:start position:0%
logical that his objection motioned had
 
01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
to be after he was served whereby the
 
01:33:50.030 --> 01:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
time stamp on the protective order
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
between the child and the mother is time
 
01:33:56.450 --> 01:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
stamped at 2 17 pm on the same day so we
 
01:33:57.890 --> 01:33:57.900 align:start position:0%
believe this should have been obvious to
 
01:33:59.390 --> 01:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
attorney Finney we believe this should
 
01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
have been obvious to the judge handling
 
01:34:02.990 --> 01:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
the case that he has two different
 
01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
protective orders filed on two different
 
01:34:09.050 --> 01:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
days and that Mary whereby is not
 
01:34:12.290 --> 01:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
violating the later existing
 
01:34:14.510 --> 01:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
protective order that did not exist at
 
01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
the time of her filing
 
01:34:19.010 --> 01:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
for this reason I respectfully conclude
 
01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
that attorney Catherine Finney
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
misrepresented the information to defame
 
01:34:26.090 --> 01:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
my sister and impede Justice
 
01:34:29.890 --> 01:34:29.900 align:start position:0%
um the I would like to just bring up
 
01:34:34.129 --> 01:34:34.139 align:start position:0%
that you know RSA 641 is perjury we had
 
01:34:36.110 --> 01:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
another person bringing that up and that
 
01:34:38.090 --> 01:34:38.100 align:start position:0%
this was not this false material
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
statement was provided it was
 
01:34:41.689 --> 01:34:41.699 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with what was actually
 
01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
happened and it was plainly false it was
 
01:34:46.610 --> 01:34:46.620 align:start position:0%
known to be false all of these
 
01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:48.070 align:start position:0%
known to be false all of these
um just

01:34:48.070 --> 01:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
um just
 
01:34:51.290 --> 01:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
illustrate that there was um and no lack
 
01:34:53.570 --> 01:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
of there was no no oversight all of this
 
01:34:55.550 --> 01:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
the judges and the lawyers now just made
 
01:34:57.410 --> 01:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
this decision and because we went from a
 
01:34:59.510 --> 01:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
civil case about domestic violence and
 
01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
now we were in a family court the
 
01:35:06.890 --> 01:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
judge's decision was law 30 seconds
 
01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
so give us the points we're going to
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
consider because in this iteration of
 
01:35:14.209 --> 01:35:14.219 align:start position:0%
the committee we're not looking at
 
01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
specific names people to bring charges
 
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
against we are simply looking at
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
procedural issues so I suppose the
 
01:35:26.330 --> 01:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
procedural issue that um your the dcyf
 
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
and that other parents have brought up
 
01:35:29.629 --> 01:35:29.639 align:start position:0%
is that there is no oversight the first
 
01:35:31.250 --> 01:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
parent that gets the restraining order
 
01:35:33.530 --> 01:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
has the benefit of all the force of the
 
01:35:35.330 --> 01:35:35.340 align:start position:0%
court I don't believe that that goes
 
01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
male or female but I do believe that
 
01:35:38.570 --> 01:35:38.580 align:start position:0%
females tend to get restraining orders
 
01:35:41.330 --> 01:35:41.340 align:start position:0%
first and maybe we would look into that
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
that which you know who who's working
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
male and female with dcyf with these
 
01:35:47.810 --> 01:35:47.820 align:start position:0%
organizations and who's winning the ones
 
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
that are playing ball or the ones that
 
01:35:51.050 --> 01:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
have have a restraining order against
 
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
them that they're now appearing in court
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
trying to just play catch-up on not
 
01:35:57.229 --> 01:35:57.239 align:start position:0%
being able to do that
 
01:36:00.530 --> 01:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
um I do believe that this that
 
01:36:03.649 --> 01:36:03.659 align:start position:0%
lawyers and the judges and they they are
 
01:36:06.410 --> 01:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
able to work in concert with each other
 
01:36:08.270 --> 01:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
um and just completely Overlook it
 
01:36:10.430 --> 01:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
whereas the offense now became not
 
01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
whether Brian was using a restraining
 
01:36:15.290 --> 01:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
order to falsely do this but that Mary
 
01:36:17.450 --> 01:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
was undermining and disrespecting the
 
01:36:20.090 --> 01:36:20.100 align:start position:0%
courts when it was clearly the case did
 
01:36:22.729 --> 01:36:22.739 align:start position:0%
not get the time it was not um I just
 
01:36:25.010 --> 01:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
want to add one more one more point is
 
01:36:26.810 --> 01:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
that she had what that the woman that
 
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
used to work for dcyf had mentioned that
 
01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
the judges have access to all of these
 
01:36:32.689 --> 01:36:32.699 align:start position:0%
cases they have different numbers they
 
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
were presented to him and he was he took
 
01:36:37.729 --> 01:36:37.739 align:start position:0%
and he just ignored he did not he did
 
01:36:39.110 --> 01:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
not review the information that was
 
01:36:40.729 --> 01:36:40.739 align:start position:0%
given to him and he was intentionally
 
01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
misled by a lawyer who was taking
 
01:36:45.229 --> 01:36:45.239 align:start position:0%
advantage of nobody being able to hold
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
her accountable for perjury thank you
 
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman and thank you Miss
 
01:37:28.370 --> 01:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
vaidola for taking my question I was
 
01:37:30.830 --> 01:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you could just
 
01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
in 20 seconds just kind of Briefly
 
01:37:36.229 --> 01:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
summarize what was the overall outcome
 
01:37:37.850 --> 01:37:37.860 align:start position:0%
of the case like what what ended up
 
01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:43.850 --> 01:37:43.860 align:start position:0%
uh are you asking on that court date
 
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
when we went for the ex parte
 
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
just overall what ended up happening
 
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
with custody with the child and your
 
01:37:51.770 --> 01:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
sister is now deceased so I didn't know
 
01:37:53.330 --> 01:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
if there was
 
01:37:55.970 --> 01:37:55.980 align:start position:0%
um so my sister was deceased there by
 
01:37:58.729 --> 01:37:58.739 align:start position:0%
the court just dissolved the case Brian
 
01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
now has full custody of the child and
 
01:38:02.810 --> 01:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
does and we are
 
01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:03.590 align:start position:0%
does and we are
um

01:38:03.590 --> 01:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:07.610 --> 01:38:07.620 align:start position:0%
we are estranged and because that was
 
01:38:09.110 --> 01:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
his intent the entire time was to
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
estrange my family and my sister from
 
01:38:13.370 --> 01:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
the life of the baby so um he was
 
01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
successful in that and um he just
 
01:38:17.629 --> 01:38:17.639 align:start position:0%
utilized the court to bully her so there
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
was there was really no there was
 
01:38:20.209 --> 01:38:20.219 align:start position:0%
nothing else we could do after that
 
01:38:20.219 --> 01:38:20.930 align:start position:0%
nothing else we could do after that
point

01:38:20.930 --> 01:38:20.940 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:38:22.729 --> 01:38:22.739 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%

01:39:10.139 --> 01:39:11.209 align:start position:0%
I mean I have a list of of issues in my
case

01:39:11.209 --> 01:39:11.219 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:39:13.310 --> 01:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
that would occupy more than five minutes
 
01:39:15.649 --> 01:39:15.659 align:start position:0%
so I'm just gonna give a brief synopsis

01:39:19.970 --> 01:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
my intent is to submit this
 
01:39:22.250 --> 01:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
electronically after the fact after I
 
01:39:24.410 --> 01:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
clean it up but I'll briefly go through
 
01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
some of the issues
 
01:39:28.729 --> 01:39:28.739 align:start position:0%
um I guess one of them one of the main
 
01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
issues uh was failure of due process
 
01:39:35.570 --> 01:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
in regards to a parenting plan my case
 
01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
started in Hooksett
 
01:39:43.129 --> 01:39:43.139 align:start position:0%
and initiated uh in 2018
 
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh temporary hearing was held in January
 
01:39:48.590 --> 01:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
of 2019.
 
01:39:51.530 --> 01:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
at that time of the temporary hearing
 
01:39:54.290 --> 01:39:54.300 align:start position:0%
and the order which came out there was
 
01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
no parenting plan uh at all it was about
 
01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:01.750 align:start position:0%
no parenting plan uh at all it was about
a

01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:04.970 --> 01:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
paragraph or so stating
 
01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:06.350 align:start position:0%
paragraph or so stating
um

01:40:06.350 --> 01:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:09.649 --> 01:40:09.659 align:start position:0%
you know the the visitation it initiated
 
01:40:13.850 --> 01:40:13.860 align:start position:0%
by me in 2018 by filing an ex parte
 
01:40:16.189 --> 01:40:16.199 align:start position:0%
because I was not being allowed to see
 
01:40:18.169 --> 01:40:18.179 align:start position:0%
my daughter
 
01:40:18.179 --> 01:40:19.850 align:start position:0%
my daughter
um

01:40:19.850 --> 01:40:19.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:24.649 --> 01:40:24.659 align:start position:0%
that lack of a parenting plan uh lasted
 
01:40:24.659 --> 01:40:26.270 align:start position:0%
that lack of a parenting plan uh lasted
until

01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
until
 
01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:28.970 align:start position:0%
until
2020.

01:40:28.970 --> 01:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
2020.
 
01:40:31.729 --> 01:40:31.739 align:start position:0%
um at least three motions were filed uh
 
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
requesting the judge to
 
01:40:35.390 --> 01:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
um put forth
 
01:40:38.510 --> 01:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
or hold an expedite hearing to provide a
 
01:40:40.090 --> 01:40:40.100 align:start position:0%
parenting plan that would allow for
 
01:40:43.129 --> 01:40:43.139 align:start position:0%
vacation holidays and like
 
01:40:45.770 --> 01:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
that was denied until the final hearings
 
01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:48.719 align:start position:0%
which in total there were about six
 
01:40:51.229 --> 01:40:51.239 align:start position:0%
final hearings before we got to that
 
01:40:51.239 --> 01:40:52.510 align:start position:0%
final hearings before we got to that
point

01:40:52.510 --> 01:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:40:55.330 --> 01:40:55.340 align:start position:0%
throughout the matter there was
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
obviously issues as far as not providing
 
01:41:02.330 --> 01:41:02.340 align:start position:0%
finding facts both in property division
 
01:41:06.350 --> 01:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
in downward deviation of Child Support
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:12.169 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:41:12.169 --> 01:41:12.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:12.179 --> 01:41:13.610 align:start position:0%
 
alimony

01:41:13.610 --> 01:41:13.620 align:start position:0%
alimony
 
01:41:15.709 --> 01:41:15.719 align:start position:0%
that case got remanded to the Supreme
 
01:41:15.719 --> 01:41:17.050 align:start position:0%
that case got remanded to the Supreme
Court

01:41:17.050 --> 01:41:17.060 align:start position:0%
Court
 
01:41:20.330 --> 01:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
in 2021
 
01:41:23.390 --> 01:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
it got remanded back to Hooksett now
 
01:41:25.070 --> 01:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
under a new judge because the original
 
01:41:27.709 --> 01:41:27.719 align:start position:0%
judge was retiring during the first
 
01:41:29.570 --> 01:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
portion of the hearings
 
01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
she made that very clear to US during
 
01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
the hearings
 
01:41:36.169 --> 01:41:36.179 align:start position:0%
and said her time was limited so we
 
01:41:40.370 --> 01:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:41.930 --> 01:41:41.940 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately
 
01:41:44.689 --> 01:41:44.699 align:start position:0%
on the reband the the Supreme Court
 
01:41:48.169 --> 01:41:48.179 align:start position:0%
remanded that all property division be
 
01:41:48.179 --> 01:41:49.189 align:start position:0%
remanded that all property division be
um

01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:52.729 --> 01:41:52.739 align:start position:0%
reheard that did not happen
 
01:41:57.229 --> 01:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
and so we are in a peel number two
 
01:41:57.239 --> 01:41:58.669 align:start position:0%
and so we are in a peel number two
um

01:41:58.669 --> 01:41:58.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:01.010 --> 01:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
some other issues that I guess are of
 
01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:02.460 align:start position:0%
concern to me
 
01:42:04.609 --> 01:42:04.619 align:start position:0%
and people have brought up the uh
 
01:42:08.090 --> 01:42:08.100 align:start position:0%
problem with attorneys making false
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
statements the issue of perjury
 
01:42:14.030 --> 01:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
um the opposing Council during the the
 
01:42:15.649 --> 01:42:15.659 align:start position:0%
first uh
 
01:42:18.709 --> 01:42:18.719 align:start position:0%
session of my hearings I was represented
 
01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:20.159 align:start position:0%
by attorney
 
01:42:22.910 --> 01:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
that attorney has since
 
01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:23.570 align:start position:0%
that attorney has since
um

01:42:23.570 --> 01:42:23.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:25.970 --> 01:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
had to step down
 
01:42:28.669 --> 01:42:28.679 align:start position:0%
under investigation
 
01:42:30.890 --> 01:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
I filed the complaint against that
 
01:42:33.530 --> 01:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
attorney in 2020
 
01:42:35.330 --> 01:42:35.340 align:start position:0%
which was denied
 
01:42:35.340 --> 01:42:37.070 align:start position:0%
which was denied
after

01:42:37.070 --> 01:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
after
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh being very diligent with the attorney
 
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
discipline office I went through files
 
01:42:45.770 --> 01:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
to see how many other complaints were
 
01:42:48.050 --> 01:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
lodged and there were a total of eight
 
01:42:50.450 --> 01:42:50.460 align:start position:0%
docketed complaints which again docketed
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
complaints are only those which rise to
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
the occasion per the uh
 
01:42:58.810 --> 01:42:58.820 align:start position:0%
the attorney discipline office
 
01:43:01.129 --> 01:43:01.139 align:start position:0%
when I finally was able to go review
 
01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
files due to covid in 2021
 
01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
I had found that that particular
 
01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:09.649 align:start position:0%
I had found that that particular
attorney

01:43:09.649 --> 01:43:09.659 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
01:43:13.010 --> 01:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
was had another docketed complaint which
 
01:43:15.010 --> 01:43:15.020 align:start position:0%
consisted of
 
01:43:15.020 --> 01:43:16.850 align:start position:0%
consisted of
providing

01:43:16.850 --> 01:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
providing
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
patent Services as without being a
 
01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:23.340 align:start position:0%
licensed patent attorney
 
01:43:25.070 --> 01:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
um the number of complaints against this
 
01:43:27.649 --> 01:43:27.659 align:start position:0%
particular uh
 
01:43:27.659 --> 01:43:29.450 align:start position:0%
particular uh
lawyer

01:43:29.450 --> 01:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
01:43:31.850 --> 01:43:31.860 align:start position:0%
um we're extensive
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
and again Empower you along before the
 
01:43:36.590 --> 01:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
clock runs out what is your point that
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
we should consider as a committee the
 
01:43:40.129 --> 01:43:40.139 align:start position:0%
point is that the eternity discipline
 
01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
office is run by the Supreme Court and
 
01:43:44.689 --> 01:43:44.699 align:start position:0%
it is operated by
 
01:43:47.570 --> 01:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
again uh
 
01:43:49.609 --> 01:43:49.619 align:start position:0%
other lawyers there should be an
 
01:43:51.169 --> 01:43:51.179 align:start position:0%
independent committee
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
to pursue the matters uh at hand
 
01:44:01.490 --> 01:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:04.010 --> 01:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
um so one other issue that came up and
 
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
I'll try to be brief is there was I was
 
01:44:08.330 --> 01:44:08.340 align:start position:0%
ordered to pay child support through the
 
01:44:10.669 --> 01:44:10.679 align:start position:0%
Bureau of child support after paying on
 
01:44:12.890 --> 01:44:12.900 align:start position:0%
time for four years
 
01:44:14.750 --> 01:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
after dealing with a child support
 
01:44:17.930 --> 01:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
office they assumed or made a claim that
 
01:44:21.229 --> 01:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
I had in a rearage which I did not
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
I had argued it and it appears that uh
 
01:44:27.410 --> 01:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
the child support Bureau does not
 
01:44:30.590 --> 01:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
provide documentation to the public
 
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
of how they calculated a rearage
 
01:44:35.689 --> 01:44:35.699 align:start position:0%
and thus people are left in the dark not
 
01:44:37.609 --> 01:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
knowing exactly
 
01:44:39.770 --> 01:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
how to do that the judge in my matter
 
01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
refused to calculate a rearage and
 
01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
pushed it to the child support and there
 
01:44:47.570 --> 01:44:47.580 align:start position:0%
were no findings
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
to prove why 30 seconds I should be
 
01:44:53.629 --> 01:44:53.639 align:start position:0%
paying through the bureau so now my
 
01:44:56.510 --> 01:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
paycheck is obviously attached
 
01:44:58.250 --> 01:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
so there was a judge this doesn't count
 
01:45:00.109 --> 01:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
against your minute so there was a
 
01:45:01.609 --> 01:45:01.619 align:start position:0%
judgment made against you but there was
 
01:45:03.890 --> 01:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
no proof or reason as to why it just was
 
01:45:08.930 --> 01:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
it's got about another 20 seconds
 
01:45:17.930 --> 01:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
so I in that matter you know again part
 
01:45:21.649 --> 01:45:21.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:23.810 --> 01:45:23.820 align:start position:0%
they're they're lack there's a lack of
 
01:45:26.450 --> 01:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
findings which is consistent I think and
 
01:45:28.669 --> 01:45:28.679 align:start position:0%
something that's an overwhelming scheme
 
01:45:30.770 --> 01:45:30.780 align:start position:0%
that people are having to deal with
 
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
being forced to continue you know to
 
01:45:34.970 --> 01:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
file an appeal and the process again
 
01:45:37.550 --> 01:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
appeal is at least a year and you know
 
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
this just continues and continues and
 
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
drags out I think uh the main factor is
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
is that this this committee could form a
 
01:45:51.649 --> 01:45:51.659 align:start position:0%
decision or uh I guess make a suggestion
 
01:45:54.950 --> 01:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
that the format of orders are the same
 
01:45:57.410 --> 01:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
throughout minus the narrative which
 
01:45:59.930 --> 01:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
leaves more reason you know
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
individuality to the judges
 
01:46:06.290 --> 01:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
there is no checklist item for making a
 
01:46:08.870 --> 01:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
decision and these decisions are all
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
over the map talking a lot about history
 
01:46:12.530 --> 01:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
of things but not necessarily hitting
 
01:46:17.330 --> 01:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:21.410 --> 01:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:22.490 align:start position:0%
 
anybody

01:46:22.490 --> 01:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:25.189 align:start position:0%
anybody
no

01:46:25.189 --> 01:46:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:27.290 --> 01:46:27.300 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much thank you
 
01:46:28.990 --> 01:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
you've covered a lot of things very
 
01:46:30.890 --> 01:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
succinctly do you have anything written
 
01:46:32.570 --> 01:46:32.580 align:start position:0%
you want to give us I will submit this
 
01:46:34.669 --> 01:46:34.679 align:start position:0%
electronically if that is fine that is
 
01:46:41.450 --> 01:46:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes Nicholas Rinaldi he
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
said time needed to speak five minutes
 
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
yeah and you've given us a this is one
 
01:46:52.129 --> 01:46:52.139 align:start position:0%
document not a lot of documents with
 
01:46:54.290 --> 01:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
multiple copies so what I've provided
 
01:46:57.229 --> 01:46:57.239 align:start position:0%
with you is um that's that's the status
 
01:46:59.090 --> 01:46:59.100 align:start position:0%
of my case on everything that's been
 
01:47:01.550 --> 01:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
filed okay good thank you now we can
 
01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:02.330 align:start position:0%
filed okay good thank you now we can
start

01:47:02.330 --> 01:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
start
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
and the reason why I did give you that
 
01:47:07.970 --> 01:47:07.980 align:start position:0%
is because my entire case was botched
 
01:47:11.689 --> 01:47:11.699 align:start position:0%
um okay so I'm gonna start off that
 
01:47:13.810 --> 01:47:13.820 align:start position:0%
a judge acting without subject
 
01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:16.440 align:start position:0%

01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
state officer acts under the state law
 
01:47:59.109 --> 01:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:03.290 --> 01:48:03.300 align:start position:0%
violative of the Federal Constitution he
 
01:48:05.450 --> 01:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
comes into conflict with the superior
 
01:48:08.689 --> 01:48:08.699 align:start position:0%
authority of the Constitution and he is
 
01:48:13.629 --> 01:48:13.639 align:start position:0%
in that case stripped of his official or
 
01:48:16.250 --> 01:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
representative character in his subject
 
01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
in his person to the consequences of his
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
individual conduct the state has no
 
01:48:27.649 --> 01:48:27.659 align:start position:0%
power to impart to him any immunity for
 
01:48:29.750 --> 01:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
from responsibility to the supreme
 
01:48:32.750 --> 01:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
authority of the United States
 
01:48:35.450 --> 01:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
okay so that would bring us into a
 
01:48:40.129 --> 01:48:40.139 align:start position:0%
section 1983 that's when uh it provides
 
01:48:42.109 --> 01:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
an individual the right to sue a state
 
01:48:44.570 --> 01:48:44.580 align:start position:0%
government employees or other acting
 
01:48:47.149 --> 01:48:47.159 align:start position:0%
under the color of state law
 
01:48:50.510 --> 01:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
so my name again is Nicholas Rinaldi Mr
 
01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
Rinaldi let me go back to the very
 
01:48:55.850 --> 01:48:55.860 align:start position:0%
beginning uh this is you're you're
 
01:48:59.629 --> 01:48:59.639 align:start position:0%
speaking to a judge acting my judge is
 
01:49:01.669 --> 01:49:01.679 align:start position:0%
actually judge Garner who testified here
 
01:49:04.189 --> 01:49:04.199 align:start position:0%
without subject matter jurisdiction
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
correct they lose subjectures they lose
 
01:49:10.250 --> 01:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
their subject jurisdiction when they are
 
01:49:14.570 --> 01:49:14.580 align:start position:0%
in the process of committing felonies
 
01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
and violations of state and federal laws
 
01:49:19.550 --> 01:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
I just read about this last night please
 
01:49:22.609 --> 01:49:22.619 align:start position:0%
continue okay actually so I'll get to
 
01:49:24.290 --> 01:49:24.300 align:start position:0%
the the short because I only have a
 
01:49:26.450 --> 01:49:26.460 align:start position:0%
short amount of time well we need to be
 
01:49:28.729 --> 01:49:28.739 align:start position:0%
looking for and the reason why we are
 
01:49:32.510 --> 01:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
here because we are here is racketeering
 
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%

01:49:52.669 --> 01:49:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:49:56.689 --> 01:49:56.699 align:start position:0%
let me see here
 
01:49:58.370 --> 01:49:58.380 align:start position:0%
I think to help with what we're
 
01:50:00.169 --> 01:50:00.179 align:start position:0%
receiving from you could you speak
 
01:50:04.189 --> 01:50:04.199 align:start position:0%
specifically to how this is a violation
 
01:50:07.729 --> 01:50:07.739 align:start position:0%
how in your particular instance there
 
01:50:09.590 --> 01:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
was somebody presiding without
 
01:50:12.129 --> 01:50:12.139 align:start position:0%
appropriate subject oh jurisdiction
 
01:50:15.890 --> 01:50:15.900 align:start position:0%
briefly I mean yes so I'll just go over
 
01:50:19.250 --> 01:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
my letter intent to sue okay so uh
 
01:50:22.970 --> 01:50:22.980 align:start position:0%

uh violation of the false claims ACT
 
01:50:31.609 --> 01:50:31.619 align:start position:0%
people we have all these laws already in
 
01:50:34.010 --> 01:50:34.020 align:start position:0%
place we're just not applying them the
 
01:50:35.930 --> 01:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
judges are aware of it they know what's
 
01:50:38.270 --> 01:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
going on they didn't go through six
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
years to college uh to be dummies
 
01:50:44.510 --> 01:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
judge Garner was my job he's still my
 
01:50:45.950 --> 01:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
judge and he's actually a very
 
01:50:47.870 --> 01:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
intelligent man and he's the one that
 
01:50:51.830 --> 01:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
corrected my case so I am sitting here
 
01:50:54.890 --> 01:50:54.900 align:start position:0%
uh bearing witness that my case has been
 
01:50:56.990 --> 01:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
corrected and I have full custody of my

zero child support but I had to go to go
 
01:51:04.189 --> 01:51:04.199 align:start position:0%
through hell to get there and it was
 
01:51:06.290 --> 01:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
basically because of one single attorney
 
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:08.880 align:start position:0%

times
 
01:51:51.229 --> 01:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
that afternoon I had an appointment for
 
01:51:55.310 --> 01:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
a 20 250 000 bid on a project that I had
 
01:51:57.229 --> 01:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
lost because of the judge
 
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
and when I left the court that judge uh
 
01:52:03.169 --> 01:52:03.179 align:start position:0%
told me he was gonna throw me in jail
 
01:52:05.390 --> 01:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
because I brought it to his attention
 
01:52:08.090 --> 01:52:08.100 align:start position:0%
that that was the lowest a person can go
 
01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
after 15 minutes I don't care who you
 
01:52:11.209 --> 01:52:11.219 align:start position:0%

call and you cut everybody loose it's
 
01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:16.440 align:start position:0%

testimony and uh rebuttals of some of
 
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
the prior testimonies uh I am still
 
01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
going to follow up with that with both
 
01:54:37.250 --> 01:54:37.260 align:start position:0%
written and oral testimony pretty
 
01:54:41.450 --> 01:54:41.460 align:start position:0%
specific laws that uh were violated and
 
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
I need clarification I was not prepared
 
01:54:46.609 --> 01:54:46.619 align:start position:0%
to testify enough today and flag it when
 
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
you do as to the date so we don't
 
01:54:51.470 --> 01:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
correct mix them up okay correct you may
 
01:54:53.450 --> 01:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
begin thank you
 
01:54:58.129 --> 01:54:58.139 align:start position:0%
uh so so today I'm here uh obviously to
 
01:55:00.350 --> 01:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
continue this journey uh as noted last
 
01:55:02.510 --> 01:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
week I have over 13 years of experience
 
01:55:05.209 --> 01:55:05.219 align:start position:0%
in the Family Court uh my earlier years
 
01:55:08.629 --> 01:55:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh we were there multiple times a week
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
um for different matters
 
01:55:13.490 --> 01:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
um more recently uh luckily we've been
 
01:55:15.890 --> 01:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
to only three uh about every three
 
01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:17.270 align:start position:0%
to only three uh about every three
months

01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
months
 
01:55:19.970 --> 01:55:19.980 align:start position:0%
um for different matters but currently
 
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
what is going on and I think part of
 
01:55:24.790 --> 01:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
that is this committee's
 
01:55:26.990 --> 01:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
oversight and some other things that are
 
01:55:29.689 --> 01:55:29.699 align:start position:0%
going on in this state is over the last
 
01:55:31.070 --> 01:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
six months
 
01:55:35.450 --> 01:55:35.460 align:start position:0%
we have had significant delays of
 
01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
process there is currently seven
 
01:55:41.629 --> 01:55:41.639 align:start position:0%
outstanding motions uh from multiple
 
01:55:43.370 --> 01:55:43.380 align:start position:0%
variations of
 
01:55:46.250 --> 01:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
time frames over this last year or six
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
months starting with January the uh this
 
01:55:52.910 --> 01:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
is a guardianship matter
 
01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:53.629 align:start position:0%
is a guardianship matter
um

01:55:53.629 --> 01:55:53.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:57.530 --> 01:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
the guardian had filed to remove the no
 
01:55:59.629 --> 01:55:59.639 align:start position:0%
contact provision that the court imposed
 
01:56:02.750 --> 01:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh one year prior without anybody's
 
01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:04.669 align:start position:0%
uh one year prior without anybody's
request

01:56:04.669 --> 01:56:04.679 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:56:04.679 --> 01:56:06.530 align:start position:0%
request
um

01:56:06.530 --> 01:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:09.050 --> 01:56:09.060 align:start position:0%
it was for me to not contact the
 
01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:10.910 align:start position:0%
it was for me to not contact the
guardian

01:56:10.910 --> 01:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
guardian
 
01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:11.629 align:start position:0%
guardian
um

01:56:11.629 --> 01:56:11.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:13.370 --> 01:56:13.380 align:start position:0%
we were not able to hear that because
 
01:56:15.470 --> 01:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
the garnet item did not show up at the
 
01:56:18.410 --> 01:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
February hearing so that was postponed
 
01:56:19.790 --> 01:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
to March
 
01:56:22.990 --> 01:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
during the march hearing
 
01:56:26.510 --> 01:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
there was testimony that possibly dcyf
 
01:56:28.250 --> 01:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
was going to be getting involved the
 
01:56:31.609 --> 01:56:31.619 align:start position:0%
judge ordered that dcyf basically gets
 
01:56:35.930 --> 01:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:39.709 --> 01:56:39.719 align:start position:0%
pronounced dcyf is dragging their feet
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
at getting involved to say the least the
 
01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
office the child advocate is actively
 
01:56:49.129 --> 01:56:49.139 align:start position:0%
overseeing these matters the Ombudsman
 
01:56:51.229 --> 01:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
office is actively overseeing these
 
01:56:53.629 --> 01:56:53.639 align:start position:0%
matters and I do thank them for coming
 
01:56:56.750 --> 01:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
and testifying today
 
01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:58.370 align:start position:0%
and testifying today
um

01:56:58.370 --> 01:56:58.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:01.310 --> 01:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
so with that uh to back up a little bit
 
01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
in January February somewhere around
 
01:57:06.410 --> 01:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
that time I also filed a motion to
 
01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
conjoin dcyf to the guardianship of this
 
01:57:09.119 --> 01:57:11.090 align:start position:0%
conjoin dcyf to the guardianship of this
child

01:57:11.090 --> 01:57:11.100 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:57:13.729 --> 01:57:13.739 align:start position:0%
unbeknownst I really did not want to
 
01:57:16.490 --> 01:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
um but it was a necessity because of
 
01:57:18.589 --> 01:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
what was going on
 
01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
the court still has not heard any of
 
01:57:22.609 --> 01:57:22.619 align:start position:0%
these motions we were scheduled for
 
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
March we heard that potentially dcyf was
 
01:57:27.290 --> 01:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
stepping in to file a Chin's petition
 
01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
and place this child into residential
 
01:57:32.750 --> 01:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
custody dcyf has not done so the
 
01:57:35.229 --> 01:57:35.239 align:start position:0%
guardian the guardian litem and myself
 
01:57:39.530 --> 01:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
have asked for DC the court has asked
 
01:57:43.250 --> 01:57:43.260 align:start position:0%
dcyf to step in and take possession of
 
01:57:44.810 --> 01:57:44.820 align:start position:0%
this child
 
01:57:48.530 --> 01:57:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:51.410 --> 01:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
coming forward so we have some of these
 
01:57:53.390 --> 01:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
motions that are still outstanding we're
 
01:57:55.010 --> 01:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
waiting to hear them they were scheduled
 
01:57:57.530 --> 01:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
for June uh
 
01:57:59.810 --> 01:57:59.820 align:start position:0%
get a letter in the mail yesterday
 
01:58:02.990 --> 01:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
stating that the court has now postponed
 
01:58:06.530 --> 01:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
it yet again to now July
 
01:58:08.890 --> 01:58:08.900 align:start position:0%
any reason given no reason
 
01:58:11.930 --> 01:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
administrative ruling okay
 
01:58:14.089 --> 01:58:14.099 align:start position:0%
um was the reason that was given the
 
01:58:16.129 --> 01:58:16.139 align:start position:0%
court had decided to
 
01:58:18.530 --> 01:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
maneuver that
 
01:58:21.109 --> 01:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
um again there's been other motions
 
01:58:24.649 --> 01:58:24.659 align:start position:0%
filed uh motion to indeed have a hearing
 
01:58:26.810 --> 01:58:26.820 align:start position:0%
on the no contact provision that's
 
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
preventing things there's a motion to
 
01:58:31.609 --> 01:58:31.619 align:start position:0%
have access back to the child's records
 
01:58:34.550 --> 01:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
because Juvenile Justice is requesting
 
01:58:36.169 --> 01:58:36.179 align:start position:0%
my involvement
 
01:58:39.129 --> 01:58:39.139 align:start position:0%
in that Chin's position petition process
 
01:58:41.810 --> 01:58:41.820 align:start position:0%
and they cannot go ahead and do so until
 
01:58:43.970 --> 01:58:43.980 align:start position:0%
the judge orders that I'm allowed access
 
01:58:46.729 --> 01:58:46.739 align:start position:0%
to his records again
 
01:58:49.250 --> 01:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
um and again the the court is just
 
01:58:51.050 --> 01:58:51.060 align:start position:0%
continually delaying that so that was
 
01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
one of the prefaces that I wanted to
 
01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
touch base on today
 
01:58:55.440 --> 01:58:56.890 align:start position:0%
touch base on today
um

01:58:56.890 --> 01:58:56.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately again falls back onto my
 
01:59:02.450 --> 01:59:02.460 align:start position:0%
point of last week that dcyf really is
 
01:59:03.770 --> 01:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
to blame
 
01:59:06.709 --> 01:59:06.719 align:start position:0%
for these issues the judge has requested
 
01:59:10.970 --> 01:59:10.980 align:start position:0%
dcyf step in dcyf is refusing to step in
 
01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:13.679 align:start position:0%
for one reason or another I could give
 
01:59:15.530 --> 01:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
you my reasonings the office of the
 
01:59:16.729 --> 01:59:16.739 align:start position:0%
child Abbott could give you their
 
01:59:19.490 --> 01:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
reasonings but that would be unfair at
 
01:59:22.609 --> 01:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
this moment in time to do that
 
01:59:22.619 --> 01:59:23.149 align:start position:0%
this moment in time to do that
um

01:59:23.149 --> 01:59:23.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:25.129 --> 01:59:25.139 align:start position:0%
I will wrap that up there I will take
 
01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
questions on that in one second unless
 
01:59:28.189 --> 01:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
you would like me to answer questions
 
01:59:30.530 --> 01:59:30.540 align:start position:0%
but I do have one other quick point that
 
01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
I did want to make make the quick Point
 
01:59:35.930 --> 01:59:35.940 align:start position:0%
sure thing so to follow up with
 
01:59:38.270 --> 01:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
um child support and whatnot uh child
 
01:59:39.709 --> 01:59:39.719 align:start position:0%
support has been issued for myself
 
01:59:42.229 --> 01:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
pretty much the entire time regardless
 
01:59:44.990 --> 01:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
of the child living with me full-time or
 
01:59:46.729 --> 01:59:46.739 align:start position:0%
not and there's two children involved
 
01:59:46.739 --> 01:59:48.290 align:start position:0%
not and there's two children involved
here

01:59:48.290 --> 01:59:48.300 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:59:51.709 --> 01:59:51.719 align:start position:0%
um currently uh one child is under the
 
01:59:53.990 --> 01:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
custody of the state I am ordered child
 
01:59:56.750 --> 01:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
support to the state but the state does
 
02:00:00.229 --> 02:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
not hold any representation from the
 
02:00:02.510 --> 02:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
court that they are allowed to get
 
02:00:05.149 --> 02:00:05.159 align:start position:0%
restitution for this uh they're the ones
 
02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
that have been delaying
 
02:00:09.950 --> 02:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
um these proceedings to you know whether
 
02:00:13.189 --> 02:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
reunification or termination
 
02:00:14.689 --> 02:00:14.699 align:start position:0%
um so that's one issue that child
 
02:00:17.870 --> 02:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
support seemingly is just being granted
 
02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
as we all know is a mandatory fifty
 
02:00:23.149 --> 02:00:23.159 align:start position:0%
dollars a month regardless
 
02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
02:00:28.070 --> 02:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative katab
 
02:00:29.930 --> 02:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
02:00:33.109 --> 02:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
Gilbert for taking my question so
 
02:00:34.669 --> 02:00:34.679 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit confused here if you
 
02:00:35.689 --> 02:00:35.699 align:start position:0%
could just give like a little bit of
 
02:00:37.609 --> 02:00:37.619 align:start position:0%
background or are these your two
 
02:00:39.169 --> 02:00:39.179 align:start position:0%
children that you're speaking of and
 
02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
you're saying that
 
02:00:43.129 --> 02:00:43.139 align:start position:0%
um one of your children the court has
 
02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
ordered dcyf to take custody of and they
 
02:00:47.390 --> 02:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
haven't is are these your your own
 
02:00:50.030 --> 02:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
children you're speaking of so yeah so
 
02:00:53.270 --> 02:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
the first matter that was notified last
 
02:00:56.689 --> 02:00:56.699 align:start position:0%
week is one child we share this same
 
02:00:58.250 --> 02:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
father same mother for both of these
 
02:00:58.260 --> 02:00:59.870 align:start position:0%
father same mother for both of these
children

02:00:59.870 --> 02:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:01:03.290 --> 02:01:03.300 align:start position:0%
um the child this week is under the
 
02:01:05.149 --> 02:01:05.159 align:start position:0%
guardianship of his grandmother with
 
02:01:07.729 --> 02:01:07.739 align:start position:0%
significant issues of allegations of
 
02:01:10.729 --> 02:01:10.739 align:start position:0%
neglect and abuse going on the court
 
02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
notated to dcyf and has reported to dcy
 
02:01:16.850 --> 02:01:16.860 align:start position:0%
for their own concerns and the pleas
 
02:01:20.510 --> 02:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
from all parties to have respite and
 
02:01:22.810 --> 02:01:22.820 align:start position:0%
residential care for this child
 
02:01:26.689 --> 02:01:26.699 align:start position:0%
and ultimately it lies on dcyf for not
 
02:01:30.350 --> 02:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
providing that at request of myself the
 
02:01:36.589 --> 02:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:36.599 --> 02:01:38.810 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:01:38.810 --> 02:01:38.820 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:01:40.850 --> 02:01:40.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:01:44.629 --> 02:01:44.639 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to clarify you mentioned I
 
02:01:47.450 --> 02:01:47.460 align:start position:0%
believe that this delay in process that
 
02:01:49.970 --> 02:01:49.980 align:start position:0%
you have the child advocate office
 
02:01:52.250 --> 02:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
looking into it as well as the Ombudsman
 
02:01:54.890 --> 02:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
and I want to know what is the Ombudsman
 
02:01:56.990 --> 02:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
office that you're referring to and just
 
02:01:59.570 --> 02:01:59.580 align:start position:0%
confirm that those two offices are
 
02:02:01.490 --> 02:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
reviewing this matter of delay and
 
02:02:03.649 --> 02:02:03.659 align:start position:0%
process thank you
 
02:02:06.109 --> 02:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
so obviously the Ombudsman is the
 
02:02:11.350 --> 02:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman of dcyf uh DHHS a budgetman
 
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
they work closely with the office of the
 
02:02:17.689 --> 02:02:17.699 align:start position:0%
child advocate and obviously I can
 
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
attest that they are involved I met with
 
02:02:24.169 --> 02:02:24.179 align:start position:0%
them last week I meet again with the
 
02:02:27.169 --> 02:02:27.179 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman this week but obviously under
 
02:02:28.970 --> 02:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
their statutory requirements they are
 
02:02:31.010 --> 02:02:31.020 align:start position:0%
not allowed to acknowledge their
 
02:02:33.649 --> 02:02:33.659 align:start position:0%
involvement but they are actively
 
02:02:35.089 --> 02:02:35.099 align:start position:0%
involved they have been since the
 
02:02:37.189 --> 02:02:37.199 align:start position:0%
beginning of this year when significant
 
02:02:39.109 --> 02:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
critical incidents happened in that
 
02:02:43.850 --> 02:02:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:47.169 --> 02:02:47.179 align:start position:0%
listening to your testimony Mr Gilbert
 
02:02:49.669 --> 02:02:49.679 align:start position:0%
I just know from the medical and
 
02:02:51.890 --> 02:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
counseling office of which I'm part-time
 
02:02:55.729 --> 02:02:55.739 align:start position:0%
CEO if one of our professionals
 
02:02:58.129 --> 02:02:58.139 align:start position:0%
is late
 
02:03:02.149 --> 02:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
it is the obligation of the
 
02:03:05.570 --> 02:03:05.580 align:start position:0%
front desk Personnel to let everyone in
 
02:03:09.350 --> 02:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
the waiting room know and know why
 
02:03:13.070 --> 02:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
not just oh she can't be here well
 
02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:14.510 align:start position:0%
not just oh she can't be here well
obviously

02:03:14.510 --> 02:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
but if she had a flat tire or there was
 
02:03:19.970 --> 02:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
a medical emergency that she had to
 
02:03:22.129 --> 02:03:22.139 align:start position:0%
attend to at the hospital or something
 
02:03:24.589 --> 02:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
like that people sort of feel like
 
02:03:27.649 --> 02:03:27.659 align:start position:0%
they're being treated with some respect
 
02:03:30.950 --> 02:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
delays happen that would be correct and
 
02:03:33.950 --> 02:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
so am I hearing if the court says we
 
02:03:37.189 --> 02:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
can't hear it until July
 
02:03:40.910 --> 02:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
one sentence of we are waiting on so and
 
02:03:43.669 --> 02:03:43.679 align:start position:0%
so to do such and such
 
02:03:46.609 --> 02:03:46.619 align:start position:0%
to me doesn't betray confidences Secrets
 
02:03:48.589 --> 02:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
or lack professionalism it treats you
 
02:03:51.470 --> 02:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
with respect and gives you a reason why
 
02:03:54.950 --> 02:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
it's just not they've all gone fishing
 
02:03:56.270 --> 02:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
um could be there's not enough judges
 
02:03:59.109 --> 02:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
we're working on that but it something
 
02:04:03.169 --> 02:04:03.179 align:start position:0%
am I speaking to your point earlier so
 
02:04:05.570 --> 02:04:05.580 align:start position:0%
that would be correct and obviously as
 
02:04:08.629 --> 02:04:08.639 align:start position:0%
noted uh there's a lot going on behind
 
02:04:10.189 --> 02:04:10.199 align:start position:0%
the scenes
 
02:04:12.530 --> 02:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
um as you can imagine
 
02:04:15.890 --> 02:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
um we do have the preface that things
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
are moving for both matters
 
02:04:21.530 --> 02:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
uh but the parties at B are not being
 
02:04:24.350 --> 02:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
that there is those secrecies
 
02:04:26.510 --> 02:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
um and we do feel that it's one in the
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
same uh we do feel that the court is not
 
02:04:30.649 --> 02:04:30.659 align:start position:0%
being fully forthcoming we do feel that
 
02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
the division is not being fully
 
02:04:35.570 --> 02:04:35.580 align:start position:0%
forthcoming in both myself the office of
 
02:04:37.970 --> 02:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
the child advocate and the Ombudsman are
 
02:04:41.390 --> 02:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
fairly on the same path of we need to
 
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
open up these doors we need to stop the
 
02:04:47.330 --> 02:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
secrecies we need to
 
02:04:49.550 --> 02:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
be forthcoming well ultimately it's for
 
02:04:51.950 --> 02:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
these children uh you know these
 
02:04:54.109 --> 02:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
children need to know what's going on in
 
02:04:56.510 --> 02:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
their lives so that they are not
 
02:04:59.510 --> 02:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
adversely reacting to what is going on
 
02:05:01.430 --> 02:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
in their lives
 
02:05:05.089 --> 02:05:05.099 align:start position:0%
would it be fair to say running parallel
 
02:05:06.649 --> 02:05:06.659 align:start position:0%
with this
 
02:05:09.169 --> 02:05:09.179 align:start position:0%
if the judge asks the dcyf to do
 
02:05:09.179 --> 02:05:10.850 align:start position:0%
if the judge asks the dcyf to do
something

02:05:10.850 --> 02:05:10.860 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:05:13.970 --> 02:05:13.980 align:start position:0%
and the dcyf has not done so
 
02:05:16.189 --> 02:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
would it be legitimate for the judge to
 
02:05:19.310 --> 02:05:19.320 align:start position:0%
ask why either we don't think this is
 
02:05:20.990 --> 02:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
anything we should be involved with
 
02:05:22.970 --> 02:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
which then says to the judge go find
 
02:05:24.470 --> 02:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
somebody else who will
 
02:05:26.810 --> 02:05:26.820 align:start position:0%
or we're overworked understaffed
 
02:05:28.609 --> 02:05:28.619 align:start position:0%
underpaid and under loved which is true
 
02:05:30.709 --> 02:05:30.719 align:start position:0%
for all of us
 
02:05:30.719 --> 02:05:32.030 align:start position:0%
for all of us
yeah

02:05:32.030 --> 02:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:32.810 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

02:05:32.810 --> 02:05:32.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:37.729 --> 02:05:37.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:40.089 --> 02:05:40.099 align:start position:0%
so that would be correct uh chairman
 
02:05:42.669 --> 02:05:42.679 align:start position:0%
this is really a push question
 
02:05:46.270 --> 02:05:46.280 align:start position:0%
that that is where my
 
02:05:50.330 --> 02:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
Baseline of what my end testimony and
 
02:05:52.609 --> 02:05:52.619 align:start position:0%
changes for this committee
 
02:05:56.149 --> 02:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
ultimately lies with is we are seeing
 
02:05:56.159 --> 02:05:57.850 align:start position:0%
ultimately lies with is we are seeing
dcyf

02:05:57.850 --> 02:05:57.860 align:start position:0%
dcyf
 
02:06:00.530 --> 02:06:00.540 align:start position:0%
continually the judge is ordering
 
02:06:04.450 --> 02:06:04.460 align:start position:0%
specific things and dcyf is
 
02:06:07.189 --> 02:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
again those prior matters are dcy
 
02:06:09.770 --> 02:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
proposed orders so DC wife is proposing
 
02:06:12.890 --> 02:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
these orders for the court to order
 
02:06:15.109 --> 02:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
we're seeing that dcyf is not following
 
02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
the own orders that they propose
 
02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
and that could be very legitimate
 
02:06:21.530 --> 02:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
reasons why a reasonable person would
 
02:06:23.870 --> 02:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
say yeah you got it right but let's know
 
02:06:28.370 --> 02:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
them exactly thank you thank you if I
 
02:06:30.589 --> 02:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
were and I'm using the subjunctive voice
 
02:06:33.470 --> 02:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
for an English teacher a person with all
 
02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
power I would make this different and
 
02:06:38.510 --> 02:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
maybe we can make recommendations so
 
02:06:41.290 --> 02:06:41.300 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you
 
02:06:44.149 --> 02:06:44.159 align:start position:0%
yes uh sorry I'm sorry I didn't see your
 
02:06:45.229 --> 02:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
hand earlier representative
 
02:06:46.850 --> 02:06:46.860 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon yeah I didn't
 
02:06:48.530 --> 02:06:48.540 align:start position:0%
have it up I was awaiting
 
02:06:51.470 --> 02:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
completion of your intelligencia so uh
 
02:06:53.450 --> 02:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take that as a compliment
 
02:06:55.250 --> 02:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
thank you okay good
 
02:06:57.649 --> 02:06:57.659 align:start position:0%
Mr Gilbert last meeting we had you
 
02:07:00.169 --> 02:07:00.179 align:start position:0%
indicated you've gone through 15 gals
 
02:07:02.570 --> 02:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
and what you proposed not proposed what
 
02:07:05.990 --> 02:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
you got a decision on allegedly today
 
02:07:08.089 --> 02:07:08.099 align:start position:0%
was um
 
02:07:10.910 --> 02:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
02:07:12.589 --> 02:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:07:16.189 --> 02:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
you found a motion to conjoin DC wayf to
 
02:07:18.050 --> 02:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
the custody of a child is that the fact
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
that we eliminate the G8 gal
 
02:07:19.920 --> 02:07:21.770 align:start position:0%
that we eliminate the G8 gal
participation

02:07:21.770 --> 02:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
participation
 
02:07:26.570 --> 02:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
so it would de facto that gal it would
 
02:07:30.290 --> 02:07:30.300 align:start position:0%
then most likely under the the
 
02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
guidelines of 1.69 C it would then
 
02:07:37.609 --> 02:07:37.619 align:start position:0%
represent either a casa worker or
 
02:07:40.250 --> 02:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
another gal or we could go ahead and
 
02:07:42.729 --> 02:07:42.739 align:start position:0%
appoint the child their own attorney
 
02:07:45.709 --> 02:07:45.719 align:start position:0%
which is currently in the process we
 
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
have a motion in that first matter to
 
02:07:50.750 --> 02:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
appoint an attorney that's been waiting
 
02:07:53.330 --> 02:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
for determination since March
 
02:07:55.250 --> 02:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
wait just one follow-up follow-up thank
 
02:07:57.609 --> 02:07:57.619 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman then and and in terms of
 
02:08:01.490 --> 02:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
getting your guidance on what ultimately
 
02:08:03.830 --> 02:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
the committee will consider for
 
02:08:07.129 --> 02:08:07.139 align:start position:0%
real or proposed changes to rules of
 
02:08:07.139 --> 02:08:08.930 align:start position:0%
real or proposed changes to rules of
operation

02:08:08.930 --> 02:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
operation
 
02:08:10.729 --> 02:08:10.739 align:start position:0%
what would you see what do you have in
 
02:08:14.270 --> 02:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
your mind and how to facilitate a more
 
02:08:16.250 --> 02:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
expeditious process
 
02:08:16.260 --> 02:08:17.570 align:start position:0%
expeditious process
if

02:08:17.570 --> 02:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:08:19.550 --> 02:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
if we're not getting like you indicated
 
02:08:21.950 --> 02:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
just a few senses ago dcyf not
 
02:08:24.830 --> 02:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
responding in a timely fashion
 
02:08:27.410 --> 02:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
so again that's something I need to
 
02:08:30.109 --> 02:08:30.119 align:start position:0%
finalize that testimony and written
 
02:08:32.870 --> 02:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
documentation for you and that will be
 
02:08:35.209 --> 02:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
coming so I would appreciate that time
 
02:08:36.770 --> 02:08:36.780 align:start position:0%
to be able to answer that for you in a
 
02:08:36.780 --> 02:08:37.430 align:start position:0%
to be able to answer that for you in a
more

02:08:37.430 --> 02:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:08:39.709 --> 02:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
uh knowledgeable fashion for you and
 
02:08:42.589 --> 02:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
outside of dcyf what time would you
 
02:08:46.070 --> 02:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
speculate that would take place
 
02:08:48.109 --> 02:08:48.119 align:start position:0%
for the work you just said you were
 
02:08:52.490 --> 02:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
going to do oh uh so I Was preparing
 
02:08:53.870 --> 02:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
that for this week there was a lot of
 
02:08:56.629 --> 02:08:56.639 align:start position:0%
issues that uh I I don't think I'm gonna
 
02:08:57.950 --> 02:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
have it ready for next week I believe
 
02:08:59.810 --> 02:08:59.820 align:start position:0%
the following week is Memorial Day
 
02:09:02.330 --> 02:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
weekend is that correct
 
02:09:06.290 --> 02:09:06.300 align:start position:0%
sure yes I I believe it is so so I I
 
02:09:08.629 --> 02:09:08.639 align:start position:0%
would have to say that I would like to
 
02:09:10.550 --> 02:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
get back to you that first week of June
 
02:09:13.850 --> 02:09:13.860 align:start position:0%
uh the committee has notated that they
 
02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
are preparing to possibly here in June
 
02:09:18.350 --> 02:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
as well I I would like until that first
 
02:09:21.410 --> 02:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
week of June we are planning on meeting
 
02:09:24.050 --> 02:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
the 16th and the 23rd of this month
 
02:09:26.330 --> 02:09:26.340 align:start position:0%
we've announced we're taking the day
 
02:09:28.370 --> 02:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
after Memorial Day the day after
 
02:09:31.790 --> 02:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
Memorial Day being the 30th off we so
 
02:09:33.530 --> 02:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
far has said we're probably going to
 
02:09:36.830 --> 02:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
meet June 6 uh 13 it looks like we're
 
02:09:40.010 --> 02:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
trying to arrange a road trip the 20th
 
02:09:41.629 --> 02:09:41.639 align:start position:0%
we might be meeting
 
02:09:45.050 --> 02:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
so that hasn't been set yet but I'm
 
02:09:47.629 --> 02:09:47.639 align:start position:0%
leaning that way and I'm waiting for
 
02:09:49.669 --> 02:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
consensus to build
 
02:09:51.709 --> 02:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
but we can always take written test
 
02:09:54.169 --> 02:09:54.179 align:start position:0%
electronic testimony representative
 
02:09:56.270 --> 02:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
catab that's exactly what I was going to
 
02:09:57.770 --> 02:09:57.780 align:start position:0%
say just that you could always submit it
 
02:10:00.950 --> 02:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
to us electronically you know instead of
 
02:10:02.510 --> 02:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
coming back out if you're having
 
02:10:03.709 --> 02:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
scheduling conflicts you could always
 
02:10:05.570 --> 02:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
email it over to us
 
02:10:07.729 --> 02:10:07.739 align:start position:0%
sure thing thank you I know it's more
 
02:10:10.970 --> 02:10:10.980 align:start position:0%
just uh I'm a very busy person creating
 
02:10:12.410 --> 02:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
a lot of meetings with a lot of
 
02:10:14.810 --> 02:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
officials here in the state
 
02:10:14.820 --> 02:10:16.390 align:start position:0%
officials here in the state
um

02:10:16.390 --> 02:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
so that being said I do think uh again
 
02:10:21.470 --> 02:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
my timeline was a little off there so
 
02:10:23.330 --> 02:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
two weeks out would be the 23rd I do
 
02:10:24.709 --> 02:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
believe I could have that ready for this
 
02:10:27.950 --> 02:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
committee for the 23rd we have 168 hours
 
02:10:30.950 --> 02:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
in the week and two clerks so they each
 
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
work 82 hours a week on this committee
 
02:10:36.589 --> 02:10:36.599 align:start position:0%
alone would you believe so they'll be
 
02:10:45.310 --> 02:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:47.450 --> 02:10:47.460 align:start position:0%
it'll happen
 
02:10:50.270 --> 02:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
oh thank you anything else good
 
02:10:53.089 --> 02:10:53.099 align:start position:0%
uh before we called uh the next witness
 
02:10:56.030 --> 02:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
I want to thank a couple of you uh who
 
02:10:58.430 --> 02:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
maybe you're still here who
 
02:11:00.649 --> 02:11:00.659 align:start position:0%
um basically pulled your pink card
 
02:11:02.689 --> 02:11:02.699 align:start position:0%
because you said you would not be ready
 
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
to give what we need in the format we're
 
02:11:07.609 --> 02:11:07.619 align:start position:0%
receiving it and in the time framework
 
02:11:09.890 --> 02:11:09.900 align:start position:0%
we're setting and you'd like instead to
 
02:11:12.050 --> 02:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
testify next week when you can do that
 
02:11:14.330 --> 02:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
so hip hip hooray thank you
 
02:11:17.689 --> 02:11:17.699 align:start position:0%
now Mr Albrecht are you going to be
 
02:11:20.089 --> 02:11:20.099 align:start position:0%
presenting a specific
 
02:11:23.350 --> 02:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
slice for us to consider
 
02:11:25.790 --> 02:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
according to how we've been doing it or
 
02:11:27.890 --> 02:11:27.900 align:start position:0%
you've got another one because this is
 
02:11:31.189 --> 02:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:33.890 --> 02:11:33.900 align:start position:0%
and the the correct answer is yes sir I
 
02:11:33.900 --> 02:11:35.089 align:start position:0%
and the the correct answer is yes sir I
am

02:11:35.089 --> 02:11:35.099 align:start position:0%
am
 
02:11:37.370 --> 02:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
uh respectfully Mr chair in light of
 
02:11:39.649 --> 02:11:39.659 align:start position:0%
most of the prior testimony I've heard I
 
02:11:42.530 --> 02:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
only wish to add two very short comments
 
02:11:44.450 --> 02:11:44.460 align:start position:0%
that's why you asked for only four
 
02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
minutes that was put in earlier before I
 
02:11:49.129 --> 02:11:49.139 align:start position:0%
heard other people say everything I
 
02:11:52.030 --> 02:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
already wanted to say so it's four or
 
02:11:55.609 --> 02:11:55.619 align:start position:0%
fewer fewer
 
02:11:58.790 --> 02:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
so uh I think Mr Kelly already said it
 
02:12:01.189 --> 02:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
much better than I could so I won't
 
02:12:04.010 --> 02:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
repeat it I think Miss vaidola also said
 
02:12:06.109 --> 02:12:06.119 align:start position:0%
it much better than I could so I won't
 
02:12:08.350 --> 02:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
repeat it the only thing I will repeat
 
02:12:11.930 --> 02:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
is prosecute perjury because they both
 
02:12:14.450 --> 02:12:14.460 align:start position:0%
said it and I think you need to hear it
 
02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:21.470 --> 02:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
to that I will also add only in light of
 
02:12:24.589 --> 02:12:24.599 align:start position:0%
Mr Rinaldi's testimony I think there are
 
02:12:27.050 --> 02:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
a lot of people here who have docket
 
02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
summaries approaching the thickness of
 
02:12:32.570 --> 02:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
his I don't know how many pages it is
 
02:12:36.109 --> 02:12:36.119 align:start position:0%
who would yeah yeah we've got a lot of
 
02:12:39.470 --> 02:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
those and we've got a lot of allegations
 
02:12:42.589 --> 02:12:42.599 align:start position:0%
in those that multiple judicial officers
 
02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
have botched it again allegations
 
02:12:48.350 --> 02:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
and I think a lot of us would like to
 
02:12:49.970 --> 02:12:49.980 align:start position:0%
know and this is a rhetorical question
 
02:12:52.729 --> 02:12:52.739 align:start position:0%
in light of that how do we get
 
02:12:55.850 --> 02:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
a judge Garner to step in and sort of
 
02:12:59.890 --> 02:12:59.900 align:start position:0%
fix it the way Mr Rinaldi
 
02:13:02.629 --> 02:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
that is a topic for us to discuss
 
02:13:05.450 --> 02:13:05.460 align:start position:0%
exactly in the previous iteration of
 
02:13:07.609 --> 02:13:07.619 align:start position:0%
this committee when it was redresses of
 
02:13:10.370 --> 02:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
grievances it was pretty darn case
 
02:13:12.589 --> 02:13:12.599 align:start position:0%
specific people specific with some
 
02:13:15.050 --> 02:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
pretty tough recommendations that had
 
02:13:17.330 --> 02:13:17.340 align:start position:0%
teeth in them we're doing it differently
 
02:13:19.729 --> 02:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
as you know but that does not take away
 
02:13:22.910 --> 02:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
the need and so that is something we
 
02:13:25.910 --> 02:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
need to look at as a committee in my
 
02:13:29.450 --> 02:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
opinion how do people who have a real
 
02:13:33.050 --> 02:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
beef with somebody in the system
 
02:13:36.109 --> 02:13:36.119 align:start position:0%
get Justice we've heard of a judicial
 
02:13:38.390 --> 02:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
review committee we've heard of uh
 
02:13:41.390 --> 02:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
suggestions for at least one other body
 
02:13:44.209 --> 02:13:44.219 align:start position:0%
that's fair game for this Committee in
 
02:13:44.219 --> 02:13:45.069 align:start position:0%
that's fair game for this Committee in
general

02:13:45.069 --> 02:13:45.079 align:start position:0%
general
 
02:13:47.629 --> 02:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
exactly thank you very much I would
 
02:13:49.850 --> 02:13:49.860 align:start position:0%
strongly exhort you to do that and as
 
02:13:52.189 --> 02:13:52.199 align:start position:0%

02:15:35.270 --> 02:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much nothing further from
 
02:15:36.830 --> 02:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
me unless you want to give me a hard
 
02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:39.609 align:start position:0%
me unless you want to give me a hard
time

02:15:39.609 --> 02:15:39.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:42.290 --> 02:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
02:15:44.830 --> 02:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
it's tradition
 
02:15:47.390 --> 02:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
thank you on please just say that I'm
 
02:15:49.970 --> 02:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
not part of that tradition
 
02:15:51.770 --> 02:15:51.780 align:start position:0%
um I'm not interested in giving anyone a
 
02:15:55.729 --> 02:15:55.739 align:start position:0%
hard time I'm interested in defining a
 
02:15:59.330 --> 02:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
problem and identifying Solutions
 
02:16:03.109 --> 02:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
um as to your uh comments about perjury
 
02:16:05.930 --> 02:16:05.940 align:start position:0%
that is certainly nothing that this
 
02:16:05.940 --> 02:16:07.030 align:start position:0%
that is certainly nothing that this
committee

02:16:07.030 --> 02:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:16:09.350 --> 02:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
will enter
 
02:16:15.950 --> 02:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
committed that is not for us to decide
 
02:16:21.709 --> 02:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
and you know that what I do want to know
 
02:16:23.569 --> 02:16:23.579 align:start position:0%
from you because you've
 
02:16:25.970 --> 02:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time thinking about this
 
02:16:28.450 --> 02:16:28.460 align:start position:0%
is what are your positive
 
02:16:32.870 --> 02:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations to this committee about
 
02:16:35.990 --> 02:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
how improvements can be made in the
 
02:16:39.589 --> 02:16:39.599 align:start position:0%
Family Court one that I believe you have
 
02:16:44.049 --> 02:16:44.059 align:start position:0%
talked about is transparency
 
02:16:47.889 --> 02:16:47.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:51.790 --> 02:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
one that you've alluded to is
 
02:16:55.190 --> 02:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
accountability knowing
 
02:16:57.889 --> 02:16:57.899 align:start position:0%
who is to be held Academy for what has
 
02:16:59.929 --> 02:16:59.939 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
02:16:59.939 --> 02:17:00.770 align:start position:0%
to happen
um

02:17:00.770 --> 02:17:00.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:03.469 --> 02:17:03.479 align:start position:0%
one that's been alluded to is the need
 
02:17:06.709 --> 02:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
for consistent training
 
02:17:06.719 --> 02:17:08.349 align:start position:0%
for consistent training
and

02:17:08.349 --> 02:17:08.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:17:11.690 --> 02:17:11.700 align:start position:0%
oversight of that training I mean these
 
02:17:13.910 --> 02:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
are these are things that we
 
02:17:16.910 --> 02:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
legitimately can recommend but you've
 
02:17:20.330 --> 02:17:20.340 align:start position:0%
given it a lot of thought what else
 
02:17:24.709 --> 02:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
do you see that we could recommend
 
02:17:29.870 --> 02:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
either for to the court or that the
 
02:17:34.509 --> 02:17:34.519 align:start position:0%
legislature take action on
 
02:17:38.209 --> 02:17:38.219 align:start position:0%
I think first and foremost I would be
 
02:17:40.429 --> 02:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
grateful if every member of this
 
02:17:40.439 --> 02:17:41.690 align:start position:0%
grateful if every member of this
committee

02:17:41.690 --> 02:17:41.700 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:17:46.310 --> 02:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
viewed the loss of a parent the ability
 
02:17:49.790 --> 02:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
of someone to parent their child as a
 
02:17:53.929 --> 02:17:53.939 align:start position:0%
sanction worse than imprisonment
 
02:17:56.990 --> 02:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
and in many individual cases perhaps
 
02:17:59.629 --> 02:17:59.639 align:start position:0%
that sanction is warranted
 
02:17:59.639 --> 02:18:00.709 align:start position:0%
that sanction is warranted
but

02:18:00.709 --> 02:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:18:04.969 --> 02:18:04.979 align:start position:0%
indeed it is a sanction in my opinion
 
02:18:07.250 --> 02:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
worse than imprisonment
 
02:18:10.549 --> 02:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
and in criminal cases by way of contrast
 
02:18:13.009 --> 02:18:13.019 align:start position:0%
to family law cases if there are
 
02:18:15.770 --> 02:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
allegations of wrongdoing and I would
 
02:18:19.610 --> 02:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
refer you to article 14 or 15 and 15 of
 
02:18:21.830 --> 02:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
the State Constitution criminal
 
02:18:24.169 --> 02:18:24.179 align:start position:0%
defendants get to hear in no uncertain
 
02:18:28.129 --> 02:18:28.139 align:start position:0%
terms very explicitly what it is that
 
02:18:31.429 --> 02:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
they alleged to have done wrong
 
02:18:34.370 --> 02:18:34.380 align:start position:0%
whereas in family law
 
02:18:36.469 --> 02:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
I think you heard a lot of testimony
 
02:18:38.290 --> 02:18:38.300 align:start position:0%
earlier today
 
02:18:41.629 --> 02:18:41.639 align:start position:0%
where people feel that decisions were
 
02:18:45.709 --> 02:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
made arbitrarily where even upon the
 
02:18:48.770 --> 02:18:48.780 align:start position:0%
filing of emotion for clarification they
 
02:18:50.690 --> 02:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
don't understand
 
02:18:53.810 --> 02:18:53.820 align:start position:0%
but it is that they're even alleged to
 
02:18:55.849 --> 02:18:55.859 align:start position:0%
have done
 
02:18:55.859 --> 02:18:57.709 align:start position:0%
have done
um

02:18:57.709 --> 02:18:57.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:59.870 --> 02:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
we may be going a little I could even
 
02:19:01.250 --> 02:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
point you
 
02:19:05.770 --> 02:19:05.780 align:start position:0%
to a specific statute or say 173b
 
02:19:09.410 --> 02:19:09.420 align:start position:0%
uh Roman numerals six it says the
 
02:19:11.750 --> 02:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
courtial state I
 
02:19:13.549 --> 02:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
I can't read my own writing but to
 
02:19:13.559 --> 02:19:15.250 align:start position:0%
I can't read my own writing but to
paraphrase

02:19:15.250 --> 02:19:15.260 align:start position:0%
paraphrase
 
02:19:18.410 --> 02:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
uh at the request of an agreed party in
 
02:19:21.110 --> 02:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
writing the reasons for its decision
 
02:19:23.629 --> 02:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
I would allege with frequency that's not
 
02:19:23.639 --> 02:19:24.650 align:start position:0%
I would allege with frequency that's not
happening

02:19:24.650 --> 02:19:24.660 align:start position:0%
happening
 
02:19:27.190 --> 02:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
even when it's spelled out
 
02:19:30.589 --> 02:19:30.599 align:start position:0%
uh in a motion for clarification
 
02:19:32.990 --> 02:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:19:35.389 --> 02:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
I think we need to raise the standard
 
02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
and have a presumption
 
02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:39.530 align:start position:0%
and have a presumption
of

02:19:39.530 --> 02:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:19:43.730 --> 02:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
uh 50 50 equal shared parenting again a
 
02:19:43.740 --> 02:19:45.310 align:start position:0%
uh 50 50 equal shared parenting again a
presumption

02:19:45.310 --> 02:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
presumption
 
02:19:49.310 --> 02:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
whereby if that's not happening
 
02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:50.929 align:start position:0%
whereby if that's not happening
uh

02:19:50.929 --> 02:19:50.939 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:19:53.090 --> 02:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
one of the litigants should come up with
 
02:19:55.370 --> 02:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
some very good reasons why
 
02:19:58.130 --> 02:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
and then the judge has discretion but
 
02:20:01.130 --> 02:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing that judges have far too
 
02:20:02.690 --> 02:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
much discretion
 
02:20:05.030 --> 02:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
children are being
 
02:20:07.690 --> 02:20:07.700 align:start position:0%
sent out of state
 
02:20:10.870 --> 02:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
all of these allegations are coming up
 
02:20:13.790 --> 02:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
based on
 
02:20:16.670 --> 02:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
the emotional demeanor
 
02:20:18.889 --> 02:20:18.899 align:start position:0%
of someone in court
 
02:20:21.650 --> 02:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
and you lose your children for that
 
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
raise the standard
 
02:20:27.770 --> 02:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
if you're going to lose your children
 
02:20:31.490 --> 02:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
make it Crystal Clear what somebody did
 
02:20:35.389 --> 02:20:35.399 align:start position:0%
wrong and why they are subject to such
 
02:20:38.750 --> 02:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:40.790 --> 02:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and that's very
 
02:20:42.830 --> 02:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
helpful well if I could if I could
 
02:20:44.809 --> 02:20:44.819 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:20:47.690 --> 02:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
um we I think all of us on the committee
 
02:20:52.730 --> 02:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
understand that it is likely that in
 
02:20:56.750 --> 02:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
close to half of the cases that the
 
02:21:01.309 --> 02:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
family court hears in in these matters
 
02:21:01.319 --> 02:21:03.530 align:start position:0%
family court hears in in these matters
um

02:21:03.530 --> 02:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:06.650 --> 02:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
well in close to all of the cases that
 
02:21:08.469 --> 02:21:08.479 align:start position:0%
the family court hears in this matter
 
02:21:11.690 --> 02:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
half of the people
 
02:21:14.809 --> 02:21:14.819 align:start position:0%
are unhappy
 
02:21:14.819 --> 02:21:15.710 align:start position:0%
are unhappy
um

02:21:15.710 --> 02:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:18.170 --> 02:21:18.180 align:start position:0%
we live in a society where we think of
 
02:21:20.870 --> 02:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
things as wins and losses and we don't
 
02:21:23.270 --> 02:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
quite understand the gray areas in
 
02:21:23.280 --> 02:21:25.010 align:start position:0%
quite understand the gray areas in
between

02:21:25.010 --> 02:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
between
 
02:21:25.020 --> 02:21:28.450 align:start position:0%
between
um

02:21:28.450 --> 02:21:28.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:31.550 --> 02:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
the cases that have come
 
02:21:34.610 --> 02:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
before us are not cases that are coming
 
02:21:37.429 --> 02:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
in in an appeal they're certainly not
 
02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
cases which are being presented to us
 
02:21:42.250 --> 02:21:42.260 align:start position:0%
with both sides
 
02:21:45.889 --> 02:21:45.899 align:start position:0%
explaining their position nor should
 
02:21:48.889 --> 02:21:48.899 align:start position:0%
they be because we are not a trial
 
02:21:52.250 --> 02:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
we are not an appeal court we are a
 
02:21:53.809 --> 02:21:53.819 align:start position:0%
legislative body
 
02:21:57.950 --> 02:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
so what I'm trying to get from you
 
02:22:02.690 --> 02:22:02.700 align:start position:0%
is what we can do in the legislature to
 
02:22:06.349 --> 02:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
make sure that the court best meets the
 
02:22:08.630 --> 02:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
need of all of our citizens and you've
 
02:22:09.889 --> 02:22:09.899 align:start position:0%
given us
 
02:22:16.690 --> 02:22:16.700 align:start position:0%
some examples it's not a question of us
 
02:22:21.110 --> 02:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
recognizing the the seriousness of this
 
02:22:23.330 --> 02:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
matter I think every one of us on this
 
02:22:23.340 --> 02:22:24.610 align:start position:0%
matter I think every one of us on this
committee

02:22:24.610 --> 02:22:24.620 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:22:27.889 --> 02:22:27.899 align:start position:0%
understood that before we agreed to be
 
02:22:30.889 --> 02:22:30.899 align:start position:0%
on this committee that's not something
 
02:22:34.389 --> 02:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
that we need to be convinced of
 
02:22:38.750 --> 02:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
but where do we go from here
 
02:22:41.990 --> 02:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
is what we're trying to figure out we
 
02:22:44.929 --> 02:22:44.939 align:start position:0%
are not going to review your cases we're
 
02:22:48.050 --> 02:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
not going to change the outcome what we
 
02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
are looking at is the system itself are
 
02:22:54.950 --> 02:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
there things that we can do we certainly
 
02:22:57.349 --> 02:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
know we need more judges
 
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
we certainly know that we need
 
02:23:04.190 --> 02:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
additional Revenue to pay for those
 
02:23:04.200 --> 02:23:05.330 align:start position:0%
additional Revenue to pay for those
judges

02:23:05.330 --> 02:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
judges
 
02:23:08.950 --> 02:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
we've had examples today of other
 
02:23:11.389 --> 02:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
expenditures that might very well
 
02:23:14.450 --> 02:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
improve the situation including the
 
02:23:17.469 --> 02:23:17.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have social workers
 
02:23:20.690 --> 02:23:20.700 align:start position:0%
involved in cases in a way that
 
02:23:24.590 --> 02:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
differentiates themselves from gals or
 
02:23:28.670 --> 02:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
guardians or Casa or any of the others
 
02:23:31.910 --> 02:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
all that we've heard now what we need
 
02:23:35.210 --> 02:23:35.220 align:start position:0%
we've certainly heard that training is
 
02:23:35.220 --> 02:23:36.010 align:start position:0%
we've certainly heard that training is
not

02:23:36.010 --> 02:23:36.020 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:23:39.050 --> 02:23:39.060 align:start position:0%
consistent and that oversight is not
 
02:23:39.060 --> 02:23:40.370 align:start position:0%
consistent and that oversight is not
consistent

02:23:40.370 --> 02:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
02:23:43.250 --> 02:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
that is something that this legislature
 
02:23:46.370 --> 02:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
can clearly require
 
02:23:49.130 --> 02:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
of the judicial branch without violating
 
02:23:51.110 --> 02:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
the separation
 
02:23:51.120 --> 02:23:53.210 align:start position:0%
the separation
but

02:23:53.210 --> 02:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:23:57.889 --> 02:23:57.899 align:start position:0%
it does us it doesn't bring us forward
 
02:24:00.889 --> 02:24:00.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:03.889 --> 02:24:03.899 align:start position:0%
the very serious concerns that you all
 
02:24:07.070 --> 02:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
have because we understand that you have
 
02:24:09.050 --> 02:24:09.060 align:start position:0%
real concerns
 
02:24:12.830 --> 02:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
we need to know now what
 
02:24:15.830 --> 02:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
and the now what isn't going to include
 
02:24:17.990 --> 02:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
a reversal
 
02:24:20.809 --> 02:24:20.819 align:start position:0%
of your of your court cases not through
 
02:24:23.030 --> 02:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
us that would have to happen someplace
 
02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:25.429 align:start position:0%
us that would have to happen someplace
else

02:24:25.429 --> 02:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:29.650 --> 02:24:29.660 align:start position:0%
you are organizing so successfully
 
02:24:32.929 --> 02:24:32.939 align:start position:0%
people who believe they have not been
 
02:24:36.670 --> 02:24:36.680 align:start position:0%
treated fairly by the court
 
02:24:40.309 --> 02:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
and you know I I see your emails I know
 
02:24:42.349 --> 02:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
the people you've brought here and
 
02:24:46.490 --> 02:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
you've been diligent about that
 
02:24:46.500 --> 02:24:47.690 align:start position:0%
you've been diligent about that
but

02:24:47.690 --> 02:24:47.700 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:24:50.450 --> 02:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
if we just rehash
 
02:24:52.550 --> 02:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
the concerns
 
02:24:55.610 --> 02:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
that might be good to have given you you
 
02:24:58.309 --> 02:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
know an opportunity to rehash them but
 
02:25:00.830 --> 02:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't bring us forward
 
02:25:05.750 --> 02:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
and when I I really hope from you
 
02:25:09.530 --> 02:25:09.540 align:start position:0%
is a reflection on what
 
02:25:13.309 --> 02:25:13.319 align:start position:0%
given all the concerns how can we make
 
02:25:16.309 --> 02:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
the system better
 
02:25:18.830 --> 02:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
I think a full answer to that question
 
02:25:22.490 --> 02:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
for me might be best done in writing not
 
02:25:24.290 --> 02:25:24.300 align:start position:0%
ad-libbed in front of this committee
 
02:25:26.950 --> 02:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
that would be terrific
 
02:25:29.990 --> 02:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that and and
 
02:25:33.590 --> 02:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your for your concerns uh
 
02:25:36.889 --> 02:25:36.899 align:start position:0%
but is one brief preview I would Echo
 
02:25:38.510 --> 02:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
your sentiment
 
02:25:41.090 --> 02:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
uh if we could get rid of the winners
 
02:25:44.210 --> 02:25:44.220 align:start position:0%
and losers and have more winners and
 
02:25:44.220 --> 02:25:45.670 align:start position:0%
and losers and have more winners and
winners

02:25:45.670 --> 02:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
winners
 
02:25:48.889 --> 02:25:48.899 align:start position:0%
clear in convincing evidence
 
02:25:53.330 --> 02:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
of abuse that would be a wonderful thing
 
02:25:55.490 --> 02:25:55.500 align:start position:0%
I was to thank the vice chair for a
 
02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
wonderful wonderful wrap-up at the end
 
02:26:03.469 --> 02:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
of a long and busy day when you submit
 
02:26:03.479 --> 02:26:04.990 align:start position:0%
of a long and busy day when you submit
paper

02:26:04.990 --> 02:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
paper
 
02:26:09.830 --> 02:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
or Electronics to the committee it does
 
02:26:12.410 --> 02:26:12.420 align:start position:0%
not automatically go into the committee
 
02:26:12.420 --> 02:26:13.550 align:start position:0%
not automatically go into the committee
file

02:26:13.550 --> 02:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
file
 
02:26:16.550 --> 02:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
I have to vet it or I may ask my vice
 
02:26:18.830 --> 02:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
chair to vet it and if it is something
 
02:26:20.690 --> 02:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
that we believe should be in the
 
02:26:23.990 --> 02:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
permanent file then it will be given the
 
02:26:25.670 --> 02:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
clearance to the clerk to place it
 
02:26:28.130 --> 02:26:28.140 align:start position:0%
accordingly that statement that I make
 
02:26:30.830 --> 02:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of every week's
 
02:26:34.490 --> 02:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
committee meeting says that we do not
 
02:26:37.250 --> 02:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
have to put it in the file It ultimately
 
02:26:41.630 --> 02:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
becomes my discretion to do so so you
 
02:26:43.429 --> 02:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
send this you can send that to me you
 
02:26:45.770 --> 02:26:45.780 align:start position:0%
can send that to all of us I'll look it
 
02:26:49.790 --> 02:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
over if it is as promised you know it'll
 
02:26:51.650 --> 02:26:51.660 align:start position:0%
go into that file
 
02:26:53.929 --> 02:26:53.939 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:26:57.469 --> 02:26:57.479 align:start position:0%
30 seconds representative long thank you
 
02:26:59.510 --> 02:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman yeah with
 
02:27:01.429 --> 02:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
respect to winners and losers I was
 
02:27:04.190 --> 02:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
never a winner or loser my child was and
 
02:27:07.670 --> 02:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
and I I look for what the child wins or
 
02:27:11.210 --> 02:27:11.220 align:start position:0%
loses not what a parent wins or loses
 
02:27:14.210 --> 02:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
representative mcbash thank you I just
 
02:27:16.010 --> 02:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
wanted to follow up I believe that you
 
02:27:20.090 --> 02:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
cited a um the statute RSA 173 B Roman
 
02:27:22.030 --> 02:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
numeral 6 when you were talking about
 
02:27:24.650 --> 02:27:24.660 align:start position:0%
transparency of judges and what they
 
02:27:26.270 --> 02:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
needed to provide in their orders yes
 
02:27:29.090 --> 02:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
that 173b is actually a domestic
 
02:27:31.010 --> 02:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
violence statute that is correct so
 
02:27:33.469 --> 02:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
that's not what judges are Family Court
 
02:27:36.170 --> 02:27:36.180 align:start position:0%
judges are determining child
 
02:27:36.180 --> 02:27:37.030 align:start position:0%
judges are determining child
um

02:27:37.030 --> 02:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:39.770 --> 02:27:39.780 align:start position:0%
paranormal responsibilities on was there
 
02:27:41.150 --> 02:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
a different statute that you wanted to
 
02:27:43.570 --> 02:27:43.580 align:start position:0%
cite in regard to that or
 
02:27:47.150 --> 02:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
uh respectfully I believe judges are
 
02:27:49.010 --> 02:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
making parental decisions all of the
 
02:27:51.770 --> 02:27:51.780 align:start position:0%
time in the context of DV cases and it's
 
02:27:54.590 --> 02:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
a huge problem and respectfully that
 
02:27:56.750 --> 02:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
actually was the Statute I was referring
 
02:27:59.090 --> 02:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
to because they don't explain why orders
 
02:28:02.330 --> 02:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
are issued or extended adequately and it
 
02:28:05.330 --> 02:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
Cycles right back to by way of contrast
 
02:28:07.790 --> 02:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
in a criminal case people get to hear
 
02:28:10.010 --> 02:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
exactly what they're alleged to have
 
02:28:14.290 --> 02:28:14.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:18.469 --> 02:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you and with that I
 
02:28:21.070 --> 02:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
close the special
 
02:28:29.270 --> 02:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
