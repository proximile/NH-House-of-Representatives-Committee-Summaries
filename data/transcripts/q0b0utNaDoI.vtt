would like to ask representative Bel to
 
00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 align:start position:0%

with liberty and justice for
 
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
all I want to remind everyone of our
 
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
mission we are a bipartisan committee
 
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
tasked with investigating and evaluating
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
the state's response to the covid-19
 
00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
pandemic the committee will function in
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
a science-based fact-f finding review
 
00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:34.599 align:start position:0%
specifically acquiring comprehensive
 
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
accurate data and all related
 
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
information pertaining there to areas of
 
00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
particular Focus will include the
 
00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
administration of federal guidance
 
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
acceptance of federal funds and
 
00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
implementation of emergency use
 
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080 align:start position:0%
authorization vaccination efforts a
 
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
report will be issued outlining the
 
00:06:57.869 --> 00:06:57.879 align:start position:0%
committee's findings and the impact on
 
00:06:59.869 --> 00:06:59.879 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 align:start position:0%
um this morning we are supposed to have
 
00:07:05.869 --> 00:07:05.879 align:start position:0%
uh uh someone coming in to testify and
 
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
we are missing some other committee
 
00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
members but currently uh there is a
 
00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
parade going on outside so I do believe
 
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
some of our people have been delayed but
 
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
I did not want to delay this hearing uh
 
00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:21.919 align:start position:0%
for the public I think we uh the who is
 
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
the people that are here will'll uh have
 
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
a small discussion about we learned
 
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
yesterday um and uh
 
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
for me it
 
00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
was transformational I I will say I had
 
00:07:35.599 --> 00:07:37.029 align:start position:0%
was transformational I I will say I had
no

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
idea that anything and I mean any
 
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine listed as a childhood vaccine
 
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:46.120 align:start position:0%
gets complete
 
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
immunity no damages ever can be filed um
 
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
from my understanding and if anyone else
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
got the a different impression um and as
 
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
it was stated there is no other product
 
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
out there that has immunity from
 
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
damages and our children are extremely
 
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
important uh represent
 
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:12.280 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you madam chair and and to
 
00:08:13.869 --> 00:08:13.879 align:start position:0%
further clarify that as
 
00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:15.629 align:start position:0%
further clarify that as
well

00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:15.639 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
damages are capped um at a relatively
 
00:08:23.309 --> 00:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
low amount but it's it's that damages
 
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
pursued against the government against a
 
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
government agency for any harm that was
 
00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:34.919 align:start position:0%
incurred and the same government agency
 
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
that is tasked with
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
regulating and that is also tasked with
 
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
um as a
 
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
policy uh
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
promoting the um the vaccine so in terms
 
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
of a product you have you have the same
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
agency involved in in
 
00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:55.160 align:start position:0%
promoting in
 
00:08:58.069 --> 00:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
regulating and in defending the
 
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
government against any claims of Damages
 
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
because the uh the the manufacturers
 
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:08.200 align:start position:0%
themselves are immunized from any damage
 
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
which as we learned the the threat of
 
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and it's certainly true I think
 
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
that there have been times in this
 
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
nation where things have been a bit too
 
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
litigious but generally speaking the the
 
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
threat of financial um loss is is what
 
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
keeps businesses honest and it it is a
 
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:31.160 align:start position:0%
primary mechanism for um Market forces
 
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:35.240 align:start position:0%
to ensure things such as safety and
 
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
efficacy um thank you represent Bel I I
 
00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
agree with that and and you know one of
 
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:42.200 align:start position:0%
the Striking things
 
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
is the government is supposed to
 
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.790 align:start position:0%
is the government is supposed to
protect

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
protect
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
us they're supposed to be our protectant
 
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
and yet in this case they are not they
 
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
are the
 
00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
promoter um and they are the ones that
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
we the anyone filing damages actually
 
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
has to Sue I mean that is contrary to
 
00:10:08.949 --> 00:10:08.959 align:start position:0%
everything else that we stand for um in
 
00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:11.079 align:start position:0%
my opinion
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
because congressmen Senators legislators
 
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
we are the Servants of the people and
 
00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
people need to be reminded of that that
 
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
they are in charge we are only here at
 
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
their pleasure and we serve at their
 
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
Penza yeah
 
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you um Madam chair and I just
 
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to comment kind of what
 
00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
you when you first said that because um
 
00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
you that you weren't aware um I've been
 
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
very well aware for a long time in
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
regards with the 1986 act that uh
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
President Reagan had signed and um and
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
so I knew uh of the level of um immunity
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
that big Pharma had but I think the most
 
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
important thing that we have to talk
 
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
about here um from yesterday is all of
 
00:11:07.389 --> 00:11:07.399 align:start position:0%
the information that was
 
00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
given it was given to use traditional
 
00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:15.639 align:start position:0%
vaccines to do a comparison like so we
 
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:18.440 align:start position:0%
could understand where we were at with
 
00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
anything that had to do with covid and
 
00:11:23.069 --> 00:11:23.079 align:start position:0%
and that it was so and there were times
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
where we stayed on that subject of
 
00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
traditional for you know quite some time
 
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
to to really lay the groundwork for
 
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
where we were at with Co and in addition
 
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
to co it's more than just a blanket
 
00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:39.079 align:start position:0%
immunity there were contracts that were
 
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
signed they protected by the prep act um
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
I knew all of that but to the
 
00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
extent of those contracts and what was
 
00:11:54.509 --> 00:11:54.519 align:start position:0%
signed um I didn't know to that and it
 
00:11:54.519 --> 00:11:55.670 align:start position:0%
signed um I didn't know to that and it
was

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
um it was that piece there in in
 
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.150 align:start position:0%
um it was that piece there in in
realizing

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:01.160 align:start position:0%
realizing
 
00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.710 align:start position:0%
realizing
that

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:06.269 --> 00:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
damages death suffering
 
00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:10.279 align:start position:0%
injuries that no one when it comes to
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
covid um emergency youth authorization
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
injections they have absolutely no way
 
00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:22.519 align:start position:0%
to get any sort of
 
00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:26.519 align:start position:0%
compensation damages relief at all and
 
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
that was that's absolutely debilitating
 
00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.710 align:start position:0%
that was that's absolutely debilitating
to

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
hear represent
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair and I
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
was I was repeatedly shocked by a number
 
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
of the things that we um we were told
 
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
and we saw
 
00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:44.839 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh not the least of which
 
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
being um that in clinical trials for
 
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
miners for the MRNA I believe it was the
 
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.670 align:start position:0%
miners for the MRNA I believe it was the
fizer

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
fizer
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
injection that a young woman who was
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
enrolled in the clinical trials
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
suffered what appeared to be
 
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
devastating um injury it is alleged to
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
have been because of the um
 
00:13:13.389 --> 00:13:13.399 align:start position:0%
vaccine um but in any case it it does
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
appear that the corporation
 
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
involved failed to report that injury
 
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
that occurred in a clinical
 
00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
trial um to the regulators and it it it
 
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
it really brings up a bigger question to
 
00:13:33.389 --> 00:13:33.399 align:start position:0%
to me which
 
00:13:35.629 --> 00:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
is why
 
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
are the clinical
 
00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839 align:start position:0%
trials being
 
00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
run by the
 
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:49.240 align:start position:0%
companies themselves as opposed to some
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
sort of third
 
00:13:55.749 --> 00:13:55.759 align:start position:0%
party yes well um speaking of that well
 
00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
F uh two points um was that
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
the regulator the investigator said he
 
00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:05.430 align:start position:0%
the regulator the investigator said he
didn't

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
feel he didn't do it scientifically he
 
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
just didn't feel that it was
 
00:14:16.749 --> 00:14:16.759 align:start position:0%
related well you know I didn't feel like
 
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
getting up this morning too early and so
 
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
I you know what if I just didn't feel
 
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:23.240 align:start position:0%
like coming
 
00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
here I mean we don't feel when we're
 
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with science and we don't feel
 
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
when we're dealing with people's lives
 
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
facts the other thing is is when you
 
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
independent there is an independent
 
00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:42.519 align:start position:0%
board but what we
 
00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
learned is that one of the people on
 
00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
that independent board was paid by
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
fizer and although she said well yeah I
 
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
was paid but I can still be
 
00:14:57.069 --> 00:14:57.079 align:start position:0%
independent but there but then there
 
00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
goes to bias you can't be independent of
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
somebody if you are involved in that
 
00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:07.399 align:start position:0%
industry even you have to remove your
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
everything has to be removed for it to
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
be truly an independent
 
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
person there's all we all bring a bias
 
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.350 align:start position:0%
person there's all we all bring a bias
with

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
us you know every single person has a
 
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
bias but to be involved with the people
 
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
that you're
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
investigating goes beyond
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to speak to um
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
representative belcher's
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
beyond there really is no question I
 
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
mean after the injection it was almost
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
immediately what this this girl suffered
 
00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
which was a client of the speaker and
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
but then our own government agencies
 
00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.389 align:start position:0%
but then our own government agencies
also

00:15:57.389 --> 00:15:57.399 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
participated in non not having that
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
information come out so once they were
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
made aware still people didn't know
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
about it and I think that was really
 
00:16:13.949 --> 00:16:13.959 align:start position:0%
really hard as well as he didn't get
 
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
into some of these details but I will
 
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
put in the record as well during
 
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:20.990 align:start position:0%
put in the record as well during
clinical

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
clinical
 
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
trials the um the deaths that
 
00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
occurred uh most people didn't hear
 
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
about any of that information and there
 
00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
is um I believe one person that has come
 
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
forward with uh their child that passed
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
and because of that I think it would be
 
00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
really good for people to to realize if
 
00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0%
that information had been free and open
 
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
that's in that's that shows informed
 
00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
consent people have to understand um
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
that the risks when they doing something
 
00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
uh even though I know this this was put
 
00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
out because a lot of people were very
 
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:07.720 align:start position:0%
afraid uh when it came to the
 
00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959 align:start position:0%
pandemic but at least that they would
 
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:start position:0%
have they would have known they would
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
have had that information they would
 
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
have had
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
Choice as I say all the time where there
 
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:19.640 align:start position:0%
is risk there needs to be choice but
 
00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
nothing representative
 
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:31.240 align:start position:0%
leus one of of the things following on
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
with that same case that really
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
Disturbed me was the abuse she took
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
afterwards so here's a young lady who
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
thought she was helping
 
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
Society healthy young lady thought she'd
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
volunteer for these trials Not only was
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
she harmed not only did the harms get
 
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
covered up anytime she said people were
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
actually abusive to her on social media
 
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
Etc if she told her story they took it
 
00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
down they said it was misinformation and
 
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
stuff like that I mean
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
that's it it's
 
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
disgusting uh on represent
 
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you madam chair and I I
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
just wanted to speak a little bit to the
 
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
the issue surrounding uh government
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
regulation and
 
00:18:24.149 --> 00:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
oversight of of pharmaceutical
 
00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
Industries in general um and I believe I
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
I mentioned the record yesterday that
 
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
the uh the FDA
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner um that exists that that
 
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
there was some difficulties with um as
 
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
she was being placed in that role there
 
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
was a letter writing campaign from um
 
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
moneyed interests in pharmaceutical
 
00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
Industries to get her place in that
 
00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
position the gentleman uh by the last
 
00:18:53.149 --> 00:18:53.159 align:start position:0%
name of markx M rks that they uh
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
reportedly had quite a few issues with I
 
00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:57.640 align:start position:0%
looked up his um his background on the
 
00:19:00.149 --> 00:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
FDA website he did come from the
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical industry where he went
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
then to research universities of course
 
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
they hold a lot of patents therefore a
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
lot of money interest before moving on
 
00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
to the FDA being placed in that position
 
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:14.200 align:start position:0%
where he's in an oversight role over
 
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
this I'm seeing in various reports
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
suggesting that around 45% of the total
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
FDA budget comes from industry user fees
 
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
AKA from the pharmaceutical industry
 
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:26.200 align:start position:0%
specifically the drug division of the
 
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:29.720 align:start position:0%
FDA is financed to the tune of around
 
00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:33.559 align:start position:0%
75% by the pharmaceutical industry and
 
00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
what's noteworthy is there is no
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
Prohibition in law or in any sort of
 
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
binding ethics guidelines that prohibit
 
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
um a person from going back and forth
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
between a pharmaceutical or research
 
00:19:47.919 --> 00:19:48.990 align:start position:0%
between a pharmaceutical or research
industry

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
role over to the regulatory side and
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
then back again creating what seems to
 
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:04.919 align:start position:0%
Ard representative
 
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
leus another
 
00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
interesting thing from yesterday was the
 
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:13.240 align:start position:0%
graphs of all death
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
mortality and if you looked at what it
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
was during the height of covid when so
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
many people were reported as dying from
 
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
covid and then you looked at after the
 
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
vaccines were
 
00:20:32.789 --> 00:20:32.799 align:start position:0%
introduced and it was higher after the
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
vaccines were introduced than it was at
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
Co the another thing that was glaringly
 
00:20:45.789 --> 00:20:45.799 align:start position:0%
shocking to me and I know this is a
 
00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
little aside from Co but Co has been now
 
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
listed as a childhood vaccine I do
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
believe if I am if I understood
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
everything correctly so now it uh
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
has the immunity of the
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
1986 vaccine act but was the number of
 
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
vaccines that have that children are now
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
between the ages of zero and I think it
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
was 6 months or 12
 
00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
months in the past it was five and now
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
it's I didn't even couldn't even count
 
00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:27.919 align:start position:0%
the total uh on the slide um literally I
 
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
would have been sitting here pointing my
 
00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:31.480 align:start position:0%
finger about for you know trying to
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
count those it was just
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
outrageous you know
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
have what's changed why do we need to be
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
so heavily vaccinated and from in this
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
newborn when they're they're growing in
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
their immune system is adapting to their
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
surroundings and how do you build up an
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
chance represent leus following on with
 
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
that the thing that I think the thing
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
that struck me the most was when he was
 
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
comparing the difference between the
 
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine into in industry and the regular
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
um medical medicine
 
00:22:32.909 --> 00:22:32.919 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical industry and he and he
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
listed the top
 
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
medicines and how many
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
years they were under
 
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
study in before they came to Market and
 
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
then he got to
 
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines and they were days you know
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
five days that they tracked these
 
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
individuals and said oh you know no
 
00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
problems in five days well all five days
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
is going to give you as if there's an
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
immediate an
 
00:23:03.149 --> 00:23:03.159 align:start position:0%
actic you know there's not much but 5
 
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
days yeah it's fine it's safe no
 
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
problem well I am really looking forward
 
00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039 align:start position:0%
to the vsafe data that um and really
 
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
analyzing some of those slides that he
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
why and this was this is my big
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
why when they initially were going to do
 
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
studies the FDA was going to do one and
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
the CDC was going to do
 
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
another but after they got the reports
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
from the P I believe it was a
 
00:23:46.669 --> 00:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
prr not sure if I'm saying that
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
correctly thank you represent beler for
 
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
that the flags
 
00:23:59.630 --> 00:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
were exponentially higher than than what
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
they thought they were going to be and
 
00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:03.990 align:start position:0%
they thought they were going to be and
they

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
changed and said yeah we're just not
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
going to do this uh do it this way
 
00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
anymore we're going to follow the FDA
 
00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:13.640 align:start position:0%
now we have two separate
 
00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:18.440 align:start position:0%
agencies one is policy one is
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
oversight going to do the same
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
report they should be doing two
 
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
different reports so that we understand
 
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
that we're getting the best out of that
 
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
but so why when you set your criteria
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
for science when you're doing a science
 
00:24:41.389 --> 00:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
experiment you lay out how you're going
 
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
to do it you don't change it Midstream
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
don't unless you don't unless you want
 
00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
to manipulate the data and you don't
 
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.630 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:03.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
Penza so I wanted to speak um Madam
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
chair just to follow up on what you said
 
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
in regards with what changed um in
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
regards with the childhood schedule and
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
the biggest thing that changed
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
was if prior
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
to the 1986 I call it 1986 the ACT if
 
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
expanded safety protocols vetting
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
clinical trials all of that in
 
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
that people were were able to go
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
after you know a company that was
 
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
producing something that caused their
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
their child
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
harm of course you're going to have only
 
00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
a a you know only a small amount
 
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
that are based upon
 
00:26:05.149 --> 00:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
need but vaccines are a huge industry
 
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
they are billions of dollars I mean as
 
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
we all have probably seen there's a
 
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
there's a video of Bill Gates that talks
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
about it and he said that was one of the
 
00:26:17.549 --> 00:26:17.559 align:start position:0%
best investments that he ever got into
 
00:26:22.669 --> 00:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
was in um vaccines so if you see that
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
it's money-making and then there's you
 
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
strip out you strip out um um liability
 
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
then what are you left with
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
exponentially increases increases
 
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
increases over
 
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:44.200 align:start position:0%
time and it's very sad especially
 
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
with lack of
 
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
oversight reports that were supposed to
 
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
be done mandated by the government that
 
00:26:52.909 --> 00:26:52.919 align:start position:0%
were never
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
done we have we have statements that are
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
made by agencies
 
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
NOS nonprofits all of these that are
 
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
supposed to be in the in the health
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
field that are saying such and such
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
Doesn't cause this and they're saying
 
00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
these things definitively saying that
 
00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
there's been numerous studies D dada and
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
there isn't any studies that say that
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
it's that kind of stuff is just in a
 
00:27:24.669 --> 00:27:24.679 align:start position:0%
sense it's it's lies it's propaganda and
 
00:27:27.549 --> 00:27:27.559 align:start position:0%
and most people believe that and and we
 
00:27:28.909 --> 00:27:28.919 align:start position:0%
have our own
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
our own government here locally that
 
00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
that perpetuates that as well and and
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
those things are so concerning but we
 
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:40.360 align:start position:0%
are that the graphic that he showed was
 
00:27:42.669 --> 00:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
the first year of life it went up to 12
 
00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
months so there's another graphic that
 
00:27:49.509 --> 00:27:49.519 align:start position:0%
shows all the way it shows further and
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
it went from you know whatever five to
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
you know there's like I think now on the
 
00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
schedule to include the multiples like
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
the multiple shots to is got you know
 
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
CO's on the schedule with the CDC it's
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
not on the schedule in New
 
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but our New Hampshire office
 
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
links right to the CDC and those are all
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
offered so I believe that you're
 
00:28:20.029 --> 00:28:20.039 align:start position:0%
seeing exponentially to include flu it's
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
it's over 70
 
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%
injections so from like five in 1980 you
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
know prior to 198 86 all the way up to
 
00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:33.640 align:start position:0%
that and um and we're not promoting what
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
we should be prevention in health and
 
00:28:40.269 --> 00:28:40.279 align:start position:0%
supplements lifestyle all of those
 
00:28:42.509 --> 00:28:42.519 align:start position:0%
things it's it's incredible to me
 
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
there's so many things that came out of
 
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday it was so long it was it was
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
such an incredible presentation I'd love
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
to capture that up and I'd want the
 
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
entire legislature um everyone in the
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
state to watch that because it was it
 
00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
was so incredible and and in um and it
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter this is not this is not a
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
political thing this is about about
 
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
people having this information because
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
they should I know I was elected to
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
protect the rights of New Hampshire
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
citizens and this is the kind of stuff
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
that we should be listening to as
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
legislators because it is so impactful
 
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
like punch you in the face like oh my
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
gosh how could this
 
00:29:29.509 --> 00:29:29.519 align:start position:0%
happen so you know we we have you know
 
00:29:31.509 --> 00:29:31.519 align:start position:0%
our mission is covid right and the
 
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
emergency use authorization
 
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
know based on what we
 
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
saw before they rolled out the vsafe
 
00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
checklist of
 
00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
symptoms they already
 
00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.029 align:start position:0%
symptoms they already
knew

00:29:54.029 --> 00:29:54.039 align:start position:0%
knew
 
00:29:57.789 --> 00:29:57.799 align:start position:0%
myocarditis uh heart you know death they
 
00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:01.039 align:start position:0%
had had all of those things listed and
 
00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
they removed every single one of them
 
00:30:07.549 --> 00:30:07.559 align:start position:0%
from the checklist for
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
vsafe and yet nobody in the public was
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
privy to that
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
list because
 
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
we as I believe it was representative
 
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
Penza stated yesterday we did drive up
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
injections where people given a list of
 
00:30:34.149 --> 00:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
effects our parents given a list of
 
00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:46.269 --> 00:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
vaccine informed
 
00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919 align:start position:0%
consent means you have been informed and
 
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
then you
 
00:30:56.909 --> 00:30:56.919 align:start position:0%
consent and he is right that if we do do
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
not educate our elves and are not
 
00:31:02.909 --> 00:31:02.919 align:start position:0%
informed and we put our
 
00:31:06.629 --> 00:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
trust in our doctors and in our medical
 
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
professionals and in the people that are
 
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
at the top of our government and we
 
00:31:16.269 --> 00:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
saying we instilled fear in this country
 
00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.710 align:start position:0%
 
state

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:31:29.549 --> 00:31:29.559 align:start position:0%
exponentially the mental health of
 
00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
alone we're going to be dealing with for
 
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:41.549 --> 00:31:41.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
afraid yes covid was a horrible
 
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.190 align:start position:0%
afraid yes covid was a horrible
horrible

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:52.629 --> 00:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
pandemic but this committee needs to
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
figure out a way for the next pandemic
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
on what is best for New Hampshire City
 
00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
cens how do we going
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
forward make
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
sure that everybody is listened
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
to and that the proper professionals are
 
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:14.120 align:start position:0%
brought in on each
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
subject and that there is truly an
 
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
independent board
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:27.320 align:start position:0%
data we know that medical professionals
 
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
do not
 
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
understand mask that we
 
00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
learned there are Specialists that deal
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
with just
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
that we know that social distancing was
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
an arbitrary
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
science but yet the public was led to
 
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
believe whether intentionally or not
 
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
or whether they even stated it but it
 
00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:02.559 align:start position:0%
was said so everyone said well this is
 
00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:09.389 --> 00:33:09.399 align:start position:0%
do we could go grocery shopping we could
 
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
do certain things if you had a place of
 
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
employment that was considered essential
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
you could go to
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
home for me during that time I was
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:33.679 --> 00:33:35.350 align:start position:0%
 
understand

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
why things were shut down why we
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't go outside I remember having to
 
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
go to a wedding outside and it was like
 
00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:46.360 align:start position:0%
well we're really not supposed to go to
 
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
a have a wedding outside because there's
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.509 --> 00:33:58.519 align:start position:0%
outside I think somewhere in all of this
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
Common Sense did not
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
Prevail and I thought I think we
 
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:13.399 align:start position:0%
interaction Solitude is not a good thing
 
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
for us we are social
 
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
creatures and by making
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
children stay
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
home by
 
00:34:29.069 --> 00:34:29.079 align:start position:0%
themselves with no interaction with
 
00:34:29.079 --> 00:34:30.710 align:start position:0%
themselves with no interaction with
their

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
travesty covering up their faces so they
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
Communications teachers can't really you
 
00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:48.919 align:start position:0%
can say one thing but your face can say
 
00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
something completely different
 
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
child there are cues that teachers take
 
00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
from seeing the child's
 
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
face or how they
 
00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
too I understand that we did the Swiss
 
00:35:14.589 --> 00:35:14.599 align:start position:0%
cheese approach to throw everything at
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
it to see what we could
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
do but did anyone before they did that
 
00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:23.240 align:start position:0%
stop to
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
think about all the other harms that
 
00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
and I think during the next pandemic the
 
00:35:34.589 --> 00:35:34.599 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we really need to
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
consider is because in in my I'm not a
 
00:35:40.829 --> 00:35:40.839 align:start position:0%
medical professional but I've always
 
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:48.510 align:start position:0%
 
harm

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
harm
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if we took that into
 
00:35:56.309 --> 00:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
belra Madam chair I want to comment
 
00:36:09.069 --> 00:36:09.079 align:start position:0%
on you know aund things that you just
 
00:36:12.349 --> 00:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
said but I'm going to start with
 
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
um the list that was
 
00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
known specifically for emergency youth
 
00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
authorization injections the list that
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
was known from the big companies fizer
 
00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
and madna
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
they knew these in
 
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
November possibly earlier but we saw you
 
00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:37.640 align:start position:0%
know we saw a slide that showed
 
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
that and that none of the public knew
 
00:36:46.109 --> 00:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
about that and only until lawsuits
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
released and I'm not we we should put
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
that on the record when the lawsuits
 
00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
released specifically for fizer
 
00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
documents nine
 
00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
pages of all of the different side
 
00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:02.200 align:start position:0%
effects no one knew any of that but the
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
ones that they did know which were big
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
uh pericarditis you know all of that um
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
and it was a long
 
00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
list and for them to come out with be
 
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
safe and have things like fever nauseous
 
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
like those things are not they're not
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
critical and they should have had you
 
00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
know the radio buttons on vsafe with
 
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:35.560 align:start position:0%
those other and they didn't um but that
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
all comes to the whole piece of informed
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
consent and so when we were
 
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
using you massive amounts we you know
 
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
this whole uptick of trying to get
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
everyone you know in the state injected
 
00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:53.839 align:start position:0%
and and people were they were horrible
 
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
to each
 
00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
other um say saying you know did you get
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
you know have you been vaccinated have
 
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:01.240 align:start position:0%
you been vaccinated oh my gosh I mean
 
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
just asking random people you'd walk
 
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
into a store and people would ask if
 
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
you're it was crazy there was no such
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
thing as as personal medical privacy
 
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
anymore there was nothing it was out the
 
00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
window but I know for a fact from a
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
pharmacist that there was
 
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely zero informed
 
00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
consent at a pharmacy uh this is a very
 
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
large Pharmacy actually a chain
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
um there was no handout that gave that
 
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
list that he was talking about that the
 
00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies knew
 
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
were specific adverse serious adverse
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
side effects that's informed consent and
 
00:38:50.829 --> 00:38:50.839 align:start position:0%
they knew that information from their 6
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
months or so of clinical
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
trials that is it right there that's to
 
00:38:59.710 --> 00:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
me where the rubber meets the road
 
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
there's no questions asked everyone
 
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
should have had that information so for
 
00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:06.200 align:start position:0%
every Mall every you know New Hampshire
 
00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
Motor Speedway drive-thru every single
 
00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
person before they had an injection in
 
00:39:14.309 --> 00:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
their arm should have had a piece of
 
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:17.720 align:start position:0%
paper that said you need to
 
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
know in a sense that you are part of
 
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
this massive experiment because they are
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
because we didn't have enough data to
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
know what was going to
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
happen so they were in a sense part of a
 
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
clinical trial and they should have
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
known hey this is what we know right now
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
we're still moving forward with this
 
00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
it's under emergency use it's not
 
00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
authorized all of the you all the data
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
is not out but you have to know before
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
you do this and not any of those people
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
did and I don't know what those numbers
 
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
are here in New Hampshire we have 1.4
 
00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
million people last I knew we were in
 
00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
the we were up WS of when this was all
 
00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
going on in 2021 and
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
2022 um when people were getting first
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
shot second shot and boosters uh it was
 
00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
we were close to I believe 80% of in the
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
State 70 possibly 80% that were um that
 
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
had been injected at that
 
00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:23.839 align:start position:0%
point so to me that is with no informed
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
consent these people were going into
 
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
something blind they were you know a lot
 
00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:31.839 align:start position:0%
of people were fear had fear some of
 
00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
them were if they had to keep their job
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
were bullied or shamed or whatever into
 
00:40:38.589 --> 00:40:38.599 align:start position:0%
getting it and it was awful I remember
 
00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
talking to I need to get her name
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
because I'd love her to come testify um
 
00:40:44.109 --> 00:40:44.119 align:start position:0%
a police
 
00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
officer and even though that they were
 
00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
protected here in the state see that's
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
the key you know nobody they say oh well
 
00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
they weren't forced whatever but it was
 
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
like they were
 
00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
forced cuz if you were the the only one
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
in your department that
 
00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:05.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't how they were treated was awful
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
she was shamed and bullied by other by
 
00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:11.030 align:start position:0%
she was shamed and bullied by other by
upper

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
management especially with masking and
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
things like that it was just it was
 
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
awful and so she succumbed to it and
 
00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
she's vaccine injured young woman
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't think she's ever going to be
 
00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
able to have children now horrible story
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
there's some of us that ran for office
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
because of this and and from hearing
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
these stories and I'm one of them and um
 
00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:36.200 align:start position:0%
but just listening to that to me I think
 
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
more than anything else and I'd like to
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
know what our state knew did our state
 
00:41:47.309 --> 00:41:47.319 align:start position:0%
know those serious adverse effects and
 
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
we did not in our massive efforts of
 
00:41:56.109 --> 00:41:56.119 align:start position:0%
giving everyone injected did we not
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
provide that information
 
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:04.349 --> 00:42:04.359 align:start position:0%
public represent
 
00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:07.079 align:start position:0%
Bela thank you madam chair and I would
 
00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
tend to uh concur with all I've heard
 
00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
thus far here and I would like to go a
 
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
little deeper into some things and talk
 
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
about perhaps propose some things that
 
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
we might consider um we do have albeit
 
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
not total we do have some power and some
 
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
Authority given our circumstance at the
 
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
moment and I think we should consider
 
00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
utilizing some of it in order to
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
properly do this some things I'd like us
 
00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
to look at if we would agree would be to
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
uh send out some questions to certain
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
parties to see if we can get some
 
00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
answers specifically I would like to see
 
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
us send some questions to uh pertinent
 
00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:48.750 align:start position:0%
us send some questions to uh pertinent
Federal

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
Regulators as well as uh certain
 
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical um corporations who were
 
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
involved in some of the data we found
 
00:42:57.309 --> 00:42:57.319 align:start position:0%
out yesterday I would like to find out
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
some specific information I would like
 
00:43:04.109 --> 00:43:04.119 align:start position:0%
to um I would like to request access to
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
the entirety of data from the vs
 
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
analysis and the vsafe analysis as well
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
as all methodologies used to determine
 
00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:15.710 align:start position:0%
as all methodologies used to determine
safety

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
signals I would like to ask them point
 
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
blank when was the first time you became
 
00:43:28.829 --> 00:43:28.839 align:start position:0%
aware that a safety signal existed
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
using either or both methods that were
 
00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
outlined for um the vaccines in
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
question I would like to request
 
00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
information from the pharmaceutical
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
companies as to why they decided to
 
00:43:47.309 --> 00:43:47.319 align:start position:0%
immediately vaccinate the control group
 
00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
after approximately two months over the
 
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
preferences that were expressed by the
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
Food and Drug Administration now there's
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
limited we obviously are a little
 
00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:00.839 align:start position:0%
Limited in trying to um trying to obtain
 
00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:02.680 align:start position:0%
this information if it is not something
 
00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
that's willingly given but I think
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
there's no harm whatsoever in trying to
 
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
receive this
 
00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
information uh beyond that we have a
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
little more power when it comes to this
 
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
but I would like to find out if any New
 
00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Regulators or executive
 
00:44:22.349 --> 00:44:22.359 align:start position:0%
Personnel had access to any of these
 
00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:25.880 align:start position:0%
data um when it comes to the vaccines in
 
00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
real or near real time as it was rolled
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
out I would like to know if DHHS had
 
00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
access to these databases if they were
 
00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:37.160 align:start position:0%
aware of any safety signals that existed
 
00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
or were being exceeded um and if so when
 
00:44:43.069 --> 00:44:43.079 align:start position:0%
they became aware of them I would like
 
00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
to know now what they believe as in
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
terms of these safety signals and the
 
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
methodologies that were being used by
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
the FDA and
 
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
CDC and I would like to ask them what
 
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
their current opinion is on the safety
 
00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
and and efficacy um of the vaccines
 
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
especially the MRNA vaccines in question
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
given the data that we've seen from
 
00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.630 align:start position:0%
given the data that we've seen from
yesterday

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
um on to the next item uh yesterday I
 
00:45:14.549 --> 00:45:14.559 align:start position:0%
had my mind repeatedly blown by a lot of
 
00:45:17.069 --> 00:45:17.079 align:start position:0%
this data that came out um a lot of my
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
own personal understandings and
 
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
narratives were challenged in some of
 
00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
the information I'm still working
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
through it it's going to take some time
 
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
but now I'd like to return the favor and
 
00:45:27.309 --> 00:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
blow up a few narratives myself so I'd
 
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:31.480 align:start position:0%
like to read into the record quickly not
 
00:45:34.589 --> 00:45:34.599 align:start position:0%
in total just by um by
 
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:38.760 align:start position:0%

after receiving vaccines or other items
 
00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:14.200 align:start position:0%
that uh had to do with covid and

government actions during
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
covid um they even had analysis of
 
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
techniques to use to automate the
 
00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:26.119 align:start position:0%
process of targeting narratives as they
 
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:27.640 align:start position:0%
were developing before they could take
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
off and Achieve any sort of um social
 
00:47:35.309 --> 00:47:35.319 align:start position:0%
hold as well as putting out information
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
that was um their preferred narrative
 
00:47:40.829 --> 00:47:40.839 align:start position:0%
that appears in hindsight to have been
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
patently false um and again this is this
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
is an official government document from
 
00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:48.200 align:start position:0%
the federal government can you
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
see that oh sure this uh this was from
 
00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:55.160 align:start position:0%
June 26 2023 this particular report
 
00:47:56.829 --> 00:47:56.839 align:start position:0%
could you forward that to the committee
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
abely it will be forwarded to the
 
00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
committee um so that's one interesting
 
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
thing that I think deserves to be looked
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
at a little bit and even more recently
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
just in this last week I would like to
 
00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:09.839 align:start position:0%
also read into the record and these ones
 
00:48:11.309 --> 00:48:11.319 align:start position:0%
I have already sent to the
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
committee um based on the
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
report of the another report from the
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
United States House of
 
00:48:22.109 --> 00:48:22.119 align:start position:0%
Representatives titled an evaluation of
 
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
the evidence surrounding Eco Health
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
Alliance Incorporated research
 
00:48:25.359 --> 00:48:27.270 align:start position:0%
Alliance Incorporated research
activities

00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
activities
 
00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
um this report of May 1st
 
00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:35.720 align:start position:0%
2024 documents the um extreme violations
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
of policy and perhaps law I would argue
 
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
um by the corporation Eco Health
 
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
Alliance this was a described as an
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
intermediary or pass through
 
00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:49.720 align:start position:0%
Organization for Grant making they
 
00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
received taxpayer funds from the United
 
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
States federal government for which to
 
00:48:57.630 --> 00:48:57.640 align:start position:0%
then make grants according to United
 
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
States law and policy set forth by the
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
NIH and FDA um um research what for for
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
folks what is the NIH the National
 
00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
Institutes of Health which is the
 
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
organization that had been run by um
 
00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
Anthony fouchy or perhaps still is I'm
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
not did he retire I'm not sure we'll
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
find that out
 
00:49:21.309 --> 00:49:21.319 align:start position:0%
um anyway this organization was a pass
 
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
the organization that makes grants for
 
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
medical research now uh gain of function
 
00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
research uh is something that is
 
00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
prohibited under federal law as being
 
00:49:35.549 --> 00:49:35.559 align:start position:0%
excessively dangerous and what it does
 
00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
is it involves
 
00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
taking uh pathogens such as viruses and
 
00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:45.079 align:start position:0%
manipulating their genomes and their
 
00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
characteristics such that they gain
 
00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
functions that they in theory might
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
someday come to gain through natural
 
00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
processes but they through this
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
non-natural selective process that they
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
engineer um caused them to gain uh
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
rapidly things such as increased virence
 
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
in increased transmissibility the
 
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
ability to jump from Human to
 
00:50:14.349 --> 00:50:14.359 align:start position:0%
human um representative Bel Belcher
 
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't that one of the questions I
 
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
believe and I'm not positive that was
 
00:50:22.829 --> 00:50:22.839 align:start position:0%
circulating out there during covid that
 
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
people were saying was you know thought
 
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
that this might be a gain of function
 
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
indeed and this this significantly this
 
00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
report plays into that question because
 
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
it was asked of a number of people
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
during various Congressional testimonies
 
00:50:36.549 --> 00:50:36.559 align:start position:0%
whether there was gain of function
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
research funded at the Wuhan Institute
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
of virology in Wuhan China by the uh
 
00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
organization Eco Health Alliance as an
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
intermediary from the National
 
00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
Institutes of Health the answer was
 
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
given as no there was no gain of
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
function research however this report
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
finds that that testimony was not
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
accurate there was gain of function
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
research funded by the United States
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayers through the intermediary Eco
 
00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:05.960 align:start position:0%
Health Alliance against federal law in a
 
00:51:09.549 --> 00:51:09.559 align:start position:0%
foreign military laboratory the uh Wuhan
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
Institute of virology is a military
 
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
laboratory of the people's Liberation
 
00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
Army of the Chinese Communist Party um
 
00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
is Dr fouchi associated with either the
 
00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
National Institute of Health or the
 
00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
equal Alliance yes uh Dr fouchi was um
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps still is but he certainly was um
 
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
the head of the NIH and and the the
 
00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:31.240 align:start position:0%
individual who would have ultimately
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
been responsible for
 
00:51:37.309 --> 00:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
approving um such Grant making he held a
 
00:51:41.309 --> 00:51:41.319 align:start position:0%
lot of money um available to him to make
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh grants to uh other entities with so
 
00:51:47.309 --> 00:51:47.319 align:start position:0%
they would have been approved um whether
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
or not he specifically approved funding
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
to The Institute of virology or the
 
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
Wuhan Institute is another story because
 
00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:55.160 align:start position:0%
there's some suggestion here that this
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
was sort of something that was being
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
done by Eco Health Alliance um perhaps
 
00:52:01.549 --> 00:52:01.559 align:start position:0%
without the knowledge of the federal
 
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
government or perhaps with it's hard to
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's hard to know exactly but they were
 
00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
nonetheless in violation of Law and as a
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
result of this
 
00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
Services office of the secretary
 
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
Washington DC in this letter dated uh
 
00:52:18.549 --> 00:52:18.559 align:start position:0%
where is it
 
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
bottom I don't see a date I'll find the
 
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
date but it's from the last rough
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
roughly weak um they have noticed the
 
00:52:32.829 --> 00:52:32.839 align:start position:0%
suspension and proposed debarment of
 
00:52:35.309 --> 00:52:35.319 align:start position:0%
Ecco Health Alliance from any further
 
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
receipt of taxpayer funding as an
 
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
intermediary to fund these um various
 
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
medical research programs based on their
 
00:52:48.589 --> 00:52:48.599 align:start position:0%
gross violation and not just violation
 
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
but this details how they repeatedly
 
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
requested information during the covid
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic of Ecco Health Alliance because
 
00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
there were allegations that were
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
considered credible that the Wuhan
 
00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:03.400 align:start position:0%
Institute of virology developed the SARS
 
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
cove2 virus in their laboratory from
 
00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:08.200 align:start position:0%
which it spilled and that that funding
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
may have been paid for by the American
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
taxpayer through Eco Health Alliance Eco
 
00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
Health Alliance stonewalled this
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
investigation refusing to provide the
 
00:53:19.549 --> 00:53:19.559 align:start position:0%
documents that would have demonstrated
 
00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
the truth or the falsity of this claim
 
00:53:23.549 --> 00:53:23.559 align:start position:0%
and that's the reason for their uh
 
00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:25.480 align:start position:0%
suspension and dis Department do we know
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
how much money has been given to that
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
organization I'm sure we can find that
 
00:53:31.109 --> 00:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
out I don't have it off top of my head
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
here um I just want to say something
 
00:53:35.069 --> 00:53:35.079 align:start position:0%
about the social media aspect that you
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
were talking about
 
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
now you know people say oh yeah you're
 
00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
being censored on I mean I don't use
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
social media so I'm very illiterate when
 
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
it comes to that so you know we're being
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
censored on Facebook or we're being
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
censored on Twitter or um whatever other
 
00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:57.400 align:start position:0%
social media is out there um and you
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
know I'd say well you know maybe a
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
little you know maybe somebody's doing
 
00:54:01.559 --> 00:54:04.030 align:start position:0%
little you know maybe somebody's doing
something

00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:07.109 align:start position:0%
something
offensive

00:54:07.109 --> 00:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:10.589 --> 00:54:10.599 align:start position:0%
however we have heard testimony after
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
testimony in this committee and I have
 
00:54:19.549 --> 00:54:19.559 align:start position:0%
heard numerous complaints from
 
00:54:23.549 --> 00:54:23.559 align:start position:0%
constituents on how they can no longer
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
post on something or their posts are
 
00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
being taken taken down or you can't
 
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:37.829 --> 00:54:37.839 align:start position:0%
etc we are supposed to be a free country
 
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
and freedom of
 
00:54:46.109 --> 00:54:46.119 align:start position:0%
speech is our First Amendment
 
00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
right I understand that our
 
00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
distinguished guests yesterday said that
 
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
they are private companies and they can
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
do what they
 
00:54:55.319 --> 00:54:57.630 align:start position:0%
do what they
want

00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:57.640 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
ever if they're going to censor our
 
00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
first amendment rights they should put
 
00:55:05.109 --> 00:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
that in
 
00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
there right at when you're signing up
 
00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
that we have the right and maybe it's in
 
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
the small fine
 
00:55:15.309 --> 00:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
print but they should list what type of
 
00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
speech they're going to
 
00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:20.920 align:start position:0%
censor not just arbitrarily oh this time
 
00:55:22.349 --> 00:55:22.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to censor this type of
 
00:55:23.589 --> 00:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
speech and tomorrow we're going to
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
censor that type of speech because what
 
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
what I find when people are censoring
 
00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
things or prohibiting things and you
 
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
know I'll just use an analogy I told my
 
00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:37.549 align:start position:0%
know I'll just use an analogy I told my
children

00:55:37.549 --> 00:55:37.559 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
once my son said you know Mom mosquitoes
 
00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
outlawed I said you know that makes
 
00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:46.839 align:start position:0%
perfect sense I I think that's a great
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
idea I said
 
00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:51.400 align:start position:0%
however what if someone said snakes
 
00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:53.839 align:start position:0%
should be outlawed and you like snakes
 
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
well that wouldn't be very good I said
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
see how it
 
00:56:01.309 --> 00:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
works you may not think something is
 
00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
good and should be outlawed and somebody
 
00:56:06.349 --> 00:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
else will say yeah I agree with you but
 
00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:08.440 align:start position:0%
then eventually they'll get around to
 
00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:13.240 align:start position:0%
what you think should stay and they want
 
00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:18.760 align:start position:0%
outlawed it's pretty simple um he got it
 
00:56:21.309 --> 00:56:21.319 align:start position:0%
represent Bela representative leus first
 
00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:56:26.589 --> 00:56:26.599 align:start position:0%
representative thank you I think trust
 
00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
is the thing
 
00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
um or the destruction of trust I think
 
00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
is going to be is and is going to be
 
00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
much more harmful in the future than a
 
00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
lot of other things my dad told me when
 
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
I was a little
 
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
girl that as long as you always told the
 
00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
truth people would always trust whatever
 
00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
you said and there would be a time when
 
00:56:54.589 --> 00:56:54.599 align:start position:0%
yeah what you said might be doubtful but
 
00:56:56.029 --> 00:56:56.039 align:start position:0%
if you were known for always telling the
 
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
truth truth you would be
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
believed but if you only once told a lie
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
that trust would take a really long time
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
of telling the truth to come
 
00:57:08.079 --> 00:57:10.069 align:start position:0%
of telling the truth to come
back

00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
because ever after that people would be
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
like but is this one of those times
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
right and unfortunately what we've seen
 
00:57:23.109 --> 00:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
throughout this whole pandemic and with
 
00:57:25.829 --> 00:57:25.839 align:start position:0%
testimony that we've gotten is there was
 
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
an awful lot
 
00:57:33.029 --> 00:57:33.039 align:start position:0%
of sometimes overt lies and sometimes
 
00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
just lies through
 
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
Omission um misleading
 
00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:40.630 align:start position:0%
Omission um misleading
information

00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
and like for instance with the young
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
lady we were talking about who had wait
 
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
darn she had a feeding tube she was in a
 
00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
wheelchair all kinds of things and that
 
00:58:08.349 --> 00:58:08.359 align:start position:0%
was that was part of the trials right
 
00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
and those were the injuries that were
 
00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
almost immediately obvious and she
 
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
continued downhill and how did it get
 
00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
reported abdominal
 
00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
pain abdominal pain she's got a feeding
 
00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
tube she's in wheelchair she can't do
 
00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:26.799 align:start position:0%
anything and it's abdominal pain but
 
00:58:29.029 --> 00:58:29.039 align:start position:0%
and oh I'm sorry not only that
 
00:58:32.029 --> 00:58:32.039 align:start position:0%
represented leus it wasn't just that she
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
had abdominal pain it was that the
 
00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:37.839 align:start position:0%
investigator said he didn't
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
feel that it was related didn't feel
 
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
when it happened almost immediately yes
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
but but um the idea that covid came from
 
00:58:54.109 --> 00:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
a lab right I knew that in
 
00:58:56.789 --> 00:58:56.799 align:start position:0%
2019 that information was put out
 
00:58:59.309 --> 00:58:59.319 align:start position:0%
shortly after it went out I read There
 
00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:01.240 align:start position:0%
were links to the Papers written by the
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
doctor who created it there were paper
 
00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
Paths of the money that was given to
 
00:59:09.870 --> 00:59:09.880 align:start position:0%
them there were documents as to the fact
 
00:59:13.029 --> 00:59:13.039 align:start position:0%
that that lab was not secure and ran the
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
risk of of um Biologicals getting out
 
00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:19.960 align:start position:0%
all that information was there and that
 
00:59:21.789 --> 00:59:21.799 align:start position:0%
the Chinese government when they found
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
out that they had succeeded said shut it
 
00:59:26.910 --> 00:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
all down get rid of it all
 
00:59:28.589 --> 00:59:28.599 align:start position:0%
that was in
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
2019 and then to have the federal
 
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
government our government
 
00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:37.240 align:start position:0%
including fouchi from the NIH who was in
 
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
charge of giving that
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
money to that
 
00:59:45.789 --> 00:59:45.799 align:start position:0%
organization right because it had to go
 
00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
through him um oh no it was natural and
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
all of that I mean it was supposedly a
 
00:59:55.789 --> 00:59:55.799 align:start position:0%
conspiracy theory that nothing more than
 
00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
that that it was manufactured but we
 
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
already knew that I saw that evidence in
 
01:00:04.029 --> 01:00:04.039 align:start position:0%
2019 so I remember when they were saying
 
01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
that I was like what the heck are they
 
01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:07.640 align:start position:0%
talking about they know where this came
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
from I know where this came from and it
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
thing and thing and thing after that I
 
01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
had read a I had a there was a um study
 
01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
that hospital had
 
01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:24.680 align:start position:0%
done about why ventilators were not the
 
01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:27.400 align:start position:0%
proper response and how it could
 
01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:30.440 align:start position:0%
actually be killing people and what they
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
were doing research they found a lot of
 
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
clots and stuff they found that vitamin
 
01:00:37.549 --> 01:00:37.559 align:start position:0%
C massive vitamin C would help prevent
 
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
that all kinds of information I posted
 
01:00:45.549 --> 01:00:45.559 align:start position:0%
that not a commentary on it the study
 
01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
and got
 
01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:49.240 align:start position:0%
misinformation and that got the link to
 
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
that disappeared Etc that was facts that
 
01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:54.200 align:start position:0%
people needed to know that was a real
 
01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
study by a real Hospital that would
 
01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
potentially have saved people's lives
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
but it was being shut down it was not
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
being distributed and why do you think
 
01:01:04.319 --> 01:01:06.109 align:start position:0%
being distributed and why do you think
that

01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
is uh if I had to make a guess I'd say
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
money that's what we keep seeing follow
 
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
the money follow the money somebody was
 
01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:01:20.829 --> 01:01:20.839 align:start position:0%
benefit like for instance if there was
 
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
no treatment and that's another thing
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
all these treatments that these doctor
 
01:01:28.109 --> 01:01:28.119 align:start position:0%
doctors were finding and coming up with
 
01:01:31.549 --> 01:01:31.559 align:start position:0%
and we've heard from medical doctors Etc
 
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
the treatments iorc and hydro
 
01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
hydro whatever you know what I'm saying
 
01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.789 align:start position:0%
hydro whatever you know what I'm saying
hydroxy

01:01:39.789 --> 01:01:39.799 align:start position:0%
hydroxy
 
01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
chloroquin treatments that were
 
01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:45.160 align:start position:0%
working and yet that became a no no you
 
01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't say that you'd lose your
 
01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:49.640 align:start position:0%
license etc etc pharmacists couldn't
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
even have it in you know to fill
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
prescriptions and that also I mean I
 
01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
think that was because while they made
 
01:02:00.589 --> 01:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of money on vaccines and
 
01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
some of the other treatments new
 
01:02:06.269 --> 01:02:06.279 align:start position:0%
treatments that they came up with and if
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
we had had treatments that would work we
 
01:02:12.349 --> 01:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
could not have done an
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
eua we could not have allowed that vac
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
those vaccines they would not have been
 
01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:22.950 align:start position:0%
those vaccines they would not have been
Lial

01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
Lial
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
free because we had another
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
treatment as long as we had another
 
01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
treatment we couldn't do that and here's
 
01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
my problem with all of
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
that we may have another pandemic in the
 
01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:41.480 align:start position:0%
future who's going to
 
01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
believe what should be done right and
 
01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:47.480 align:start position:0%
that's the big harm that I see in
 
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
telling all these lie after lie after
 
01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
lie not only were people
 
01:02:56.349 --> 01:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
killed or died who didn't need to be
 
01:02:59.069 --> 01:02:59.079 align:start position:0%
if we have in the future a pandemic that
 
01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:00.559 align:start position:0%
is very
 
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
dangerous much more so than this proved
 
01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.910 align:start position:0%
dangerous much more so than this proved
to

01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
be um who's going to
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
listen when they say do this or don't do
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
this who's going to listen we have lost
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
the trust of the people and that could
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
be very harmful in the future and my
 
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
question is how are we going to get it
 
01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
back well that is a great question
 
01:03:26.109 --> 01:03:26.119 align:start position:0%
because you know I've Been Told your
 
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
word is everything right that's
 
01:03:29.269 --> 01:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
basically all you
 
01:03:33.029 --> 01:03:33.039 align:start position:0%
have and once you lose
 
01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
that you
 
01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
know I know people that have lost trust
 
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
in doctors because they no longer trust
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
what they're saying because of either
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
misdiagnosis or they feel that you know
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
um they're prescrib their first reaction
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
is just prescribe a medicine instead of
 
01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
treat the cause it's let's treat the
 
01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:00.549 align:start position:0%
treat the cause it's let's treat the
symptom

01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
um so I I
 
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
mean it is going to be incredibly
 
01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:13.000 align:start position:0%
tough you know it's okay to say you know
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
gee I made a mistake or I changed my
 
01:04:19.309 --> 01:04:19.319 align:start position:0%
mind or I found out new
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
information but just to squelch it and
 
01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:25.880 align:start position:0%
deny the people in this country we are
 
01:04:28.829 --> 01:04:28.839 align:start position:0%
supposed to be the freest country in the
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
world in the
 
01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
world and we suppressed speech we
 
01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:37.910 align:start position:0%
world and we suppressed speech we
suppressed

01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
suppressed
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
ideas how do we accomplish great things
 
01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:42.680 align:start position:0%
in this country because we collaborate
 
01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
with ideas you have people you discuss
 
01:04:49.950 --> 01:04:49.960 align:start position:0%
opposing ideas and usually the best
 
01:04:52.510 --> 01:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
Solutions come when two opposing parties
 
01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
come together and figure something out
 
01:04:58.390 --> 01:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
that's how we advance things in this
 
01:05:02.670 --> 01:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
country there's no one right way for
 
01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
everything and to to only listen to one
 
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
side is
 
01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:20.190 --> 01:05:20.200 align:start position:0%
Penza so representative luus the stuff
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
that you said I think is
 
01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
um is huge I mean so many of the things
 
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
one even more so how would we ever
 
01:05:35.309 --> 01:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
believe anything
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
again I don't think that we have the
 
01:05:38.079 --> 01:05:39.549 align:start position:0%
again I don't think that we have the
opportunity

01:05:39.549 --> 01:05:39.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
to only because we can't get the message
 
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
out so here we are in New Hampshire when
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
all this started if let's just you know
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
all we're going to talk about is
 
01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
co and
 
01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
so you know in March all the stuff
 
01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
happens the hype you know you know a lot
 
01:05:59.670 --> 01:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
of people were like okay you know I'll
 
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
do my two weeks and all that and
 
01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
then some of us that had some you know
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
kind of insight and started to dig right
 
01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
away we're like okay this is um this is
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
this is not going away and then I
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
realized very quickly after about four
 
01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
weeks that that the schools weren't
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
going to open back up and it was this is
 
01:06:22.269 --> 01:06:22.279 align:start position:0%
this is how they're going to literally
 
01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:26.200 align:start position:0%
trample on everybody's civil liberties
 
01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
the problem is and let's just focus on
 
01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.630 align:start position:0%
the problem is and let's just focus on
New

01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:31.640 align:start position:0%
New
 
01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we didn't have and we still
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
don't have one
 
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
unbiased media outlet that is providing
 
01:06:44.910 --> 01:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
any of this
 
01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
information and I don't need to mention
 
01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
any names or whatever but we know who we
 
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
know who the one television station is
 
01:06:55.789 --> 01:06:55.799 align:start position:0%
that does all the reporting and they
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
don't come out with any of that there's
 
01:07:01.069 --> 01:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
a spin or whatever and very political
 
01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
bias and and then pretty much all of the
 
01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:07.029 align:start position:0%
bias and and then pretty much all of the
mainstream

01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
mainstream
 
01:07:10.029 --> 01:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
newspapers there's about four or five
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
and then the rest are online are not
 
01:07:15.630 --> 01:07:15.640 align:start position:0%
providing this kind of information so
 
01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
how would you you have you we would have
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
to be able to get that out we had almost
 
01:07:26.029 --> 01:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
247 you know we had a we had a governor
 
01:07:29.950 --> 01:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
and and state epidemiologist and all of
 
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
these people that were you know uh DHHS
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
Lor shanet at the time pounding weekly
 
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes even more than that a
 
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
narrative over and over and over and
 
01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
over and over again where the rest of
 
01:07:46.349 --> 01:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
that media newspaper the television was
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
was all lock
 
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
step and if that doesn't change in 60%
 
01:07:56.549 --> 01:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
70% of with the one .4 million in New
 
01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if that's all they're
 
01:08:01.549 --> 01:08:01.559 align:start position:0%
listening to and they don't listen to
 
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
any of the other side because they can't
 
01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:07.240 align:start position:0%
hear it it's squelched and it still is
 
01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
squelched you cannot search anywhere on
 
01:08:11.549 --> 01:08:11.559 align:start position:0%
Google and find this
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
information doctors react 19 I can um
 
01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:17.110 align:start position:0%
information doctors react 19 I can um
the

01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:20.269 --> 01:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
flccc you need to know it to find it
 
01:08:22.309 --> 01:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
Epoch times has some great things that's
 
01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
more of a national thing they they've
 
01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
really put out a lot of different things
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
that have come out whether it be doctors
 
01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
and studies and stuff with covid which
 
01:08:32.829 --> 01:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
has been wonderful treatments showing uh
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
you know you know early on vitamin D uh
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
talked about vitamin um vitamin B niin
 
01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
all these other types of things which is
 
01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
wonderful but that's a paid um entity
 
01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
and you can't just get that you know
 
01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
most of these too even conquered monitor
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
um uh The Fosters Daily Democrat where I
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
am where I'm located those are all
 
01:08:57.870 --> 01:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
behind a pay wall and there's such a
 
01:09:00.030 --> 01:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
small percentage of people that are that
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
have access to that not many people read
 
01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
um you know read the newspaper uh you
 
01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
know my generation and
 
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
younger um they spend a lot of time on
 
01:09:13.630 --> 01:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
social media like social media news
 
01:09:16.110 --> 01:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
outlets where you can get some stuff but
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
that's still missing you know I would
 
01:09:22.349 --> 01:09:22.359 align:start position:0%
have to say 70 to 80% or more of New
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not going to know this kind
 
01:09:26.269 --> 01:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
of stuff how many people are going to
 
01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
actually know about this hearing like
 
01:09:30.669 --> 01:09:30.679 align:start position:0%
they're not following they're not
 
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
tracking so how could we really change
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
that that to me is where it has to come
 
01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
from the top so whether you need a
 
01:09:43.149 --> 01:09:43.159 align:start position:0%
governor that's speaking that whether
 
01:09:46.590 --> 01:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
you need um an agency that's speaking
 
01:09:48.149 --> 01:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
that full
 
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
transparency and where we have a
 
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
legislature that passes laws to demand
 
01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:55.950 align:start position:0%
legislature that passes laws to demand
it

01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
is important too yesterday a lot of
 
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
things came out with some some
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
legislation this is Nob brainer
 
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
legislation whether it means um your
 
01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
right of conscience or if it's religious
 
01:10:11.950 --> 01:10:11.960 align:start position:0%
or whatever for whatever reason you
 
01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
don't want to have an injection or a
 
01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
medical uh procedure or whatever that is
 
01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
the utmost liberty
 
01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
interest those are the things that
 
01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan so I just I don't
 
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
know how we can get there with what
 
01:10:38.910 --> 01:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
you're talking about unless it it comes
 
01:10:42.189 --> 01:10:42.199 align:start position:0%
from that I mean I always say you know
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
pull all our money together and and make
 
01:10:46.669 --> 01:10:46.679 align:start position:0%
our own kind of you know news site or
 
01:10:49.709 --> 01:10:49.719 align:start position:0%
whatever because it's trying to come
 
01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
compete with the same ones that we
 
01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
censoring and all of that because
 
01:10:58.270 --> 01:10:58.280 align:start position:0%
they're advertisers are the same
 
01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
entities that are um they're making the
 
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
money so
 
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
they're it's you know it's never going
 
01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
to happen they're they're being paid so
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
I just I don't see a huge amount of
 
01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
change there unless our federal
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
government can stop that too you know it
 
01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
was talked about a little bit yesterday
 
01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
but we're one of the
 
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
only one of the only countries and other
 
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
countries kind of I guess look at us and
 
01:11:26.830 --> 01:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
and somewhat laugh at us how we let um
 
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies um drug
 
01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
companies have these
 
01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
commercials I mean they're
 
01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
constant just repeating whatever drug
 
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
they're trying to pedal and um and then
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
we laugh in our household we don't watch
 
01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of TV but we laugh at the end of
 
01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
those commercials because then it's like
 
01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
okay well suicide and death and suicidal
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
thoughts and uh and stroke and heart
 
01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
attack and but but before that it was
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
like this wonderful everything's so
 
01:11:56.350 --> 01:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
wonderful there you know running through
 
01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
a garden a field and oh by the way all
 
01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
of these side effects because they have
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
to give them but you know we're kind of
 
01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
a joke we make our our for having that
 
01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
level and those type that type of money
 
01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
that's the money that controls news that
 
01:12:16.669 --> 01:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
controls the narrative and we stay in a
 
01:12:19.390 --> 01:12:19.400 align:start position:0%
kind of a Perpetual state so I think
 
01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
what you said is so important though is
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
who are we going to trust some of the
 
01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:25.719 align:start position:0%
best doctor
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
the ones that were that always
 
01:12:32.229 --> 01:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
trusted and that said hey this worked
 
01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
for my
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
patient oh my gosh they lost everything
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
licenses and all that in a free country
 
01:12:46.709 --> 01:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
so I don't I don't know how we can
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
dismantle that medical industrial
 
01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
complex these hospitals protocols they
 
01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
were paid
 
01:13:00.430 --> 01:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
more money for a covid tagged
 
01:13:04.990 --> 01:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
death for a CO positive patient for
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
certain protocols do we have actual data
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
supporting that there is data that
 
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
supports that and um but I want to make
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
sure that it's it's absolutely factual
 
01:13:19.629 --> 01:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
um what we have I I have some things but
 
01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
it's I I need to know those Source
 
01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
documents I believe that some of the
 
01:13:25.709 --> 01:13:25.719 align:start position:0%
speakers that we've had here can help us
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
with that we do need to know that um
 
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
yeah if we want to make sure that it's
 
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
factual um and if you can uh email it to
 
01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
those documents to the committee so that
 
01:13:37.870 --> 01:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
we can put them in the record that would
 
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
be great there was a chart that came out
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
over a year ago Yuri you might be
 
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
familiar with it remember it gave every
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
state and it gave uh it gave an amount
 
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
just because you're on HHS and gave an
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
amount that hospitals were paid per
 
01:13:56.669 --> 01:13:56.679 align:start position:0%
covid death and and uh you know some
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
some were in over 100,000 for you know
 
01:14:03.669 --> 01:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
um so but I we need to know what their
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
that Source document is so it would be
 
01:14:09.550 --> 01:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
good for our committee to find that
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
information uh represent p is
 
01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
off um I have a couple of questions that
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh I would offer for discussion so first
 
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
one is uh we're talking about possible
 
01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
way we see
 
01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
our um legislation should go but uh next
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
Thursday we have Senate Bill 402 which
 
01:14:43.229 --> 01:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
have a good chances of passing and uh uh
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire General Court basically
 
01:14:51.669 --> 01:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
wants to give more authority to FDA and
 
01:14:56.189 --> 01:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
CDC and and say uh that uh
 
01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh basically our authority to
 
01:15:04.669 --> 01:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
review vaccinations uh that pharmacist
 
01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
are allowed to
 
01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:10.280 align:start position:0%
administer uh we we will uh we will
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
cancer Authority of New Hampshire
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
general court and just say if FDA and
 
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
CDC feels that those vaccines are good
 
01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
so go ahead and administer them so just
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
your your sort like
 
01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:30.280 align:start position:0%
about uh I mean counter argument is that
 
01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
local politicians that we are not
 
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
doctors we are not medical professionals
 
01:15:38.350 --> 01:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
so we should not make those medical
 
01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
decisions so let's uh let FDA and
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
CDC do it and
 
01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
basically uh as we heard yesterday and
 
01:15:51.709 --> 01:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
in some other testimonies
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh it might be not the best decision so
 
01:15:57.790 --> 01:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
just your thoughts on on
 
01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
that could you just explain a you know
 
01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
what are you
 
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
saying as I'm not familiar with the bill
 
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
um as you are because this is I'm saying
 
01:16:14.310 --> 01:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
your area of expertise more so than um
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
that we are going to be giving more
 
01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
authority to the
 
01:16:25.629 --> 01:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
FDA versus having our own state
 
01:16:28.189 --> 01:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
look into these things is that basically
 
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
what you just said oh basically uh maybe
 
01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
it's more mild issue it's more like
 
01:16:38.910 --> 01:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
before we could say no to to a certain
 
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
in a certain situation of Pharmacists
 
01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
administering uh certain new vaccines
 
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
for example and now we're saying no no
 
01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire General Court won't be
 
01:16:56.189 --> 01:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
involved anymore it will be all uh all
 
01:16:59.149 --> 01:16:59.159 align:start position:0%
according to FDA and
 
01:17:02.510 --> 01:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
CDC so te technically they're taking
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
away all our our Authority as
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
legislators in regards to protecting the
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire is that
 
01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
correct yeah yeah yes that's how I see
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
it but unfortunately uh the way I feel
 
01:17:20.830 --> 01:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
the majority of legislature see it the
 
01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
other way so not not sure well I think
 
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
maybe we should all have them watch the
 
01:17:30.430 --> 01:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
uh testimony from
 
01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:33.159 align:start position:0%
yesterday or at least suggest it or
 
01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody can go through and pick
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
out Snippets and share with the general
 
01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
court so that they have an idea of what
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
they're voting
 
01:17:45.390 --> 01:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
on I I know for me personally it was an
 
01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
eyeopener I had no idea about a lot of
 
01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
that um probably because my children are
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
older and
 
01:18:00.990 --> 01:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
um I react to medicines very poorly so
 
01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
I'm always
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
no and have been so I'm probably
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
fortunate um that I've had that um me
 
01:18:14.629 --> 01:18:14.639 align:start position:0%
mentality um only because of reactions
 
01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
um and you know when we speak about that
 
01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
right like I had a woman come in when we
 
01:18:25.390 --> 01:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
were talking about covid uh vaccine and
 
01:18:27.310 --> 01:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
she's like you
 
01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
know i' take the
 
01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
vaccine if they just told me what was in
 
01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
it because she can no longer get the flu
 
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine because of the inert not the
 
01:18:44.110 --> 01:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
actual ingredient but the inert
 
01:18:46.350 --> 01:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
ingredients that are in it in it the
 
01:18:48.669 --> 01:18:48.679 align:start position:0%
inactive ingredients and she's like I
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
just I'll take it but I want to know
 
01:18:54.390 --> 01:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
what the inactive ingredients are and
 
01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
she could not get it and it was going to
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
cost a her
 
01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
job and she was concerned because if she
 
01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
had another reaction like she had with
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
the flu shot she would
 
01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
die so her choice
 
01:19:19.229 --> 01:19:19.239 align:start position:0%
was get the vaccine chance dying cuz we
 
01:19:22.030 --> 01:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
don't know what's in it or keeping my
 
01:19:24.870 --> 01:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
job I don't know let me think think
 
01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
about that for a
 
01:19:29.189 --> 01:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
moment you know it's a really it was a
 
01:19:31.229 --> 01:19:31.239 align:start position:0%
really difficult I mean
 
01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
obviously her life meant more than her
 
01:19:37.470 --> 01:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
job but that also caused a hardship for
 
01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:38.709 align:start position:0%
job but that also caused a hardship for
her

01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
her
 
01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
family we didn't give her much of a
 
01:19:44.709 --> 01:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
choice she was wanted to get it she just
 
01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to know the ingredients and we
 
01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't even give her
 
01:19:55.709 --> 01:19:55.719 align:start position:0%
that representative beler
 
01:19:57.750 --> 01:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and just to return
 
01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
for a moment to the um to the issue of
 
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
some of the censorship that occurred uh
 
01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
social media issues and whatnot I do
 
01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
recall when I um when I was injured uh
 
01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
in the aftermath of my vaccination I I
 
01:20:16.229 --> 01:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
tried to share uh just a factual story
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
of what happened to me what my
 
01:20:21.310 --> 01:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
experience was um and based on so-called
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
misinformation policies I was suspended
 
01:20:26.110 --> 01:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
from social media and I would not
 
01:20:27.550 --> 01:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
allowed I was not allowed to return to
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
social media until I deleted the posts
 
01:20:33.390 --> 01:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
in question now at the time I certainly
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
didn't know this I I I thought that they
 
01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
were just these social media companies
 
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
following along with sort of a what what
 
01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
was seemed like a moral imperative that
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
was being socially pushed on them but
 
01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:49.480 align:start position:0%
now we know I think quite factually
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
given the information in the
 
01:20:53.310 --> 01:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
Congressional report I just read into
 
01:20:56.350 --> 01:20:56.360 align:start position:0%
the record that these instructions and
 
01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
these narratives of of how to censor and
 
01:21:01.870 --> 01:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
what to censor and what was preferable
 
01:21:03.870 --> 01:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
to have out there
 
01:21:06.669 --> 01:21:06.679 align:start position:0%
publicly it originated with the federal
 
01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
government it originated with the uh
 
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
with ciza and with individuals from the
 
01:21:13.629 --> 01:21:13.639 align:start position:0%
FBI and
 
01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
doj so represent Bel I just want to
 
01:21:18.189 --> 01:21:18.199 align:start position:0%
interrupt you for one moment and and
 
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
forgive me for doing that so it wasn't
 
01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
actually the social media companies that
 
01:21:25.470 --> 01:21:25.480 align:start position:0%
were making this
 
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
decision uh at least it's very it's very
 
01:21:31.790 --> 01:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
arguable that it was not now now was
 
01:21:33.870 --> 01:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
there an enforcement mechanism from the
 
01:21:35.709 --> 01:21:35.719 align:start position:0%
federal government to force them to do
 
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
this I don't know if that's clear yet
 
01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
but it is clear that there was an
 
01:21:42.910 --> 01:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
attempt at coercion at the very least
 
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
from the federal government they
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
designed software where they had Direct
 
01:21:50.709 --> 01:21:50.719 align:start position:0%
portals using a a software system that
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
they open on their computers that
 
01:21:55.229 --> 01:21:55.239 align:start position:0%
allowed them to transmit Direct ly to
 
01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
Personnel at big companies such as
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
Facebook and Twitter where they would
 
01:22:03.709 --> 01:22:03.719 align:start position:0%
they would give them lists of people and
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
topics that they wanted removed and
 
01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
censored from their
 
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
platforms and this went directly to
 
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
often what we're called trust and safety
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
teams rather
 
01:22:18.910 --> 01:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
dystopian at these organizations where
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
they would then act on them and this
 
01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
again this is not this is not
 
01:22:24.189 --> 01:22:24.199 align:start position:0%
speculation this is factual there's a
 
01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
current ly a lawsuit pending as well
 
01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
called Missouri versus Biden and this
 
01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
lawsuit is currently pending before The
 
01:22:33.310 --> 01:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court I don't know if they've
 
01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
issued CT on this yet um a lower court
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
judge identified in this in his finding
 
01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
and in the injunction that he placed on
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
the federal government he said and I'm
 
01:22:48.629 --> 01:22:48.639 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing but he said this is the
 
01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
biggest first imminent violation in this
 
01:22:50.239 --> 01:22:52.229 align:start position:0%
biggest first imminent violation in this
nation's

01:22:52.229 --> 01:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
nation's
 
01:22:55.590 --> 01:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
history that the censorship was
 
01:22:58.830 --> 01:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
outrageous what was occurring and again
 
01:23:00.669 --> 01:23:00.679 align:start position:0%
I believe this is pending right now
 
01:23:02.830 --> 01:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
before the Supreme Court um I think
 
01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to take this up probably
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
in this next year uh and hopefully
 
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
something something good and more
 
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
information will come out of this uh but
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
yeah we we know that this was not a
 
01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
private company making private decisions
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
without any outside influence this was a
 
01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
government influence
 
01:23:28.149 --> 01:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
censorship campaign and narrative
 
01:23:30.510 --> 01:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
campaign to build a certain narrative
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
and we know this was uh This was done
 
01:23:33.470 --> 01:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
actually in coordination with other
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
other countries too this was done in
 
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
coordination with the five eyes Nations
 
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
it was done with uh with MI5 in Britain
 
01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh this was not a standalone effort the
 
01:23:45.550 --> 01:23:45.560 align:start position:0%
entire Western world seems to have
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
thrown the very concept of of freedom of
 
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
speech and freedom of conscience and
 
01:23:53.149 --> 01:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
freedom of religion all of those things
 
01:23:55.149 --> 01:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
just kind of went out the window and to
 
01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
speak to what you you said earlier you
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
you you gave a listing of of how they
 
01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:03.800 align:start position:0%
ignored certain harms and focused
 
01:24:05.910 --> 01:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
exclusively on this one thing and and
 
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
there's actually a word for that the
 
01:24:08.590 --> 01:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
word is
 
01:24:12.030 --> 01:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
safetyism safetyism is when you become
 
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
myopic and you focus exclusively on one
 
01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
harm without weighing the counterveiling
 
01:24:22.750 --> 01:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
considerations that will come with any
 
01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
action you take cuz we know that
 
01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
anything the government does or does not
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
do comes with both intended and
 
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences and it just it
 
01:24:35.149 --> 01:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
just appears right now that that those
 
01:24:37.470 --> 01:24:37.480 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences and other things
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
were ignored because this became a as we
 
01:24:44.030 --> 01:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
heard yesterday A A certainly
 
01:24:46.510 --> 01:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
ideological and perhaps even borderline
 
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
religious um
 
01:24:53.070 --> 01:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
conviction of mitigating covid at any
 
01:24:57.709 --> 01:24:57.719 align:start position:0%
cost so so a couple things is one um
 
01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
that judges ruling the lower court uh
 
01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
could we could you email that to the
 
01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
committee yes I'll find that uh that
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
would be great um just so we can have
 
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
that uh you know for backup and to uh
 
01:25:14.189 --> 01:25:14.199 align:start position:0%
substantiate what we're discussing here
 
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is is you know um my
 
01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
family Co went through our family early
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
on um right at the beginning of the
 
01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
whole pandemic and the
 
01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
shutdowns and
 
01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:29.950 align:start position:0%
shutdowns and
[Music]

01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
um so we you know when the vaccines came
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
around we figured you know
 
01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
immune our immune system was pretty good
 
01:25:41.149 --> 01:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
um at that time but there was a lot of
 
01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
controversy about that but you know what
 
01:25:49.350 --> 01:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:52.510 --> 01:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday was when he
 
01:25:55.709 --> 01:25:55.719 align:start position:0%
said well
 
01:25:57.550 --> 01:25:57.560 align:start position:0%
if you get the covid vaccine they
 
01:25:59.310 --> 01:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
finally admitted that you still can
 
01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.310 align:start position:0%
finally admitted that you still can
transmit

01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
transmit
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
covid how long did they deny
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
that how long did they know that it
 
01:26:10.270 --> 01:26:10.280 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
transmissible once the
 
01:26:16.109 --> 01:26:16.119 align:start position:0%
injection you were given the
 
01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
injection how long did they know that
 
01:26:21.470 --> 01:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
you could still get covid even if you
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
got the
 
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine or the covid
 
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
shot how long did they know about
 
01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
that and I think you know I think once
 
01:26:34.830 --> 01:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
it came out that you could people
 
01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
started getting covid after being
 
01:26:39.390 --> 01:26:39.400 align:start position:0%
vaccinated I I think the new narrative
 
01:26:45.070 --> 01:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:48.669 --> 01:26:48.679 align:start position:0%
symptoms but if we look at the charts
 
01:26:51.550 --> 01:26:51.560 align:start position:0%
and the death rates I don't
 
01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
represent P off yeah and just anecdote
 
01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
my Koka and his
 
01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
daughter um I think probably he
 
01:27:11.390 --> 01:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
understood that his daughter is
 
01:27:15.189 --> 01:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
not risk uh population and maybe he
 
01:27:18.310 --> 01:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
himself is young enough but he was
 
01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
definitely getting vaccine for himself
 
01:27:22.669 --> 01:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
and covid vaccine for his daughter
 
01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
because his wife was
 
01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh immun compromised how old is his
 
01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:30.030 align:start position:0%
uh immun compromised how old is his
daughter

01:27:30.030 --> 01:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
daughter
 
01:27:35.109 --> 01:27:35.119 align:start position:0%
please so uh about 10 years old
 
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh so uh uh child a child so so the
 
01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
point being yes uh people were not
 
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
informed that and many
 
01:27:52.830 --> 01:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
people even if they understood the risk
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
or of vaccination they felt that they
 
01:27:59.950 --> 01:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
are protecting vulnerable relatives or
 
01:28:02.990 --> 01:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
vulnerable populations and they were not
 
01:28:06.990 --> 01:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:10.390 --> 01:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
case right I think we heard here from um
 
01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
Dr kulor that
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
really the target group were was the
 
01:28:19.109 --> 01:28:19.119 align:start position:0%
older population um that we really
 
01:28:20.910 --> 01:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
needed to be concerned about and they
 
01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
were the ones that really needed to be
 
01:28:23.679 --> 01:28:24.870 align:start position:0%
were the ones that really needed to be
um

01:28:24.870 --> 01:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
protected uh and
 
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
vaccinated um so
 
01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
uh and as an infectious disease doctor
 
01:28:38.350 --> 01:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
and hearing him talk about that and
 
01:28:42.189 --> 01:28:42.199 align:start position:0%
talking about how technically I think he
 
01:28:44.990 --> 01:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
said anyone like under 40 or maybe it's
 
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.669 align:start position:0%
said anyone like under 40 or maybe it's
even

01:28:46.669 --> 01:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
even
 
01:28:52.510 --> 01:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
50 really the risk of covid is
 
01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:58.950 --> 01:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
compared to what he's I believe I'm not
 
01:29:00.510 --> 01:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
I don't want to put words in his mouth
 
01:29:03.950 --> 01:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
but I think the the risk benefit uh is
 
01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
there and that nobody under the age of
 
01:29:09.149 --> 01:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
50 I believe he he believes should be
 
01:29:09.159 --> 01:29:10.709 align:start position:0%
50 I believe he he believes should be
getting

01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:12.690 align:start position:0%
vaccinated so
 
01:29:12.690 --> 01:29:14.229 align:start position:0%
vaccinated so
[Music]

01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:29:17.390 --> 01:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
um and this is not a doctor who is
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
against vaccines because he does believe
 
01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
in vaccines and he believes in people
 
01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
getting vaccinated
 
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
but he also believes I I think you know
 
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
listening to his testimony that there
 
01:29:33.790 --> 01:29:33.800 align:start position:0%
are Target populations for different
 
01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines so did
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh represent Belcher thank you madam
 
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
chair and since I've brought it up and I
 
01:29:42.790 --> 01:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
will I will forward this to the
 
01:29:43.870 --> 01:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
committee will'll become part of the
 
01:29:45.669 --> 01:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
official record I just wanted to quote
 
01:29:47.550 --> 01:29:47.560 align:start position:0%
quickly from that lower court decision
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
that I've got it in front of me in the
 
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
case Missouri versus Biden in the
 
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
Judgment attached to the inj Junction
 
01:29:57.550 --> 01:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
the present case arguably involves the
 
01:29:59.550 --> 01:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
most massive attack against free speech
 
01:30:01.990 --> 01:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
in United States history in their
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
attempts to suppress alleged
 
01:30:05.310 --> 01:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
disinformation the federal government
 
01:30:06.830 --> 01:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
and a particularly defendants named
 
01:30:08.590 --> 01:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
herein and there is quite the list of
 
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
defendants are alleged to have blatantly
 
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
ignored the first amendment's right to
 
01:30:15.550 --> 01:30:15.560 align:start position:0%
free speech although the censorship
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
alleged in this case almost exclusively
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
targeted conservative speech the issues
 
01:30:23.470 --> 01:30:23.480 align:start position:0%
herein raised beyond go beyond party
 
01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:24.590 align:start position:0%
herein raised beyond go beyond party
lines

01:30:24.590 --> 01:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
lines
 
01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
and the list of people enjoined and as a
 
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
part of this includes almost
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
every almost every Federal agency that
 
01:30:35.149 --> 01:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
we would be looking at here including
 
01:30:39.149 --> 01:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
not just FBI and CA but also the NIH the
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:49.990 --> 01:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
others I will make one point um and this
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
has been said um from a lot of our
 
01:30:57.149 --> 01:30:57.159 align:start position:0%
speakers is is that New Hampshire did
 
01:30:57.159 --> 01:30:58.189 align:start position:0%
speakers is is that New Hampshire did
pretty

01:30:58.189 --> 01:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
01:30:58.199 --> 01:30:59.910 align:start position:0%
pretty
good

01:30:59.910 --> 01:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
um so uh I just want to make sure that
 
01:31:08.669 --> 01:31:08.679 align:start position:0%
um we got some things right I I don't
 
01:31:10.390 --> 01:31:10.400 align:start position:0%
ever want to say that we got it all
 
01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
wrong and I don't
 
01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:14.910 align:start position:0%
wrong and I don't
think

01:31:14.910 --> 01:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
um this is a learning curve for all of
 
01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:19.830 align:start position:0%
um this is a learning curve for all of
us

01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:24.400 align:start position:0%
here um but go but next time we need to
 
01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
do better um and I think that what we
 
01:31:31.870 --> 01:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
need to understand is that there were
 
01:31:35.229 --> 01:31:35.239 align:start position:0%
conflicting information um being given
 
01:31:39.109 --> 01:31:39.119 align:start position:0%
out um as we heard in testimony from the
 
01:31:42.189 --> 01:31:42.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education he was given
 
01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
guidance to schools and they were opted
 
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
not to follow the state guidance which
 
01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
was less restrictive and following
 
01:31:50.239 --> 01:31:51.629 align:start position:0%
was less restrictive and following
Federal

01:31:51.629 --> 01:31:51.639 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
01:31:54.910 --> 01:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
guidance um which was more restri
 
01:31:58.310 --> 01:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
restrictive um
 
01:32:05.390 --> 01:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:12.189 --> 01:32:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:16.280 align:start position:0%
population it's very hard to
 
01:32:18.510 --> 01:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
discern which way to
 
01:32:24.669 --> 01:32:24.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:28.030 --> 01:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
and fear does play an important point in
 
01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:29.750 align:start position:0%
and fear does play an important point in
our

01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:32:33.390 --> 01:32:33.400 align:start position:0%
lives but it can't rule our
 
01:32:36.750 --> 01:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
lives and I think that's what happened
 
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:49.350 --> 01:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
everything and I think that is something
 
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
that can never ever ever happen
 
01:32:56.430 --> 01:32:56.440 align:start position:0%
again there is always has to be
 
01:32:58.229 --> 01:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
something to look forward
 
01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
to there has to be
 
01:33:02.590 --> 01:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
gratitude there is always something to
 
01:33:04.709 --> 01:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
be grateful
 
01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:13.709 --> 01:33:13.719 align:start position:0%
today and I think that we as public
 
01:33:15.709 --> 01:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
servces and as the
 
01:33:19.350 --> 01:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
government we need to understand that
 
01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
to yes things can be bad but there's
 
01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:30.350 align:start position:0%
to yes things can be bad but there's
always

01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
always
 
01:33:33.950 --> 01:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
something even if it's the tiniest thing
 
01:33:36.189 --> 01:33:36.199 align:start position:0%
that we can be grateful for or that's
 
01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
positive and we need to make sure we
 
01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
outline those
 
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
positives represent
 
01:33:47.790 --> 01:33:47.800 align:start position:0%
leus following on that and
 
01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:49.910 align:start position:0%
leus following on that and
fear

01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
fear
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
um fear keeps us safe quickly at the
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
moment moment tells us jump out of the
 
01:34:00.510 --> 01:34:00.520 align:start position:0%
way of the car Etc I mean it has a good
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
a reason why we have it but there's a
 
01:34:06.109 --> 01:34:06.119 align:start position:0%
been a lot there is a lot of evidence we
 
01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
know that it fear
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
also interferes with making rational
 
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
logical decisions it acts as you know
 
01:34:19.790 --> 01:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
it's that back part of our brain right
 
01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
that keeps us
 
01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
alive but it also interferes with with
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
that front part of our brain that
 
01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:30.350 align:start position:0%
that front part of our brain that
reasons

01:34:30.350 --> 01:34:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:32.910 --> 01:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
and I I
 
01:34:35.189 --> 01:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
01:34:39.910 --> 01:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
fear stirring fear increasing fear was
 
01:34:43.229 --> 01:34:43.239 align:start position:0%
intentional on the part of various
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
members of our
 
01:34:48.390 --> 01:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
government and as
 
01:34:52.030 --> 01:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
example if you listen very carefully to
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
the things that f for instance said he
 
01:34:58.990 --> 01:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
would always say well this could happen
 
01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:02.719 align:start position:0%
or this might cause this or whatever
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
when we know now it really didn't and
 
01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't and you can see that for a long
 
01:35:11.149 --> 01:35:11.159 align:start position:0%
time for instance during the AIDS
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
epidemic he said
 
01:35:18.229 --> 01:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
well children might be able to get AIDS
 
01:35:20.910 --> 01:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
from coming in contact with somebody who
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
has it right casual contact well we know
 
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
that wasn't the case we pretty much knew
 
01:35:30.030 --> 01:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
that wasn't the case then but and he
 
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
pretty much knew that wasn't the case
 
01:35:35.109 --> 01:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
then so by say but by saying it might
 
01:35:37.950 --> 01:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
happen it could be everybody takes that
 
01:35:40.669 --> 01:35:40.679 align:start position:0%
as oh my goodness and then look at all
 
01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
of the AIDS patients who were
 
01:35:47.229 --> 01:35:47.239 align:start position:0%
abandoned who had to survive alone whose
 
01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
relatives friends Etc were terrified to
 
01:35:53.070 --> 01:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
come and visit them because they might
 
01:35:57.709 --> 01:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
get a s now see that's one of those lies
 
01:35:57.719 --> 01:35:58.709 align:start position:0%
get a s now see that's one of those lies
of

01:35:58.709 --> 01:35:58.719 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:36:02.430 --> 01:36:02.440 align:start position:0%
omission he was right I guess it could
 
01:36:06.030 --> 01:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
maybe it was a possibility but by saying
 
01:36:08.590 --> 01:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
those things over and over it instilled
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
fear in people it made it a big deal and
 
01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
this is what we saw over and over with
 
01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
Co all the things that could be might be
 
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
you know those wordings were very
 
01:36:22.709 --> 01:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
careful I listened to those and I said
 
01:36:26.229 --> 01:36:26.239 align:start position:0%
hm didn't say these are the odds we have
 
01:36:29.070 --> 01:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
evidence whatever he said this might be
 
01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
this could be and it was all to build
 
01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:39.070 align:start position:0%
 
population

01:36:39.070 --> 01:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:43.870 --> 01:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
so Wow first I'm going to say because
 
01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
here we have someone that already did
 
01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:54.430 --> 01:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
again and I can tell you from personal
 
01:36:57.629 --> 01:36:57.639 align:start position:0%
experience that that is true my mom
 
01:37:02.430 --> 01:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:11.070 align:start position:0%
 
her

01:37:11.070 --> 01:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
her
 
01:37:15.390 --> 01:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
however I called a doctor friend of mine
 
01:37:17.229 --> 01:37:17.239 align:start position:0%
and said you know I've had
 
01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
covid um what do you think he like well
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
when did you have it I told him and he
 
01:37:25.629 --> 01:37:25.639 align:start position:0%
goes yep no no problem so I would go
 
01:37:27.310 --> 01:37:27.320 align:start position:0%
over and bring her whatever she needed
 
01:37:29.870 --> 01:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
and make sure she was okay and stuff I
 
01:37:35.669 --> 01:37:35.679 align:start position:0%
never got covid from her but if I didn't
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
go she would have been
 
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
her how many other people or parents or
 
01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:51.149 align:start position:0%
her how many other people or parents or
elderly

01:37:51.149 --> 01:37:51.159 align:start position:0%
elderly
 
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
people had that happened to them and
 
01:37:56.750 --> 01:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
didn't have anyone to go and visit with
 
01:37:59.229 --> 01:37:59.239 align:start position:0%
them I mean I would have gone anyways
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
whether but I just wanted to double
 
01:38:03.109 --> 01:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
check what my chances were of getting
 
01:38:06.350 --> 01:38:06.360 align:start position:0%
you know if I would get Co again um but
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:13.950 --> 01:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
is that was the narrative my
 
01:38:17.550 --> 01:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
dad was taken to the hospital at the
 
01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
very beginning of when covid
 
01:38:24.990 --> 01:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
happened um right after the lockdowns
 
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
and I will never forget and thank God
 
01:38:30.510 --> 01:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
for the paramedics that's all I can say
 
01:38:33.910 --> 01:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
is thank God for them they made sure
 
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
that he took his phone I don't know if
 
01:38:39.589 --> 01:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
he has an iPad might have an iPad and
 
01:38:42.990 --> 01:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
his charges they said take those with
 
01:38:46.629 --> 01:38:46.639 align:start position:0%
you if they did not do that we would
 
01:38:51.149 --> 01:38:51.159 align:start position:0%
have had no and I mean no communication
 
01:38:54.629 --> 01:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
with him at all we were not allowed to
 
01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
go to the hospital we were not allowed
 
01:39:00.510 --> 01:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
to see him we were allowed
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:08.229 --> 01:39:08.239 align:start position:0%
isolated and guess what he didn't have
 
01:39:12.350 --> 01:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
oh co he did not have
 
01:39:15.390 --> 01:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
covid but yet at that time he was
 
01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
treated like he was did and we were
 
01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
banned from seeing him fortunately
 
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
because of the param iics were able to
 
01:39:28.510 --> 01:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
communicate with him and talked to him
 
01:39:33.790 --> 01:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
via Zoom or whatever he had on his
 
01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
iPhone but that's because we had
 
01:39:41.390 --> 01:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
people that told us told him what to
 
01:39:43.470 --> 01:39:43.480 align:start position:0%
take with him to make sure that we would
 
01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:44.990 align:start position:0%
take with him to make sure that we would
have

01:39:44.990 --> 01:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:39:47.629 --> 01:39:47.639 align:start position:0%
communication how many people didn't
 
01:39:49.629 --> 01:39:49.639 align:start position:0%
have someone tell them that and they
 
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
were alone that did have covid and did
 
01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:53.910 align:start position:0%
were alone that did have covid and did
die

01:39:53.910 --> 01:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
die
 
01:39:56.830 --> 01:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
alone without their family and those
 
01:40:02.350 --> 01:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:04.629 --> 01:40:04.639 align:start position:0%
goodbye representative leus and then
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
represent beler I just want
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
to remind all of us I guess that in the
 
01:40:14.270 --> 01:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
beginning we didn't know there was a lot
 
01:40:16.990 --> 01:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
we didn't know and so we were being
 
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
super super careful and that was a good
 
01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
thing because if this if this disease
 
01:40:25.109 --> 01:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
would have Pro proven to be as deadly to
 
01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
01:40:30.109 --> 01:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
populace as we thought the things we did
 
01:40:34.229 --> 01:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
in the beginning were good but fairly
 
01:40:37.709 --> 01:40:37.719 align:start position:0%
quickly fairly quickly and and from
 
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
things we've been hearing I think there
 
01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
was a lot more known at that point um
 
01:40:48.270 --> 01:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
than was being leted out but because the
 
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
people who know those things or knew
 
01:40:52.709 --> 01:40:52.719 align:start position:0%
those things weren't letting it out the
 
01:40:54.669 --> 01:40:54.679 align:start position:0%
majority of people the majority
 
01:40:57.470 --> 01:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
officials the majority of doctors Etc
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
were doing the best they could and what
 
01:41:02.030 --> 01:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
they were doing I think made sense for
 
01:41:06.790 --> 01:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
the first little bit but then as we knew
 
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
it was the elderly Etc as we knew that
 
01:41:12.629 --> 01:41:12.639 align:start position:0%
children were not actually going to
 
01:41:14.750 --> 01:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
spread covid to their
 
01:41:18.910 --> 01:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
grandmas um because they didn't get
 
01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:20.750 align:start position:0%
grandmas um because they didn't get
it

01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
then the fact should I mean we should
 
01:41:24.189 --> 01:41:24.199 align:start position:0%
have been
 
01:41:27.149 --> 01:41:27.159 align:start position:0%
informed all along as we knew so we
 
01:41:29.229 --> 01:41:29.239 align:start position:0%
could say okay we did the best we could
 
01:41:32.589 --> 01:41:32.599 align:start position:0%
there we now know this let's do this and
 
01:41:34.669 --> 01:41:34.679 align:start position:0%
I think that's the problem is that we
 
01:41:38.270 --> 01:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
stuck with that protocol even after we
 
01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
knew it didn't work it wasn't
 
01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate I mean in the beginning we
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
washed everything right and then we
 
01:41:48.629 --> 01:41:48.639 align:start position:0%
found out that we actually it's not it's
 
01:41:48.639 --> 01:41:50.910 align:start position:0%
found out that we actually it's not it's
not

01:41:50.910 --> 01:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
um you can't get it from surfaces right
 
01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
and but we still kept up that protocol
 
01:42:01.950 --> 01:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
even though we had learned that's not
 
01:42:04.589 --> 01:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
how it spread and a lot of things like
 
01:42:06.790 --> 01:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
that and that's people have to be
 
01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
willing I think to say okay I did the
 
01:42:12.270 --> 01:42:12.280 align:start position:0%
best I could with what I knew I now knew
 
01:42:16.990 --> 01:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
other know other things I was wrong you
 
01:42:19.709 --> 01:42:19.719 align:start position:0%
know and and this is what I know now and
 
01:42:21.189 --> 01:42:21.199 align:start position:0%
this is what we should do but it just
 
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
seems like there's a lot of pride in not
 
01:42:27.390 --> 01:42:27.400 align:start position:0%
wanting to admit
 
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
that they said the wrong thing or a
 
01:42:33.790 --> 01:42:33.800 align:start position:0%
mistake was made well everybody makes
 
01:42:36.910 --> 01:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
mistakes I think the the problem is when
 
01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
you're not willing to admit it and move
 
01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
on from there I mean you respect
 
01:42:44.350 --> 01:42:44.360 align:start position:0%
somebody who says okay with the
 
01:42:47.189 --> 01:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
information I had you know I made this
 
01:42:49.030 --> 01:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
decision it was the wrong decision I now
 
01:42:51.709 --> 01:42:51.719 align:start position:0%
have this misinformation go forward and
 
01:42:55.149 --> 01:42:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:58.589 --> 01:42:58.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
today that's part of I think what we
 
01:43:04.030 --> 01:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
need to do to begin to get some trust
 
01:43:07.109 --> 01:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
back is for people
 
01:43:12.030 --> 01:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
to be willing to to say I made a mistake
 
01:43:14.070 --> 01:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
about this I was wrong about that this
 
01:43:16.990 --> 01:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
is what I know now this is you know but
 
01:43:18.510 --> 01:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
we don't seem
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
to we don't seem to allow people to
 
01:43:23.149 --> 01:43:23.159 align:start position:0%
change their mind or change or anything
 
01:43:24.510 --> 01:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
anything you see that in the news all
 
01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
the time somebody who used to believe
 
01:43:30.430 --> 01:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
one way then you see they say oh you
 
01:43:32.830 --> 01:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
know I've learned this since then and
 
01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
now I believe this way and what happens
 
01:43:38.709 --> 01:43:38.719 align:start position:0%
the news social media everybody attacks
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
them constantly yeah well they used to
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
you know whatever and they're just fakes
 
01:43:46.229 --> 01:43:46.239 align:start position:0%
and all kinds of stuff it's like no
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
they're humans we make the best
 
01:43:50.229 --> 01:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
decisions we can with the information we
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
have as we get more information we
 
01:43:56.709 --> 01:43:56.719 align:start position:0%
change our mind I H hardly agree and I
 
01:44:01.350 --> 01:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
think that if that had happened early on
 
01:44:02.790 --> 01:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be having the discussion
 
01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:04.189 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be having the discussion
about

01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
trust I said but they
 
01:44:10.669 --> 01:44:10.679 align:start position:0%
didn't and they're still trying not to
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
and that that is the biggest problem uh
 
01:44:14.159 --> 01:44:15.470 align:start position:0%
and that that is the biggest problem uh
representative

01:44:15.470 --> 01:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you madam chair I'd like
 
01:44:20.950 --> 01:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
to offer a perhaps counterintuitive
 
01:44:23.470 --> 01:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
Silver Lining to some of the things that
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
have happened and that silver lining
 
01:44:28.950 --> 01:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
that piece of good news for me is that
 
01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
trust in government and established
 
01:44:35.709 --> 01:44:35.719 align:start position:0%
media has
 
01:44:39.310 --> 01:44:39.320 align:start position:0%
collapsed collapsed through the floor
 
01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:47.109 --> 01:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
news we government are not to be
 
01:44:49.790 --> 01:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
trusted for those watching we sitting
 
01:44:51.589 --> 01:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
here we are not your friends and we are
 
01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
not your family we have power power over
 
01:44:55.790 --> 01:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
you that means you need to watch us
 
01:44:58.950 --> 01:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
because power corrupts you do not trust
 
01:45:00.990 --> 01:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
government you watch government and you
 
01:45:03.229 --> 01:45:03.239 align:start position:0%
make sure it doesn't get out of control
 
01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
the trouble now comes
 
01:45:09.510 --> 01:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
in with the fact that what we've seen in
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
some of the documents I've read in this
 
01:45:13.589 --> 01:45:13.599 align:start position:0%
morning and previously is that we are
 
01:45:17.109 --> 01:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
dealing with not just collapse in
 
01:45:20.910 --> 01:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
government uh trust we're also dealing
 
01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
with collapse in institutional
 
01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
trust that is a real
 
01:45:28.390 --> 01:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
problem so what we need to be looking at
 
01:45:31.550 --> 01:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
I think is why and H what we can do
 
01:45:33.910 --> 01:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
about that and I think it's entirely
 
01:45:36.390 --> 01:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
clear based on these things that there
 
01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:37.669 align:start position:0%
clear based on these things that there
is

01:45:37.669 --> 01:45:37.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:45:40.589 --> 01:45:40.599 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive Cel
 
01:45:43.870 --> 01:45:43.880 align:start position:0%
behavior that is being conducted in both
 
01:45:46.350 --> 01:45:46.360 align:start position:0%
the private sector and the public sector
 
01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
at the federal level especially um in
 
01:45:52.270 --> 01:45:52.280 align:start position:0%
what are commonly known these days as uh
 
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
public private
 
01:45:57.070 --> 01:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
Partnerships and I I would only add in
 
01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
here a quote that
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
um the according to bino musolini the
 
01:46:05.790 --> 01:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
definition of fascism is the combination
 
01:46:09.310 --> 01:46:09.320 align:start position:0%
of state and corporate power so I would
 
01:46:11.589 --> 01:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
I would throw that out there
 
01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
but we have a collusion happening with
 
01:46:16.669 --> 01:46:16.679 align:start position:0%
and this is demonstrated in the house
 
01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
documents I read into the record that
 
01:46:21.310 --> 01:46:21.320 align:start position:0%
government is working with Nos and
 
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
private companies to affect cartel
 
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
Behavior to control narratives to do
 
01:46:28.149 --> 01:46:28.159 align:start position:0%
censorship and to do to push certain
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
ideas and to keep things out of the
 
01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:31.270 align:start position:0%
ideas and to keep things out of the
public

01:46:31.270 --> 01:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
record now let me read from you our
 
01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
charge as a legislature under New
 
01:46:41.229 --> 01:46:41.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution Article 83 we are
 
01:46:44.390 --> 01:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
charged with crushing and I quote
 
01:46:47.709 --> 01:46:47.719 align:start position:0%
conspiracy Monopoly and any other unfair
 
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
means of Market manipulation this is in
 
01:46:52.430 --> 01:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution we have a
 
01:46:55.390 --> 01:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
charge to do it as a legislature and is
 
01:46:57.790 --> 01:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
within our power to do this so I think
 
01:46:59.310 --> 01:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
that is something that we can look at
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
down the road either in our report or as
 
01:47:05.390 --> 01:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
we may come back next year and introduce
 
01:47:10.189 --> 01:47:10.199 align:start position:0%
legislation what can be done to stifle
 
01:47:13.390 --> 01:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
the cartel behavior that is eroding
 
01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
public trust in our public
 
01:47:18.390 --> 01:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
institutions in order that we don't have
 
01:47:20.149 --> 01:47:20.159 align:start position:0%
a total collapse in society because
 
01:47:22.189 --> 01:47:22.199 align:start position:0%
trust in government shouldn't be there
 
01:47:25.870 --> 01:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:27.510 --> 01:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
important thank you for that
 
01:47:29.629 --> 01:47:29.639 align:start position:0%
clarification and and thank you uh
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative beler for citing uh that
 
01:47:34.149 --> 01:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
article uh article 83 from the New
 
01:47:36.430 --> 01:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution I think that's
 
01:47:38.910 --> 01:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
extremely uh
 
01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:40.550 align:start position:0%
extremely uh
powerful

01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
powerful
 
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
um always being one to believe in
 
01:47:45.790 --> 01:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
transparency no matter where it may lead
 
01:47:48.189 --> 01:47:48.199 align:start position:0%
um whether I agree or not agree uh I
 
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
think is essential to good
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
governance um truth and labeling
 
01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:55.310 align:start position:0%
governance um truth and labeling
informed

01:47:55.310 --> 01:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
informed
 
01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:57.229 align:start position:0%
informed
consent

01:47:57.229 --> 01:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:48:00.109 --> 01:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
Etc should be something
 
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire should strive to be
 
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
on The Cutting Edge
 
01:48:10.149 --> 01:48:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
charge because if we are to live up to
 
01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:16.030 align:start position:0%
charge because if we are to live up to
our

01:48:16.030 --> 01:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:19.310 --> 01:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
motto which is Live Free or Die but
 
01:48:22.870 --> 01:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
death is not the worst of all evils
 
01:48:26.669 --> 01:48:26.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:32.709 --> 01:48:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
everywhere Will O be the only
 
01:48:40.750 --> 01:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
way that citizens of New
 
01:48:45.870 --> 01:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can make informed
 
01:48:48.189 --> 01:48:48.199 align:start position:0%
decisions and know
 
01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%
exactly what they're signing up for
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:01.109 --> 01:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
Penza Madam chair I agree with
 
01:49:02.270 --> 01:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
everything that you just said and I
 
01:49:06.589 --> 01:49:06.599 align:start position:0%
wanted to comment on uh representative
 
01:49:09.270 --> 01:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh leus and representative Belcher there
 
01:49:11.229 --> 01:49:11.239 align:start position:0%
all these points that have been given
 
01:49:15.589 --> 01:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:19.149 --> 01:49:19.159 align:start position:0%
previously I don't use my litmus test as
 
01:49:22.870 --> 01:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
okay well New Hampshire wasn't we did we
 
01:49:24.870 --> 01:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
did some things right we did some things
 
01:49:27.430 --> 01:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
wrong New Hampshire wasn't as or many
 
01:49:29.149 --> 01:49:29.159 align:start position:0%
people have said New Hampshire wasn't as
 
01:49:31.629 --> 01:49:31.639 align:start position:0%
bad as oh this state that worst state
 
01:49:33.070 --> 01:49:33.080 align:start position:0%
whether it be you know a lot of people
 
01:49:35.790 --> 01:49:35.800 align:start position:0%
talk about how bad New York was how bad
 
01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
other states were I don't I don't go
 
01:49:41.189 --> 01:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
based upon that every single person that
 
01:49:43.109 --> 01:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
is in our
 
01:49:46.030 --> 01:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
government especially our
 
01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
executive took an oath to both New
 
01:49:51.870 --> 01:49:51.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution first and the US
 
01:49:54.310 --> 01:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution Second
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
and I have to say that when this was all
 
01:50:00.390 --> 01:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
going down that's what I followed and
 
01:50:03.470 --> 01:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
there weren't many in this country and I
 
01:50:05.790 --> 01:50:05.800 align:start position:0%
don't give a pass I don't care if you
 
01:50:10.189 --> 01:50:10.199 align:start position:0%
trampled on one right or a h 100 none of
 
01:50:13.350 --> 01:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
it should have ever happened
 
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
because you were elected the the people
 
01:50:18.750 --> 01:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
are the ones that hold the trust they're
 
01:50:20.430 --> 01:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
the ones that are managing they're the
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
ones that are the boss they're they're
 
01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:23.270 align:start position:0%
ones that are the boss they're they're
basically

01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
they're the boss and we work for
 
01:50:29.830 --> 01:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
them Christy gome in South
 
01:50:32.870 --> 01:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
Dakota and there's probably a lot of
 
01:50:34.229 --> 01:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
different videos and things that you
 
01:50:36.910 --> 01:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
could read about but I saw her in person
 
01:50:39.510 --> 01:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
and she spoke on this directly whether
 
01:50:41.950 --> 01:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
you like her or not I'm only talking
 
01:50:45.390 --> 01:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
about how she handled
 
01:50:48.990 --> 01:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
specifically covid when it came to
 
01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
Federal money protocols and all of that
 
01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
she literally said in this meeting she
 
01:50:59.310 --> 01:50:59.320 align:start position:0%
took out right in the early on she took
 
01:51:01.950 --> 01:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
out her Constitution she read it
 
01:51:04.990 --> 01:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
thoroughly she wanted to know exactly
 
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
where her Authority
 
01:51:10.589 --> 01:51:10.599 align:start position:0%
rested she didn't do all those executive
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
orders she didn't do any of that they
 
01:51:16.149 --> 01:51:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
money it was quite
 
01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
incredible and she wanted to make sure
 
01:51:23.950 --> 01:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
that she stayed within her Authority
 
01:51:27.390 --> 01:51:27.400 align:start position:0%
versus New Hampshire with over our
 
01:51:31.510 --> 01:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
governor had over a 100 emergency and
 
01:51:34.069 --> 01:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
executive orders and that was a runaway
 
01:51:37.390 --> 01:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
freight train for the Live Free or Die
 
01:51:41.069 --> 01:51:41.079 align:start position:0%
State that's my litmus test I don't care
 
01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
about we weren't as bad or whatever
 
01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
no we decided we decided to have in our
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
state we we had a an executive brand
 
01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
that picked the winners and the
 
01:51:59.550 --> 01:51:59.560 align:start position:0%
losers and I will never forget
 
01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:02.360 align:start position:0%
that state liquor stores you're all fine
 
01:52:06.790 --> 01:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:09.629 --> 01:52:09.639 align:start position:0%
essential small little mom and top pop
 
01:52:13.870 --> 01:52:13.880 align:start position:0%
restaurant sorry shut it
 
01:52:18.189 --> 01:52:18.199 align:start position:0%
down no I I there's no way I can ever
 
01:52:21.189 --> 01:52:21.199 align:start position:0%
just forget any of
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
that having having a government decide
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
who was essential and who wasn't was out
 
01:52:31.149 --> 01:52:31.159 align:start position:0%
of control and those are the things that
 
01:52:35.229 --> 01:52:35.239 align:start position:0%
to me can never ever happen again so
 
01:52:38.030 --> 01:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
whatever we all the different components
 
01:52:40.950 --> 01:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
of the report that we provide here the
 
01:52:44.270 --> 01:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
most important thing is to say we have
 
01:52:48.430 --> 01:52:48.440 align:start position:0%
to follow the law our foundational law
 
01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:49.350 align:start position:0%
to follow the law our foundational law
our

01:52:49.350 --> 01:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
constitutions we have to have people
 
01:52:53.069 --> 01:52:53.079 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:52:56.430 --> 01:52:56.440 align:start position:0%
Ed that are that take their oath
 
01:53:00.589 --> 01:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
seriously and and then don't uh that
 
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
don't um
 
01:53:07.550 --> 01:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
overextend on people's rights no matter
 
01:53:10.229 --> 01:53:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:12.750 --> 01:53:12.760 align:start position:0%
emergency thank you representative Penza
 
01:53:16.069 --> 01:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
for your opinion
 
01:53:16.079 --> 01:53:20.109 align:start position:0%
for your opinion
um

01:53:20.109 --> 01:53:20.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:23.190 --> 01:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
and I think we need to you
 
01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:24.310 align:start position:0%
and I think we need to you
[Music]

01:53:24.310 --> 01:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:53:26.470 --> 01:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
know I'm not going to say what you said
 
01:53:29.870 --> 01:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
is wrong um but as represent LE has
 
01:53:32.589 --> 01:53:32.599 align:start position:0%
pointed out the first few weeks we just
 
01:53:37.709 --> 01:53:37.719 align:start position:0%
weren't sure um and the big question is
 
01:53:39.589 --> 01:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
is who knew what
 
01:53:43.189 --> 01:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
when and so to say that all decisions
 
01:53:46.030 --> 01:53:46.040 align:start position:0%
were wrong I I would not want to go down
 
01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
that road um because of if something in
 
01:53:53.470 --> 01:53:53.480 align:start position:0%
the future uh that could be worse
 
01:53:56.790 --> 01:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
um however I think finding out the data
 
01:53:58.629 --> 01:53:58.639 align:start position:0%
of who knew what
 
01:54:00.790 --> 01:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
when um is
 
01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:04.149 align:start position:0%
when um is
important

01:54:04.149 --> 01:54:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:06.990 --> 01:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
and represent
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
Belia thank you bam chair and I'd just
 
01:54:12.109 --> 01:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
like to to broaden our look a little bit
 
01:54:13.870 --> 01:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
too because I know that the executive
 
01:54:15.950 --> 01:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
branch catches a lot of flak and I I do
 
01:54:17.629 --> 01:54:17.639 align:start position:0%
think some of that is
 
01:54:20.430 --> 01:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
deserved but we need to look at all I
 
01:54:23.109 --> 01:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
think everything that happened with all
 
01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
the branches of government and I think
 
01:54:27.950 --> 01:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
that really needs to include the fact
 
01:54:31.390 --> 01:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
that we effectively shut down our court
 
01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
system for the entire duration for
 
01:54:37.790 --> 01:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
however a year and a half or more how
 
01:54:41.109 --> 01:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
how much damage was done to our our
 
01:54:43.470 --> 01:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
basic foundational system of justice
 
01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
because we couldn't people didn't have
 
01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:46.189 align:start position:0%
because we couldn't people didn't have
Speedy

01:54:46.189 --> 01:54:46.199 align:start position:0%
Speedy
 
01:54:48.669 --> 01:54:48.679 align:start position:0%
trials uh the ability to bring lawsuits
 
01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
for things was was
 
01:54:53.069 --> 01:54:53.079 align:start position:0%
interrupted uh families needing to go to
 
01:54:55.189 --> 01:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
Family Court to deal with their issues I
 
01:54:59.109 --> 01:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
mean how I it it boggles my mind that
 
01:55:02.669 --> 01:55:02.679 align:start position:0%
the that the pensioner who lost a lot
 
01:55:05.950 --> 01:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
and it was struggling on social security
 
01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
so they had to go get a job as a greeter
 
01:55:10.669 --> 01:55:10.679 align:start position:0%
at Walmart or a bagger at Market Basket
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
is a Frontline employee and they can be
 
01:55:14.069 --> 01:55:14.079 align:start position:0%
there doing their job during the
 
01:55:15.629 --> 01:55:15.639 align:start position:0%
pandemic but we we don't have judges
 
01:55:17.709 --> 01:55:17.719 align:start position:0%
seated at their bench because it's too
 
01:55:20.030 --> 01:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
dangerous I that doesn't make a lot of
 
01:55:21.870 --> 01:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
sense to me maybe maybe for the initial
 
01:55:24.990 --> 01:55:25.000 align:start position:0%
brief per period sure I I can I was I
 
01:55:27.149 --> 01:55:27.159 align:start position:0%
was a little panicked too I and I I'll
 
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
admit that I fell for some of the early
 
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
disinformation and I I was worried and I
 
01:55:33.229 --> 01:55:33.239 align:start position:0%
was watching what happened I was like
 
01:55:35.950 --> 01:55:35.960 align:start position:0%
okay two weeks I can do two weeks we'll
 
01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
we'll kind of evaluate everything and
 
01:55:40.990 --> 01:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
see where we're at um and then that was
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
extended and it was extended
 
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
again and the Judiciary remains shut
 
01:55:49.870 --> 01:55:49.880 align:start position:0%
down the
 
01:55:52.750 --> 01:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
executive um well the executive
 
01:55:54.350 --> 01:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
certainly didn't shut down the executive
 
01:55:55.950 --> 01:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
kicked in the hyper drive and and in
 
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
some ways came became three branches
 
01:55:57.840 --> 01:55:58.830 align:start position:0%
some ways came became three branches
into

01:55:58.830 --> 01:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:56:01.069 --> 01:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
itself and the
 
01:56:03.910 --> 01:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
legislature um eventually got back into
 
01:56:05.629 --> 01:56:05.639 align:start position:0%
you know it got back into session and
 
01:56:07.750 --> 01:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
and did and did work although it was
 
01:56:12.189 --> 01:56:12.199 align:start position:0%
interrupted to some degree um but I I
 
01:56:14.709 --> 01:56:14.719 align:start position:0%
think as a part of our as a part of our
 
01:56:16.990 --> 01:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
charge in investigating the covid
 
01:56:18.830 --> 01:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
response we really need to dive into the
 
01:56:21.189 --> 01:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
Judiciary a little bit and figure out
 
01:56:24.149 --> 01:56:24.159 align:start position:0%
why did anybody believe it was necessary
 
01:56:27.189 --> 01:56:27.199 align:start position:0%
to keep the Judiciary closed for that
 
01:56:30.149 --> 01:56:30.159 align:start position:0%
length of time how many people may have
 
01:56:32.149 --> 01:56:32.159 align:start position:0%
been impacted by not being able to get
 
01:56:34.390 --> 01:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
trials in a speedy fashion as is their
 
01:56:39.109 --> 01:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
constitutional right and everything else
 
01:56:41.750 --> 01:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
that had to do with that and what just
 
01:56:45.550 --> 01:56:45.560 align:start position:0%
what happened there
 
01:56:48.709 --> 01:56:48.719 align:start position:0%
um all good points
 
01:56:52.069 --> 01:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
um as you know this afternoon we'll have
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
um um commissioner Caswell in here
 
01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
talking about the monies that were
 
01:56:58.629 --> 01:56:58.639 align:start position:0%
received and how they were
 
01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
dispensed um on May 31st director buckon
 
01:57:05.629 --> 01:57:05.639 align:start position:0%
from Homeland Security was instrumental
 
01:57:08.189 --> 01:57:08.199 align:start position:0%
in some of the guidance I believe uh
 
01:57:13.790 --> 01:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
will be here to talk with us um we also
 
01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:14.750 align:start position:0%
will be here to talk with us um we also
have

01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
to understand that the executive branch
 
01:57:22.669 --> 01:57:22.679 align:start position:0%
relies on the governmental agencies to
 
01:57:24.270 --> 01:57:24.280 align:start position:0%
make their
 
01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:26.069 align:start position:0%
make their
decisions

01:57:26.069 --> 01:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:57:29.069 --> 01:57:29.079 align:start position:0%
um so if you're relying on your
 
01:57:31.629 --> 01:57:31.639 align:start position:0%
governmental agencies and the
 
01:57:35.229 --> 01:57:35.239 align:start position:0%
CDC and the federal government
 
01:57:38.750 --> 01:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
guidance you better be able to trust the
 
01:57:41.149 --> 01:57:41.159 align:start position:0%
people in your
 
01:57:43.950 --> 01:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
state I'm just going to throw that out
 
01:57:46.830 --> 01:57:46.840 align:start position:0%
there uh representative Penza and then
 
01:57:48.069 --> 01:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
we will break for
 
01:57:50.430 --> 01:57:50.440 align:start position:0%
lunch yeah I just would like to comment
 
01:57:53.669 --> 01:57:53.679 align:start position:0%
on um what represent vure said yeah it
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
didn't fall in that one that was of
 
01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:57.149 align:start position:0%
didn't fall in that one that was of
course

01:57:57.149 --> 01:57:57.159 align:start position:0%
course
 
01:57:59.950 --> 01:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
um what I was you know I was referencing
 
01:58:01.830 --> 01:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
that but the same thing the shutting
 
01:58:04.910 --> 01:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
down of the of the legislature as well
 
01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:07.069 align:start position:0%
down of the of the legislature as well
as

01:58:07.069 --> 01:58:07.079 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
um oh my
 
01:58:10.870 --> 01:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
gosh the
 
01:58:15.149 --> 01:58:15.159 align:start position:0%
judicial we personally we had a a case
 
01:58:16.750 --> 01:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
that was supposed to take place during
 
01:58:19.870 --> 01:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
that time I just have to tell you how
 
01:58:23.390 --> 01:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
difficult it is during Reg regular time
 
01:58:27.229 --> 01:58:27.239 align:start position:0%
for anyone that is not fluent you have
 
01:58:29.790 --> 01:58:29.800 align:start position:0%
to do every you can't talk to the courts
 
01:58:31.550 --> 01:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
directly it's very hard to do that you
 
01:58:33.870 --> 01:58:33.880 align:start position:0%
have to go through an 800 number they
 
01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
have this whole
 
01:58:39.750 --> 01:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
process and then you can't just walk
 
01:58:41.629 --> 01:58:41.639 align:start position:0%
down and fill out paperwork it's
 
01:58:43.550 --> 01:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
extremely hard they push you all
 
01:58:47.350 --> 01:58:47.360 align:start position:0%
everything's online it's all through um
 
01:58:49.310 --> 01:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
this New Hampshire court
 
01:58:52.589 --> 01:58:52.599 align:start position:0%
system and not everyone is is computer
 
01:58:54.950 --> 01:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
savvy like that it's it's not an easy
 
01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
system to work and so you can just
 
01:59:00.550 --> 01:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
imagine that's how it normally is right
 
01:59:05.430 --> 01:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
now it was prior to um the pandemic and
 
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
it is currently like that so you can
 
01:59:09.629 --> 01:59:09.639 align:start position:0%
just imagine there's no there's nobody
 
01:59:12.709 --> 01:59:12.719 align:start position:0%
in the courts no one's and then you're
 
01:59:15.910 --> 01:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
forcing people that don't are not fluid
 
01:59:18.270 --> 01:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
with you know with working and filing
 
01:59:20.229 --> 01:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
and having to attach documents and all
 
01:59:23.069 --> 01:59:23.079 align:start position:0%
of that kind of stuff in an on online
 
01:59:27.470 --> 01:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
system so you could just it's to me um
 
01:59:31.189 --> 01:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
even worse but yeah it was I think it we
 
01:59:33.030 --> 01:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
have to find that information out I
 
01:59:35.069 --> 01:59:35.079 align:start position:0%
think that should all be on the record
 
01:59:37.870 --> 01:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
as well representative Belcher that um
 
01:59:40.270 --> 01:59:40.280 align:start position:0%
exactly how much time I believe it was
 
01:59:43.709 --> 01:59:43.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
half how much Injustice was there for
 
01:59:50.229 --> 01:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
all of those people is is mind-boggling
 
01:59:54.149 --> 01:59:54.159 align:start position:0%
and just my little experience that I had
 
01:59:58.750 --> 01:59:58.760 align:start position:0%
was um debilitating so I can't imagine
 
02:00:02.589 --> 02:00:02.599 align:start position:0%
for serious situations whether it be
 
02:00:04.430 --> 02:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
with with children involved in Family
 
02:00:07.189 --> 02:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
Court I do have to say that when the
 
02:00:10.510 --> 02:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
schools were shut down um and we weren't
 
02:00:13.790 --> 02:00:13.800 align:start position:0%
we were living in Bedford at the time I
 
02:00:16.830 --> 02:00:16.840 align:start position:0%
I talked to several Manchester School
 
02:00:20.790 --> 02:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
teachers they were actually on their own
 
02:00:23.069 --> 02:00:23.079 align:start position:0%
when kids wouldn't show up to class
 
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
online they were driving directly to
 
02:00:28.030 --> 02:00:28.040 align:start position:0%
their homes because they were afraid for
 
02:00:30.990 --> 02:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
their welfare so you can imagine not
 
02:00:34.229 --> 02:00:34.239 align:start position:0%
having all of these things in place um
 
02:00:36.910 --> 02:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
people took it on their own to do things
 
02:00:39.550 --> 02:00:39.560 align:start position:0%
like that I can imagine how many stories
 
02:00:40.750 --> 02:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
I would love to have people in the
 
02:00:42.229 --> 02:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
committee that would talk to us about
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
stuff like that because they were scared
 
02:00:46.470 --> 02:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
for the health and well-being of of
 
02:00:50.790 --> 02:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
children that basically just fell off
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:57.510 --> 02:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
times uh being almost noon time uh we're
 
02:01:00.470 --> 02:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
going to recess until 1:00
 
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:01:20.910 --> 02:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:50.830 align:start position:0%

uh looking over what the state's
 
03:04:40.309 --> 03:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
response was uh how it was handled how
 
03:04:42.630 --> 03:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
it was handled with the citizens of the

03:04:48.190 --> 03:04:48.200 align:start position:0%
story
 
03:04:48.200 --> 03:04:50.190 align:start position:0%
story
of

03:04:50.190 --> 03:04:50.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:04:54.590 --> 03:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
how the vaccine was handled in my case I
 
03:04:56.670 --> 03:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
want to caveat by saying that I'm not a
 
03:05:00.990 --> 03:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
scientist and I'm not uh an expert on on
 
03:05:05.110 --> 03:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
vaccines or so you know I'm not going to
 
03:05:09.070 --> 03:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
claim any expertise or make any claims
 
03:05:12.030 --> 03:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
as to what happened to me but what I can
 
03:05:16.030 --> 03:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
say is that I started
 
03:05:19.510 --> 03:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
off a very Pro vaccine person I I grew
 
03:05:23.269 --> 03:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
up in a in a household that uh wasn't
 
03:05:26.950 --> 03:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
and went to public school and was told
 
03:05:29.670 --> 03:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
that uh I was going to die because my
 
03:05:31.510 --> 03:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
mom didn't give me vaccines that is what
 
03:05:36.110 --> 03:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
I was told by my uh health teacher and
 
03:05:39.110 --> 03:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
as a result I forced my mother to bring
 
03:05:43.389 --> 03:05:43.399 align:start position:0%
me to the doctor and get my vaccines MMR
 
03:05:45.910 --> 03:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
all these things that I hadn't gotten
 
03:05:48.670 --> 03:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
before and that's fine you know nothing
 
03:05:52.309 --> 03:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
as far as I know happened from
 
03:05:56.630 --> 03:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
those during Co in 20120 it was a very
 
03:05:58.910 --> 03:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
intense situation as we all
 
03:05:58.920 --> 03:06:00.429 align:start position:0%
intense situation as we all
remember

03:06:00.429 --> 03:06:00.439 align:start position:0%
remember
 
03:06:05.469 --> 03:06:05.479 align:start position:0%
um people were dying at
 
03:06:07.100 --> 03:06:07.110 align:start position:0%
numbers that
 
03:06:07.110 --> 03:06:10.469 align:start position:0%
numbers that
[Music]

03:06:10.469 --> 03:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:14.910 --> 03:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
we hadn't seen I suppose and um there
 
03:06:17.229 --> 03:06:17.239 align:start position:0%
was a lot of fear about what was going
 
03:06:17.239 --> 03:06:18.830 align:start position:0%
was a lot of fear about what was going
on

03:06:18.830 --> 03:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:06:21.710 --> 03:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
um families were isolated I think of all
 
03:06:24.070 --> 03:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
the people that were in hospitals dying
 
03:06:27.510 --> 03:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
alone I think of all the people that
 
03:06:30.030 --> 03:06:30.040 align:start position:0%
um had their lives stripped away from
 
03:06:33.990 --> 03:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
them their work their livelihoods it was
 
03:06:36.510 --> 03:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
an incredibly uncertain time we all know
 
03:06:38.150 --> 03:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
that I mean it was
 
03:06:42.030 --> 03:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
uh no matter what your opinion is it was
 
03:06:44.429 --> 03:06:44.439 align:start position:0%
one of those things
 
03:06:46.950 --> 03:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
that felt like anything could happen in
 
03:06:50.670 --> 03:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:53.070 --> 03:06:53.080 align:start position:0%
2021 it wasn't
 
03:06:56.550 --> 03:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
until the fall of
 
03:06:59.830 --> 03:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
2021 where I started to seriously
 
03:07:02.429 --> 03:07:02.439 align:start position:0%
consider after having seen the roll out
 
03:07:06.150 --> 03:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
and Etc uh getting my
 
03:07:11.550 --> 03:07:11.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine and I was hesitant because
 
03:07:14.750 --> 03:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh there was such a drum beat towards
 
03:07:17.910 --> 03:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
everybody getting a shot that it made me
 
03:07:22.349 --> 03:07:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:24.950 --> 03:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
country's treatment
 
03:07:27.870 --> 03:07:27.880 align:start position:0%
towards poor and low-income people with
 
03:07:29.670 --> 03:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
the Tuskegee experiment where they
 
03:07:34.309 --> 03:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
injected syphilis into black men without
 
03:07:34.319 --> 03:07:35.110 align:start position:0%
injected syphilis into black men without
their

03:07:35.110 --> 03:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:07:40.910 --> 03:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
consent for experimentation purposes or
 
03:07:44.590 --> 03:07:44.600 align:start position:0%
other experiments done on the public by
 
03:07:49.389 --> 03:07:49.399 align:start position:0%
the United States government or it's
 
03:07:51.670 --> 03:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
Affiliates for experimentation on the
 
03:07:54.309 --> 03:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
public I were those those are all public
 
03:07:56.550 --> 03:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
record I was perfectly aware of those
 
03:07:59.309 --> 03:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
and I was also concerned with the level
 
03:08:00.750 --> 03:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
of control
 
03:08:04.429 --> 03:08:04.439 align:start position:0%
that the people who are pushing these
 
03:08:08.550 --> 03:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
vaccines fiser modna Johnson and Johnson
 
03:08:11.070 --> 03:08:11.080 align:start position:0%
these pharmaceutical companies have uh
 
03:08:13.190 --> 03:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
so much control in our federal
 
03:08:16.750 --> 03:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
government that we know in the cases of
 
03:08:19.870 --> 03:08:19.880 align:start position:0%
the opioid crisis where they told
 
03:08:24.910 --> 03:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
doctors to push the uh opioids they knew
 
03:08:28.269 --> 03:08:28.279 align:start position:0%
people would get addicted to onto the
 
03:08:32.630 --> 03:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
citizenry or any of the other drugs that
 
03:08:34.590 --> 03:08:34.600 align:start position:0%
have been involved in
 
03:08:37.229 --> 03:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
the lawsuits that they've had to pay
 
03:08:39.790 --> 03:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
billions they as an organiz uh as a
 
03:08:42.110 --> 03:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
industry have had to pay billions to the
 
03:08:44.750 --> 03:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
federal government and our taxpayers for
 
03:08:47.990 --> 03:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
doing um billions of dollars in lawsuits
 
03:08:50.950 --> 03:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
around drugs that have hopped clinical
 
03:08:55.550 --> 03:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
trials drugs that have um been rushed
 
03:08:59.469 --> 03:08:59.479 align:start position:0%
through the process and pushed as same
 
03:09:01.190 --> 03:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
words that they use for the vaccine safe
 
03:09:07.349 --> 03:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:09.710 --> 03:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
and there were people in my life who
 
03:09:12.630 --> 03:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
knew that I had an opinion about these
 
03:09:14.910 --> 03:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
things I was concerned
 
03:09:17.710 --> 03:09:17.720 align:start position:0%
about the what I just laid out the as
 
03:09:20.309 --> 03:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
that be and how uh how they've
 
03:09:23.110 --> 03:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
approached this somebody knew that I had
 
03:09:25.870 --> 03:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
those concerns came to me and said well
 
03:09:27.550 --> 03:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
you know throughout a whole conversation
 
03:09:29.630 --> 03:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
we were having a conversation and I I
 
03:09:32.349 --> 03:09:32.359 align:start position:0%
told them why I was feeling
 
03:09:34.510 --> 03:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
hesitant and they brought back to me
 
03:09:37.030 --> 03:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
after hearing my 10 minute long diet
 
03:09:39.309 --> 03:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
tribe about well I'm worried about this
 
03:09:41.030 --> 03:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
I'm worried about that I'm I'm I'm
 
03:09:43.790 --> 03:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
hesitant because I'm looking at this
 
03:09:46.309 --> 03:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
situation where I'm hearing these people
 
03:09:50.910 --> 03:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
say one thing and then uh scientists and
 
03:09:52.950 --> 03:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
the people in the journals notes say a
 
03:09:55.190 --> 03:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
say a totally different thing the
 
03:09:57.750 --> 03:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine stops transmission this was fall
 
03:09:57.760 --> 03:09:58.750 align:start position:0%
vaccine stops transmission this was fall
of

03:09:58.750 --> 03:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:10:02.469 --> 03:10:02.479 align:start position:0%
2021 but we're finding out as the months
 
03:10:06.229 --> 03:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
go on and fall 21 and then in the winter
 
03:10:08.870 --> 03:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
that it actually did
 
03:10:11.670 --> 03:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
not well it's actually because it's
 
03:10:12.910 --> 03:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
going to stop your it's going to lower
 
03:10:14.429 --> 03:10:14.439 align:start position:0%
your risk of
 
03:10:17.309 --> 03:10:17.319 align:start position:0%
hospitalization well there's some
 
03:10:19.590 --> 03:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
evidence contrary to that fact if you're
 
03:10:21.950 --> 03:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
young if you're an older person there's
 
03:10:24.429 --> 03:10:24.439 align:start position:0%
some evidence I that I've seen that
 
03:10:26.830 --> 03:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
suggests that it would help you but if
 
03:10:29.630 --> 03:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
you're a as I was at the time an
 
03:10:32.710 --> 03:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
18-year-old with
 
03:10:35.469 --> 03:10:35.479 align:start position:0%
no ill health effects with a perfectly
 
03:10:35.479 --> 03:10:37.429 align:start position:0%
no ill health effects with a perfectly
healthy

03:10:37.429 --> 03:10:37.439 align:start position:0%
healthy
 
03:10:40.190 --> 03:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
18-year-old it there is no evidence
 
03:10:43.510 --> 03:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily that that risk is uh is
 
03:10:45.670 --> 03:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
higher is what I was seeing at the time
 
03:10:45.680 --> 03:10:47.590 align:start position:0%
higher is what I was seeing at the time
and

03:10:47.590 --> 03:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:10:49.870 --> 03:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
the risk for myocarditis and pyio
 
03:10:52.870 --> 03:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
carditis that was really a big worry of
 
03:10:55.269 --> 03:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
mine as well I liked to run I liked to
 
03:10:57.750 --> 03:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
be active I didn't want to have any
 
03:11:00.429 --> 03:11:00.439 align:start position:0%
cardio problems I told this woman this
 
03:11:02.870 --> 03:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
that we we were having a meeting at in
 
03:11:05.269 --> 03:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
downtown petero I was telling her this
 
03:11:07.429 --> 03:11:07.439 align:start position:0%
and she told me after hearing my
 
03:11:09.950 --> 03:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
concerns well Joanie you have to make a
 
03:11:12.389 --> 03:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
choice because you want to run for
 
03:11:14.349 --> 03:11:14.359 align:start position:0%
office I know and you want to do this
 
03:11:17.030 --> 03:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
and that and you have your job at uh the
 
03:11:18.830 --> 03:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
or organization that I was working for
 
03:11:19.950 --> 03:11:19.960 align:start position:0%
and you're going to have to make a
 
03:11:22.469 --> 03:11:22.479 align:start position:0%
choice because people are going to find
 
03:11:24.670 --> 03:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
out whether or not you're vaccinated so
 
03:11:28.309 --> 03:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to get the vaccine
 
03:11:32.630 --> 03:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
or not and tell people what your choice
 
03:11:36.630 --> 03:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
is sitting there as an 18-year-old with
 
03:11:39.830 --> 03:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
this older woman who I respected at the
 
03:11:44.510 --> 03:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
time telling me that I had no I had to
 
03:11:46.150 --> 03:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
make that op I had to make that decision
 
03:11:47.469 --> 03:11:47.479 align:start position:0%
essentially right there right there then
 
03:11:49.030 --> 03:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not to get that vaccine
 
03:11:51.389 --> 03:11:51.399 align:start position:0%
late fall of
 
03:11:55.030 --> 03:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
2021 um may I ask a question sure thank
 
03:11:57.389 --> 03:11:57.399 align:start position:0%
you so was the condition of your
 
03:12:00.790 --> 03:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
employment um to be vaccinated it was
 
03:12:03.830 --> 03:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
heavily suggested that we get the vacine
 
03:12:04.950 --> 03:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
thank you heavily
 
03:12:07.349 --> 03:12:07.359 align:start position:0%
suggested not mandated but heavily
 
03:12:07.359 --> 03:12:09.030 align:start position:0%
suggested not mandated but heavily
heavily

03:12:09.030 --> 03:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
heavily
 
03:12:13.429 --> 03:12:13.439 align:start position:0%
suggested it there was mandated via I
 
03:12:15.510 --> 03:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
knew at the time I'm not going to be
 
03:12:16.950 --> 03:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
able to go on business trips I'm not
 
03:12:18.670 --> 03:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
going to be able to go to conferences
 
03:12:20.670 --> 03:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
because at the time they were able to
 
03:12:22.510 --> 03:12:22.520 align:start position:0%
say at these conferences you need to
 
03:12:24.990 --> 03:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
have your vaccine shot and they showed
 
03:12:27.309 --> 03:12:27.319 align:start position:0%
the card you needed to show the card Etc
 
03:12:29.389 --> 03:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
so this is running through my mind as
 
03:12:31.550 --> 03:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
she's saying you know you want to run
 
03:12:33.710 --> 03:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
for office you want to have your job
 
03:12:36.389 --> 03:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
here you either get the shot or you
 
03:12:40.070 --> 03:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
don't but just so you know you have a
 
03:12:42.910 --> 03:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
job you want to run for office be aware
 
03:12:44.550 --> 03:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
what the consequences are essentially
 
03:12:48.229 --> 03:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
saying if I don't get the shot then
 
03:12:49.790 --> 03:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
you know just be aware that people will
 
03:12:53.309 --> 03:12:53.319 align:start position:0%
know that and she'll make an effort to
 
03:12:55.670 --> 03:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
tell people that I hadn't gotten the
 
03:12:58.150 --> 03:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
shot so do you feel like that was a form
 
03:13:00.990 --> 03:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
of Co coercion it was definitely a
 
03:13:02.550 --> 03:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
threat it was definitely a threat of
 
03:13:04.190 --> 03:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
some kind she wanted me to get that shot
 
03:13:05.790 --> 03:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
it was bullying it was bullying that's
 
03:13:09.550 --> 03:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
what it was and I sit there as an
 
03:13:12.229 --> 03:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
18-year-old being you know this woman
 
03:13:16.269 --> 03:13:16.279 align:start position:0%
that I respected and I go back to my
 
03:13:18.429 --> 03:13:18.439 align:start position:0%
house and I'm I'm you know wallowing
 
03:13:20.269 --> 03:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
about it I oh my gosh what am I going to
 
03:13:23.190 --> 03:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
do a couple of weeks go by and it was
 
03:13:24.710 --> 03:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
December of
 
03:13:27.150 --> 03:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
2021 and finally after being just
 
03:13:29.110 --> 03:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
disoriented I mean disoriented from the
 
03:13:30.750 --> 03:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
news that was being pushed out
 
03:13:32.750 --> 03:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
disoriented from this woman who kept
 
03:13:35.030 --> 03:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
texting me did you get it yet oh here's
 
03:13:36.590 --> 03:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
the van the van's coming through did you
 
03:13:38.710 --> 03:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
get it yet you know and and making sure
 
03:13:40.510 --> 03:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
that she texted a few other people to
 
03:13:42.550 --> 03:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that they would text me she
 
03:13:44.710 --> 03:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
texted a
 
03:13:47.630 --> 03:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
uh African-American woman in town
 
03:13:50.790 --> 03:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
who because she also had concerns and
 
03:13:52.830 --> 03:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
was able to alleviate that woman's
 
03:13:55.150 --> 03:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
concerns that woman had texted me
 
03:13:58.550 --> 03:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
knowing that she could somehow see there
 
03:14:00.990 --> 03:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
were a lot of people that uh a lot of
 
03:14:04.750 --> 03:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
pressures that were put on me uh in that
 
03:14:07.469 --> 03:14:07.479 align:start position:0%
four or so week period from having the
 
03:14:09.590 --> 03:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
conversation with her
 
03:14:11.950 --> 03:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
and represent Bel apologize for the
 
03:14:13.030 --> 03:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
interruption I just wanted to ask a
 
03:14:14.550 --> 03:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
quick question that's Sor actually two
 
03:14:18.389 --> 03:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
quick questions uh so obviously a lot of
 
03:14:21.710 --> 03:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
pressure around this to get the vaccine
 
03:14:23.150 --> 03:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
I guess my my question would be on on
 
03:14:25.110 --> 03:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
the whole totality of circumstances do
 
03:14:26.110 --> 03:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
you feel
 
03:14:29.389 --> 03:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
like mandates or uh strong
 
03:14:31.830 --> 03:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations that were made by state
 
03:14:34.550 --> 03:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
officials coming from within the state
 
03:14:37.750 --> 03:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
or the federal government CDC um created
 
03:14:39.990 --> 03:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
an environment where you felt like you
 
03:14:42.150 --> 03:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
had to get it in order to move on with
 
03:14:43.510 --> 03:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
the direction of your life that you
 
03:14:46.309 --> 03:14:46.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to go in absolutely and that was
 
03:14:47.590 --> 03:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
the big
 
03:14:49.429 --> 03:14:49.439 align:start position:0%
Crux of the pressure am I going to be
 
03:14:53.469 --> 03:14:53.479 align:start position:0%
able to uh if it's not running for the
 
03:14:55.229 --> 03:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
state house and if I'm not successful in
 
03:14:57.710 --> 03:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
that am I able to hold my job at this
 
03:14:59.990 --> 03:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization am I able to
 
03:15:01.630 --> 03:15:01.640 align:start position:0%
continue to do the good work that I was
 
03:15:03.309 --> 03:15:03.319 align:start position:0%
doing in the national public school
 
03:15:06.550 --> 03:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
system am I able to go to college if I
 
03:15:09.269 --> 03:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to after that no would be the
 
03:15:11.389 --> 03:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
answer to that and follow in that's
 
03:15:12.830 --> 03:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
exactly what I was interested in knowing
 
03:15:14.510 --> 03:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
and if I may quick followup the second
 
03:15:17.229 --> 03:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
the second thing I wanted to ask is now
 
03:15:19.630 --> 03:15:19.640 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that um that this
 
03:15:20.910 --> 03:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
particular person had reached out to
 
03:15:22.229 --> 03:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
another African-American woman in your
 
03:15:24.550 --> 03:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
town alleviated concerns they were also
 
03:15:26.110 --> 03:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
interested in trying to get you to
 
03:15:26.120 --> 03:15:27.070 align:start position:0%
interested in trying to get you to
become

03:15:27.070 --> 03:15:27.080 align:start position:0%
become
 
03:15:30.469 --> 03:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
vaccinated do you have any sense as to
 
03:15:33.110 --> 03:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
whether this had anything to do with
 
03:15:35.229 --> 03:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
what was colloquial known as vaccine
 
03:15:37.790 --> 03:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
Equity e efforts at the time where there
 
03:15:40.590 --> 03:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
was a a push even above and beyond the
 
03:15:42.389 --> 03:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
general population and try to get any
 
03:15:44.229 --> 03:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
minority population vaccinated because
 
03:15:46.389 --> 03:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
they felt like they needed to increase
 
03:15:48.349 --> 03:15:48.359 align:start position:0%
those numbers
 
03:15:50.349 --> 03:15:50.359 align:start position:0%
I don't know if my case is exactly a
 
03:15:52.550 --> 03:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
push in that way I know that that that a
 
03:15:54.670 --> 03:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
woman had reached out to another black
 
03:15:55.830 --> 03:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
woman because she knew that that was
 
03:15:58.269 --> 03:15:58.279 align:start position:0%
going to be helpful for me specifically
 
03:16:00.269 --> 03:16:00.279 align:start position:0%
but I do know what you're talking about
 
03:16:03.510 --> 03:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
and I remember u in that summer and in
 
03:16:06.309 --> 03:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
the summer afterwards hearing about well
 
03:16:07.710 --> 03:16:07.720 align:start position:0%
how are we going to get the black people
 
03:16:10.269 --> 03:16:10.279 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and hearing about watching
 
03:16:12.830 --> 03:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
the video of Anthony fouchy and the
 
03:16:16.110 --> 03:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
mayor of uh Washington DC walk through
 
03:16:19.990 --> 03:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
the um poor areas of Washington DC the
 
03:16:21.790 --> 03:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
more black and poor areas of Washington
 
03:16:23.269 --> 03:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
DC and trying to get these people
 
03:16:25.229 --> 03:16:25.239 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and there was a large push
 
03:16:27.550 --> 03:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
around that but I forget if that was
 
03:16:29.229 --> 03:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
exactly around the same time or I don't
 
03:16:30.590 --> 03:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
think that had anything to do with M
 
03:16:32.389 --> 03:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah and and and just to just
 
03:16:34.110 --> 03:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
added the record we did have a vaccine
 
03:16:35.990 --> 03:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
Equity program in New Hampshire where
 
03:16:38.510 --> 03:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
there was a certain percentage of the
 
03:16:40.189 --> 03:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
total the total vaccines that were
 
03:16:42.550 --> 03:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
available set aside from the
 
03:16:46.189 --> 03:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
general tranch only for minority
 
03:16:49.030 --> 03:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
populations at that time thank you uh
 
03:16:51.309 --> 03:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh represent beler if you can
 
03:16:52.910 --> 03:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
get that dat room put in the records I'd
 
03:16:55.510 --> 03:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate it we'll
 
03:16:59.830 --> 03:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
do so it was December of 2021 and you
 
03:17:01.990 --> 03:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
know all these you know sitting there
 
03:17:03.870 --> 03:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
wallowing about all these pressures and
 
03:17:05.590 --> 03:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
you know even my mother at the same time
 
03:17:08.590 --> 03:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
was I might get it myself I had went to
 
03:17:10.189 --> 03:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
her about this I might get it myself
 
03:17:12.710 --> 03:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
because I I need to travel too and if I
 
03:17:14.389 --> 03:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
have to go to Chicago or something like
 
03:17:16.110 --> 03:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
that I might need it you know worried
 
03:17:21.189 --> 03:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
about the idea that there might be some
 
03:17:23.710 --> 03:17:23.720 align:start position:0%
requirement uh to get a vaccine to
 
03:17:23.720 --> 03:17:25.910 align:start position:0%
requirement uh to get a vaccine to
travel

03:17:25.910 --> 03:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
travel
 
03:17:31.309 --> 03:17:31.319 align:start position:0%
um and I it was a funny enough it was it
 
03:17:33.550 --> 03:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
was a rainy day and I had just driven I
 
03:17:34.910 --> 03:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
know I knew that there was some clinic
 
03:17:36.950 --> 03:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
in a new ipswitch
 
03:17:39.670 --> 03:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
and honestly all I can say is I was
 
03:17:43.750 --> 03:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
disoriented and not making
 
03:17:46.229 --> 03:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh I wasn't in the right decision
 
03:17:48.790 --> 03:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
mindset I was thinking that my whole
 
03:17:51.950 --> 03:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
life was uh based off of whether or not
 
03:17:54.150 --> 03:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
I could get it I was thinking if somehow
 
03:17:56.590 --> 03:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
I could get somebody you know I hate to
 
03:17:58.510 --> 03:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
admit this on on the public record but I
 
03:17:59.990 --> 03:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
think it was a consideration that a lot
 
03:18:02.070 --> 03:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
of people made so I I'm going to include
 
03:18:04.950 --> 03:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
it in the story but um there were people
 
03:18:07.429 --> 03:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
that came to me who were so
 
03:18:10.389 --> 03:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
antiva KN friends of mine that knew that
 
03:18:12.429 --> 03:18:12.439 align:start position:0%
I was considering it and said no I'll
 
03:18:16.150 --> 03:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
get you a fake vaccine card but you know
 
03:18:17.710 --> 03:18:17.720 align:start position:0%
you hear about the fact that you're
 
03:18:19.790 --> 03:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
going to be put in prison for having one
 
03:18:21.030 --> 03:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
of those you know I don't know if that
 
03:18:22.990 --> 03:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
was true or not but you I remember
 
03:18:25.429 --> 03:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
seeing that on the news and thinking to
 
03:18:26.790 --> 03:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
myself well I'm not getting put in
 
03:18:30.229 --> 03:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
prison over over this um you know being
 
03:18:33.510 --> 03:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
an 18-year-old who wasn't able to make
 
03:18:36.950 --> 03:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh that proper decision on his own I
 
03:18:41.110 --> 03:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
hopped in my car and I drove
 
03:18:45.710 --> 03:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
to the clinic in newp switch and
 
03:18:49.349 --> 03:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
um you know almost walked out but kept
 
03:18:49.359 --> 03:18:50.269 align:start position:0%
um you know almost walked out but kept
in

03:18:50.269 --> 03:18:50.279 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:18:54.070 --> 03:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
line and I I got my shot and the woman
 
03:18:55.950 --> 03:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
you know grabbed my arm and
 
03:18:59.349 --> 03:18:59.359 align:start position:0%
she the VAC the administration of the
 
03:18:59.359 --> 03:19:00.630 align:start position:0%
she the VAC the administration of the
shot

03:19:00.630 --> 03:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
shot
 
03:19:03.550 --> 03:19:03.560 align:start position:0%
was as far as I knew fine it was quick
 
03:19:07.710 --> 03:19:07.720 align:start position:0%
but it was fine uh represent
 
03:19:10.670 --> 03:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
Venza so we've had a lot of uh hearings
 
03:19:12.389 --> 03:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
and especially for yesterday we've a lot
 
03:19:16.269 --> 03:19:16.279 align:start position:0%
of discussion about um informed consent
 
03:19:20.510 --> 03:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
and all of that so uh I assume you got
 
03:19:22.710 --> 03:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
two shots probably one okay so you got
 
03:19:26.030 --> 03:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
one um did you were you provided with
 
03:19:29.269 --> 03:19:29.279 align:start position:0%
before that person um was it you know
 
03:19:32.189 --> 03:19:32.199 align:start position:0%
was it a medical professional or no that
 
03:19:36.349 --> 03:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
that she was a nurse practitioner if I'm
 
03:19:38.469 --> 03:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
it was a it was through the manad
 
03:19:41.150 --> 03:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
community hospital system yeah so were
 
03:19:43.309 --> 03:19:43.319 align:start position:0%
you provided with like a you know like a
 
03:19:46.830 --> 03:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
sheet that told you of all the
 
03:19:49.790 --> 03:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
everything so so you weren't given any
 
03:19:52.030 --> 03:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
information no no informed consent
 
03:19:54.950 --> 03:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
document no informed consent document no
 
03:19:59.229 --> 03:19:59.239 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you and
 
03:20:02.510 --> 03:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
um you know she grabbed the arm
 
03:20:05.710 --> 03:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
and gave me the shot told me to sit down
 
03:20:07.469 --> 03:20:07.479 align:start position:0%
in the room that they had right there
 
03:20:09.710 --> 03:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
and I sat down for 10 or so minutes just
 
03:20:11.830 --> 03:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure that I wouldn't pass out I
 
03:20:14.110 --> 03:20:14.120 align:start position:0%
suppose is what the procedure was and
 
03:20:16.309 --> 03:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
then once I was able to I got up I asked
 
03:20:18.229 --> 03:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
him if I could leave I left went into my
 
03:20:21.189 --> 03:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
car went home uh threw up immediately
 
03:20:23.189 --> 03:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
when I got home I don't know if it was
 
03:20:25.429 --> 03:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
nerves or or what it was but that that
 
03:20:28.790 --> 03:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
did happen and for about two months
 
03:20:30.550 --> 03:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
afterwards it was fine I had no no
 
03:20:31.910 --> 03:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
symptoms or anything like that I
 
03:20:33.269 --> 03:20:33.279 align:start position:0%
actually had kind of forgotten that I
 
03:20:36.189 --> 03:20:36.199 align:start position:0%
had gotten the shot first week I was all
 
03:20:38.349 --> 03:20:38.359 align:start position:0%
oh my gosh about it but as soon as there
 
03:20:41.229 --> 03:20:41.239 align:start position:0%
was nothing happening I was I I I my
 
03:20:43.110 --> 03:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
concerns were alleviated I said to
 
03:20:45.830 --> 03:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
myself all my hesitancy is fine I I
 
03:20:47.670 --> 03:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
don't know what I was worrying
 
03:20:55.189 --> 03:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
about then March of 2022 happened and um
 
03:20:58.510 --> 03:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
I woke up one day with what I can only
 
03:21:01.670 --> 03:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
describe as heart palpitations I woke up
 
03:21:05.750 --> 03:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh with my heart with a irregular beat
 
03:21:09.670 --> 03:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
um my chest was tight yeah sure oh yeah

03:21:29.870 --> 03:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
same from that point on there was
 
03:21:31.910 --> 03:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
numbness in my arm the left arm where I
 
03:21:37.550 --> 03:21:37.560 align:start position:0%

Buzz

03:21:56.150 --> 03:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
Buzz
 
03:21:59.990 --> 03:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:02.990 --> 03:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
until the summer where it got really bad
 
03:22:06.189 --> 03:22:06.199 align:start position:0%
I was running for election walking
 
03:22:09.910 --> 03:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
around and you my office job became a
 
03:22:12.950 --> 03:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
lot more active um so I was out and
 
03:22:15.389 --> 03:22:15.399 align:start position:0%
about I was up I was doing things and
 
03:22:17.750 --> 03:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
there were a number of times where and
 
03:22:21.670 --> 03:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
mind you I was an active kid until I I
 
03:22:23.510 --> 03:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
didn't have I wasn't sick didn't have
 
03:22:25.510 --> 03:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
the flu since fourth grade when I got it
 
03:22:29.269 --> 03:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
really bad and uh never had it since
 
03:22:31.110 --> 03:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
perfectly healthy kid never had a one
 
03:22:32.550 --> 03:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
problem what whatsoever other than a
 
03:22:35.750 --> 03:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
stigmatism in my eyes and maybe some
 
03:22:39.790 --> 03:22:39.800 align:start position:0%
migraines and here I am walking doors
 
03:22:43.469 --> 03:22:43.479 align:start position:0%
and not able to make it two miles
 
03:22:45.429 --> 03:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
without having to sit
 
03:22:49.349 --> 03:22:49.359 align:start position:0%
down knowing I I can feel for myself I
 
03:22:51.590 --> 03:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
knew my body I knew that my stamina had
 
03:22:53.830 --> 03:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
gone down that my ability to stand up
 
03:22:56.309 --> 03:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
and be up for a while had gone down that
 
03:22:59.349 --> 03:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
my ability to be as active as I was had
 
03:23:02.510 --> 03:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
gone down that my strength had gone down
 
03:23:05.990 --> 03:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
that I was weaker than than I used to be
 
03:23:09.030 --> 03:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
um I was eating just as much spinach as
 
03:23:11.269 --> 03:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
I had when I was 17 years old I don't
 
03:23:13.750 --> 03:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
know necessarily what had changed I had
 
03:23:15.630 --> 03:23:15.640 align:start position:0%
a perfectly healthy diet I grew up with
 
03:23:19.590 --> 03:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
a mother who apprenticed under Hoshi
 
03:23:21.870 --> 03:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
Hayashi was a famous chef here in hker
 
03:23:23.750 --> 03:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know I I grew up with great food and
 
03:23:25.670 --> 03:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
it was well well ate I had good
 
03:23:28.590 --> 03:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
nutrition good diet that hadn't changed
 
03:23:32.910 --> 03:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
nothing about my life my diet anything
 
03:23:34.429 --> 03:23:34.439 align:start position:0%
had changed other than the fact that I
 
03:23:36.510 --> 03:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
had gotten the vaccine so when I'm
 
03:23:39.030 --> 03:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
walking around here in the summer
 
03:23:41.590 --> 03:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
Sweating Bullets like never before
 
03:23:45.590 --> 03:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
unable to walk as I used to run as I
 
03:23:47.950 --> 03:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
used to be active as I used to swim as I
 
03:23:50.750 --> 03:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
used to bike as I used to feeling the
 
03:23:52.229 --> 03:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
difference when I'm doing these things
 
03:23:54.429 --> 03:23:54.439 align:start position:0%
in the summer feeling the difference
 
03:23:57.269 --> 03:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
when I'm going around driving and I can
 
03:23:59.349 --> 03:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
feel on my arm the numbness and I can
 
03:24:02.750 --> 03:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
feel in my chest that slight pain and
 
03:24:04.910 --> 03:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
thinking to myself
 
03:24:08.349 --> 03:24:08.359 align:start position:0%
well what could this be what could this
 
03:24:13.269 --> 03:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
be and and yes Madam chair I did think
 
03:24:15.550 --> 03:24:15.560 align:start position:0%
maybe it's the vaccine I have no
 
03:24:18.510 --> 03:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
evidence for this it is purely anecdotal
 
03:24:21.550 --> 03:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
but given the fact that that is the only
 
03:24:27.150 --> 03:24:27.160 align:start position:0%
thing in my life at that point that had
 
03:24:29.990 --> 03:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
changed I that was was a consideration
 
03:24:30.000 --> 03:24:31.269 align:start position:0%
changed I that was was a consideration
of

03:24:31.269 --> 03:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:24:35.110 --> 03:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
mine that lasted up until about April of
 
03:24:38.910 --> 03:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
2023 the shooting pain the numbness es
 
03:24:42.070 --> 03:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
and flows and when the winter had
 
03:24:44.150 --> 03:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
started up again and I had was less
 
03:24:47.790 --> 03:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
active Fallen winter um it was not as
 
03:24:49.910 --> 03:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
prevalent and actually had kind of
 
03:24:52.750 --> 03:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
slipped my mind as we the craziness of
 
03:24:55.389 --> 03:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
being a Freshman legislator came about
 
03:24:57.429 --> 03:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
you know we get elected and we're swept
 
03:24:59.670 --> 03:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
up in the orientation of it all and
 
03:25:02.349 --> 03:25:02.359 align:start position:0%
getting your you know swept up in in
 
03:25:06.030 --> 03:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
everything um I had forgotten about it
 
03:25:07.309 --> 03:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact sometimes there
 
03:25:10.189 --> 03:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
would be a pain and I go o but you know
 
03:25:11.910 --> 03:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
for the most part I'd forgotten about it
 
03:25:14.229 --> 03:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
now did you ever go to the doctor uh for
 
03:25:16.550 --> 03:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
this I did that's a good point actually
 
03:25:20.070 --> 03:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
had forgotten about that in Fall of 2022
 
03:25:21.830 --> 03:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
right before the election I had gone to
 
03:25:24.429 --> 03:25:24.439 align:start position:0%
my primary care doctor about this
 
03:25:27.710 --> 03:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
because it was really you know it this
 
03:25:29.870 --> 03:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
was popping off as the election had
 
03:25:31.469 --> 03:25:31.479 align:start position:0%
really heated up as we were really you
 
03:25:33.990 --> 03:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
know large schedule at work it was
 
03:25:35.910 --> 03:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
really just a busy season and I I think
 
03:25:37.990 --> 03:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
part of that could have been stress
 
03:25:39.950 --> 03:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
although I didn't feel too stressed out
 
03:25:41.110 --> 03:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necessarily mean you
 
03:25:42.910 --> 03:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
weren't stressed but I I didn't feel
 
03:25:45.349 --> 03:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
stressed felt pretty calm I know what
 
03:25:46.950 --> 03:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
stress is I've had
 
03:25:48.710 --> 03:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
you know moments of stress very
 
03:25:51.670 --> 03:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
stressful moments in my life before um I
 
03:25:53.710 --> 03:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
went to my doctor about it he had said
 
03:25:55.710 --> 03:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
oh maybe it's
 
03:25:58.269 --> 03:25:58.279 align:start position:0%
stress being very dismissive I told him
 
03:25:59.870 --> 03:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
the whole thing I said I'm getting pains
 
03:26:02.269 --> 03:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
in my chest I have a numbness in my arm
 
03:26:03.910 --> 03:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
I I you know and I
 
03:26:06.870 --> 03:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
said look doctor I'm I'm not trying to
 
03:26:10.070 --> 03:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
be an antivaxer here I I I got the shot
 
03:26:11.710 --> 03:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to be an antivaxer
 
03:26:14.189 --> 03:26:14.199 align:start position:0%
I had you know he was the same doctor
 
03:26:15.750 --> 03:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
that had given me Shots before when I
 
03:26:17.229 --> 03:26:17.239 align:start position:0%
had come
 
03:26:19.510 --> 03:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh whatever that was like seventh grade
 
03:26:21.550 --> 03:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
when I had you know forced my mom to
 
03:26:23.830 --> 03:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
bring me to the VAC uh the doctor to get
 
03:26:25.670 --> 03:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
some vaccines because I was all worried
 
03:26:28.269 --> 03:26:28.279 align:start position:0%
about it uh he you know trying to tell
 
03:26:32.070 --> 03:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
him I I am not an antivaxer here but
 
03:26:33.750 --> 03:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
doctor when the only thing that has
 
03:26:35.150 --> 03:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
changed in my life is the vaccine and
 
03:26:36.870 --> 03:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
now here I
 
03:26:40.349 --> 03:26:40.359 align:start position:0%
am passing out close to it on the side
 
03:26:44.030 --> 03:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
of the road and Sharon walking in 75
 
03:26:46.750 --> 03:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
degree heat not even that hot and
 
03:26:50.309 --> 03:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
I used to be able to you know
 
03:26:53.950 --> 03:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
Run Forever never stop you know perfect
 
03:26:55.990 --> 03:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
endurance obviously a little bit of an
 
03:26:58.429 --> 03:26:58.439 align:start position:0%
exaggeration but what's happening here
 
03:27:00.670 --> 03:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
oh well you know I have one other kid
 
03:27:02.990 --> 03:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
who's with me who might be going through
 
03:27:05.189 --> 03:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
the same thing nothing to worry about
 
03:27:07.910 --> 03:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's what I was told no followup no oh
 
03:27:09.670 --> 03:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
we'll do this test or that test there
 
03:27:13.110 --> 03:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
was just it's nothing to worry about
 
03:27:15.309 --> 03:27:15.319 align:start position:0%
could be stress if it's not stressed
 
03:27:17.309 --> 03:27:17.319 align:start position:0%
it's nothing to worry about about come
 
03:27:20.030 --> 03:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
back if things get
 
03:27:22.349 --> 03:27:22.359 align:start position:0%
worse I didn't know what to say I didn't
 
03:27:24.910 --> 03:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
want to be you know forceful about it I
 
03:27:26.030 --> 03:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
didn't want to
 
03:27:28.910 --> 03:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
be I didn't know what to say I was a
 
03:27:31.429 --> 03:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
19-year-old with no medical history and
 
03:27:34.670 --> 03:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
no ability to question what uh this
 
03:27:36.670 --> 03:27:36.680 align:start position:0%
doctor was saying to me right there
 
03:27:40.870 --> 03:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
right then so I had left and didn't go
 
03:27:46.630 --> 03:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
back so now we're here in April of 202 3
 
03:27:48.349 --> 03:27:48.359 align:start position:0%
after forgetting about it after the
 
03:27:50.590 --> 03:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
craziness of the session there was some
 
03:27:53.630 --> 03:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
you know moments of numbness but it
 
03:27:56.990 --> 03:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
mostly had gone away until I think it
 
03:27:59.150 --> 03:27:59.160 align:start position:0%
was the third week in April of last year
 
03:28:01.710 --> 03:28:01.720 align:start position:0%
and I was in the uh state house right
 
03:28:04.910 --> 03:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
here outside of Room
 
03:28:08.150 --> 03:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
101 uh this the senate committee room
 
03:28:10.830 --> 03:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
right there talking to my chairman and
 
03:28:12.670 --> 03:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
Chris Schultz and all three of us were
 
03:28:15.710 --> 03:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
talking and I had woken up that day
 
03:28:18.030 --> 03:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
actually I got to start with the with
 
03:28:19.389 --> 03:28:19.399 align:start position:0%
how I woke up I woken up that day
 
03:28:22.309 --> 03:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
feeling not great and it took me about
 
03:28:24.510 --> 03:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
an extra 30 minutes to get out of get
 
03:28:26.670 --> 03:28:26.680 align:start position:0%
out of the house but I did I you know
 
03:28:28.710 --> 03:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
got out of the house drank my water ate
 
03:28:31.630 --> 03:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
a banana or whatever I had that day and
 
03:28:33.670 --> 03:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
got up and out of the house and the
 
03:28:36.110 --> 03:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
feeling had gone away until it was you
 
03:28:38.389 --> 03:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
know about 1:30 when I had been standing
 
03:28:40.309 --> 03:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
there with my chairman and Chris Schultz
 
03:28:42.590 --> 03:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
we were talking in the
 
03:28:46.150 --> 03:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
hallway excuse me and out of nowhere I
 
03:28:49.550 --> 03:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
get shooting pain in my chest my heart
 
03:28:51.469 --> 03:28:51.479 align:start position:0%
gets tight is the only way I can
 
03:28:57.630 --> 03:28:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:00.550 --> 03:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh it was a very it was an incredibly
 
03:29:03.030 --> 03:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
intense feeling of just you know it was
 
03:29:06.670 --> 03:29:06.680 align:start position:0%
like a an instant flu like an
 
03:29:11.229 --> 03:29:11.239 align:start position:0%
instant my my body went cold I I got
 
03:29:13.750 --> 03:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
Shivers I started to cold sweat I my my
 
03:29:16.910 --> 03:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
test was my chest was tight I
 
03:29:19.590 --> 03:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
you know my first thought Madam chair
 
03:29:22.790 --> 03:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
was I'm having a heart attack my second
 
03:29:25.710 --> 03:29:25.720 align:start position:0%
thought was shut up you're 19 years old
 
03:29:27.429 --> 03:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
you know you're probably you know
 
03:29:29.870 --> 03:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
something this or that you know or I was
 
03:29:33.389 --> 03:29:33.399 align:start position:0%
20 at the time
 
03:29:37.469 --> 03:29:37.479 align:start position:0%
and all I could do was sit down at the
 
03:29:39.269 --> 03:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
at the bench I didn't I didn't cause a
 
03:29:42.030 --> 03:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
panic you know I was it hurt it did hurt
 
03:29:43.469 --> 03:29:43.479 align:start position:0%
but I didn't want to cause a panic I
 
03:29:47.070 --> 03:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
figured cuz I've had you know
 
03:29:48.910 --> 03:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
migraines that have been pretty painful
 
03:29:53.389 --> 03:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
before so it wasn't wasn't like a I felt
 
03:29:54.830 --> 03:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
like maybe I'll pass out and then I'll
 
03:29:56.710 --> 03:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
be fine that that's what it felt like it
 
03:30:00.790 --> 03:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
felt like a nausea that wouldn't NE a
 
03:30:02.469 --> 03:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
nausea that wouldn't result in a throw
 
03:30:04.870 --> 03:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
up it it's a hard feeling to describe
 
03:30:09.189 --> 03:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
it's really it was it was
 
03:30:13.070 --> 03:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh trying to think about it now was it
 
03:30:14.389 --> 03:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
it was scary
 
03:30:16.630 --> 03:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
honestly I sit down and I didn't want to
 
03:30:18.670 --> 03:30:18.680 align:start position:0%
cause alarm I sit down at the bench
 
03:30:19.790 --> 03:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
right there Chris Schultz and the
 
03:30:21.389 --> 03:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
chairman are still
 
03:30:24.189 --> 03:30:24.199 align:start position:0%
talking I'm sitting there for what was
 
03:30:27.590 --> 03:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
maybe five to 10 minutes of just me
 
03:30:29.830 --> 03:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
listening to this conversation as I can
 
03:30:31.790 --> 03:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
barely see my eyes have gone tunnel
 
03:30:34.269 --> 03:30:34.279 align:start position:0%
vision I'm sitting there cold sweat in
 
03:30:36.870 --> 03:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
pain I didn't know what to do I I really
 
03:30:38.389 --> 03:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
kind of felt like I was dying and I just
 
03:30:41.950 --> 03:30:41.960 align:start position:0%
sort of sat there in the in the in the
 
03:30:45.349 --> 03:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
bench uh not wanting to cause alarm not
 
03:30:46.950 --> 03:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
wanting to
 
03:30:49.389 --> 03:30:49.399 align:start position:0%
just sort of sitting there with myself
 
03:30:51.670 --> 03:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
in pain thinking
 
03:30:51.680 --> 03:30:53.349 align:start position:0%
in pain thinking
about

03:30:53.349 --> 03:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:30:55.990 --> 03:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know am I GNA die here in the
 
03:30:59.110 --> 03:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
goddamn State House hallway like
 
03:31:01.229 --> 03:31:01.239 align:start position:0%
geez and
 
03:31:05.229 --> 03:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
um so after about 10 minutes or so the
 
03:31:07.750 --> 03:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
feeling had kind of gone away I was just
 
03:31:09.349 --> 03:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
praying as much as I could and I was
 
03:31:11.990 --> 03:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
just praying to God I was just standing
 
03:31:17.510 --> 03:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:18.590 --> 03:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know I was thinking about a lot
 
03:31:20.070 --> 03:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
of things in that 10 minutes but I was
 
03:31:21.630 --> 03:31:21.640 align:start position:0%
listening to their conversation I was
 
03:31:23.469 --> 03:31:23.479 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
03:31:26.189 --> 03:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
just please Lord let this feeling go
 
03:31:29.990 --> 03:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
away eventually the cold sweat had kind
 
03:31:32.590 --> 03:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
of mitigated gone away you know
 
03:31:35.830 --> 03:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
dissipated a little bit the nausea
 
03:31:38.429 --> 03:31:38.439 align:start position:0%
feeling had gone away sufficient enough
 
03:31:40.950 --> 03:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
to where I could walk into the anti room
 
03:31:43.510 --> 03:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
of the State House I laid down there at
 
03:31:45.070 --> 03:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
one of the benches of the anti room and
 
03:31:46.710 --> 03:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
I sat there on my my computer for maybe
 
03:31:48.710 --> 03:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
two hour two two hours two and a half
 
03:31:50.870 --> 03:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
hours or so I I felt good enough to
 
03:31:53.710 --> 03:31:53.720 align:start position:0%
stand up I felt good enough to walk so I
 
03:31:58.229 --> 03:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
figured I'm fine and I sat there in the
 
03:32:00.309 --> 03:32:00.319 align:start position:0%
anti room I didn't feel fine enough to
 
03:32:02.630 --> 03:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
drive but I I sat there in the anti room
 
03:32:04.750 --> 03:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
for a little bit did my work on the
 
03:32:07.550 --> 03:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
computer until I did got in my car went
 
03:32:09.990 --> 03:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
home didn't tell nobody or nothing about
 
03:32:12.150 --> 03:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
it because I was worried I didn't want
 
03:32:13.790 --> 03:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:32:16.309 --> 03:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh I didn't want to cause a l arm I
 
03:32:17.990 --> 03:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
didn't want people to
 
03:32:20.349 --> 03:32:20.359 align:start position:0%
say one thing or the other oh you're
 
03:32:24.349 --> 03:32:24.359 align:start position:0%
just being young and crazy you you know
 
03:32:27.030 --> 03:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
the hell is a 19-year-old having a an
 
03:32:28.349 --> 03:32:28.359 align:start position:0%
attack like this I don't know if it was
 
03:32:29.750 --> 03:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
a heart attack or not I don't know what
 
03:32:31.389 --> 03:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
happened but what the hell is a
 
03:32:32.910 --> 03:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
19-year-old having
 
03:32:36.389 --> 03:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
a something like that happen you know
 
03:32:40.070 --> 03:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
and I told one person about it some a
 
03:32:43.309 --> 03:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
colleague of mine here and their
 
03:32:45.910 --> 03:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
immediate response was I was a panic
 
03:32:47.110 --> 03:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
attack it was
 
03:32:49.510 --> 03:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
stress and I said to them well I feel
 
03:32:51.309 --> 03:32:51.319 align:start position:0%
like I would have to have been panicked
 
03:32:53.790 --> 03:32:53.800 align:start position:0%
or stressed for that thing to have been
 
03:32:55.510 --> 03:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
a panic attack or a stress attack and I
 
03:32:57.309 --> 03:32:57.319 align:start position:0%
know what a panic or stress attack is
 
03:32:59.070 --> 03:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
and I wasn't panicked or stressed I was
 
03:33:01.670 --> 03:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
perfectly calm and content in fact I was
 
03:33:04.349 --> 03:33:04.359 align:start position:0%
just trying to think about my own
 
03:33:07.150 --> 03:33:07.160 align:start position:0%
mortality as a 19-year-old and Ponder
 
03:33:09.910 --> 03:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
the life in which I lived and how it
 
03:33:12.990 --> 03:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
ended here in the State House
 
03:33:15.429 --> 03:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
hallway I wasn't panicked at all I was
 
03:33:19.309 --> 03:33:19.319 align:start position:0%
just amazed at that that was that was
 
03:33:21.910 --> 03:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
the culmination of of n of 20
 
03:33:23.950 --> 03:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
years and
 
03:33:26.389 --> 03:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
um so I continued to not tell people
 
03:33:27.910 --> 03:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
about it because that was someone's in
 
03:33:29.349 --> 03:33:29.359 align:start position:0%
initial reaction I told that person
 
03:33:31.630 --> 03:33:31.640 align:start position:0%
maybe two days after it had happened I
 
03:33:34.150 --> 03:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
told my mom maybe two weeks after it
 
03:33:37.790 --> 03:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
happened I told my grandmother I I know
 
03:33:39.189 --> 03:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
they were like oh you should go to the
 
03:33:40.469 --> 03:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
doctor and say something about it to
 
03:33:45.429 --> 03:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
them I did they dismissed it again as I
 
03:33:47.630 --> 03:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
saw well I will but I I'm pretty sure
 
03:33:50.150 --> 03:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
they're going to dismiss it I did they
 
03:33:52.550 --> 03:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
dismissed it Panic or stress attack they
 
03:33:54.950 --> 03:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
said don't worry about it
 
03:33:54.960 --> 03:33:56.990 align:start position:0%
said don't worry about it
and

03:33:56.990 --> 03:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:33:59.750 --> 03:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
just not knowing you really well but
 
03:34:02.189 --> 03:34:02.199 align:start position:0%
seeing you around the state
 
03:34:04.950 --> 03:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
house you do not look like someone who
 
03:34:08.590 --> 03:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
panics or stresses very easily you are
 
03:34:12.030 --> 03:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
to me a very calm and
 
03:34:14.710 --> 03:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
even individual I appreciate that
 
03:34:17.070 --> 03:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
representative kto I I would agree with
 
03:34:19.189 --> 03:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
that I I think I am you know I'm a
 
03:34:22.790 --> 03:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
meditator I I I'm a breather you know I
 
03:34:25.469 --> 03:34:25.479 align:start position:0%
I think I am pretty calm especially with
 
03:34:26.790 --> 03:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
some some of the things that happened I
 
03:34:29.870 --> 03:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
could be a lot less calm that's for sure
 
03:34:31.389 --> 03:34:31.399 align:start position:0%
represent a
 
03:34:34.110 --> 03:34:34.120 align:start position:0%
Penza so I just want to time frame wise
 
03:34:38.750 --> 03:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
I kind of want to place this so um so
 
03:34:40.910 --> 03:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
the shot
 
03:34:43.950 --> 03:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
was like end of December right December
 
03:34:46.910 --> 03:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
of 21 21 y so shop was end of December
 
03:34:50.870 --> 03:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
21 and then they started like end of
 
03:34:53.429 --> 03:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
February or or March or something like
 
03:34:55.110 --> 03:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
that a couple months after you said I
 
03:34:57.510 --> 03:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
had the shot on December 21 there was a
 
03:35:00.189 --> 03:35:00.199 align:start position:0%
year of the 2022 year was the numbness
 
03:35:02.150 --> 03:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
and the pain in the chest and then in
 
03:35:04.790 --> 03:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
2023 April of 23 that was when that
 
03:35:07.510 --> 03:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
event had happened okay in the doctor
 
03:35:08.870 --> 03:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
piece because I think that that's
 
03:35:10.950 --> 03:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
probably the most important out of this
 
03:35:12.910 --> 03:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
whole conversation so when you went to
 
03:35:16.229 --> 03:35:16.239 align:start position:0%
the doctor which was not even
 
03:35:18.189 --> 03:35:18.199 align:start position:0%
not even a year it would have been in
 
03:35:19.910 --> 03:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
the fall it it would have been maybe
 
03:35:21.990 --> 03:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
seven months seven or eight months seven
 
03:35:24.670 --> 03:35:24.680 align:start position:0%
months so that was and you went and you
 
03:35:27.750 --> 03:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
you know whatever brushed it off now the
 
03:35:27.760 --> 03:35:29.110 align:start position:0%
you know whatever brushed it off now the
second

03:35:29.110 --> 03:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
second
 
03:35:31.269 --> 03:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
time I don't even want to excuse the
 
03:35:34.269 --> 03:35:34.279 align:start position:0%
first time but the second time if this
 
03:35:36.269 --> 03:35:36.279 align:start position:0%
was a a practitioner just a regular
 
03:35:38.429 --> 03:35:38.439 align:start position:0%
general practitioner immediately that
 
03:35:40.670 --> 03:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
should have been a flag to bring you
 
03:35:43.710 --> 03:35:43.720 align:start position:0%
into a cardiologist point so there was
 
03:35:45.269 --> 03:35:45.279 align:start position:0%
no mention of that you should have had
 
03:35:46.910 --> 03:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
scin hands you should have had all of
 
03:35:48.950 --> 03:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
that at that point especially if you
 
03:35:51.950 --> 03:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
were I I believe you probably had a
 
03:35:55.590 --> 03:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
minor um heart attack so and there was
 
03:35:57.910 --> 03:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
no mention of tests there was no mention
 
03:36:00.590 --> 03:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
of followup it was you probably had a
 
03:36:05.670 --> 03:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:09.590 --> 03:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
it and uh you know luckily I think that
 
03:36:11.389 --> 03:36:11.399 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
03:36:14.030 --> 03:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
what I feel much better after that it
 
03:36:15.910 --> 03:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
happened in April of 23 and the summer
 
03:36:19.229 --> 03:36:19.239 align:start position:0%
of 2023 was was fine and the numbness
 
03:36:20.870 --> 03:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
still exists but
 
03:36:23.389 --> 03:36:23.399 align:start position:0%
it's way less you know sometimes when
 
03:36:24.990 --> 03:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about it like before I came
 
03:36:26.550 --> 03:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
here before I'm about to tell this story
 
03:36:28.110 --> 03:36:28.120 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about it so on the way up
 
03:36:29.790 --> 03:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
here I was like thinking about and you
 
03:36:32.469 --> 03:36:32.479 align:start position:0%
know I could feel it in my arm but ever
 
03:36:35.710 --> 03:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
since then it's been decently all right
 
03:36:37.750 --> 03:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
there's been some moments where I if I
 
03:36:40.110 --> 03:36:40.120 align:start position:0%
really really work myself where I can
 
03:36:43.550 --> 03:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
I'm oh I got to sit down and I I I don't
 
03:36:45.590 --> 03:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
have my strength as I used to I don't
 
03:36:48.550 --> 03:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
you know that's still the same but um
 
03:36:49.750 --> 03:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
you know the reason I wanted to tell
 
03:36:52.150 --> 03:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
this story I had I watch most of the
 
03:36:53.870 --> 03:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
committee I watch almost every Committee
 
03:36:56.469 --> 03:36:56.479 align:start position:0%
hearing I can uh here in the legislature
 
03:36:58.990 --> 03:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
I I try to be as active as I can and I
 
03:37:00.710 --> 03:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
saw this was happening I knew that from
 
03:37:01.630 --> 03:37:01.640 align:start position:0%
conversations with the you
 
03:37:03.269 --> 03:37:03.279 align:start position:0%
representative comto that this happening
 
03:37:05.229 --> 03:37:05.239 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately I wasn't able to be on
 
03:37:07.590 --> 03:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
the committee uh for one reason or the
 
03:37:09.590 --> 03:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
other but we'll leave that for another
 
03:37:09.600 --> 03:37:11.830 align:start position:0%
other but we'll leave that for another
day

03:37:11.830 --> 03:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
day
 
03:37:15.110 --> 03:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
and but I knew there are people Madame
 
03:37:15.120 --> 03:37:16.309 align:start position:0%
and but I knew there are people Madame
chair

03:37:16.309 --> 03:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:37:18.950 --> 03:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
throughout this state that went through
 
03:37:22.030 --> 03:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
the same thing that I did but have no
 
03:37:25.229 --> 03:37:25.239 align:start position:0%
voice to be able to tell their story to
 
03:37:27.510 --> 03:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
them it probably was a panic or a stress
 
03:37:29.229 --> 03:37:29.239 align:start position:0%
attack because they have no Outlet to be
 
03:37:31.790 --> 03:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
able to know that there might
 
03:37:36.229 --> 03:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
be some myocardial effect
 
03:37:40.429 --> 03:37:40.439 align:start position:0%
to your shot or to something else
 
03:37:43.229 --> 03:37:43.239 align:start position:0%
environmentally and Madam chair I am
 
03:37:46.070 --> 03:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
deeply concerned when anecdotal in my
 
03:37:47.750 --> 03:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
life I know that there are so many young
 
03:37:49.790 --> 03:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
people that have gone
 
03:37:54.389 --> 03:37:54.399 align:start position:0%
through heart or brain or some kind of
 
03:37:57.349 --> 03:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
blood vessel syndrome I don't know if
 
03:37:58.670 --> 03:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
that's the right
 
03:38:01.670 --> 03:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
term and we hear this anecdotally across
 
03:38:03.269 --> 03:38:03.279 align:start position:0%
the country as
 
03:38:07.510 --> 03:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
well I as a representative would be
 
03:38:10.910 --> 03:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
remiss and feel bad with myself if I
 
03:38:14.269 --> 03:38:14.279 align:start position:0%
didn't at least come and tell this story
 
03:38:16.150 --> 03:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh these stories should be told told
 
03:38:20.469 --> 03:38:20.479 align:start position:0%
people should feel open to tell their
 
03:38:23.389 --> 03:38:23.399 align:start position:0%
stories this isn't
 
03:38:25.830 --> 03:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
about it's so unfortunate to me that
 
03:38:27.389 --> 03:38:27.399 align:start position:0%
this has become a partisan thing because
 
03:38:29.229 --> 03:38:29.239 align:start position:0%
this isn't about one party or the other
 
03:38:31.590 --> 03:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
this isn't about pushing a narrative or
 
03:38:33.670 --> 03:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
the other this is about people in our
 
03:38:37.269 --> 03:38:37.279 align:start position:0%
state who have gone through incredibly
 
03:38:39.910 --> 03:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
tough experiences by
 
03:38:43.189 --> 03:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
themselves isolated with the medical
 
03:38:44.790 --> 03:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
profession telling them it's a panic or
 
03:38:45.990 --> 03:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
stress attack
 
03:38:48.389 --> 03:38:48.399 align:start position:0%
or attributing it to something else if
 
03:38:51.030 --> 03:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
it's a more extreme case and then
 
03:38:55.830 --> 03:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
getting him on this line of of a a wild
 
03:38:59.750 --> 03:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
goose chase that isn't actually finding
 
03:39:03.070 --> 03:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
what the symptoms are again I'm not a
 
03:39:05.630 --> 03:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
scientist I'm not a vaccinologist I
 
03:39:07.750 --> 03:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know if it was the vaccine
 
03:39:10.630 --> 03:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
I have my hunches I have my I have my
 
03:39:14.150 --> 03:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
assumptions what I do and I and I I I
 
03:39:16.269 --> 03:39:16.279 align:start position:0%
can't you you know I can't make a
 
03:39:18.510 --> 03:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation beyond what I know but
 
03:39:21.630 --> 03:39:21.640 align:start position:0%
but what I do know is that people were
 
03:39:23.590 --> 03:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
forced into this people were forced into
 
03:39:25.110 --> 03:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
getting a vaccine that they were
 
03:39:28.389 --> 03:39:28.399 align:start position:0%
hesitant to get and after getting that
 
03:39:30.550 --> 03:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine they went through health effects
 
03:39:34.150 --> 03:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
that they they they hadn't gone through
 
03:39:37.710 --> 03:39:37.720 align:start position:0%
before that alone that correlation which
 
03:39:40.150 --> 03:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
is not causation but that correlation
 
03:39:45.429 --> 03:39:45.439 align:start position:0%
alone is enough to worry me as uh as an
 
03:39:47.150 --> 03:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
individual who I think is pretty
 
03:39:49.189 --> 03:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
levelheaded and clear-minded and and I
 
03:39:51.030 --> 03:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
think it's worrying a lot of people
 
03:39:54.510 --> 03:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
throughout our state people who were
 
03:40:00.349 --> 03:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
fully uh you know I fully a part of they
 
03:40:02.309 --> 03:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
they believed it fully and and I think
 
03:40:05.670 --> 03:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
they they too are worried because of the
 
03:40:07.790 --> 03:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
effects that that people have had here
 
03:40:10.510 --> 03:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
so that's that's why I wanted to tell my
 
03:40:13.469 --> 03:40:13.479 align:start position:0%
story Madam chair and and I you know
 
03:40:15.590 --> 03:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's not to for one conclusion or the
 
03:40:18.030 --> 03:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
other but it's to bring a story that I
 
03:40:20.150 --> 03:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
know other people in our state have
 
03:40:21.910 --> 03:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
faced because I've talked to those
 
03:40:24.670 --> 03:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
people and I know that those people uh
 
03:40:27.750 --> 03:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
feel isolated because there's no voice
 
03:40:29.510 --> 03:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
in government or the medical profession
 
03:40:31.870 --> 03:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's trying to truly listen to
 
03:40:34.389 --> 03:40:34.399 align:start position:0%
them and look at their case and and see
 
03:40:35.790 --> 03:40:35.800 align:start position:0%
where they're moving forward so
 
03:40:37.429 --> 03:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
hopefully through committees like this
 
03:40:40.710 --> 03:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
and through uh research that's happening
 
03:40:43.309 --> 03:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
across this country we can get that done
 
03:40:46.910 --> 03:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
um if you don't mind um uh couple things
 
03:40:48.790 --> 03:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
is when you we started out when you
 
03:40:51.349 --> 03:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
started out the conversation you
 
03:40:52.830 --> 03:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you were concerned about
 
03:40:56.990 --> 03:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
myotis and some other issues prior to
 
03:40:59.510 --> 03:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
actually taking the
 
03:41:03.229 --> 03:41:03.239 align:start position:0%
vaccine um how did you obtain that
 
03:41:05.550 --> 03:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
knowledge because it wasn't necessarily
 
03:41:05.560 --> 03:41:07.630 align:start position:0%
knowledge because it wasn't necessarily
readily

03:41:07.630 --> 03:41:07.640 align:start position:0%
readily
 
03:41:11.469 --> 03:41:11.479 align:start position:0%
available well I there were people
 
03:41:14.429 --> 03:41:14.439 align:start position:0%
um you know I followed this guy online
 
03:41:15.670 --> 03:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
you know it's always interesting when
 
03:41:17.150 --> 03:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
you say oh I followed a guy online but
 
03:41:19.349 --> 03:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
there was a man who posted YouTube
 
03:41:21.670 --> 03:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
videos uh named I think this is the
 
03:41:24.550 --> 03:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
first place that I had seen it um named
 
03:41:27.710 --> 03:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
Dr John Campbell who had started out um
 
03:41:29.469 --> 03:41:29.479 align:start position:0%
recommend part of the reason I took the
 
03:41:31.070 --> 03:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine is because he recommended and he
 
03:41:32.830 --> 03:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
too had got I think he had gotten up to
 
03:41:35.550 --> 03:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
three or four shots
 
03:41:38.349 --> 03:41:38.359 align:start position:0%
um but he had pointed out that there was
 
03:41:40.229 --> 03:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
definitely cuz he was trying to respond
 
03:41:44.670 --> 03:41:44.680 align:start position:0%
and debunk the antia conspiracy side of
 
03:41:49.550 --> 03:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
it he has since moved to uh apologize
 
03:41:51.030 --> 03:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
for some of his behavior in the first
 
03:41:53.030 --> 03:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
two years which is kind it's kind of an
 
03:41:57.670 --> 03:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
interesting uh timeline to watch but
 
03:42:00.990 --> 03:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
during the fall of 21 he was I think
 
03:42:02.189 --> 03:42:02.199 align:start position:0%
that was the first person who I had
 
03:42:05.149 --> 03:42:05.159 align:start position:0%
heard bring up that there was
 
03:42:07.910 --> 03:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
some higher risk of
 
03:42:07.920 --> 03:42:10.790 align:start position:0%
some higher risk of
myocarditis

03:42:10.790 --> 03:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
myocarditis
 
03:42:13.870 --> 03:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
um or inflammation of the heart after
 
03:42:16.149 --> 03:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
taking the vaccine but he had said the
 
03:42:18.510 --> 03:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
first per but him being the first person
 
03:42:20.149 --> 03:42:20.159 align:start position:0%
who had brought that up had said
 
03:42:23.070 --> 03:42:23.080 align:start position:0%
afterwards that there is uh higher risk
 
03:42:23.080 --> 03:42:24.149 align:start position:0%
afterwards that there is uh higher risk
of

03:42:24.149 --> 03:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:42:26.429 --> 03:42:26.439 align:start position:0%
myocarditis from getting covid and that
 
03:42:30.710 --> 03:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
was the the jumby that you heard uh from
 
03:42:34.950 --> 03:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
most people during that time um now I
 
03:42:36.590 --> 03:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
believe we're still saying that it is
 
03:42:39.670 --> 03:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
safe and effective um for
 
03:42:42.870 --> 03:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
children um do you think that that is
 
03:42:42.880 --> 03:42:43.830 align:start position:0%
children um do you think that that is
proper

03:42:43.830 --> 03:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
proper
 
03:42:47.349 --> 03:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
labeling I I couldn't say I couldn't say
 
03:42:47.359 --> 03:42:49.550 align:start position:0%
labeling I I couldn't say I couldn't say
I

03:42:49.550 --> 03:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:42:52.389 --> 03:42:52.399 align:start position:0%
um yeah I have my personal opinions that
 
03:42:58.189 --> 03:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:01.149 --> 03:43:01.159 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if a 5-year-old needs the
 
03:43:03.269 --> 03:43:03.279 align:start position:0%
coronavirus shot is what I would say but
 
03:43:05.469 --> 03:43:05.479 align:start position:0%
I I can't make a medical recommendation
 
03:43:08.630 --> 03:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
for parents um and one final question
 
03:43:10.990 --> 03:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
from um now you said you were an avid
 
03:43:14.469 --> 03:43:14.479 align:start position:0%
Runner and very active um can you still
 
03:43:15.670 --> 03:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
do those activ
 
03:43:18.910 --> 03:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
activities not like I used to I I I you
 
03:43:20.790 --> 03:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
know I tried a bike last summer and I
 
03:43:25.950 --> 03:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
tried to uh I did get out um didn't swim
 
03:43:28.790 --> 03:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
as much as I wanted to last summer but
 
03:43:31.229 --> 03:43:31.239 align:start position:0%
you know like I said it is significantly
 
03:43:34.030 --> 03:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
harder for me to get out and do those
 
03:43:34.040 --> 03:43:35.990 align:start position:0%
harder for me to get out and do those
things

03:43:35.990 --> 03:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:43:39.070 --> 03:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
um it's I I find it easy to walk
 
03:43:41.870 --> 03:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
nowadays it there was a period in 2022
 
03:43:43.309 --> 03:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
when it was really kind of difficult to
 
03:43:46.070 --> 03:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
walk around um doing door knocking and
 
03:43:48.309 --> 03:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
stuff like that it's easier to walk um
 
03:43:50.309 --> 03:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure as life goes on you know
 
03:43:52.830 --> 03:43:52.840 align:start position:0%
body is a powerful powerful thing and
 
03:43:55.910 --> 03:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
and there's uh you know sure I'll heel
 
03:43:59.229 --> 03:43:59.239 align:start position:0%
young lucky on that end but uh no it is
 
03:44:03.830 --> 03:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
not the same to to go Bike and Hike and
 
03:44:06.750 --> 03:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
swim it's a there's a significant and
 
03:44:08.870 --> 03:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
noticeable stamina difference in
 
03:44:08.880 --> 03:44:10.070 align:start position:0%
noticeable stamina difference in
endurance

03:44:10.070 --> 03:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
endurance
 
03:44:16.070 --> 03:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:18.030 --> 03:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
have thank you madam shair have you
 
03:44:18.040 --> 03:44:19.710 align:start position:0%
have thank you madam shair have you
thought

03:44:19.710 --> 03:44:19.720 align:start position:0%
thought
 
03:44:22.870 --> 03:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
of going and getting
 
03:44:27.269 --> 03:44:27.279 align:start position:0%
uh the diagnosis like seeing um a heart
 
03:44:31.229 --> 03:44:31.239 align:start position:0%
specialist to get a diagnosis of whether
 
03:44:31.239 --> 03:44:32.510 align:start position:0%
specialist to get a diagnosis of whether
I

03:44:32.510 --> 03:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:44:36.389 --> 03:44:36.399 align:start position:0%
mean it's it's very documented you fall
 
03:44:39.790 --> 03:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
within that range you're a young male it
 
03:44:43.269 --> 03:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
I mean there the increase um there's
 
03:44:44.870 --> 03:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
many different studies that talk about
 
03:44:47.030 --> 03:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
this and it's not just myocarditis it's
 
03:44:49.429 --> 03:44:49.439 align:start position:0%
it's paric carditis it's you know
 
03:44:51.950 --> 03:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
several different things so um a heart
 
03:44:55.269 --> 03:44:55.279 align:start position:0%
specialist to to get that diagnosis and
 
03:44:59.469 --> 03:44:59.479 align:start position:0%
just to see to monitor that uh you know
 
03:45:02.229 --> 03:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
I after I went to my primary care
 
03:45:04.309 --> 03:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
specialist the second time after what
 
03:45:06.870 --> 03:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
had happened in April of 23 and he had
 
03:45:09.590 --> 03:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
told me that I got a had a a panic
 
03:45:11.269 --> 03:45:11.279 align:start position:0%
attack I I actually initially believed
 
03:45:13.670 --> 03:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
him you know I really just wanted to
 
03:45:16.030 --> 03:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
believe that um
 
03:45:17.670 --> 03:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh it was a panic attack even though I
 
03:45:20.030 --> 03:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
didn't panic and I wasn't stressed um it
 
03:45:21.389 --> 03:45:21.399 align:start position:0%
wasn't until I talked to my grandmother
 
03:45:23.030 --> 03:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
again and told her what he had said that
 
03:45:26.510 --> 03:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
she was no I I don't think so and I and
 
03:45:28.870 --> 03:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
I agreed you know I didn't want to
 
03:45:30.790 --> 03:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
believe that that was the truth I didn't
 
03:45:32.189 --> 03:45:32.199 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't I didn't Panic or
 
03:45:34.910 --> 03:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
stress but
 
03:45:37.750 --> 03:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
um I didn't follow up after it because
 
03:45:42.189 --> 03:45:42.199 align:start position:0%
he he had just dismissed it and um was
 
03:45:44.590 --> 03:45:44.600 align:start position:0%
just sort of well maybe I'm maybe I'm
 
03:45:47.389 --> 03:45:47.399 align:start position:0%
being crazy I guess maybe maybe it
 
03:45:49.229 --> 03:45:49.239 align:start position:0%
wasn't as intense as it was I don't know
 
03:45:50.349 --> 03:45:50.359 align:start position:0%
it was you just keep you go through
 
03:45:52.070 --> 03:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
those things you know as time goes on
 
03:45:54.910 --> 03:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
you know and as life progresses it's oh
 
03:45:56.670 --> 03:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
I guess it wasn't as intense as it was
 
03:45:58.510 --> 03:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
it wasn't you know there's no need to
 
03:46:00.550 --> 03:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
what is this you know I'm fine I'm still
 
03:46:02.269 --> 03:46:02.279 align:start position:0%
here so I just
 
03:46:05.550 --> 03:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
didn't uh I didn't follow up with a
 
03:46:08.429 --> 03:46:08.439 align:start position:0%
specialist after he didn't move to test
 
03:46:10.990 --> 03:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
move to do anything other than say he
 
03:46:12.830 --> 03:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
probably had a panic
 
03:46:17.070 --> 03:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:18.149 --> 03:46:18.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam
 
03:46:20.550 --> 03:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
chair I appreciate that testimony thank
 
03:46:21.750 --> 03:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
you and I and I know what that feels
 
03:46:23.149 --> 03:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
like too because I was in that same
 
03:46:26.349 --> 03:46:26.359 align:start position:0%
position after getting the vaccine what
 
03:46:28.469 --> 03:46:28.479 align:start position:0%
I would like to do is I'd like to tell
 
03:46:31.189 --> 03:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
you a few things that we have heard um
 
03:46:35.229 --> 03:46:35.239 align:start position:0%
in our committee about uh vaccine safety
 
03:46:37.309 --> 03:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
and efficacy and then give you a chance
 
03:46:39.349 --> 03:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
to respond to see what you think about
 
03:46:42.870 --> 03:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
this so we've heard
 
03:46:46.550 --> 03:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
that and this is from federal government
 
03:46:51.710 --> 03:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
data that the CDC proposed a method of
 
03:46:55.349 --> 03:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
evaluating safety signal coming from the
 
03:46:58.110 --> 03:46:58.120 align:start position:0%
vaccines before they were rolled out and
 
03:47:00.110 --> 03:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
they established okay this number this
 
03:47:01.429 --> 03:47:01.439 align:start position:0%
number this number this number we're
 
03:47:03.070 --> 03:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
going to look for this and if it exceeds
 
03:47:04.990 --> 03:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
these certain thresholds that's a safety
 
03:47:07.309 --> 03:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
signal we got a problem if it exceeds
 
03:47:09.870 --> 03:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
those thresholds and we know we now know
 
03:47:11.510 --> 03:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
that those safety thresholds were
 
03:47:13.269 --> 03:47:13.279 align:start position:0%
exceeded for multiple conditions within
 
03:47:15.750 --> 03:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
a period of months of the vaccine being
 
03:47:19.229 --> 03:47:19.239 align:start position:0%
rolled out we know that by November of
 
03:47:22.030 --> 03:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
2020 when they were designing the vsafe
 
03:47:24.670 --> 03:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine safety data system they had a
 
03:47:28.590 --> 03:47:28.600 align:start position:0%
laundry list of known side effects from
 
03:47:31.950 --> 03:47:31.960 align:start position:0%
the vaccines that included myocarditis
 
03:47:34.750 --> 03:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
paric carditis autoimmune disorders and
 
03:47:34.760 --> 03:47:36.630 align:start position:0%
paric carditis autoimmune disorders and
neurological

03:47:36.630 --> 03:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
neurological
 
03:47:39.630 --> 03:47:39.640 align:start position:0%
disorders we know from this further in
 
03:47:41.429 --> 03:47:41.439 align:start position:0%
this data the vsafe data which is the
 
03:47:43.229 --> 03:47:43.239 align:start position:0%
best data we have this is federal data
 
03:47:45.269 --> 03:47:45.279 align:start position:0%
from the CDC
 
03:47:48.950 --> 03:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
that in excess of 7% of patients
 
03:47:52.229 --> 03:47:52.239 align:start position:0%
receiving the vaccine had serious
 
03:47:55.830 --> 03:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
adverse reactions to the
 
03:47:59.670 --> 03:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine more than uh more than 25% had
 
03:48:03.269 --> 03:48:03.279 align:start position:0%
to miss work or school so
 
03:48:07.870 --> 03:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
that's way more than that that's a big
 
03:48:10.070 --> 03:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
number but 7even plus perent serious
 
03:48:11.590 --> 03:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
adverse reactions by the way serious
 
03:48:13.630 --> 03:48:13.640 align:start position:0%
adverse reactions those are defined as
 
03:48:15.269 --> 03:48:15.279 align:start position:0%
big things
 
03:48:15.279 --> 03:48:16.429 align:start position:0%
big things
like

03:48:16.429 --> 03:48:16.439 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:48:20.189 --> 03:48:20.199 align:start position:0%
myocarditis like death
 
03:48:22.309 --> 03:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
like permanent
 
03:48:25.229 --> 03:48:25.239 align:start position:0%
disability brain damage lots of things
 
03:48:28.710 --> 03:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
serious Adverse Events more than
 
03:48:31.389 --> 03:48:31.399 align:start position:0%
7% and we knew that
 
03:48:35.790 --> 03:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
and they knew that before you received
 
03:48:35.800 --> 03:48:38.510 align:start position:0%
and they knew that before you received
your

03:48:38.510 --> 03:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:42.910 --> 03:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:45.510 --> 03:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
respond well you know those numbers are
 
03:48:48.309 --> 03:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
true that is that's a very that's a very
 
03:48:50.550 --> 03:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
sad State of Affairs
 
03:48:55.189 --> 03:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:57.790 --> 03:48:57.800 align:start position:0%
that there should be a space open for
 
03:48:59.550 --> 03:48:59.560 align:start position:0%
people to tell their story like this so
 
03:49:02.229 --> 03:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
that we can have solid data about how
 
03:49:04.750 --> 03:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
many injuries were taking place we know
 
03:49:07.349 --> 03:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
that V's the vaccine injur most people
 
03:49:09.670 --> 03:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
don't know that exists um and the people
 
03:49:11.229 --> 03:49:11.239 align:start position:0%
that do know that
 
03:49:14.469 --> 03:49:14.479 align:start position:0%
exists don't always report we need to
 
03:49:16.070 --> 03:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that that system is
 
03:49:18.469 --> 03:49:18.479 align:start position:0%
strengthened so that people have an
 
03:49:21.229 --> 03:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
ability to report their vaccine
 
03:49:21.239 --> 03:49:23.229 align:start position:0%
ability to report their vaccine
injuries

03:49:23.229 --> 03:49:23.239 align:start position:0%
injuries
 
03:49:26.349 --> 03:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
and what I can say representative beler
 
03:49:27.870 --> 03:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:49:30.189 --> 03:49:30.199 align:start position:0%
the you know we try to operate in good
 
03:49:31.830 --> 03:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
faith here in this legislature so what
 
03:49:35.269 --> 03:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
I'll do is say the best faith what I
 
03:49:38.429 --> 03:49:38.439 align:start position:0%
think happened is they there was a a
 
03:49:43.670 --> 03:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
novel uh virus that came from China and
 
03:49:45.750 --> 03:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
we we didn't know how to handle it and
 
03:49:48.670 --> 03:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
we rush through with billions of dollars
 
03:49:53.469 --> 03:49:53.479 align:start position:0%
and very little safety trial um a
 
03:49:56.149 --> 03:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
vaccine based off of
 
03:49:56.159 --> 03:49:57.830 align:start position:0%
vaccine based off of
uh

03:49:57.830 --> 03:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:50:00.910 --> 03:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
uh a technology that yes has existed for
 
03:50:03.189 --> 03:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
the last 20 years but um had not been
 
03:50:05.429 --> 03:50:05.439 align:start position:0%
used in the general population until
 
03:50:09.030 --> 03:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
this situation and I think that there
 
03:50:14.990 --> 03:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
were and this is best face you know
 
03:50:16.349 --> 03:50:16.359 align:start position:0%
assuming that the pharmaceutical
 
03:50:18.309 --> 03:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
companies were operating in be fa best
 
03:50:18.319 --> 03:50:19.950 align:start position:0%
companies were operating in be fa best
faith

03:50:19.950 --> 03:50:19.960 align:start position:0%
faith
 
03:50:22.550 --> 03:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
um they rushed through this process and
 
03:50:24.349 --> 03:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of people were hurt as a
 
03:50:26.309 --> 03:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
result that's that's what I think
 
03:50:28.149 --> 03:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
happened I think a lot of
 
03:50:31.630 --> 03:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
people were bullied into getting it
 
03:50:33.670 --> 03:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
because there was an assumption
 
03:50:36.750 --> 03:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
that everyone getting it
 
03:50:40.670 --> 03:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
would save us from this novel virus that
 
03:50:43.990 --> 03:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
assumption didn't end up being true and
 
03:50:46.830 --> 03:50:46.840 align:start position:0%
I I think people are going to have to I
 
03:50:48.550 --> 03:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
think we need solid data so we can have
 
03:50:50.030 --> 03:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
a a
 
03:50:52.790 --> 03:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
solid response to what happened here I
 
03:50:54.429 --> 03:50:54.439 align:start position:0%
you know I think that's the benefit of
 
03:50:56.389 --> 03:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
hopefully work that can be done in
 
03:50:57.670 --> 03:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
committees like
 
03:51:01.030 --> 03:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
this um yesterday we learned and I don't
 
03:51:03.790 --> 03:51:03.800 align:start position:0%
know if you're aware and and maybe if I
 
03:51:05.510 --> 03:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
misspeak uh I'm sure one of the
 
03:51:09.469 --> 03:51:09.479 align:start position:0%
committee members will correct me um but
 
03:51:13.110 --> 03:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
AC as vs
 
03:51:16.630 --> 03:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
goes the only person that has to report
 
03:51:20.950 --> 03:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
to theirs is the person who injected you
 
03:51:23.389 --> 03:51:23.399 align:start position:0%
if you got injected and then went to
 
03:51:25.710 --> 03:51:25.720 align:start position:0%
your doctor there is no responsibility
 
03:51:28.990 --> 03:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
for them because they didn't do the
 
03:51:32.750 --> 03:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
injection um is uh representative
 
03:51:37.070 --> 03:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
Penza yeah what um thank you madam chair
 
03:51:39.670 --> 03:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
what representative um kto just said is
 
03:51:43.389 --> 03:51:43.399 align:start position:0%
actually true um and and kind of to
 
03:51:46.590 --> 03:51:46.600 align:start position:0%
expand that a little bit more more
 
03:51:50.269 --> 03:51:50.279 align:start position:0%
is the there there's no real training so
 
03:51:51.950 --> 03:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
I mean we couldn't even put a percentage
 
03:51:54.830 --> 03:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
but it is extremely low so right now if
 
03:51:56.389 --> 03:51:56.399 align:start position:0%
you look at
 
03:51:59.469 --> 03:51:59.479 align:start position:0%
1% of people you know it's it it's
 
03:52:01.670 --> 03:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
possibly only 1% that of people that
 
03:52:05.710 --> 03:52:05.720 align:start position:0%
report to a theirs um practitioners
 
03:52:09.670 --> 03:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
aren't taught this um nurses aren't
 
03:52:12.269 --> 03:52:12.279 align:start position:0%
taught this and so that's the problem it
 
03:52:17.429 --> 03:52:17.439 align:start position:0%
is a very difficult cumbersome system so
 
03:52:20.070 --> 03:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to try to go in there and
 
03:52:22.790 --> 03:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
Report something it like you said it's
 
03:52:26.429 --> 03:52:26.439 align:start position:0%
almost near impossible but based
 
03:52:29.870 --> 03:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
upon if you suffered something and we
 
03:52:31.469 --> 03:52:31.479 align:start position:0%
know this from another person that came
 
03:52:35.670 --> 03:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
to testify what they had to go through
 
03:52:38.870 --> 03:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
to get it reported their daughter's
 
03:52:44.149 --> 03:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
injury from a a I believe it was the J&amp;J
 
03:52:44.159 --> 03:52:45.630 align:start position:0%
injury from a a I believe it was the J&amp;J
correct

03:52:45.630 --> 03:52:45.640 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:52:48.189 --> 03:52:48.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure which one but it was she
 
03:52:51.349 --> 03:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
had it done at a hospital correct so um
 
03:52:55.070 --> 03:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
but for that family to be able to get
 
03:52:57.590 --> 03:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
that reported and reported correctly was
 
03:53:00.910 --> 03:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
an unbelievable process um the first
 
03:53:03.750 --> 03:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
report was wrong and inaccurate so so
 
03:53:07.149 --> 03:53:07.159 align:start position:0%
just to understand it's it's it's not
 
03:53:08.630 --> 03:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
the greatest thing that we heard
 
03:53:10.910 --> 03:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
yesterday and you know I I'll push it
 
03:53:12.710 --> 03:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
off to representative belard that he can
 
03:53:15.710 --> 03:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
explain is the gentleman that was able
 
03:53:18.149 --> 03:53:18.159 align:start position:0%
to get this information from bsafe and
 
03:53:20.030 --> 03:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
you know if you had signed up for that
 
03:53:21.269 --> 03:53:21.279 align:start position:0%
you know it was this app and they
 
03:53:22.229 --> 03:53:22.239 align:start position:0%
thought they were going to get all this
 
03:53:24.790 --> 03:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
great data they had 10 million people
 
03:53:27.710 --> 03:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
sign up for this now not everybody
 
03:53:29.710 --> 03:53:29.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily was in there and and
 
03:53:31.469 --> 03:53:31.479 align:start position:0%
reported all of it but they got an
 
03:53:33.750 --> 03:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
unbelievable amount of data way more
 
03:53:36.429 --> 03:53:36.439 align:start position:0%
than we could ever get from because
 
03:53:38.389 --> 03:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
these people they were all on board
 
03:53:40.910 --> 03:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
they're like yes I'm getting my shot D
 
03:53:43.269 --> 03:53:43.279 align:start position:0%
so it's totally different and opposite
 
03:53:47.110 --> 03:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
than than a system and they had
 
03:53:49.750 --> 03:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
open um besides radio buttons on there
 
03:53:51.910 --> 03:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
that you could select they had open
 
03:53:55.030 --> 03:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
areas where you could write about 250
 
03:53:57.910 --> 03:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
characters so they're just getting that
 
03:53:59.389 --> 03:53:59.399 align:start position:0%
some of that data now they're going to
 
03:54:02.030 --> 03:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
get all of that and I guess that is
 
03:54:05.990 --> 03:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
quite damaging one one woman for example
 
03:54:07.790 --> 03:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
in every single place she could write
 
03:54:10.510 --> 03:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
was in who was injured please help me
 
03:54:13.349 --> 03:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:17.469 --> 03:54:17.479 align:start position:0%
me and it nobody
 
03:54:22.149 --> 03:54:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:25.710 --> 03:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
Pa thank you Madame chair
 
03:54:29.349 --> 03:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
so um three parts first part um more
 
03:54:32.349 --> 03:54:32.359 align:start position:0%
like responding my understanding there
 
03:54:36.389 --> 03:54:36.399 align:start position:0%
are several ways that information is
 
03:54:39.550 --> 03:54:39.560 align:start position:0%
aggregated so obviously we safe with one
 
03:54:42.790 --> 03:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
separate Silo with about 10 million
 
03:54:44.990 --> 03:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
participants that was just
 
03:54:48.630 --> 03:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh rolled out during uh the co response
 
03:54:52.870 --> 03:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
so then then we have uh wir database
 
03:54:57.830 --> 03:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
cdc's vaccine adverse uh reactions
 
03:55:01.349 --> 03:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
database uh and uh there are some other
 
03:55:07.189 --> 03:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
siles that collect that data and uh I
 
03:55:09.149 --> 03:55:09.159 align:start position:0%
think we might need
 
03:55:11.870 --> 03:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
to check with somebody who knows how it
 
03:55:15.309 --> 03:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
work my understanding is like
 
03:55:17.870 --> 03:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
yes person who administered vaccine if
 
03:55:21.030 --> 03:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
he knows about an adverse side effect
 
03:55:24.349 --> 03:55:24.359 align:start position:0%
it's that person responsibility
 
03:55:29.070 --> 03:55:29.080 align:start position:0%
to uh to report it to the virus database
 
03:55:34.910 --> 03:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is as people can uh
 
03:55:37.030 --> 03:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
as medical professionals and even
 
03:55:40.189 --> 03:55:40.199 align:start position:0%
patient I believe can self report to
 
03:55:45.110 --> 03:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
virus database and as anecdote uh I I I
 
03:55:45.120 --> 03:55:46.469 align:start position:0%
virus database and as anecdote uh I I I
know

03:55:46.469 --> 03:55:46.479 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:55:49.790 --> 03:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
that a couple of other representatives
 
03:55:53.349 --> 03:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
from both parties they actually admitted
 
03:55:57.710 --> 03:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
of having uh uh adverse reactions to uh
 
03:56:01.510 --> 03:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
to covid vaccine and making sure that
 
03:56:05.389 --> 03:56:05.399 align:start position:0%
the report made it to the virus database
 
03:56:08.790 --> 03:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
so one of my questions to Jonah would be
 
03:56:12.790 --> 03:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
would you consider to try and uh see if
 
03:56:16.070 --> 03:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
you can self-report your experience uh
 
03:56:21.910 --> 03:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh to the CDC official uh database virus
 
03:56:25.550 --> 03:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely and and as a
 
03:56:28.710 --> 03:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
followup uh like I understand your
 
03:56:31.030 --> 03:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
concern that you are not a medical
 
03:56:33.670 --> 03:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
professional and you're not a scientist
 
03:56:38.349 --> 03:56:38.359 align:start position:0%
and the fact that uh you had problems
 
03:56:41.750 --> 03:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
came after vaccine you cannot still
 
03:56:43.790 --> 03:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
definitively that it was caused by
 
03:56:47.149 --> 03:56:47.159 align:start position:0%
vaccine but people who created virus
 
03:56:49.349 --> 03:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
database they understand it they
 
03:56:52.469 --> 03:56:52.479 align:start position:0%
understand that those reported reactions
 
03:56:53.910 --> 03:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
03:56:57.990 --> 03:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
always uh from uh for example from legal
 
03:56:58.000 --> 03:57:00.070 align:start position:0%
always uh from uh for example from legal
point

03:57:00.070 --> 03:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:57:03.790 --> 03:57:03.800 align:start position:0%
Cause prove the causality and it's one
 
03:57:07.750 --> 03:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why in uh in official
 
03:57:12.070 --> 03:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
databases we have only one person under
 
03:57:14.550 --> 03:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
18 from New Hampshire who died from
 
03:57:17.990 --> 03:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
covid officially but four people who are
 
03:57:18.000 --> 03:57:19.149 align:start position:0%
covid officially but four people who are
dead

03:57:19.149 --> 03:57:19.159 align:start position:0%
dead
 
03:57:23.110 --> 03:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
with uh side effects after covid vaccine
 
03:57:25.910 --> 03:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
so why nobody car so one of the reason
 
03:57:29.030 --> 03:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
is like they say yeah those four kids
 
03:57:32.750 --> 03:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
are there they reported to CDC virus
 
03:57:35.110 --> 03:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
database as New Hampshire kids who died
 
03:57:38.229 --> 03:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
after receiving covid-19 vaccine but uh
 
03:57:42.229 --> 03:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily caused by vaccine
 
03:57:44.469 --> 03:57:44.479 align:start position:0%
even though
 
03:57:49.349 --> 03:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
so so yeah yeah I encourage you uh to
 
03:57:53.070 --> 03:57:53.080 align:start position:0%
self report and also like previous
 
03:57:56.550 --> 03:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
people said if there any way
 
03:58:00.750 --> 03:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
to to get some uh additional monitoring
 
03:58:04.910 --> 03:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
on your health uh it would be maybe it
 
03:58:08.670 --> 03:58:08.680 align:start position:0%
will make sense thank you represent
 
03:58:11.110 --> 03:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam
 
03:58:13.189 --> 03:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
chair uh representative wheeler you
 
03:58:15.630 --> 03:58:15.640 align:start position:0%
offered a very very generous
 
03:58:18.710 --> 03:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
interpretation of
 
03:58:21.790 --> 03:58:21.800 align:start position:0%
uh what occurred and I appreciate that I
 
03:58:25.110 --> 03:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
I do and certainly we can't say with any
 
03:58:25.120 --> 03:58:27.030 align:start position:0%
I do and certainly we can't say with any
definitive

03:58:27.030 --> 03:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
definitive
 
03:58:27.040 --> 03:58:28.710 align:start position:0%
definitive
um

03:58:28.710 --> 03:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:32.070 --> 03:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
finality exactly what occurred I do just
 
03:58:34.110 --> 03:58:34.120 align:start position:0%
want to remind uh the committee and I
 
03:58:35.269 --> 03:58:35.279 align:start position:0%
I've previously read this into the
 
03:58:36.590 --> 03:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
record so we've already are in
 
03:58:38.670 --> 03:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
possession of this uh through a Freedom
 
03:58:41.110 --> 03:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
of Information Act we became well not us
 
03:58:42.990 --> 03:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
but another party who we then got it
 
03:58:45.950 --> 03:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
from came into possession of emails uh
 
03:58:47.670 --> 03:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
internal emails within the Food and Drug
 
03:58:48.910 --> 03:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
Administration the
 
03:58:54.229 --> 03:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
FDA um documenting that early on when
 
03:58:56.830 --> 03:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
they became aware of the death of two
 
03:59:00.070 --> 03:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
young men from myocarditis in the
 
03:59:04.110 --> 03:59:04.120 align:start position:0%
aftermath of uh Co
 
03:59:08.349 --> 03:59:08.359 align:start position:0%
injection they were very very worried
 
03:59:08.359 --> 03:59:09.189 align:start position:0%
injection they were very very worried
very

03:59:09.189 --> 03:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
very
 
03:59:13.469 --> 03:59:13.479 align:start position:0%
concerned um not about the the deaths
 
03:59:16.070 --> 03:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
but about how that knowledge would
 
03:59:20.189 --> 03:59:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:22.110 --> 03:59:22.120 align:start position:0%
population yeah I've heard similar
 
03:59:24.510 --> 03:59:24.520 align:start position:0%
stories about uh what had happened in
 
03:59:27.030 --> 03:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
the FDA and CDC when they had seen
 
03:59:28.389 --> 03:59:28.399 align:start position:0%
stories that they labeled as
 
03:59:29.870 --> 03:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
misinformation come out into the
 
03:59:31.309 --> 03:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
populace and how they were worried that
 
03:59:32.550 --> 03:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
that was going to seep down to the
 
03:59:37.110 --> 03:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine Equity program with uh black and
 
03:59:39.189 --> 03:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
lowincome black and brown low income
 
03:59:41.429 --> 03:59:41.439 align:start position:0%
communities in the country that were
 
03:59:43.429 --> 03:59:43.439 align:start position:0%
already hesitant seeing stories like
 
03:59:45.790 --> 03:59:45.800 align:start position:0%
that and increasing that hesitancy
 
03:59:49.149 --> 03:59:49.159 align:start position:0%
because of the stories that
 
03:59:51.030 --> 03:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
they and I know that a lot of those
 
03:59:53.189 --> 03:59:53.199 align:start position:0%
stories were wiped from the internet as
 
03:59:54.550 --> 03:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
well as a
 
03:59:58.550 --> 03:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:01.710 --> 04:00:01.720 align:start position:0%
Penza I just like to follow up to in
 
04:00:05.030 --> 04:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
kind of like a did you know um piece
 
04:00:07.189 --> 04:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
because we we learned this yesterday and
 
04:00:08.870 --> 04:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
just we learned so many things but this
 
04:00:12.710 --> 04:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
is one that is um is so important and it
 
04:00:14.830 --> 04:00:14.840 align:start position:0%
just looks at you know it's not just our
 
04:00:16.670 --> 04:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
state but it's our entire country and
 
04:00:19.189 --> 04:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
how we're different than other countries
 
04:00:19.199 --> 04:00:20.269 align:start position:0%
how we're different than other countries
and

04:00:20.269 --> 04:00:20.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:00:23.269 --> 04:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
um because we don't
 
04:00:27.429 --> 04:00:27.439 align:start position:0%
have we because in 1986 we gave full
 
04:00:30.510 --> 04:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
immunity from any sort of liability to
 
04:00:33.229 --> 04:00:33.239 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies for their
 
04:00:36.790 --> 04:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
products for their vaccines or emergency
 
04:00:38.590 --> 04:00:38.600 align:start position:0%
youth authorizations fall under the prep
 
04:00:41.990 --> 04:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
act and completely immun U full immunity
 
04:00:45.870 --> 04:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
there from liability um
 
04:00:47.990 --> 04:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
we're just we're sitting ducks in a
 
04:00:49.870 --> 04:00:49.880 align:start position:0%
sense because of that you can't go after
 
04:00:52.750 --> 04:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
the people that have injured you and how
 
04:00:55.349 --> 04:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
it's set up with this uh it's kind of
 
04:00:57.790 --> 04:00:57.800 align:start position:0%
like this vaccine Court there's
 
04:01:00.030 --> 04:01:00.040 align:start position:0%
limitations there I think he said for
 
04:01:02.870 --> 04:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
death it's like 250,000 it's it's
 
04:01:04.830 --> 04:01:04.840 align:start position:0%
unbelievable and it's very hard and
 
04:01:06.870 --> 04:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
there's time limitations and all of this
 
04:01:11.110 --> 04:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff um in other
 
04:01:14.030 --> 04:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
countries how things are reported it's
 
04:01:16.389 --> 04:01:16.399 align:start position:0%
like in a think of it like a central
 
04:01:19.469 --> 04:01:19.479 align:start position:0%
system it's all coming one place like
 
04:01:22.750 --> 04:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
for example if if the FDA is supposed to
 
04:01:25.710 --> 04:01:25.720 align:start position:0%
be the monitoring whatever arm like all
 
04:01:27.269 --> 04:01:27.279 align:start position:0%
the data would be filling through there
 
04:01:29.149 --> 04:01:29.159 align:start position:0%
right you wouldn't have okay well you
 
04:01:31.750 --> 04:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
self-report here a position puts it in
 
04:01:33.389 --> 04:01:33.399 align:start position:0%
here everybody would know right you're
 
04:01:36.229 --> 04:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
all putting that data especially if
 
04:01:38.750 --> 04:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
you're talking about with this millions
 
04:01:40.389 --> 04:01:40.399 align:start position:0%
of injections happening with under
 
04:01:42.229 --> 04:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
emergency youth authorization that it
 
04:01:44.630 --> 04:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
would make sense so that's why other
 
04:01:48.309 --> 04:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
data coming in from other countries um
 
04:01:50.110 --> 04:01:50.120 align:start position:0%
like there was a Danish study that's
 
04:01:52.870 --> 04:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
that's Crystal Clear is
 
04:01:55.630 --> 04:01:55.640 align:start position:0%
because the centralized way that they've
 
04:01:58.630 --> 04:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
handled this makes sense so in all
 
04:02:00.830 --> 04:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
actuality let's just use fizer as an
 
04:02:02.670 --> 04:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
example if you took a fiser shot and you
 
04:02:05.229 --> 04:02:05.239 align:start position:0%
had a reaction you could if you signed
 
04:02:06.429 --> 04:02:06.439 align:start position:0%
up for vsafe you could have put
 
04:02:09.030 --> 04:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
something in there you could possibly
 
04:02:11.870 --> 04:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
get your information into vs you could
 
04:02:14.870 --> 04:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
call a 1 1800 number that is listed on
 
04:02:21.269 --> 04:02:21.279 align:start position:0%
the CDC FDA site and then also fizer had
 
04:02:23.309 --> 04:02:23.319 align:start position:0%
a way that you could report to them as
 
04:02:26.630 --> 04:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
well now the worst thing about it is is
 
04:02:28.309 --> 04:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
none of this data that's not all the
 
04:02:30.229 --> 04:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
same it's all different models and this
 
04:02:32.750 --> 04:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
and that and some very convoluted some
 
04:02:35.149 --> 04:02:35.159 align:start position:0%
not even asking the correct information
 
04:02:38.149 --> 04:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
or even providing uh the correct radio
 
04:02:40.510 --> 04:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
buttons about what you're experiencing
 
04:02:43.149 --> 04:02:43.159 align:start position:0%
so you couldn't you can't really have
 
04:02:45.229 --> 04:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
like this wealth of
 
04:02:47.710 --> 04:02:47.720 align:start position:0%
knowledge and I don't know if you
 
04:02:50.790 --> 04:02:50.800 align:start position:0%
realize that that we're really the the
 
04:02:55.229 --> 04:02:55.239 align:start position:0%
only country that is so
 
04:02:57.910 --> 04:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
broken with that well I did realize that
 
04:02:59.429 --> 04:02:59.439 align:start position:0%
we're the only country that props up the
 
04:03:02.429 --> 04:03:02.439 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical lobby as much as we do
 
04:03:05.990 --> 04:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
we're the only country that allows uh I
 
04:03:07.590 --> 04:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
think we're the only country other than
 
04:03:11.469 --> 04:03:11.479 align:start position:0%
maybe an island nation that allows
 
04:03:13.830 --> 04:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical advertising on television
 
04:03:17.229 --> 04:03:17.239 align:start position:0%
in the way that we do um there's a few
 
04:03:18.590 --> 04:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
things that we do with pharmaceutical
 
04:03:22.389 --> 04:03:22.399 align:start position:0%
drugs and allowing the companies to do
 
04:03:27.670 --> 04:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
things that uh hop over safety hop over
 
04:03:30.910 --> 04:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
obstacles that exist in other country to
 
04:03:32.790 --> 04:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
make sure that the drugs and products
 
04:03:35.110 --> 04:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
that they're putting out are safe um we
 
04:03:37.429 --> 04:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
kind of have a free-for-all here uh in
 
04:03:40.110 --> 04:03:40.120 align:start position:0%
the United States of America with
 
04:03:45.670 --> 04:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies with uh
 
04:03:47.510 --> 04:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
large oil companies with chemical
 
04:03:49.630 --> 04:03:49.640 align:start position:0%
companies I mean there is a lot of
 
04:03:51.790 --> 04:03:51.800 align:start position:0%
free-for-all happening here in the
 
04:03:56.309 --> 04:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
United States and um and we see that
 
04:04:00.309 --> 04:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
happen well in conclusion
 
04:04:04.550 --> 04:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:08.429 --> 04:04:08.439 align:start position:0%
off uh would you believe that
 
04:04:13.990 --> 04:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh when uh government gives uh uh leg
 
04:04:17.030 --> 04:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
immunity to manufacturers of vaccines
 
04:04:19.630 --> 04:04:19.640 align:start position:0%
and then to specifically of covid vaccin
 
04:04:22.910 --> 04:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
they also set up injury compensation
 
04:04:28.630 --> 04:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
funds uh and that uh even those funds
 
04:04:32.149 --> 04:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
are small but uh still there were
 
04:04:35.870 --> 04:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
probably a couple of thousand dollars
 
04:04:40.910 --> 04:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
for a person so by by dismissing
 
04:04:44.309 --> 04:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
your symptoms uh
 
04:04:47.149 --> 04:04:47.159 align:start position:0%
that medical professional in your town
 
04:04:50.189 --> 04:04:50.199 align:start position:0%
and by not informing you about that
 
04:04:53.630 --> 04:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
Federal injury Compensation Program
 
04:04:53.640 --> 04:04:56.349 align:start position:0%
Federal injury Compensation Program
youve

04:04:56.349 --> 04:04:56.359 align:start position:0%
youve
 
04:04:56.359 --> 04:04:58.269 align:start position:0%
youve
intially

04:04:58.269 --> 04:04:58.279 align:start position:0%
intially
 
04:05:03.670 --> 04:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
denied uh filing in the the uh allowed
 
04:05:07.269 --> 04:05:07.279 align:start position:0%
window to get those few thousands
 
04:05:08.510 --> 04:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
dollars of
 
04:05:11.750 --> 04:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
compensation that I believe you were
 
04:05:14.149 --> 04:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
entitled well I think there's a lot of
 
04:05:16.429 --> 04:05:16.439 align:start position:0%
people that were entitled to that money
 
04:05:18.550 --> 04:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
that weren't weren't told about it if
 
04:05:18.560 --> 04:05:19.750 align:start position:0%
that weren't weren't told about it if
that's

04:05:19.750 --> 04:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:05:19.760 --> 04:05:22.229 align:start position:0%
that's
true

04:05:22.229 --> 04:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
true
 
04:05:25.349 --> 04:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
terrible I yes in conclusion Madam chair
 
04:05:26.750 --> 04:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say you know thank you
 
04:05:29.269 --> 04:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
for opening up the space for me to tell
 
04:05:30.870 --> 04:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
my story you know I
 
04:05:33.469 --> 04:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
was going back and forth as whether or
 
04:05:35.550 --> 04:05:35.560 align:start position:0%
not I necessarily wanted to you know
 
04:05:39.389 --> 04:05:39.399 align:start position:0%
because I can't say whether or not uh it
 
04:05:40.870 --> 04:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
was the vaccine that caused what
 
04:05:44.309 --> 04:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
happened to me on April of 2023
 
04:05:50.269 --> 04:05:50.279 align:start position:0%
what I can say was is I was and am a
 
04:05:55.469 --> 04:05:55.479 align:start position:0%
healthy was a 21 20-year-old kid who uh
 
04:05:58.590 --> 04:05:58.600 align:start position:0%
was very active up
 
04:06:02.070 --> 04:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
until December of 2021 when I had gotten
 
04:06:05.149 --> 04:06:05.159 align:start position:0%
the one shot of the fiser vaccine and
 
04:06:07.750 --> 04:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
since then have had reduction in stamina
 
04:06:11.349 --> 04:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
a numb arm tight chest culminating in
 
04:06:14.189 --> 04:06:14.199 align:start position:0%
what happened in April of 2023 with
 
04:06:17.389 --> 04:06:17.399 align:start position:0%
with um with what I've been told as a
 
04:06:21.149 --> 04:06:21.159 align:start position:0%
panic attack so um thank you for opening
 
04:06:22.830 --> 04:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
up the space for me to say this here
 
04:06:24.590 --> 04:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
because I have met a lot of people
 
04:06:27.070 --> 04:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
across the state who have gone through a
 
04:06:27.080 --> 04:06:28.030 align:start position:0%
across the state who have gone through a
similar

04:06:28.030 --> 04:06:28.040 align:start position:0%
similar
 
04:06:30.309 --> 04:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
experience never talking about their
 
04:06:31.990 --> 04:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
experience outside of their family or
 
04:06:34.950 --> 04:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
their friends um because they're worried
 
04:06:37.269 --> 04:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
about backlash people don't want to be
 
04:06:39.110 --> 04:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
labeled an antivaxer they don't want to
 
04:06:41.429 --> 04:06:41.439 align:start position:0%
be labeled anti-id they don't want to be
 
04:06:44.070 --> 04:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
labeled a conspiracy theorist
 
04:06:46.590 --> 04:06:46.600 align:start position:0%
um I I don't want to be labeled those
 
04:06:49.229 --> 04:06:49.239 align:start position:0%
things either you know I want to be
 
04:06:51.429 --> 04:06:51.439 align:start position:0%
compliant with the society in which we
 
04:06:56.349 --> 04:06:56.359 align:start position:0%
live to an extent and I want there to
 
04:06:59.790 --> 04:06:59.800 align:start position:0%
be safe vaccines out there I believe in
 
04:07:03.269 --> 04:07:03.279 align:start position:0%
the science that has created these
 
04:07:05.750 --> 04:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
beautiful medical devices that we live
 
04:07:08.149 --> 04:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
off of today I want those to be safe and
 
04:07:10.630 --> 04:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
effective in a true sense I want the
 
04:07:12.990 --> 04:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies to be held to
 
04:07:15.910 --> 04:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
account and and I want them to
 
04:07:19.710 --> 04:07:19.720 align:start position:0%
be putting out safe and effective
 
04:07:22.030 --> 04:07:22.040 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical products
 
04:07:25.429 --> 04:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
um I mean ex like like I said before I I
 
04:07:26.870 --> 04:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
don't think it's too much of a leap to
 
04:07:28.630 --> 04:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
believe the pharmaceutical companies
 
04:07:34.109 --> 04:07:34.119 align:start position:0%
that pushed the opioids onto our country
 
04:07:38.510 --> 04:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
or any of the ineffective and dangerous
 
04:07:39.950 --> 04:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
drugs that they've pushed onto our
 
04:07:41.269 --> 04:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
country I don't I don't think it's too
 
04:07:44.950 --> 04:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
far to believe that they they might have
 
04:07:47.469 --> 04:07:47.479 align:start position:0%
uh jumped a few obstacles that should
 
04:07:49.990 --> 04:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
have been walked around I suppose so I'm
 
04:07:53.349 --> 04:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
going to put that and in the end hurt a
 
04:07:54.910 --> 04:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
few thousand people in this country we
 
04:07:56.990 --> 04:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
don't know how many because there isn't
 
04:07:59.149 --> 04:07:59.159 align:start position:0%
the appropriate data but I hope
 
04:08:01.790 --> 04:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
committees like these through a measured
 
04:08:04.189 --> 04:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
and balanced and appropriate approach
 
04:08:07.070 --> 04:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
can hopefully find some some truth
 
04:08:08.389 --> 04:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
through this so that we don't have to
 
04:08:12.070 --> 04:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
have such a partisan ranker debate about
 
04:08:15.469 --> 04:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:17.790 --> 04:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
measured it's just you know people
 
04:08:19.550 --> 04:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
deserve to be heard when they are when
 
04:08:22.030 --> 04:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
they're hurt has nothing to do with
 
04:08:23.510 --> 04:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's a vaccine it's just
 
04:08:26.389 --> 04:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
we should find out what is causing all
 
04:08:29.710 --> 04:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
these very young people to to be very uh
 
04:08:31.830 --> 04:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
injured so thank you madam chairman and
 
04:08:35.229 --> 04:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the the opportunity to come
 
04:08:37.189 --> 04:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
speak here today and the invitation
 
04:08:39.670 --> 04:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much for coming
 
04:08:41.790 --> 04:08:41.800 align:start position:0%
and uh sharing your story I appreciate
 
04:08:41.800 --> 04:08:53.710 align:start position:0%
and uh sharing your story I appreciate
it

04:08:53.710 --> 04:08:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:00.149 --> 04:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:02.670 --> 04:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
Caswell I would like to thank you for
 
04:09:05.109 --> 04:09:05.119 align:start position:0%
making the time to be here today I know
 
04:09:07.030 --> 04:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
you have a very busy schedule so thank
 
04:09:09.990 --> 04:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
you so much I'm happy to be here today
 
04:09:13.389 --> 04:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
um I received the information that that
 
04:09:15.109 --> 04:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk about today so let me
 
04:09:17.229 --> 04:09:17.239 align:start position:0%
pull that a little closer um I thought
 
04:09:19.109 --> 04:09:19.119 align:start position:0%
maybe what I might do is just sort of
 
04:09:21.349 --> 04:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
give a little background on gopher and
 
04:09:23.550 --> 04:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
sort of what all that's about and first
 
04:09:25.469 --> 04:09:25.479 align:start position:0%
of all I would start by saying I
 
04:09:27.510 --> 04:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
apologize for the acronym I didn't come
 
04:09:30.070 --> 04:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
up with the acronym gopher but it is
 
04:09:31.590 --> 04:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
what it is it's the governor's office
 
04:09:34.149 --> 04:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
for emergency relief and Recovery uh
 
04:09:36.189 --> 04:09:36.199 align:start position:0%
that office was established by an
 
04:09:38.030 --> 04:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
executive order right at the beginning
 
04:09:41.870 --> 04:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
of covid in April of 2020 um during a
 
04:09:44.389 --> 04:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
period of time uh would say for the next
 
04:09:47.349 --> 04:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
two years uh gopher was pretty much
 
04:09:51.469 --> 04:09:51.479 align:start position:0%
engaged in the um in the management of
 
04:09:54.429 --> 04:09:54.439 align:start position:0%
the funds that came from the cares act
 
04:09:56.790 --> 04:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh and the way that we did that at the
 
04:10:00.830 --> 04:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
time was uh we had an assembly of I
 
04:10:03.950 --> 04:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
would say about 10 or 15 state employees
 
04:10:06.309 --> 04:10:06.319 align:start position:0%
from other agencies that were assigned
 
04:10:09.109 --> 04:10:09.119 align:start position:0%
to work uh undergo for for a period of
 
04:10:11.710 --> 04:10:11.720 align:start position:0%
time so we had people that um policy
 
04:10:14.309 --> 04:10:14.319 align:start position:0%
people we had uh
 
04:10:15.670 --> 04:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
administrative and accounting
 
04:10:17.830 --> 04:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
individuals some legal people and some
 
04:10:21.670 --> 04:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
um Outreach people and that is pretty
 
04:10:25.429 --> 04:10:25.439 align:start position:0%
much how gopher operated in those we
 
04:10:28.269 --> 04:10:28.279 align:start position:0%
call I call it the early days of gopher
 
04:10:31.630 --> 04:10:31.640 align:start position:0%
um when the arpa uh was passed the
 
04:10:34.469 --> 04:10:34.479 align:start position:0%
American Rescue plan that was passed uh
 
04:10:37.189 --> 04:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
by Congress in early
 
04:10:41.830 --> 04:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
2021 um gopher um was assigned basically
 
04:10:45.830 --> 04:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
to to take over over the the continue
 
04:10:47.550 --> 04:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
the same kind of operation that we were
 
04:10:50.910 --> 04:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
doing under cares act for um for those
 
04:10:54.109 --> 04:10:54.119 align:start position:0%
funds and it's important to to know that
 
04:10:56.469 --> 04:10:56.479 align:start position:0%
under arpa there were many many buckets
 
04:10:59.469 --> 04:10:59.479 align:start position:0%
of funds one of the largest was called
 
04:11:02.469 --> 04:11:02.479 align:start position:0%
the state and local fiscal Recovery Fund
 
04:11:04.630 --> 04:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
that was the most flexible of those
 
04:11:06.910 --> 04:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
funds and that were those were the funds
 
04:11:09.910 --> 04:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
that goer was assigned to uh to manage
 
04:11:13.790 --> 04:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the state um and so uh that
 
04:11:15.469 --> 04:11:15.479 align:start position:0%
is pretty much where we have been
 
04:11:17.269 --> 04:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
operating since
 
04:11:19.590 --> 04:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
then um and I can talk a little bit
 
04:11:23.469 --> 04:11:23.479 align:start position:0%
about kind of that process and so on um
 
04:11:26.309 --> 04:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
but what gopher has been specifically
 
04:11:28.710 --> 04:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
tested with and I think on a day-to-day
 
04:11:30.790 --> 04:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
basis is I mentioned is to just manage
 
04:11:35.950 --> 04:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
the overall um um uh use and delineation
 
04:11:39.070 --> 04:11:39.080 align:start position:0%
and deployment of those funds uh we work
 
04:11:41.070 --> 04:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
with all the state agencies we work with
 
04:11:42.710 --> 04:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
the legislature we work with different
 
04:11:42.720 --> 04:11:44.109 align:start position:0%
the legislature we work with different
grantees

04:11:44.109 --> 04:11:44.119 align:start position:0%
grantees
 
04:11:46.590 --> 04:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
uh we perform eligibility analysis so
 
04:11:48.950 --> 04:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
each of these particularly under under
 
04:11:51.429 --> 04:11:51.439 align:start position:0%
arpa each of these programs have
 
04:11:52.990 --> 04:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
specific requirements and they have to
 
04:11:55.429 --> 04:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
go into specific expenditure categories
 
04:11:57.429 --> 04:11:57.439 align:start position:0%
and we have to be able to account for
 
04:11:59.870 --> 04:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
all of that going forward in our regular
 
04:12:01.910 --> 04:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
reporting to the federal government and
 
04:12:04.790 --> 04:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
and to the public um we have uh
 
04:12:06.229 --> 04:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
different types of structures for
 
04:12:07.630 --> 04:12:07.640 align:start position:0%
different types of programs and
 
04:12:11.070 --> 04:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
different grants and some are some are
 
04:12:12.710 --> 04:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh some are structured differently than
 
04:12:14.830 --> 04:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
others uh depending on the
 
04:12:18.309 --> 04:12:18.319 align:start position:0%
situation um we have a very substantive
 
04:12:20.710 --> 04:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
website where all of our uh all of the
 
04:12:22.550 --> 04:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
programs and the funds and who they've
 
04:12:25.750 --> 04:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
gone to Are all uh made available um on
 
04:12:28.309 --> 04:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
our public website so transparency is
 
04:12:30.349 --> 04:12:30.359 align:start position:0%
obviously something that we spend a lot
 
04:12:34.269 --> 04:12:34.279 align:start position:0%
of time on um and going forward uh we're
 
04:12:37.269 --> 04:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
working really sort of and I think um
 
04:12:40.309 --> 04:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
moving toward a scenario where a lot
 
04:12:42.469 --> 04:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
more of the operations that we are
 
04:12:44.429 --> 04:12:44.439 align:start position:0%
engaged in are in compliance and
 
04:12:47.149 --> 04:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Compliance and reporting to
 
04:12:50.189 --> 04:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
all the various uh agencies on uh what
 
04:12:52.229 --> 04:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
the how the funds have been used and how
 
04:12:55.469 --> 04:12:55.479 align:start position:0%
they're going so um in terms of the
 
04:12:57.429 --> 04:12:57.439 align:start position:0%
total amounts like the big picture
 
04:13:01.510 --> 04:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
amounts under cares act the state was uh
 
04:13:04.229 --> 04:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
was allocated $1.25
 
04:13:07.149 --> 04:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
billion uh and so that was the first
 
04:13:09.750 --> 04:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
iteration of that uh we received those
 
04:13:13.750 --> 04:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
funds on April 17th of 2020
 
04:13:16.910 --> 04:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh the funds ultimately needed to be uh
 
04:13:18.910 --> 04:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
obligated by the end of
 
04:13:22.070 --> 04:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
2021 with full expenditures completed by
 
04:13:25.269 --> 04:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
September 30th 2022 all of that has
 
04:13:28.109 --> 04:13:28.119 align:start position:0%
occurred those funds all yes ma'am
 
04:13:30.790 --> 04:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
representen thank you madam chair I
 
04:13:32.109 --> 04:13:32.119 align:start position:0%
really want to listen to your testimony
 
04:13:34.269 --> 04:13:34.279 align:start position:0%
but I have to I have to go home but I
 
04:13:36.309 --> 04:13:36.319 align:start position:0%
have a just a quick question and it's
 
04:13:37.750 --> 04:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
about time frame so I know you were
 
04:13:41.349 --> 04:13:41.359 align:start position:0%
explaining it which is good um so I know
 
04:13:43.109 --> 04:13:43.119 align:start position:0%
when everything started I I kind of
 
04:13:45.030 --> 04:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
follow that very closely with gopher
 
04:13:46.590 --> 04:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
actually a couple representatives from
 
04:13:48.229 --> 04:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
straford County just met with you
 
04:13:50.269 --> 04:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
recently yes okay so I'm kind of part of
 
04:13:53.750 --> 04:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
that piece too um I didn't understand
 
04:13:56.030 --> 04:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
how gopher kind of transitioned into
 
04:13:58.550 --> 04:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
arpa so thank you for that explanation I
 
04:14:01.429 --> 04:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
know it's probably a lot more um a lot
 
04:14:03.830 --> 04:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
more weeds to it than what you explained
 
04:14:08.269 --> 04:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
so in a sense can can I just understand
 
04:14:11.870 --> 04:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
when how long will it go for right so
 
04:14:13.710 --> 04:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
that's what I want to try okay so I
 
04:14:14.990 --> 04:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
understand with a federal government I
 
04:14:17.389 --> 04:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
know certain things have all based upon
 
04:14:20.790 --> 04:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
time and then um and things run out and
 
04:14:22.630 --> 04:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
then it's gone if it's not spent it's
 
04:14:26.309 --> 04:14:26.319 align:start position:0%
gone or not accepted but is there is
 
04:14:28.349 --> 04:14:28.359 align:start position:0%
there an end in sight because I know
 
04:14:29.990 --> 04:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
certain things like you just said had an
 
04:14:32.550 --> 04:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
end in sight but now with arpa kind of
 
04:14:35.429 --> 04:14:35.439 align:start position:0%
where does that if you can explain that
 
04:14:37.269 --> 04:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
I sure hope there's an end in sight I'm
 
04:14:40.149 --> 04:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
really looking for it but I would say so
 
04:14:43.790 --> 04:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
to answer your question um arpa right
 
04:14:46.149 --> 04:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
now we are required to have all
 
04:14:48.590 --> 04:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
obligations complete by the end of this
 
04:14:52.389 --> 04:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
calendar year so any of the decisions on
 
04:14:54.790 --> 04:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
what is going to be uh be receiving
 
04:14:58.550 --> 04:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
funding under the again under the sfrf
 
04:15:00.550 --> 04:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
the state and local fiscal Recovery Fund
 
04:15:03.030 --> 04:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
sorry for the acronyms the sfrf
 
04:15:05.309 --> 04:15:05.319 align:start position:0%
programming has to be obligated by the
 
04:15:08.670 --> 04:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
end of this calendar year uh then there
 
04:15:10.710 --> 04:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
is a period of an additional two years
 
04:15:13.070 --> 04:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
to complete all the expenditures so
 
04:15:15.670 --> 04:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
everything that is obligated by the end
 
04:15:18.229 --> 04:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
of this year has to be spent by the end
 
04:15:18.239 --> 04:15:19.030 align:start position:0%
of this year has to be spent by the end
of

04:15:19.030 --> 04:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:15:22.109 --> 04:15:22.119 align:start position:0%
2026 so that's the basic overview of it
 
04:15:24.149 --> 04:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of wiggle room there
 
04:15:25.670 --> 04:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
but what I was about to say is under
 
04:15:27.309 --> 04:15:27.319 align:start position:0%
car's act originally That was supposed
 
04:15:32.109 --> 04:15:32.119 align:start position:0%
to be the end of 2020 2020 and uh on
 
04:15:34.229 --> 04:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
three days before that deadline Congress
 
04:15:37.950 --> 04:15:37.960 align:start position:0%
extended it for a year
 
04:15:40.870 --> 04:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
so there's stories to go with
 
04:15:43.590 --> 04:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
that there might be a little end of the
 
04:15:46.429 --> 04:15:46.439 align:start position:0%
tunnel light for you in 2026 who knows
 
04:15:48.149 --> 04:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
yes that's right uh we're looking
 
04:15:50.030 --> 04:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
forward to that but yeah I think and and
 
04:15:51.189 --> 04:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
the last thing I would say
 
04:15:53.590 --> 04:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative that related to this is
 
04:15:56.229 --> 04:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
that at this point the state has
 
04:15:58.590 --> 04:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
allocated the entire amount that we have
 
04:16:01.510 --> 04:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
under sfrf it that doesn't mean that
 
04:16:03.429 --> 04:16:03.439 align:start position:0%
it's been fully obligated and I'm sorry
 
04:16:05.590 --> 04:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
for the different the different terms
 
04:16:06.830 --> 04:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
but by obligated what we're talking
 
04:16:08.790 --> 04:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
about is that funding is under contract
 
04:16:10.950 --> 04:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
so there are still some allocations that
 
04:16:13.229 --> 04:16:13.239 align:start position:0%
gopher has made to State agencies for
 
04:16:15.590 --> 04:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
example and they have not yet been able
 
04:16:18.189 --> 04:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
to secure a contract to to to spend
 
04:16:20.309 --> 04:16:20.319 align:start position:0%
those funds they need to have that done
 
04:16:23.830 --> 04:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
by the end of this year so um you've
 
04:16:25.189 --> 04:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
probably seen and heard that we've been
 
04:16:27.830 --> 04:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
doing some reallocations of funds these
 
04:16:29.830 --> 04:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
are programs that we could identify
 
04:16:31.510 --> 04:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
we're not going to fully spend what
 
04:16:33.790 --> 04:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
their allocation was and so rather than
 
04:16:35.229 --> 04:16:35.239 align:start position:0%
send that money back to the federal
 
04:16:37.149 --> 04:16:37.159 align:start position:0%
government we want to make sure that we
 
04:16:39.830 --> 04:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
have as as much of that uh amount that
 
04:16:42.070 --> 04:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
we have under sfrf fully obligated by
 
04:16:43.910 --> 04:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
the end of this calendar year so it's
 
04:16:45.309 --> 04:16:45.319 align:start position:0%
going to be kind of this process over
 
04:16:46.710 --> 04:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
the next couple of months to make sure
 
04:16:52.910 --> 04:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:55.070 --> 04:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
you and feel free to reach out to me
 
04:16:56.670 --> 04:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
anytime if there's other questions that
 
04:16:58.590 --> 04:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
you you that you have on all of this
 
04:16:59.790 --> 04:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
kind of thing I know it's something
 
04:16:59.800 --> 04:17:00.469 align:start position:0%
kind of thing I know it's something
you're

04:17:00.469 --> 04:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:17:03.070 --> 04:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
following so just again just to go back
 
04:17:04.950 --> 04:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
to just a few notes that I made here the
 
04:17:08.309 --> 04:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
the the total amount for the arpa sfrf
 
04:17:10.349 --> 04:17:10.359 align:start position:0%
funding that we received uh that the
 
04:17:14.229 --> 04:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
state received is n 99
 
04:17:14.239 --> 04:17:17.630 align:start position:0%
state received is n 99
4,555

04:17:17.630 --> 04:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:17.640 --> 04:17:19.870 align:start position:0%
 
187760

04:17:19.870 --> 04:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
187760
 
04:17:23.710 --> 04:17:23.720 align:start position:0%
um can we just say shy of 1 billion yeah
 
04:17:25.429 --> 04:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
that's what I always say but I know you
 
04:17:29.469 --> 04:17:29.479 align:start position:0%
guys like to be exact so it's $994,000
 
04:17:39.309 --> 04:17:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:41.710 --> 04:17:41.720 align:start position:0%
7760 yeah I mean we're holding back to
 
04:17:44.109 --> 04:17:44.119 align:start position:0%
60 cents just for entertainment value
 
04:17:47.389 --> 04:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
but um the uh those funds were received
 
04:17:51.229 --> 04:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
in two tranches uh one on May 19th 2021
 
04:17:52.910 --> 04:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
and then a second trunch I think of
 
04:17:56.710 --> 04:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
equal amount on uh the same date in 2022
 
04:17:58.910 --> 04:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
and as we just spoke those are the uh
 
04:18:01.510 --> 04:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
deadlines and obligations uh that we
 
04:18:03.269 --> 04:18:03.279 align:start position:0%
have to for spending and and using that
 
04:18:05.389 --> 04:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
money so the last thing that I'll say
 
04:18:06.550 --> 04:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
and then we can talk about whatever you
 
04:18:10.469 --> 04:18:10.479 align:start position:0%
want the um our focus on these funds has
 
04:18:13.109 --> 04:18:13.119 align:start position:0%
been to make investments in capital
 
04:18:15.229 --> 04:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
Capital Investments we have tried very
 
04:18:18.269 --> 04:18:18.279 align:start position:0%
hard to avoid uh making Investments that
 
04:18:19.910 --> 04:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
are going to have long-term
 
04:18:22.309 --> 04:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
administrative and operational cost
 
04:18:24.109 --> 04:18:24.119 align:start position:0%
implications for state government or
 
04:18:27.030 --> 04:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
really for anybody else uh that was uh
 
04:18:28.550 --> 04:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
we call it the prime directive from the
 
04:18:30.630 --> 04:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
governor and I think we've done a pretty
 
04:18:33.950 --> 04:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
good job at um at really implementing
 
04:18:35.830 --> 04:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
that and in fact uh there was recently a
 
04:18:37.590 --> 04:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
study from the Pew charitable trust that
 
04:18:39.590 --> 04:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
gave New Hampshire a very high number I
 
04:18:41.189 --> 04:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
think it was close to 80% of the funds
 
04:18:43.309 --> 04:18:43.319 align:start position:0%
and according to their
 
04:18:46.670 --> 04:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh their uh analysis that we had put uh
 
04:18:48.790 --> 04:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
into those Capital sort of I don't want
 
04:18:49.870 --> 04:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
to call them infrastructure because they
 
04:18:51.710 --> 04:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
weren't all infrastructure but Capital
 
04:18:55.030 --> 04:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
Investments um so good examples of that
 
04:18:56.990 --> 04:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
would be we've put a significant amount
 
04:19:00.510 --> 04:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
of money into water and sewer uh funds
 
04:19:03.189 --> 04:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
and uh programs uh through Department of
 
04:19:05.630 --> 04:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services uh we have
 
04:19:07.670 --> 04:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
invested uh a little over hundred
 
04:19:09.750 --> 04:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
million of arpa funds for affordable
 
04:19:13.990 --> 04:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
housing and for uh municipalities um uh
 
04:19:16.309 --> 04:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
to to move forward how they wish on
 
04:19:18.710 --> 04:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
affordable housing initiatives we
 
04:19:21.550 --> 04:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
continued to have some uh early earlier
 
04:19:24.830 --> 04:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
in this um uh dur in this period you
 
04:19:27.030 --> 04:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
know still into 2021 we were still able
 
04:19:29.429 --> 04:19:29.439 align:start position:0%
to use the arpa funds to help with some
 
04:19:31.109 --> 04:19:31.119 align:start position:0%
of the immediate covid responses that
 
04:19:33.990 --> 04:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
were still going on at that time um and
 
04:19:36.070 --> 04:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
we also have seen a pretty significant
 
04:19:39.309 --> 04:19:39.319 align:start position:0%
investment into um mental and Behavioral
 
04:19:42.389 --> 04:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
Health Systems um and and really uh in a
 
04:19:45.309 --> 04:19:45.319 align:start position:0%
sub use disorder uh context as well
 
04:19:47.269 --> 04:19:47.279 align:start position:0%
because those numbers skyrocketed as I'm
 
04:19:50.389 --> 04:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
sure you're aware during covid so arpa
 
04:19:53.149 --> 04:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
funds were used for en large for um for
 
04:19:54.469 --> 04:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
those types of
 
04:19:58.030 --> 04:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
services um a quick step back to car's
 
04:20:01.550 --> 04:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
act which was different in some ways I
 
04:20:03.349 --> 04:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
would say that a majority of the funds
 
04:20:05.469 --> 04:20:05.479 align:start position:0%
that we used under car's act were used
 
04:20:07.870 --> 04:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
to stabilize the really the private
 
04:20:10.550 --> 04:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
sector uh at that time we put a
 
04:20:12.830 --> 04:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
significant amount of resource into to
 
04:20:15.910 --> 04:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
the Main Street Relief Fund uh into a
 
04:20:17.910 --> 04:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
program for self-employed individuals
 
04:20:20.469 --> 04:20:20.479 align:start position:0%
which was aptly named self like don't
 
04:20:21.750 --> 04:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
ask me to tell you what it stood for I
 
04:20:25.309 --> 04:20:25.319 align:start position:0%
don't remember but the uh self-employed
 
04:20:29.790 --> 04:20:29.800 align:start position:0%
livelihood fund thank you Chase um uh
 
04:20:31.309 --> 04:20:31.319 align:start position:0%
see that's why I brought him he's good
 
04:20:33.830 --> 04:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
with the acronyms but uh and then we had
 
04:20:36.910 --> 04:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
another program the nonprofit Enterprise
 
04:20:39.070 --> 04:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
Relief Fund Nerf so we gave a good
 
04:20:41.109 --> 04:20:41.119 align:start position:0%
amount of resources to nonprofit
 
04:20:43.510 --> 04:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
employers so all all together I think
 
04:20:45.550 --> 04:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
that total I would say somewhere between
 
04:20:49.309 --> 04:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
75 and 80% of the funds and um and we
 
04:20:51.750 --> 04:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
did that very quickly we we moved those
 
04:20:55.510 --> 04:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
funds um as I said we received those in
 
04:20:59.030 --> 04:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
April of 2020 we had that first Main
 
04:21:02.189 --> 04:21:02.199 align:start position:0%
Street Relief Fund online by June of
 
04:21:04.389 --> 04:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
that year and and I and I like to think
 
04:21:06.710 --> 04:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
that that made a difference in terms of
 
04:21:09.030 --> 04:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
our ability to rebound quickly a lot of
 
04:21:10.429 --> 04:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
other states were just starting to think
 
04:21:11.790 --> 04:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
about what they were going to do with it
 
04:21:14.189 --> 04:21:14.199 align:start position:0%
by the time we were operating uh
 
04:21:17.790 --> 04:21:17.800 align:start position:0%
programs um so the other thing we did do
 
04:21:19.750 --> 04:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh under cares Act was as you'll recall
 
04:21:23.309 --> 04:21:23.319 align:start position:0%
also there was uh there was a lot of uh
 
04:21:25.750 --> 04:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
there there were a lot of issues with um
 
04:21:27.630 --> 04:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
assisted living facilities nursing homes
 
04:21:29.990 --> 04:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
and other locations where uh they were
 
04:21:32.109 --> 04:21:32.119 align:start position:0%
having difficulty with Staffing and
 
04:21:34.870 --> 04:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
other things and costs um that were
 
04:21:37.870 --> 04:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
escalating we did uh dedicated uh some
 
04:21:40.189 --> 04:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
resources to stabilizing those
 
04:21:43.189 --> 04:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
organizations at that time um um and
 
04:21:44.990 --> 04:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
then really the last one that in terms
 
04:21:46.710 --> 04:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
of big and we did a lot of programming
 
04:21:48.590 --> 04:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
but I think in terms of big Investments
 
04:21:51.189 --> 04:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
was in the agriculture space um a lot of
 
04:21:53.710 --> 04:21:53.720 align:start position:0%
our agriculture uh communities were also
 
04:21:56.309 --> 04:21:56.319 align:start position:0%
very heavily damaged by not being able
 
04:21:59.149 --> 04:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
to get their um their their Pro their
 
04:22:01.710 --> 04:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
produce and their products um to Market
 
04:22:04.710 --> 04:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
or sold so th that's kind of the big
 
04:22:06.590 --> 04:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
overview I know there's there's a whole
 
04:22:08.189 --> 04:22:08.199 align:start position:0%
lot I mean this has been about four
 
04:22:10.950 --> 04:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
years that we've been in operation um
 
04:22:12.990 --> 04:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to talk about but that's
 
04:22:17.670 --> 04:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
that's the extent of it for at least my
 
04:22:19.910 --> 04:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
statement represent
 
04:22:22.510 --> 04:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
Vel thank you for coming sir it's good
 
04:22:26.109 --> 04:22:26.119 align:start position:0%
to see you on a uh Friday
 
04:22:26.119 --> 04:22:27.870 align:start position:0%
to see you on a uh Friday
afternoon

04:22:27.870 --> 04:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
04:22:33.550 --> 04:22:33.560 align:start position:0%
um so just in the uh original um
 
04:22:35.030 --> 04:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
creation of
 
04:22:37.750 --> 04:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
gopher there was originally some sort of
 
04:22:40.269 --> 04:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
a commission or something I I because I
 
04:22:43.030 --> 04:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
remember listening remember Homeland sec
 
04:22:46.229 --> 04:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
was running the uh the
 
04:22:48.710 --> 04:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
phones the days before we discovered the
 
04:22:51.910 --> 04:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
magic of zoom and team heard of Zo we
 
04:22:53.910 --> 04:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
were having like you know 4our
 
04:22:56.550 --> 04:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
conference calls um yes you're correct
 
04:22:59.790 --> 04:22:59.800 align:start position:0%
there was the legislative Advisory Board
 
04:23:02.710 --> 04:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh which was part of the uh under cares
 
04:23:04.990 --> 04:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
act that was a group obviously that we
 
04:23:07.389 --> 04:23:07.399 align:start position:0%
kept up to date and informed with regard
 
04:23:09.990 --> 04:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
to uh how the funds were being uh
 
04:23:12.510 --> 04:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
deployed there was also as I recall a
 
04:23:15.710 --> 04:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
stakeholder Advisory Board the component
 
04:23:20.109 --> 04:23:20.119 align:start position:0%
under car's act um concurrent to all of
 
04:23:21.469 --> 04:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
that and you might also remember
 
04:23:23.630 --> 04:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
representative is the was the U
 
04:23:27.990 --> 04:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
reopening task force that also had those
 
04:23:31.510 --> 04:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
God aul long um conference meetings over
 
04:23:33.990 --> 04:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
phone um but those were also quite
 
04:23:36.269 --> 04:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
informative to the work of goer and I
 
04:23:38.269 --> 04:23:38.279 align:start position:0%
know that was sort of in my Bea
 
04:23:40.870 --> 04:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
existence which was you know to try to
 
04:23:42.070 --> 04:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
understand from businesses what they
 
04:23:44.950 --> 04:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
were facing at the time with the regard
 
04:23:46.790 --> 04:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
to closures and what was closed and what
 
04:23:49.030 --> 04:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
was opening and why and balancing that
 
04:23:51.109 --> 04:23:51.119 align:start position:0%
with public health uh in our Public
 
04:23:54.070 --> 04:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
Health division um that was also I would
 
04:23:56.870 --> 04:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
say um an informative component of the
 
04:24:01.870 --> 04:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:04.550 --> 04:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
time followup
 
04:24:07.229 --> 04:24:07.239 align:start position:0%
um because I just remember there was
 
04:24:09.030 --> 04:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
discussion at that point whether the
 
04:24:10.670 --> 04:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee was going to have
 
04:24:13.670 --> 04:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
authority of the oversight of the funds
 
04:24:15.830 --> 04:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
and then I guess a determination was
 
04:24:19.990 --> 04:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
made to leave it to to the Gopher um
 
04:24:23.030 --> 04:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
oversight so yeah so well first of all
 
04:24:24.389 --> 04:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
under cares act remember we were in
 
04:24:25.910 --> 04:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
state of emergency so that was a
 
04:24:28.790 --> 04:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
different animal and then um when we got
 
04:24:31.870 --> 04:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
to arpa yes I think the decision the
 
04:24:33.550 --> 04:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
discussion and the decision was that
 
04:24:35.469 --> 04:24:35.479 align:start position:0%
gopher was already in a position of
 
04:24:38.030 --> 04:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
having all of the Personnel to manage
 
04:24:41.149 --> 04:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
these types of Grants and programs but
 
04:24:42.670 --> 04:24:42.680 align:start position:0%
given that we were no longer in state of
 
04:24:45.510 --> 04:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
emergency we that's when sort of the the
 
04:24:47.510 --> 04:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
the role of fiscal committee came back
 
04:24:49.149 --> 04:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
into the picture and they've been in it
 
04:24:51.830 --> 04:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
ever since okay that's what I wondered
 
04:24:55.229 --> 04:24:55.239 align:start position:0%
because um you know we're in the with
 
04:24:57.189 --> 04:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
the budget process and all that
 
04:25:00.349 --> 04:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
everybody is really getting um ecstatic
 
04:25:04.269 --> 04:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
about arpa opportunities to fund uh
 
04:25:06.389 --> 04:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
these different uh
 
04:25:08.910 --> 04:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation uh bills and I knew at
 
04:25:12.389 --> 04:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
some point that that fiscal had so they
 
04:25:14.990 --> 04:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
basically have control of of how the
 
04:25:17.469 --> 04:25:17.479 align:start position:0%
funds for arpa are disseminated well
 
04:25:18.950 --> 04:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
they have they yeah they ultimately have
 
04:25:20.910 --> 04:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
to approve any of the expenditures that
 
04:25:23.630 --> 04:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
have been proposed so um we were just
 
04:25:26.109 --> 04:25:26.119 align:start position:0%
there today with with a with a with with
 
04:25:28.990 --> 04:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
another tranch of programs and and
 
04:25:31.469 --> 04:25:31.479 align:start position:0%
funding initiatives that they reviewed
 
04:25:31.479 --> 04:25:32.870 align:start position:0%
funding initiatives that they reviewed
and

04:25:32.870 --> 04:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:25:35.149 --> 04:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
approved I have some others but other
 
04:25:38.189 --> 04:25:38.199 align:start position:0%
people can talk oh follow up yeah I mean
 
04:25:40.469 --> 04:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
I guess the other thing is just based on
 
04:25:42.790 --> 04:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
the charge of this committee
 
04:25:46.109 --> 04:25:46.119 align:start position:0%
which is to to kind of look into the
 
04:25:49.269 --> 04:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
response of the State uh from a efficacy
 
04:25:50.830 --> 04:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
standpoint in
 
04:25:53.510 --> 04:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
covid I was sort of listening to what
 
04:25:56.510 --> 04:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
you were describing and I of how the
 
04:25:59.109 --> 04:25:59.119 align:start position:0%
funds were used especially the car's act
 
04:26:02.510 --> 04:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
and I was trying to understand how much
 
04:26:07.710 --> 04:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
of this money was used for like vaccines
 
04:26:11.590 --> 04:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
or health health related issues I heard
 
04:26:13.590 --> 04:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
you say about the nursing homes and
 
04:26:17.229 --> 04:26:17.239 align:start position:0%
stabilizing that Workforce situation but
 
04:26:19.750 --> 04:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
how much of it was actually used by the
 
04:26:22.229 --> 04:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
public health sector would you say a lot
 
04:26:24.510 --> 04:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of the cares act fund uh in
 
04:26:26.550 --> 04:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
particular and I'm sorry I don't have
 
04:26:28.710 --> 04:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
the exact numbers I couldn't possibly
 
04:26:30.990 --> 04:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
bring everything to be able to answer
 
04:26:32.830 --> 04:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
that type of question but we can give
 
04:26:34.990 --> 04:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
you a full list of everything that I
 
04:26:36.630 --> 04:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
mean and it's available on our website
 
04:26:38.309 --> 04:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
as well but I mean if you wanted
 
04:26:41.189 --> 04:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
something uh in writing we can give you
 
04:26:42.990 --> 04:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
um a list of the
 
04:26:44.630 --> 04:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
under any category you would like if
 
04:26:46.149 --> 04:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
you'd like to have the covid response I
 
04:26:47.510 --> 04:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
do recall there were a number of
 
04:26:50.309 --> 04:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
instances where car's act funds were
 
04:26:54.349 --> 04:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
used for uh direct covid response um and
 
04:26:57.389 --> 04:26:57.399 align:start position:0%
whether that was those early
 
04:27:00.149 --> 04:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
um I don't even remember a lot of it is
 
04:27:04.229 --> 04:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:07.630 --> 04:27:07.640 align:start position:0%
those anyway so there there were a lot
 
04:27:09.229 --> 04:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
of a lot of funds that were used under
 
04:27:11.389 --> 04:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
car's act for that and I would say the
 
04:27:15.070 --> 04:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
the other thing is is regard to how the
 
04:27:16.910 --> 04:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
how we differentiate or how I have
 
04:27:19.269 --> 04:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
always differentiated the the the two
 
04:27:21.830 --> 04:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
programs cares and arpa Caris was really
 
04:27:24.590 --> 04:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
an emergency response initiative those
 
04:27:28.670 --> 04:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
were funds that were used uh to directly
 
04:27:30.870 --> 04:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
respond to at the time what we didn't
 
04:27:34.229 --> 04:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
really know much about and what we were
 
04:27:36.269 --> 04:27:36.279 align:start position:0%
uh we were almost in a constant
 
04:27:39.149 --> 04:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
Balancing Act of issues that were
 
04:27:40.950 --> 04:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
affecting the economy and issues that
 
04:27:42.710 --> 04:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
were affecting Public Health and we had
 
04:27:44.750 --> 04:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
one pot of resource to try to manage
 
04:27:47.990 --> 04:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
those those challenges the arpa funds
 
04:27:51.109 --> 04:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
have been uh I think are I qualify as
 
04:27:53.670 --> 04:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
being more in terms of response so you
 
04:27:55.469 --> 04:27:55.479 align:start position:0%
know we've been through sort of the deep
 
04:27:58.349 --> 04:27:58.359 align:start position:0%
dark days of covid and now we have these
 
04:28:00.830 --> 04:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
other resources to Aid the recovery that
 
04:28:02.950 --> 04:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
that that happened as a result so most
 
04:28:06.149 --> 04:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
in a lot of cases those are um
 
04:28:08.189 --> 04:28:08.199 align:start position:0%
investments in like I was talking about
 
04:28:10.389 --> 04:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
in investments in infrastructure and
 
04:28:13.109 --> 04:28:13.119 align:start position:0%
organizations and programs
 
04:28:16.950 --> 04:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
that um origin originated in some way at
 
04:28:20.309 --> 04:28:20.319 align:start position:0%
least to the the the impact of the co
 
04:28:22.710 --> 04:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
pandemic well are you working with
 
04:28:25.349 --> 04:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security in their sort of after
 
04:28:28.670 --> 04:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
action yes report because I I think all
 
04:28:30.950 --> 04:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
of us would hate for you to have to uh
 
04:28:34.750 --> 04:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
do duplicative work but um I think it
 
04:28:36.990 --> 04:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
would be interesting as part of our
 
04:28:39.550 --> 04:28:39.560 align:start position:0%
charge since you have a better handle on
 
04:28:42.429 --> 04:28:42.439 align:start position:0%
health related expenditures of car money
 
04:28:45.429 --> 04:28:45.439 align:start position:0%
than we do that maybe you could do some
 
04:28:49.670 --> 04:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
sort of helpful snapshot yes I would be
 
04:28:52.070 --> 04:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
happy to do that for you so for health
 
04:28:54.750 --> 04:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
related expenditures under car's
 
04:28:57.710 --> 04:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
act I mean we can we can look at the at
 
04:29:00.910 --> 04:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
the mission statement one more time but
 
04:29:04.269 --> 04:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
um our charge isn't really as broad as
 
04:29:06.429 --> 04:29:06.439 align:start position:0%
others I mean I think one thing you're
 
04:29:09.189 --> 04:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
interested in too is education and what
 
04:29:12.870 --> 04:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
sort of Education supports
 
04:29:15.469 --> 04:29:15.479 align:start position:0%
there might have been I let me get that
 
04:29:17.830 --> 04:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
one to you I'm not I don't I can't
 
04:29:19.389 --> 04:29:19.399 align:start position:0%
possibly remember every program that we
 
04:29:21.469 --> 04:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
did but I would be happy to so education
 
04:29:24.870 --> 04:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
Healthcare under carees act yeah I mean
 
04:29:27.429 --> 04:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me like yeah it could be
 
04:29:29.469 --> 04:29:29.479 align:start position:0%
arpa but it sounds to me that if we're
 
04:29:31.630 --> 04:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
looking at the efficacy of our covid
 
04:29:34.870 --> 04:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
response it sounds to me correct me if
 
04:29:36.990 --> 04:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong that what you're talking about
 
04:29:39.269 --> 04:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
is more the emphasis during the
 
04:29:42.990 --> 04:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
emergency with cares focused yeah I and
 
04:29:44.950 --> 04:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
in regard to that I would say probably
 
04:29:46.830 --> 04:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
the big buckets you should consider
 
04:29:49.670 --> 04:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
looking at would be the economic impacts
 
04:29:51.269 --> 04:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
the public health impacts and the
 
04:29:53.349 --> 04:29:53.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure impacts I think those
 
04:29:55.109 --> 04:29:55.119 align:start position:0%
would be the big three
 
04:29:58.269 --> 04:29:58.279 align:start position:0%
categories um but that's not there are
 
04:29:59.670 --> 04:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
others but I think you could probably
 
04:30:01.309 --> 04:30:01.319 align:start position:0%
get most of them into those three
 
04:30:03.750 --> 04:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
categories I mean our charge is I would
 
04:30:06.469 --> 04:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
say more Health focused than I see okay
 
04:30:08.590 --> 04:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
yeah and because I mean we also don't
 
04:30:12.469 --> 04:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
want to do well for Education right I
 
04:30:14.349 --> 04:30:14.359 align:start position:0%
don't think we want to do the Homeland
 
04:30:17.510 --> 04:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
Securities work either
 
04:30:19.750 --> 04:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
right right and we will have director
 
04:30:23.870 --> 04:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
buckon here um on the 31st so um he'll
 
04:30:25.950 --> 04:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
be able to answer some questions um
 
04:30:25.960 --> 04:30:27.030 align:start position:0%
be able to answer some questions um
representative

04:30:27.030 --> 04:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:30:29.229 --> 04:30:29.239 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:30:30.910 --> 04:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
for being here to answer these questions
 
04:30:33.309 --> 04:30:33.319 align:start position:0%
for us I would like to ask some
 
04:30:35.630 --> 04:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
questions about uh a topic that I'm not
 
04:30:37.030 --> 04:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
actually sure you have all the answers
 
04:30:39.750 --> 04:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
for us while I'll start with do you have
 
04:30:43.670 --> 04:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:45.469 --> 04:30:45.479 align:start position:0%
to put to put it bluntly in my
 
04:30:47.229 --> 04:30:47.239 align:start position:0%
experience with federal funds there's
 
04:30:49.229 --> 04:30:49.239 align:start position:0%
often sort of strings that come attached
 
04:30:51.109 --> 04:30:51.119 align:start position:0%
to them things you need to do so do you
 
04:30:53.990 --> 04:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
have information regarding what was
 
04:30:56.469 --> 04:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
necessary for the state to do in receipt
 
04:30:58.309 --> 04:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
and expending any of these particular
 
04:31:01.790 --> 04:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
funds is that within your wheelhouse yes
 
04:31:03.870 --> 04:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
so I with regard to the funds that
 
04:31:06.149 --> 04:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
gopher was administering so again the
 
04:31:07.750 --> 04:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
state local fiscal Recovery Fund under
 
04:31:10.670 --> 04:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
arpa and then the Corona virus Relief
 
04:31:13.910 --> 04:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
Fund funds under car act um there there
 
04:31:16.189 --> 04:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
were no strings in terms of you must do
 
04:31:17.550 --> 04:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
this in order to get the money that was
 
04:31:19.550 --> 04:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
a straight almost entitlement payment
 
04:31:20.990 --> 04:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
from the federal government to each of
 
04:31:24.469 --> 04:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
the states I will say however that if
 
04:31:26.510 --> 04:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
you wanted to try to find some strength
 
04:31:29.750 --> 04:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
the the reporting that we have to do is
 
04:31:33.389 --> 04:31:33.399 align:start position:0%
really substantive so I mean understood
 
04:31:34.790 --> 04:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
of course that they want to be able to
 
04:31:36.550 --> 04:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
account for that but that has taken a
 
04:31:38.429 --> 04:31:38.439 align:start position:0%
lot of time and and will will in the
 
04:31:43.389 --> 04:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:45.630 --> 04:31:45.640 align:start position:0%
follow up yes can you can you go go a
 
04:31:49.309 --> 04:31:49.319 align:start position:0%
little deeper into that as far as how um
 
04:31:50.990 --> 04:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
how that that particular portion would
 
04:31:53.429 --> 04:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
relate to the government um putting
 
04:31:55.469 --> 04:31:55.479 align:start position:0%
requirements on any of the funding or
 
04:31:56.910 --> 04:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
anything like that is that what you were
 
04:31:59.229 --> 04:31:59.239 align:start position:0%
meaning well I guess I'm saying that uh
 
04:32:02.070 --> 04:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
under arpa I would say in particular
 
04:32:04.550 --> 04:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
there are specific expenditure
 
04:32:06.790 --> 04:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
categories that we have to spend the
 
04:32:09.550 --> 04:32:09.560 align:start position:0%
money and keep within there are uh and
 
04:32:11.870 --> 04:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
so there's a large number of those C
 
04:32:13.630 --> 04:32:13.640 align:start position:0%
categories and those categories have
 
04:32:15.870 --> 04:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
their own requirements as to what is
 
04:32:18.830 --> 04:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
eligible for that for that category and
 
04:32:22.510 --> 04:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
what isn't so I
 
04:32:25.229 --> 04:32:25.239 align:start position:0%
guess there were no strings to get the
 
04:32:27.630 --> 04:32:27.640 align:start position:0%
money but I think that there has been
 
04:32:30.630 --> 04:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
certainly a a lot of definition as to
 
04:32:32.990 --> 04:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
how we're spending it based on the
 
04:32:34.750 --> 04:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
expenditure categories I understand
 
04:32:34.760 --> 04:32:35.510 align:start position:0%
expenditure categories I understand
thank

04:32:35.510 --> 04:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:32:38.750 --> 04:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:32:43.070 --> 04:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
leus I am not I am not sure or what
 
04:32:45.750 --> 04:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
monies came from
 
04:32:48.070 --> 04:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
where you know who you would be
 
04:32:51.229 --> 04:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
responsible for who others would but
 
04:32:53.790 --> 04:32:53.800 align:start position:0%
this is a question from my
 
04:32:56.590 --> 04:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
granddaughter who is having a hard time
 
04:32:59.830 --> 04:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
hiring people as we're seeing all across
 
04:33:03.429 --> 04:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
the state happens to be her current job
 
04:33:09.109 --> 04:33:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:13.230 --> 04:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
is is there still where do did the money
 
04:33:15.269 --> 04:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
come from for the
 
04:33:18.551 --> 04:33:18.561 align:start position:0%
extra um
 
04:33:22.150 --> 04:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
unemployment and is that still in effect
 
04:33:25.629 --> 04:33:25.639 align:start position:0%
in this state at all so I think what
 
04:33:27.990 --> 04:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
you're referring to is at the at the end
 
04:33:30.990 --> 04:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
of cares act when we got to uh the final
 
04:33:33.830 --> 04:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
date that we had to have these funds um
 
04:33:37.070 --> 04:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
obligated we used what we call waterfall
 
04:33:40.150 --> 04:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
so the funds that were not um used at
 
04:33:42.590 --> 04:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
that point all waterfall into the State
 
04:33:45.949 --> 04:33:45.959 align:start position:0%
Unemployment Insurance Fund um in order
 
04:33:48.629 --> 04:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
to um and I don't remember the exact
 
04:33:50.670 --> 04:33:50.680 align:start position:0%
numbers Chase might remember but the
 
04:33:52.990 --> 04:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
there were funds that went to that fund
 
04:33:55.590 --> 04:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
that uh were aimed at reducing the
 
04:33:58.590 --> 04:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
impact on employers uh so taking
 
04:34:00.869 --> 04:34:00.879 align:start position:0%
basically their what would normally be
 
04:34:02.429 --> 04:34:02.439 align:start position:0%
the requirement of the employers to fill
 
04:34:04.910 --> 04:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
that fund and we use the cares act uh to
 
04:34:04.920 --> 04:34:05.910 align:start position:0%
that fund and we use the cares act uh to
accomplish

04:34:05.910 --> 04:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
accomplish
 
04:34:08.789 --> 04:34:08.799 align:start position:0%
that okay thank
 
04:34:11.470 --> 04:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
you represent po off that was 109
 
04:34:14.709 --> 04:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:17.949 --> 04:34:17.959 align:start position:0%
way thank you Madame chair thank you for
 
04:34:22.551 --> 04:34:22.561 align:start position:0%
being here uh I have a question so so
 
04:34:26.269 --> 04:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
you testified that under arpa there
 
04:34:29.789 --> 04:34:29.799 align:start position:0%
specific expenditure categories uh that
 
04:34:33.310 --> 04:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
were recommended by as the understand
 
04:34:36.230 --> 04:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
federal government so did State have
 
04:34:38.590 --> 04:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
flexibility in
 
04:34:38.600 --> 04:34:40.429 align:start position:0%
flexibility in
choosing

04:34:40.429 --> 04:34:40.439 align:start position:0%
choosing
 
04:34:44.109 --> 04:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
uh uh or denying certain
 
04:34:47.029 --> 04:34:47.039 align:start position:0%
categories like if they say oh you have
 
04:34:49.750 --> 04:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
spent on this category this category and
 
04:34:52.670 --> 04:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
this category did New Hampshire have
 
04:34:55.470 --> 04:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
flexibility to say oh we don't like this
 
04:34:58.029 --> 04:34:58.039 align:start position:0%
specific category and we want be
 
04:34:59.869 --> 04:34:59.879 align:start position:0%
spending on yeah so we don't have to
 
04:35:02.629 --> 04:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
fill all the categories we would basic
 
04:35:05.470 --> 04:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
what we have been doing is uh when we
 
04:35:07.789 --> 04:35:07.799 align:start position:0%
are working with an agency or a
 
04:35:11.150 --> 04:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
potential grantee of funds um we would
 
04:35:12.310 --> 04:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
work with
 
04:35:17.029 --> 04:35:17.039 align:start position:0%
to um make their program or their their
 
04:35:20.189 --> 04:35:20.199 align:start position:0%
request um not necessarily fit but be
 
04:35:22.629 --> 04:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
eligible for a particular criteria or
 
04:35:24.910 --> 04:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
another but that was the extent of it
 
04:35:26.470 --> 04:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
but we could choose we we don't have to
 
04:35:28.629 --> 04:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
fill all the categories thank goodness
 
04:35:30.189 --> 04:35:30.199 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of
 
04:35:30.199 --> 04:35:31.910 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of
them

04:35:31.910 --> 04:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:35:36.029 --> 04:35:36.039 align:start position:0%
followup uh thank you uh and
 
04:35:40.670 --> 04:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh more broadly um thank you for giving
 
04:35:44.949 --> 04:35:44.959 align:start position:0%
us leg picture and uh showing how New
 
04:35:48.349 --> 04:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was faster in allocating some
 
04:35:52.510 --> 04:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
of those funds and thank you for your
 
04:35:56.470 --> 04:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
work on after action report so we are
 
04:36:00.390 --> 04:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
looking uh to read when it comes out but
 
04:36:04.470 --> 04:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
can you give us right now some some
 
04:36:07.470 --> 04:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
ideas uh we know that for example some
 
04:36:09.551 --> 04:36:09.561 align:start position:0%
federal agencies like
 
04:36:12.709 --> 04:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
cdcs uh like they look back and they
 
04:36:14.510 --> 04:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
admitted some mistakes and they're
 
04:36:17.709 --> 04:36:17.719 align:start position:0%
looking to do some improvements so I
 
04:36:21.269 --> 04:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
wonder if uh in your
 
04:36:23.830 --> 04:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
department uh you see something like
 
04:36:27.990 --> 04:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
that areas that uh could be done better
 
04:36:28.000 --> 04:36:29.189 align:start position:0%
that areas that uh could be done better
next

04:36:29.189 --> 04:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
next
 
04:36:31.709 --> 04:36:31.719 align:start position:0%
time next Global
 
04:36:31.719 --> 04:36:34.269 align:start position:0%
time next Global
pandemic

04:36:34.269 --> 04:36:34.279 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
04:36:37.551 --> 04:36:37.561 align:start position:0%
um I would say I mean that's a tough
 
04:36:38.910 --> 04:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
question I would have to think about
 
04:36:40.830 --> 04:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
that but and I haven't had a lot of time
 
04:36:43.109 --> 04:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
to reflect representative on questions
 
04:36:46.470 --> 04:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
like that um but I I guess I could say
 
04:36:50.510 --> 04:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
that um I felt that um we made some very
 
04:36:52.551 --> 04:36:52.561 align:start position:0%
early decisions on what were going to be
 
04:36:54.750 --> 04:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
some priorities and we ran really hard
 
04:36:58.750 --> 04:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
at that I mean our staff um was
 
04:37:03.029 --> 04:37:03.039 align:start position:0%
working easily you know 15 18 hours a
 
04:37:07.150 --> 04:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
day uh in the middle of the pandemic um
 
04:37:09.349 --> 04:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
you you'll remember this was a time when
 
04:37:10.590 --> 04:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
you know the governor was having his
 
04:37:12.070 --> 04:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
press conference every sing single day
 
04:37:15.029 --> 04:37:15.039 align:start position:0%
and it was on and people were kind of
 
04:37:18.150 --> 04:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out um working at home
 
04:37:19.709 --> 04:37:19.719 align:start position:0%
and we know the state government was
 
04:37:22.310 --> 04:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
kind of closed but kind of open and you
 
04:37:25.349 --> 04:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
guys weren't here and it was um there
 
04:37:28.230 --> 04:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
but there was a lot of activity that was
 
04:37:31.590 --> 04:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
taking place by people to run at
 
04:37:33.629 --> 04:37:33.639 align:start position:0%
specific issues that we felt were
 
04:37:36.949 --> 04:37:36.959 align:start position:0%
priorities and um I think particularly
 
04:37:38.910 --> 04:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
you know he has we haven't finished arpa
 
04:37:42.551 --> 04:37:42.561 align:start position:0%
yet but the under cares Act I'm I'm
 
04:37:44.869 --> 04:37:44.879 align:start position:0%
personally very proud of where of of how
 
04:37:46.869 --> 04:37:46.879 align:start position:0%
we ended up I think we spent that money
 
04:37:50.150 --> 04:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
very effectively I think that we uh gave
 
04:37:52.990 --> 04:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
some um ability for the New Hampshire
 
04:37:57.070 --> 04:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
economy to come out of um whatever we
 
04:38:00.150 --> 04:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
call that now the uh covid experience in
 
04:38:02.070 --> 04:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
a position of strength and I think the
 
04:38:04.590 --> 04:38:04.600 align:start position:0%
data that we've seen since then does
 
04:38:07.109 --> 04:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
reflect that um I think we certainly
 
04:38:09.390 --> 04:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
learned a lot and this would be more of
 
04:38:12.551 --> 04:38:12.561 align:start position:0%
a question for my colleagues at h
 
04:38:15.949 --> 04:38:15.959 align:start position:0%
about um the public health component of
 
04:38:17.949 --> 04:38:17.959 align:start position:0%
this I think obviously everybody learned
 
04:38:20.869 --> 04:38:20.879 align:start position:0%
a lot uh about that um but speaking from
 
04:38:24.709 --> 04:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
the economic side um I felt like uh we
 
04:38:28.390 --> 04:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
made some pretty um good decisions uh
 
04:38:30.789 --> 04:38:30.799 align:start position:0%
with those funds uh at the get-go time
 
04:38:33.150 --> 04:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
will obviously tell but that's at least
 
04:38:36.390 --> 04:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:36.400 --> 04:38:38.429 align:start position:0%
 
now

04:38:38.429 --> 04:38:38.439 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:38:42.070 --> 04:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
followup uh thank you for this expl
 
04:38:44.709 --> 04:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
explanation um I don't know if it's
 
04:38:49.269 --> 04:38:49.279 align:start position:0%
something uh that uh you're comfortable
 
04:38:52.949 --> 04:38:52.959 align:start position:0%
uh talking today if it's uh relevant but
 
04:38:57.269 --> 04:38:57.279 align:start position:0%
you mentioned uh uh working closely with
 
04:39:00.470 --> 04:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh Department of Health and Human
 
04:39:04.510 --> 04:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
Services so I wonder if you can describe
 
04:39:04.520 --> 04:39:05.629 align:start position:0%
Services so I wonder if you can describe
us

04:39:05.629 --> 04:39:05.639 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:39:11.789 --> 04:39:11.799 align:start position:0%
uh uh how it works so you more on Mon
 
04:39:14.670 --> 04:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
site and they making some additional
 
04:39:18.869 --> 04:39:18.879 align:start position:0%
policy decisions uh so how that
 
04:39:21.150 --> 04:39:21.160 align:start position:0%
interaction Jen
 
04:39:23.949 --> 04:39:23.959 align:start position:0%
Leo so the interaction at the time you
 
04:39:27.429 --> 04:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
had commissioner shanet uh at at
 
04:39:31.750 --> 04:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
HHS um and her staff were obviously just
 
04:39:34.429 --> 04:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
as engaged as gopher and my other
 
04:39:38.230 --> 04:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
department ba um in uh the public health
 
04:39:41.390 --> 04:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
side as we were on the economic side and
 
04:39:43.990 --> 04:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
so a lot of the decisions again I would
 
04:39:46.230 --> 04:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
say kind of in that early space of car's
 
04:39:50.430 --> 04:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
act um there were a multitude of inputs
 
04:39:52.030 --> 04:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
that were coming on almost every
 
04:39:54.670 --> 04:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
decision um there was there's an
 
04:39:58.150 --> 04:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
economic component there's a um human
 
04:40:00.708 --> 04:40:00.718 align:start position:0%
rights component there's a healthc care
 
04:40:04.070 --> 04:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
component um that were being made
 
04:40:05.910 --> 04:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
certainly above my head you know in
 
04:40:08.590 --> 04:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
terms of the final decisions but it was
 
04:40:13.350 --> 04:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
a constant um discussion and dialogue
 
04:40:18.070 --> 04:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
between those those uh um major issues
 
04:40:20.470 --> 04:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
in making decisions about whether it's
 
04:40:22.948 --> 04:40:22.958 align:start position:0%
funding or whether it was other things
 
04:40:25.670 --> 04:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
that um HHS would have been more
 
04:40:25.680 --> 04:40:27.910 align:start position:0%
that um HHS would have been more
responsible

04:40:27.910 --> 04:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
04:40:27.920 --> 04:40:30.670 align:start position:0%
responsible
for

04:40:30.670 --> 04:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:40:33.750 --> 04:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
followup thank you for that answer could
 
04:40:37.628 --> 04:40:37.638 align:start position:0%
you clarify when when you say uh about
 
04:40:37.638 --> 04:40:38.628 align:start position:0%
you clarify when when you say uh about
final

04:40:38.628 --> 04:40:38.638 align:start position:0%
final
 
04:40:42.270 --> 04:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
decision uh is it governor who is making
 
04:40:45.670 --> 04:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
final decision is at some Council uh the
 
04:40:47.590 --> 04:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
the governor during car's act again we
 
04:40:48.990 --> 04:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
were under state of emergency at that
 
04:40:50.830 --> 04:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
time so the governor was making almost
 
04:40:55.430 --> 04:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:00.150 --> 04:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
y um so yeah I'm looking at your website
 
04:41:04.230 --> 04:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
um very well documented um the reports
 
04:41:07.230 --> 04:41:07.240 align:start position:0%
are amazing um so I will just let you
 
04:41:08.990 --> 04:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
know that so if anyone wants to see how
 
04:41:10.830 --> 04:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
the money was spent especially under
 
04:41:13.550 --> 04:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
car's they have uh reporting every month
 
04:41:15.230 --> 04:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
through the end of May of
 
04:41:18.190 --> 04:41:18.200 align:start position:0%
2022 you can also on um you can also
 
04:41:20.628 --> 04:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
particularly on the cares act piece um
 
04:41:23.430 --> 04:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
you can see on a is both on a map but
 
04:41:28.510 --> 04:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
also um by program or by um by category
 
04:41:30.310 --> 04:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
um the funds and you can also see who
 
04:41:31.948 --> 04:41:31.958 align:start position:0%
received funds in each one of those
 
04:41:34.230 --> 04:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
categories yeah I did see that you can
 
04:41:37.270 --> 04:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
actually do it by address I believe so
 
04:41:40.750 --> 04:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
um so great job there um I have a couple
 
04:41:44.230 --> 04:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
questions um on the Main Street grant
 
04:41:47.270 --> 04:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
part um actually I was uh instrumental
 
04:41:50.030 --> 04:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
and for one company applying and the
 
04:41:52.150 --> 04:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
other one filling out the paperwork to
 
04:41:54.788 --> 04:41:54.798 align:start position:0%
make sure that we didn't have to pay it
 
04:42:01.708 --> 04:42:01.718 align:start position:0%
back um and um based on the information
 
04:42:03.550 --> 04:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
you receive back I
 
04:42:06.150 --> 04:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
mean I noticed
 
04:42:08.990 --> 04:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
personally in the business sphere that
 
04:42:11.948 --> 04:42:11.958 align:start position:0%
we got a lot of um
 
04:42:13.708 --> 04:42:13.718 align:start position:0%
people trying to collect unemployment
 
04:42:16.590 --> 04:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
that never actually worked for a company
 
04:42:18.750 --> 04:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm a small we're a small company
 
04:42:21.110 --> 04:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
of less than 30 I was getting five to
 
04:42:23.628 --> 04:42:23.638 align:start position:0%
six uh requests per week of people that
 
04:42:26.310 --> 04:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
never work for the company um took a lot
 
04:42:31.150 --> 04:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
of time um you know to reply back and
 
04:42:32.910 --> 04:42:32.920 align:start position:0%
make sure we get everything reported
 
04:42:36.590 --> 04:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
back um so knowing
 
04:42:41.190 --> 04:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
that um based on what I was seeing just
 
04:42:43.990 --> 04:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
on a small scale
 
04:42:46.470 --> 04:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
um with some of these
 
04:42:49.510 --> 04:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
programs um you know certain people were
 
04:42:50.990 --> 04:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
following the rules and trying to do it
 
04:42:53.788 --> 04:42:53.798 align:start position:0%
right did you see
 
04:42:58.310 --> 04:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
fraud um in once the reporting was back
 
04:43:00.070 --> 04:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
I know that you had to apply and you had
 
04:43:03.430 --> 04:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
to fill out certain criteria to request
 
04:43:06.628 --> 04:43:06.638 align:start position:0%
it but really the proof was in the
 
04:43:08.350 --> 04:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
pudding when you had to send your
 
04:43:10.390 --> 04:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
reports back to make sure that you
 
04:43:11.750 --> 04:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
because that's when you really get to
 
04:43:14.948 --> 04:43:14.958 align:start position:0%
see the final numbers I mean that's how
 
04:43:17.670 --> 04:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
I would look at it but I could be wrong
 
04:43:21.270 --> 04:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
um and I'm just wondering um if there
 
04:43:26.350 --> 04:43:26.360 align:start position:0%
was any fraud or not so
 
04:43:29.750 --> 04:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe people that I I don't
 
04:43:32.590 --> 04:43:32.600 align:start position:0%
want to say fraud but didn't act in good
 
04:43:35.110 --> 04:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
faith or whatever um would you put a
 
04:43:38.430 --> 04:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
percentage on that at all um I think
 
04:43:40.110 --> 04:43:40.120 align:start position:0%
that would be difficult but let me just
 
04:43:43.310 --> 04:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
explain so first of all you mentioned
 
04:43:45.868 --> 04:43:45.878 align:start position:0%
the unemployment program if you haven't
 
04:43:47.708 --> 04:43:47.718 align:start position:0%
had a chance to talk with the New
 
04:43:49.830 --> 04:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employment security about that
 
04:43:52.190 --> 04:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
subject they would be good to talk to
 
04:43:53.470 --> 04:43:53.480 align:start position:0%
because they were the ones that were
 
04:43:55.350 --> 04:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
administering the extra unemployment
 
04:43:57.390 --> 04:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
insurance F uh unemployment insurance
 
04:43:59.990 --> 04:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
that we received as a state and trying
 
04:44:04.150 --> 04:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
to navigate that process I I will say
 
04:44:05.788 --> 04:44:05.798 align:start position:0%
from my standpoint there were certainly
 
04:44:07.670 --> 04:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of people that needed those funds
 
04:44:09.430 --> 04:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
and there were certainly a lot of people
 
04:44:10.628 --> 04:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
who I think wouldn't have made it
 
04:44:11.708 --> 04:44:11.718 align:start position:0%
without it
 
04:44:13.350 --> 04:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
uh but to your point I think there might
 
04:44:15.190 --> 04:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
have been some others that probably had
 
04:44:18.510 --> 04:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
other um things in mind so that's you
 
04:44:21.590 --> 04:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
know welcome to humanity but I think uh
 
04:44:23.948 --> 04:44:23.958 align:start position:0%
as far as our programs go under Main
 
04:44:26.390 --> 04:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
Street relief uh certainly there have
 
04:44:28.830 --> 04:44:28.840 align:start position:0%
been I think some cases where we've had
 
04:44:32.190 --> 04:44:32.200 align:start position:0%
inquiries um from law enforcement U some
 
04:44:35.190 --> 04:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
of them are following up on um the PPP
 
04:44:37.350 --> 04:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
program which you probably also recall
 
04:44:41.030 --> 04:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
that was the Federal program um uh that
 
04:44:43.150 --> 04:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
was run by the SBA and I know there were
 
04:44:45.910 --> 04:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
some issues with that um that we did
 
04:44:49.070 --> 04:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
have some uh some recipients under Main
 
04:44:51.788 --> 04:44:51.798 align:start position:0%
Street that applied to both programs and
 
04:44:53.990 --> 04:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
if they were being looked at by the feds
 
04:44:56.628 --> 04:44:56.638 align:start position:0%
under the PPP program we would probably
 
04:44:58.430 --> 04:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
get a similar inquiry to see if they
 
04:45:01.270 --> 04:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
were had funds under Main Street but I
 
04:45:03.190 --> 04:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
would say overall and I don't have a
 
04:45:05.270 --> 04:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
percentage for you but overall the the
 
04:45:06.830 --> 04:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
amount of New Hampshire companies that
 
04:45:08.230 --> 04:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
were trying to commit fraud under that
 
04:45:12.150 --> 04:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
program was really small um and and I I
 
04:45:14.868 --> 04:45:14.878 align:start position:0%
guess I would add to that by saying that
 
04:45:17.990 --> 04:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
the program itself what we did as you
 
04:45:20.070 --> 04:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
will probably recall was we asked
 
04:45:22.390 --> 04:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
businesses to try to anticipate what
 
04:45:24.830 --> 04:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
their losses would be and we gave them a
 
04:45:26.788 --> 04:45:26.798 align:start position:0%
percentage of their anticipated losses
 
04:45:29.430 --> 04:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
for the year as a grant uh with the
 
04:45:31.310 --> 04:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
understanding that if it was off by much
 
04:45:33.350 --> 04:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
we were going to have to try to get some
 
04:45:34.948 --> 04:45:34.958 align:start position:0%
of that money back because you didn't do
 
04:45:36.910 --> 04:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
as poorly as you thought you did there
 
04:45:39.750 --> 04:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
weren't I mean there were instances
 
04:45:42.868 --> 04:45:42.878 align:start position:0%
where we had to uh undertake that but
 
04:45:45.230 --> 04:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
with the exception of you know I don't
 
04:45:47.430 --> 04:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
maybe a little more than a handful all
 
04:45:49.510 --> 04:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
of those business said yep that was the
 
04:45:52.390 --> 04:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
deal we we'll we'll pay you back and and
 
04:45:55.430 --> 04:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
that worked and there was no I mean
 
04:45:57.070 --> 04:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion about what the
 
04:45:58.628 --> 04:45:58.638 align:start position:0%
amounts were and how that all worked but
 
04:46:02.150 --> 04:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
it was pretty straightforward and again
 
04:46:05.750 --> 04:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
um I would say that I was very
 
04:46:08.990 --> 04:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
pleasantly surprised to see that at
 
04:46:11.430 --> 04:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
least what we saw at that time was very
 
04:46:14.110 --> 04:46:14.120 align:start position:0%
little abuse of of the program by New
 
04:46:14.120 --> 04:46:15.190 align:start position:0%
little abuse of of the program by New
Hampshire

04:46:15.190 --> 04:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:46:18.628 --> 04:46:18.638 align:start position:0%
employers that is really good news um
 
04:46:20.868 --> 04:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
because I know out there in the
 
04:46:23.390 --> 04:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
stratosphere you know we see it even now
 
04:46:26.270 --> 04:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
on an uh dayto day that there are
 
04:46:28.788 --> 04:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
nefarious characters trying to work
 
04:46:30.910 --> 04:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
their way and swindle people all the
 
04:46:33.030 --> 04:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
time so if I might just also make just
 
04:46:34.470 --> 04:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
take a moment since we're Friday
 
04:46:36.910 --> 04:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon anyway one other experience
 
04:46:39.750 --> 04:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
that occurred during that time that I
 
04:46:41.990 --> 04:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
like telling people is is that when we
 
04:46:45.470 --> 04:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
first went into the covid um experience
 
04:46:47.750 --> 04:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
again in April May of
 
04:46:52.708 --> 04:46:52.718 align:start position:0%
2020 um we were in a at a level of some
 
04:46:54.750 --> 04:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
desperation because I mean we remember
 
04:46:57.150 --> 04:46:57.160 align:start position:0%
we were trying to get um medical
 
04:46:59.230 --> 04:46:59.240 align:start position:0%
equipment PPE equipment we were trying
 
04:47:04.750 --> 04:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
to figure out like what this was and uh
 
04:47:07.150 --> 04:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
understand as best we could but also try
 
04:47:10.310 --> 04:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
to you know uh lead from a from a state
 
04:47:10.320 --> 04:47:12.150 align:start position:0%
to you know uh lead from a from a state
standpoint

04:47:12.150 --> 04:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
04:47:15.590 --> 04:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that we did uh
 
04:47:17.628 --> 04:47:17.638 align:start position:0%
again this was over in in my other job
 
04:47:19.670 --> 04:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
at the business and economic Affairs
 
04:47:21.948 --> 04:47:21.958 align:start position:0%
Department was we reached out to
 
04:47:24.910 --> 04:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturers around the state and said
 
04:47:27.990 --> 04:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
we need these things we need you know
 
04:47:30.110 --> 04:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
medical equipment we need you know
 
04:47:33.070 --> 04:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
gloves we need you know uh smoks and all
 
04:47:35.548 --> 04:47:35.558 align:start position:0%
these other things and we had quite a
 
04:47:38.070 --> 04:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
number of New Hampshire manufacturers
 
04:47:41.628 --> 04:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
who changed their outputs and uh adapted
 
04:47:44.628 --> 04:47:44.638 align:start position:0%
their equipment to meet that demand and
 
04:47:47.590 --> 04:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
it was uh probably in my seven years in
 
04:47:51.510 --> 04:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
in this position one of the most uh
 
04:47:54.270 --> 04:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
encouraging uh moments of time when we
 
04:47:56.030 --> 04:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
would see these businesses calling and
 
04:47:58.750 --> 04:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
saying what can we do what can we make
 
04:48:01.070 --> 04:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
to make uh make New Hampshire and the
 
04:48:02.708 --> 04:48:02.718 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire safe and that
 
04:48:06.030 --> 04:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
was um something i' like to share when I
 
04:48:08.670 --> 04:48:08.680 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity because it speaks
 
04:48:11.190 --> 04:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire business community
 
04:48:14.470 --> 04:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
and that it is a I think a very unique
 
04:48:17.190 --> 04:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
group of companies mostly small medium
 
04:48:20.270 --> 04:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
siiz who when they see something that
 
04:48:22.030 --> 04:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
they can help with they're willing to do
 
04:48:24.628 --> 04:48:24.638 align:start position:0%
it and that was um something I'm very
 
04:48:27.510 --> 04:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
proud of I remember that and thank you
 
04:48:29.948 --> 04:48:29.958 align:start position:0%
for sharing and reminding us of that um
 
04:48:32.788 --> 04:48:32.798 align:start position:0%
that was a really big deal at the time
 
04:48:35.310 --> 04:48:35.320 align:start position:0%
and it was
 
04:48:37.390 --> 04:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
amazing representative
 
04:48:39.990 --> 04:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
eel I have to say at some level this
 
04:48:41.628 --> 04:48:41.638 align:start position:0%
whole thing is giving a little bit of
 
04:48:45.030 --> 04:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
PTSD oh me too representative I mean
 
04:48:47.628 --> 04:48:47.638 align:start position:0%
just I'm slowly remembering things and
 
04:48:50.030 --> 04:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
well talking about the those those phone
 
04:48:52.070 --> 04:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
calls for go I can still hear the
 
04:48:57.070 --> 04:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
clicking in my ears or they um well okay
 
04:48:59.628 --> 04:48:59.638 align:start position:0%
I have a I have a couple questions one
 
04:49:03.548 --> 04:49:03.558 align:start position:0%
mostly simple but this one so I mean
 
04:49:06.628 --> 04:49:06.638 align:start position:0%
part of part of what we're working on is
 
04:49:08.628 --> 04:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
again trying to understand how the
 
04:49:11.750 --> 04:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
response flowed and I think you've
 
04:49:16.350 --> 04:49:16.360 align:start position:0%
spoken really uh clearly about like how
 
04:49:18.708 --> 04:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
manufacturers stepped up how everybody
 
04:49:21.270 --> 04:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
was stepping up and I think there's a
 
04:49:23.470 --> 04:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
lot of concern about rushing for
 
04:49:26.230 --> 04:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
instance vaccines to Market or or you
 
04:49:29.670 --> 04:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
know to the people
 
04:49:33.270 --> 04:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
but I think your experience you can if
 
04:49:35.708 --> 04:49:35.718 align:start position:0%
you want to expand on it to just talk a
 
04:49:37.868 --> 04:49:37.878 align:start position:0%
little bit more about how it was almost
 
04:49:40.868 --> 04:49:40.878 align:start position:0%
like a panic for all of us to get our
 
04:49:45.230 --> 04:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
Public Health uh systems up to speed our
 
04:49:50.788 --> 04:49:50.798 align:start position:0%
businesses up to speed um and you
 
04:49:54.910 --> 04:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
know if there was a fault uh it was
 
04:49:57.990 --> 04:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
maybe uh you know I think a lot of
 
04:49:59.470 --> 04:49:59.480 align:start position:0%
people might feel like it was an
 
04:50:01.310 --> 04:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
overreaction or some people feel like it
 
04:50:02.190 --> 04:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
was an
 
04:50:05.510 --> 04:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
overreaction but if you could talk a
 
04:50:07.830 --> 04:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
little bit about the atmosphere you felt
 
04:50:10.390 --> 04:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
at the state level to try to respond to
 
04:50:13.470 --> 04:50:13.480 align:start position:0%
the needs of the state if you get what
 
04:50:16.350 --> 04:50:16.360 align:start position:0%
I'm getting yes right and here comes the
 
04:50:19.868 --> 04:50:19.878 align:start position:0%
PTSD again so no it was no and I don't
 
04:50:22.190 --> 04:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
mean that and to be light about it
 
04:50:25.150 --> 04:50:25.160 align:start position:0%
because it was very serious and very
 
04:50:29.270 --> 04:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
um very difficult time I we
 
04:50:32.708 --> 04:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
um we were physically located often at
 
04:50:34.670 --> 04:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
the emergency Operation Center uh here
 
04:50:39.230 --> 04:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
in conquer um we um were I would say in
 
04:50:40.788 --> 04:50:40.798 align:start position:0%
the very early days there was a lot lot
 
04:50:42.270 --> 04:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
of discussion a lot of states were
 
04:50:44.070 --> 04:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
coming up with these essential business
 
04:50:45.390 --> 04:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
lists and things they were going to
 
04:50:47.310 --> 04:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
allow to be open or not open and this
 
04:50:51.750 --> 04:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
sort of thing um we didn't really uh we
 
04:50:53.470 --> 04:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
we had a lot of discussion about that
 
04:50:55.628 --> 04:50:55.638 align:start position:0%
and and in the end I think that there
 
04:50:58.590 --> 04:50:58.600 align:start position:0%
were some businesses that we felt
 
04:51:00.030 --> 04:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
because we didn't know we were dealing
 
04:51:01.350 --> 04:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
with we were going to have to
 
04:51:02.910 --> 04:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately put them in a position to
 
04:51:04.230 --> 04:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
not be able to operate for a little
 
04:51:07.190 --> 04:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
while and that was mostly restaurants uh
 
04:51:10.030 --> 04:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
places uh where people had exposure to
 
04:51:11.270 --> 04:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
each other
 
04:51:14.590 --> 04:51:14.600 align:start position:0%
um uh and um I
 
04:51:17.310 --> 04:51:17.320 align:start position:0%
think I have to say I'm not really that
 
04:51:19.750 --> 04:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
familiar with how other states did it I
 
04:51:23.070 --> 04:51:23.080 align:start position:0%
know some states around us um did it a
 
04:51:26.750 --> 04:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
little differently than we did um we
 
04:51:31.230 --> 04:51:31.240 align:start position:0%
made it a priority to lean toward
 
04:51:34.270 --> 04:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
getting everybody back to an open
 
04:51:36.750 --> 04:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
environment as quickly as we could
 
04:51:39.270 --> 04:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
without endangering Public Health again
 
04:51:41.788 --> 04:51:41.798 align:start position:0%
as we knew it at the time so uh the
 
04:51:44.190 --> 04:51:44.200 align:start position:0%
reopening task force really was a great
 
04:51:46.230 --> 04:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
tool for that because we were able to
 
04:51:49.628 --> 04:51:49.638 align:start position:0%
have um public forums with business
 
04:51:52.708 --> 04:51:52.718 align:start position:0%
owners or others Advocates interested
 
04:51:55.708 --> 04:51:55.718 align:start position:0%
parties there were public meetings where
 
04:51:58.830 --> 04:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
um you had a group of individuals from
 
04:52:01.270 --> 04:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature you know from myself
 
04:52:03.868 --> 04:52:03.878 align:start position:0%
included representatives of various
 
04:52:07.190 --> 04:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
Industries um listen to and health and
 
04:52:09.390 --> 04:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
human services and others from the from
 
04:52:12.110 --> 04:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
state government listen to the concerns
 
04:52:14.830 --> 04:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
of uh citizens and business owners and
 
04:52:18.788 --> 04:52:18.798 align:start position:0%
others about you know should we what's
 
04:52:19.788 --> 04:52:19.798 align:start position:0%
the what's going to be the deal with
 
04:52:21.868 --> 04:52:21.878 align:start position:0%
movie theaters what's going to be the
 
04:52:24.990 --> 04:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
story with u uh healthc care facilities
 
04:52:26.708 --> 04:52:26.718 align:start position:0%
or bowling alleys I remember we had we
 
04:52:27.990 --> 04:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
had like a whole two-hour meeting on
 
04:52:31.830 --> 04:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
bowling alley so there was uh a constant
 
04:52:35.150 --> 04:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
stream of input coming and those were
 
04:52:37.868 --> 04:52:37.878 align:start position:0%
helpful because you had businesses said
 
04:52:40.510 --> 04:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I get that this is the issue
 
04:52:42.990 --> 04:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
but we can do these things so rather
 
04:52:45.270 --> 04:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
than you just say you close us we can
 
04:52:47.390 --> 04:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
separate people we can have spaces
 
04:52:49.948 --> 04:52:49.958 align:start position:0%
between them we can have certain types
 
04:52:53.470 --> 04:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
of cleansing protocols put in place and
 
04:52:57.070 --> 04:52:57.080 align:start position:0%
that in some instances gave enough
 
04:52:59.350 --> 04:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
confidence and I think over time gave
 
04:53:02.510 --> 04:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
more confidence to our Public Health
 
04:53:05.350 --> 04:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
teams to be willing to talk about you
 
04:53:07.830 --> 04:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
know how can we manage them remaining
 
04:53:11.110 --> 04:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
open and employing people without
 
04:53:13.548 --> 04:53:13.558 align:start position:0%
endangering safety so there was a that
 
04:53:19.750 --> 04:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:22.590 --> 04:53:22.600 align:start position:0%
um did I answer that question I mean
 
04:53:24.990 --> 04:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I I
 
04:53:28.110 --> 04:53:28.120 align:start position:0%
guess it's hard now to look back and
 
04:53:31.548 --> 04:53:31.558 align:start position:0%
fully appreciate what was going on at
 
04:53:33.990 --> 04:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
that time
 
04:53:38.948 --> 04:53:38.958 align:start position:0%
but would you be willing to say
 
04:53:41.590 --> 04:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
that at the government level at which
 
04:53:44.990 --> 04:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
you were operating everybody was trying
 
04:53:48.070 --> 04:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
to do their level best to do the best
 
04:53:52.310 --> 04:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
for the state and that perhaps mistakes
 
04:53:55.390 --> 04:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
were made which is why we're here now
 
04:53:58.948 --> 04:53:58.958 align:start position:0%
but everyone really was knocking
 
04:54:01.350 --> 04:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
themselves out in good faith to do the
 
04:54:03.310 --> 04:54:03.320 align:start position:0%
best they could no question about it
 
04:54:04.830 --> 04:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely no question about it I mean
 
04:54:08.868 --> 04:54:08.878 align:start position:0%
the team that we that I was working with
 
04:54:12.750 --> 04:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
um took a a lot of personal toll I think
 
04:54:14.430 --> 04:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
you know dealing with these types of
 
04:54:15.910 --> 04:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
issues and taking them with the degree
 
04:54:18.750 --> 04:54:18.760 align:start position:0%
of seriousness that that they deserved
 
04:54:21.350 --> 04:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
um there is almost always going to be an
 
04:54:23.548 --> 04:54:23.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity you know years later to look
 
04:54:26.390 --> 04:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
at how that all turned out and and and
 
04:54:29.350 --> 04:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
make some constructive criticism as to
 
04:54:30.948 --> 04:54:30.958 align:start position:0%
how we could probably have done that
 
04:54:33.910 --> 04:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
better here and there but the the pace
 
04:54:36.310 --> 04:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
of the decisions that were being made
 
04:54:37.670 --> 04:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
the environment that they were being
 
04:54:42.708 --> 04:54:42.718 align:start position:0%
made within um the swirling public
 
04:54:45.670 --> 04:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
health concerns and I mean frankly
 
04:54:47.230 --> 04:54:47.240 align:start position:0%
Terror I mean we didn't know what we
 
04:54:48.990 --> 04:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
were dealing with and what we were you
 
04:54:51.430 --> 04:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
know what what this was going to evolve
 
04:54:54.548 --> 04:54:54.558 align:start position:0%
into um I would say that one of the
 
04:54:58.190 --> 04:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
things that I felt that we
 
04:55:01.708 --> 04:55:01.718 align:start position:0%
really harped on was that once we all
 
04:55:04.350 --> 04:55:04.360 align:start position:0%
agreed and the governor made a decision
 
04:55:07.070 --> 04:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
we stuck to that decision and there
 
04:55:11.350 --> 04:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't there wasn't a lot of um oh you
 
04:55:13.030 --> 04:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
know let's change this or let's change
 
04:55:16.150 --> 04:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
that and I and I think that volatility
 
04:55:19.510 --> 04:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
in that type of environment is not good
 
04:55:21.830 --> 04:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
and so keeping to a decision and sort of
 
04:55:26.390 --> 04:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
pushing through um was a little bit of a
 
04:55:28.230 --> 04:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
Hallmark I guess in our decision-making
 
04:55:29.868 --> 04:55:29.878 align:start position:0%
process and maybe something for people
 
04:55:32.070 --> 04:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
to think about and review and decide
 
04:55:34.270 --> 04:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not that was you know the
 
04:55:35.708 --> 04:55:35.718 align:start position:0%
best decision at the time I do believe
 
04:55:38.310 --> 04:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
that it was and as from my standpoint um
 
04:55:39.910 --> 04:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
from where we stand right now I I do
 
04:55:42.750 --> 04:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:46.030 --> 04:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
was there was a scramble I have compared
 
04:55:48.830 --> 04:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
to that question I have some one that's
 
04:55:52.070 --> 04:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
really easy do you have any idea how it
 
04:55:54.350 --> 04:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
was determined how much money any
 
04:55:57.230 --> 04:55:57.240 align:start position:0%
particular State got do you know how
 
04:56:00.548 --> 04:56:00.558 align:start position:0%
that math worked probably population I
 
04:56:03.670 --> 04:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
as I recall was per capita yeah so I'm
 
04:56:05.910 --> 04:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
pretty sure that under cares act and
 
04:56:09.390 --> 04:56:09.400 align:start position:0%
sfrf we got the minimum amount uh of
 
04:56:11.708 --> 04:56:11.718 align:start position:0%
State based on our size kind of what I
 
04:56:13.910 --> 04:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
thought right yeah and what was the
 
04:56:17.110 --> 04:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
agency disseminating the funds okay go
 
04:56:18.548 --> 04:56:18.558 align:start position:0%
so he just said that I think
 
04:56:20.390 --> 04:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
particularly kak unemployment probably
 
04:56:22.548 --> 04:56:22.558 align:start position:0%
also had something to do with it as well
 
04:56:24.990 --> 04:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
but I do believe we received the minimum
 
04:56:27.990 --> 04:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
amount in both of those programs and
 
04:56:30.310 --> 04:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
were what were which agencies at the
 
04:56:32.030 --> 04:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
federal level were disseminating the
 
04:56:35.628 --> 04:56:35.638 align:start position:0%
money so uh it was Treasury Department
 
04:56:36.948 --> 04:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
in both
 
04:56:41.190 --> 04:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
cases thank you very much you're welcome
 
04:56:41.200 --> 04:56:43.110 align:start position:0%
cases thank you very much you're welcome
representative

04:56:43.110 --> 04:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:56:47.270 --> 04:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
leus yes this discussion is reminding me
 
04:56:49.868 --> 04:56:49.878 align:start position:0%
of all the business owners that I spoke
 
04:56:55.150 --> 04:56:55.160 align:start position:0%
to at the time and what a diverse set of
 
04:56:58.350 --> 04:56:58.360 align:start position:0%
experiences they had there were ones who
 
04:57:00.628 --> 04:57:00.638 align:start position:0%
were so appreciative of the money that
 
04:57:04.070 --> 04:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
helped them keep afloat there were
 
04:57:07.788 --> 04:57:07.798 align:start position:0%
others who um were
 
04:57:12.750 --> 04:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
having such trouble getting all of the
 
04:57:16.590 --> 04:57:16.600 align:start position:0%
applications Etc that they went bankrupt
 
04:57:20.628 --> 04:57:20.638 align:start position:0%
before they actually got money and I was
 
04:57:22.510 --> 04:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you would comment on
 
04:57:24.470 --> 04:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
that because I remember it was very
 
04:57:27.070 --> 04:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
varied okay that's a very good question
 
04:57:30.548 --> 04:57:30.558 align:start position:0%
and and and and as you're saying that um
 
04:57:32.030 --> 04:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
and thinking about some of the questions
 
04:57:34.070 --> 04:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
that you've had previously an area we
 
04:57:36.150 --> 04:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
could do better
 
04:57:38.750 --> 04:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
right getting to all the
 
04:57:42.510 --> 04:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
businesses is definitely won because we
 
04:57:46.590 --> 04:57:46.600 align:start position:0%
leaned very heavily on uh trade groups
 
04:57:48.350 --> 04:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
business you know like the the for the
 
04:57:49.990 --> 04:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
restaurants we worked very closely with
 
04:57:51.548 --> 04:57:51.558 align:start position:0%
lodging and Restaurant Association for
 
04:57:53.708 --> 04:57:53.718 align:start position:0%
hotels um we were very closely with the
 
04:57:55.470 --> 04:57:55.480 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association or
 
04:57:57.868 --> 04:57:57.878 align:start position:0%
others the retail Federation others try
 
04:58:00.070 --> 04:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
to get the word out there were
 
04:58:01.750 --> 04:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
definitely businesses that were not
 
04:58:03.990 --> 04:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
members of those organizations and maybe
 
04:58:05.830 --> 04:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
didn't have time to read the newspaper
 
04:58:06.910 --> 04:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
or watch
 
04:58:09.708 --> 04:58:09.718 align:start position:0%
WMUR live 24-hour coverage of the
 
04:58:09.718 --> 04:58:10.868 align:start position:0%
WMUR live 24-hour coverage of the
pandemic

04:58:10.868 --> 04:58:10.878 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
04:58:16.230 --> 04:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
um the uh getting in those types of inst
 
04:58:19.510 --> 04:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
instances to a much broader set of
 
04:58:21.470 --> 04:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
businesses and
 
04:58:25.628 --> 04:58:25.638 align:start position:0%
potential uh recipients of relief is
 
04:58:28.070 --> 04:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
something that we could have done better
 
04:58:32.230 --> 04:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
on I and I think again those are
 
04:58:34.470 --> 04:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
probably whether you want to have lists
 
04:58:37.990 --> 04:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
or or that just we didn't have access to
 
04:58:40.190 --> 04:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
at the at the pace we probably could
 
04:58:43.948 --> 04:58:43.958 align:start position:0%
assembled them over time but um we were
 
04:58:45.430 --> 04:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
not in a position to be able to reach
 
04:58:47.110 --> 04:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
every single business the the Main
 
04:58:48.948 --> 04:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
Street Relief Fund probably was better
 
04:58:50.750 --> 04:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
than most because we used
 
04:58:55.670 --> 04:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
Dr um uh addresses for most of that um
 
04:58:57.750 --> 04:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
and so we we were getting taxpaying
 
04:59:02.590 --> 04:59:02.600 align:start position:0%
businesses um alerted but um yeah
 
04:59:02.600 --> 04:59:04.190 align:start position:0%
businesses um alerted but um yeah
widescale

04:59:04.190 --> 04:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
widescale
 
04:59:07.750 --> 04:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
notification of available benefits to a
 
04:59:11.470 --> 04:59:11.480 align:start position:0%
broad set of business owners and frankly
 
04:59:13.948 --> 04:59:13.958 align:start position:0%
recipients is probably an area that we
 
04:59:16.628 --> 04:59:16.638 align:start position:0%
could build a little bit more uh
 
04:59:19.430 --> 04:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
resilient uh infrastructure around for
 
04:59:23.750 --> 04:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:26.470 --> 04:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
you on that would you say for
 
04:59:29.548 --> 04:59:29.558 align:start position:0%
municipalities too I mean I wonder how
 
04:59:32.350 --> 04:59:32.360 align:start position:0%
Municipal what was the sort of interface
 
04:59:36.310 --> 04:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
with municipalities during this
 
04:59:39.788 --> 04:59:39.798 align:start position:0%
time I I I mean a lot of municipalities
 
04:59:41.548 --> 04:59:41.558 align:start position:0%
were put in a tough spot I mean because
 
04:59:44.270 --> 04:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
they were here was a huge chunk of money
 
04:59:47.430 --> 04:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
um that uh they were being asked to
 
04:59:50.788 --> 04:59:50.798 align:start position:0%
deploy but they had no capacity to
 
04:59:54.030 --> 04:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
really even um consider how they might
 
04:59:57.590 --> 04:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
do something like that we at the again
 
05:00:00.190 --> 05:00:00.200 align:start position:0%
back in KAC time we brought on a
 
05:00:02.548 --> 05:00:02.558 align:start position:0%
consultant uh to work with gopher but we
 
05:00:05.030 --> 05:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
also hired that consultant to provide
 
05:00:07.350 --> 05:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
direct technical assistance to
 
05:00:10.350 --> 05:00:10.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities um and that definitely
 
05:00:11.788 --> 05:00:11.798 align:start position:0%
helped quite a
 
05:00:15.230 --> 05:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
bit um in particular because when we got
 
05:00:17.310 --> 05:00:17.320 align:start position:0%
by the time we got to
 
05:00:21.628 --> 05:00:21.638 align:start position:0%
arpa um the state received that 994
 
05:00:25.510 --> 05:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
million in sfrf funds every almost every
 
05:00:28.510 --> 05:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
municipality in the state also received
 
05:00:31.030 --> 05:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
funding directly from Treasury under the
 
05:00:33.270 --> 05:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
sfrf fund so separate from the state's
 
05:00:36.868 --> 05:00:36.878 align:start position:0%
allocation do you know how much that
 
05:00:41.910 --> 05:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
was yeah I um I I can get that for you a
 
05:00:42.948 --> 05:00:42.958 align:start position:0%
couple of months ago that would have
 
05:00:44.310 --> 05:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
been the top of my head but I've
 
05:00:46.628 --> 05:00:46.638 align:start position:0%
forgotten it by now but um it was a
 
05:00:49.590 --> 05:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
pretty good amount and uh all
 
05:00:52.270 --> 05:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities I think except one or
 
05:00:55.830 --> 05:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
two uh accepted those funds and then all
 
05:00:58.670 --> 05:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
10 counties also got sfrf
 
05:01:01.470 --> 05:01:01.480 align:start position:0%
funds right because every County I'm
 
05:01:04.190 --> 05:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
sure you got Opera funds in your account
 
05:01:07.150 --> 05:01:07.160 align:start position:0%
but yeah yeah that's not included in the
 
05:01:10.150 --> 05:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
994 that would be an interesting number
 
05:01:12.390 --> 05:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
to yeah I would I would urge you to take
 
05:01:14.430 --> 05:01:14.440 align:start position:0%
a look at that and how municipalities
 
05:01:16.470 --> 05:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
managed there again I think we did what
 
05:01:19.030 --> 05:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
we could to try to uh support the
 
05:01:21.910 --> 05:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities um I will say that maybe
 
05:01:23.628 --> 05:01:23.638 align:start position:0%
I might venture
 
05:01:29.230 --> 05:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:32.628 --> 05:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
that looks like number 112 million that
 
05:01:34.708 --> 05:01:34.718 align:start position:0%
went to the uh is that for the
 
05:01:38.110 --> 05:01:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:41.030 --> 05:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
county okay so that was counties and
 
05:01:44.110 --> 05:01:44.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities had access to $112
 
05:01:46.868 --> 05:01:46.878 align:start position:0%
million separate from the 994 that the
 
05:01:49.310 --> 05:01:49.320 align:start position:0%
state got was that a
 
05:01:51.628 --> 05:01:51.638 align:start position:0%
direct well as I recall what they had to
 
05:01:53.830 --> 05:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
do is they had to tell us they wanted it
 
05:01:56.830 --> 05:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
and then and then then this the money
 
05:01:58.350 --> 05:01:58.360 align:start position:0%
went directly from the federal
 
05:02:00.670 --> 05:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
government so they're doing a lot you
 
05:02:01.868 --> 05:02:01.878 align:start position:0%
all the things we've talked about end
 
05:02:03.548 --> 05:02:03.558 align:start position:0%
expenditure categories and they're doing
 
05:02:06.628 --> 05:02:06.638 align:start position:0%
the same thing uh yeah cuz in our County
 
05:02:09.670 --> 05:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
we had a list of what we wanted to spend
 
05:02:12.110 --> 05:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
our prop ER funds on so but what I was
 
05:02:14.470 --> 05:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
going to say is that I I do I I I
 
05:02:16.628 --> 05:02:16.638 align:start position:0%
suspect just because you know my
 
05:02:18.230 --> 05:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
department works very closely with
 
05:02:20.788 --> 05:02:20.798 align:start position:0%
municipal government on a lot of fronts
 
05:02:24.030 --> 05:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
is as much of a as as as painful as that
 
05:02:26.190 --> 05:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
experience has been in some cases for
 
05:02:27.430 --> 05:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
for for
 
05:02:31.390 --> 05:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities it has um raised issues
 
05:02:34.430 --> 05:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
and questions locally that they've dealt
 
05:02:36.670 --> 05:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
with how they would deal with locally
 
05:02:38.470 --> 05:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
you know on their own sort of uh based
 
05:02:40.510 --> 05:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
on their own values Etc
 
05:02:42.548 --> 05:02:42.558 align:start position:0%
but has put them in a good good position
 
05:02:46.670 --> 05:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
to also be willing to maybe think about
 
05:02:49.830 --> 05:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
um how they are operating in a world
 
05:02:52.628 --> 05:02:52.638 align:start position:0%
that is increasingly complex to get
 
05:02:54.110 --> 05:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
whether it's Federal money or other
 
05:02:56.430 --> 05:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
funds um it's put them in a stronger
 
05:02:59.110 --> 05:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
position to to know how to access those
 
05:03:01.150 --> 05:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
and to have maybe some resources to be
 
05:03:02.548 --> 05:03:02.558 align:start position:0%
able to deal with them maybe with a
 
05:03:04.708 --> 05:03:04.718 align:start position:0%
little bit of assistance whereas before
 
05:03:06.590 --> 05:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
covid there were so many communities so
 
05:03:08.390 --> 05:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
that was just not even not even
 
05:03:10.788 --> 05:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
something that could have been
 
05:03:13.628 --> 05:03:13.638 align:start position:0%
done um I'd like to go back to something
 
05:03:15.910 --> 05:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
you had spoken about earlier with the
 
05:03:18.230 --> 05:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
reopening of different businesses and
 
05:03:23.910 --> 05:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
things like that and um obviously you
 
05:03:26.788 --> 05:03:26.798 align:start position:0%
dealt more with the monetary side would
 
05:03:30.590 --> 05:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
you say that the decisions to reopen
 
05:03:35.430 --> 05:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
besides the would come down to HHS
 
05:03:35.440 --> 05:03:37.230 align:start position:0%
besides the would come down to HHS
mostly

05:03:37.230 --> 05:03:37.240 align:start position:0%
mostly
 
05:03:40.788 --> 05:03:40.798 align:start position:0%
um making that ultimate decision
 
05:03:43.310 --> 05:03:43.320 align:start position:0%
I think in most cases um HHS was very
 
05:03:45.750 --> 05:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
much part of the discussion and the and
 
05:03:46.990 --> 05:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
the meetings and the hearings and
 
05:03:48.230 --> 05:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
everything they were full partner and
 
05:03:50.948 --> 05:03:50.958 align:start position:0%
all of that and so but when we got to
 
05:03:53.270 --> 05:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
the point of saying you know these are
 
05:03:54.548 --> 05:03:54.558 align:start position:0%
these are going to be the final
 
05:03:56.548 --> 05:03:56.558 align:start position:0%
recommendations they were very much part
 
05:03:58.230 --> 05:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
of that discussion as they as they
 
05:04:00.948 --> 05:04:00.958 align:start position:0%
needed to be um you know and and so
 
05:04:03.470 --> 05:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
there was a definite Public Health uh
 
05:04:06.390 --> 05:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
consideration to every one of those
 
05:04:09.150 --> 05:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
decisions only because and I my memory
 
05:04:10.750 --> 05:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
could be wrong
 
05:04:14.628 --> 05:04:14.638 align:start position:0%
but yeah I remember this um but I
 
05:04:17.070 --> 05:04:17.080 align:start position:0%
believe you know when we shut down
 
05:04:20.990 --> 05:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
restaurants and bars and everything else
 
05:04:22.470 --> 05:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
we let
 
05:04:26.110 --> 05:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
private clubs open prior to the public
 
05:04:28.910 --> 05:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
restaurants and I'm not I don't know if
 
05:04:30.910 --> 05:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
memory is serving me correctly but it
 
05:04:33.430 --> 05:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
seemed that way um and I was just
 
05:04:35.788 --> 05:04:35.798 align:start position:0%
wondering how that you know it's kind of
 
05:04:38.030 --> 05:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
like uh restaurants got open but Church
 
05:04:40.350 --> 05:04:40.360 align:start position:0%
you you know there was there's a lot of
 
05:04:42.070 --> 05:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
yeah you know I'm I'm sure there was a
 
05:04:45.150 --> 05:04:45.160 align:start position:0%
lot must have been crazy on on how to
 
05:04:48.150 --> 05:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
make those decisions yeah um yeah and I
 
05:04:50.110 --> 05:04:50.120 align:start position:0%
don't remember that distinction uh but
 
05:04:52.430 --> 05:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
it might have been
 
05:04:55.670 --> 05:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
um but yeah those look I'm the
 
05:04:56.788 --> 05:04:56.798 align:start position:0%
commissioner of business and economic
 
05:04:58.270 --> 05:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
Affairs the last thing I wanted to do is
 
05:05:00.430 --> 05:05:00.440 align:start position:0%
close the business it's like I didn't
 
05:05:04.030 --> 05:05:04.040 align:start position:0%
sign up for that so um so it was it was
 
05:05:08.430 --> 05:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:10.590 --> 05:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
make and
 
05:05:15.030 --> 05:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
did you how do I how do I put this um
 
05:05:18.190 --> 05:05:18.200 align:start position:0%
with the roll out of the unemployment
 
05:05:20.470 --> 05:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
funds and people getting to collect
 
05:05:22.030 --> 05:05:22.040 align:start position:0%
those excess
 
05:05:23.990 --> 05:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
dollars from
 
05:05:28.390 --> 05:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
unemployment when they could go back to
 
05:05:32.510 --> 05:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
work um from an employee standpoint we
 
05:05:35.948 --> 05:05:35.958 align:start position:0%
found that some would rather that it
 
05:05:38.150 --> 05:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
actually hurt
 
05:05:41.150 --> 05:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
businesses and
 
05:05:43.030 --> 05:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
had a negative
 
05:05:47.230 --> 05:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:47.240 --> 05:05:50.590 align:start position:0%
 
that

05:05:50.590 --> 05:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:53.390 --> 05:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
um I think that there were probably some
 
05:05:56.070 --> 05:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
instances where you could say that
 
05:05:58.708 --> 05:05:58.718 align:start position:0%
um the the way that some people reacted
 
05:06:02.070 --> 05:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
to that didn't it put us a little bit
 
05:06:04.910 --> 05:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
deeper in the workforce
 
05:06:10.270 --> 05:06:10.280 align:start position:0%
Hole uh and um I'm not sure
 
05:06:11.670 --> 05:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
and I haven't looked at the data enough
 
05:06:14.070 --> 05:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
to be able to say if there's like a
 
05:06:16.670 --> 05:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
correlation between the increased
 
05:06:20.270 --> 05:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
benefits and the workforce but I think
 
05:06:21.910 --> 05:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
that there were there was definitely a
 
05:06:23.548 --> 05:06:23.558 align:start position:0%
lot of real world experience that kind
 
05:06:27.990 --> 05:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:31.910 --> 05:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
case yeah and well personal experience
 
05:06:34.190 --> 05:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
um and I can speak to a couple of
 
05:06:37.628 --> 05:06:37.638 align:start position:0%
different instances where uh somebody I
 
05:06:40.030 --> 05:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
knew worked as a
 
05:06:45.430 --> 05:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
Ender but yet the when it reopened the
 
05:06:48.190 --> 05:06:48.200 align:start position:0%
people that were there said why should I
 
05:06:52.190 --> 05:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
bother um so in some instances in the
 
05:06:55.628 --> 05:06:55.638 align:start position:0%
service industry I think it really hurt
 
05:06:58.230 --> 05:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
no question um and so the service
 
05:07:00.708 --> 05:07:00.718 align:start position:0%
industry and hospitality industry got
 
05:07:03.030 --> 05:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
got banged up worse than anybody I think
 
05:07:05.070 --> 05:07:05.080 align:start position:0%
and and and it and it is a little bit of
 
05:07:07.390 --> 05:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
what maybe you're describing but it's
 
05:07:10.390 --> 05:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
also I think there were and talking with
 
05:07:12.110 --> 05:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of business owners in that space
 
05:07:13.788 --> 05:07:13.798 align:start position:0%
as well there were a lot of people are
 
05:07:15.590 --> 05:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
like you know I'm going to go do
 
05:07:17.990 --> 05:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
something else I'm going to go get you
 
05:07:19.430 --> 05:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
know spend a couple months at the
 
05:07:21.270 --> 05:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
community college on an advanced
 
05:07:23.110 --> 05:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturing program and I'm going to
 
05:07:25.030 --> 05:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
do the second shift to you know mport
 
05:07:28.350 --> 05:07:28.360 align:start position:0%
Sigma or something so uh that definitely
 
05:07:32.510 --> 05:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
occurred there was a uh literal you know
 
05:07:35.948 --> 05:07:35.958 align:start position:0%
earthquake in the labor markets as a
 
05:07:39.670 --> 05:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
result of covid and people re thought
 
05:07:41.430 --> 05:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
being in the workforce people rethought
 
05:07:42.788 --> 05:07:42.798 align:start position:0%
about what they were doing in the
 
05:07:45.510 --> 05:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
workforce the remote work issue really
 
05:07:48.030 --> 05:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
started to come into play so it really
 
05:07:50.830 --> 05:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
fundamentally changed the landscape that
 
05:07:53.910 --> 05:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
we operated under until that point I'm
 
05:07:56.030 --> 05:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
not sure that it's all shaken out even
 
05:08:00.070 --> 05:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
to this point right uh I I will say that
 
05:08:01.430 --> 05:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
I've had a number of meetings and we
 
05:08:03.070 --> 05:08:03.080 align:start position:0%
have a we have a big meeting next week
 
05:08:04.670 --> 05:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
with the tourism
 
05:08:07.590 --> 05:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
industry for the first time since Co I'm
 
05:08:08.990 --> 05:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
getting a little bit of feedback that
 
05:08:11.708 --> 05:08:11.718 align:start position:0%
they're finding the workforce they need
 
05:08:13.868 --> 05:08:13.878 align:start position:0%
in the hospitality space come for this
 
05:08:16.750 --> 05:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
coming summer which is encouraging uh I
 
05:08:18.910 --> 05:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
Pro I can't possibly say that that's
 
05:08:23.190 --> 05:08:23.200 align:start position:0%
100% but it is it is coming back around
 
05:08:25.670 --> 05:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
but how it came back around and how it's
 
05:08:27.670 --> 05:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
different from before still jury is
 
05:08:30.390 --> 05:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:34.230 --> 05:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
that thank you for that and
 
05:08:39.830 --> 05:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:42.670 --> 05:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
difference and you know we had honest
 
05:08:44.470 --> 05:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
people that actually came back to work
 
05:08:48.230 --> 05:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
even though um with those excess federal
 
05:08:51.270 --> 05:08:51.280 align:start position:0%
dollars they probably would have made
 
05:08:55.910 --> 05:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
more staying home but they were bored um
 
05:09:02.110 --> 05:09:02.120 align:start position:0%
so lucky us uh for that um but uh it
 
05:09:05.548 --> 05:09:05.558 align:start position:0%
definitely uh changed uh the landscape
 
05:09:08.948 --> 05:09:08.958 align:start position:0%
uh of the workforce and I I think in
 
05:09:11.510 --> 05:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
some way it did hinder I actually had a
 
05:09:13.750 --> 05:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
gentleman come in and say you need to
 
05:09:15.590 --> 05:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
sign me back up for this and I need to
 
05:09:18.470 --> 05:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
be collecting this and I'm like yeah
 
05:09:23.270 --> 05:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
no I mean almost I mean it was crazy but
 
05:09:26.230 --> 05:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
tough times um so yeah so that's what we
 
05:09:29.430 --> 05:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
got to see uh represent B I'm actually
 
05:09:31.708 --> 05:09:31.718 align:start position:0%
saying that what you did about referring
 
05:09:33.830 --> 05:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
to remote
 
05:09:36.830 --> 05:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
um could you talk a little bit about the
 
05:09:39.948 --> 05:09:39.958 align:start position:0%
uh Broadband lift that New Hampshire got
 
05:09:44.990 --> 05:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
as a result of Co I I it just seems to
 
05:09:47.708 --> 05:09:47.718 align:start position:0%
me that we're way ahead of where we were
 
05:09:50.750 --> 05:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
in that yes so that's a good point too
 
05:09:54.390 --> 05:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh representative so um in addition
 
05:09:57.430 --> 05:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
there uh has been a total I'm it's like
 
05:10:01.150 --> 05:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
$250 million of funding through both
 
05:10:05.270 --> 05:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
car's act and um arpa and now separately
 
05:10:09.670 --> 05:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
from another program called bead um that
 
05:10:11.708 --> 05:10:11.718 align:start position:0%
the state has received that my
 
05:10:14.708 --> 05:10:14.718 align:start position:0%
department not gopher but baa is
 
05:10:19.190 --> 05:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
deploying uh to really get us to 100%
 
05:10:21.830 --> 05:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
access to high-speed internet for people
 
05:10:25.270 --> 05:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
who want it um we are well underway with
 
05:10:28.270 --> 05:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
those programs so we did we have two
 
05:10:32.510 --> 05:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
companies right now that are um putting
 
05:10:35.830 --> 05:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
in fiber all over rural New Hampshire uh
 
05:10:37.708 --> 05:10:37.718 align:start position:0%
this summer and started they started
 
05:10:40.548 --> 05:10:40.558 align:start position:0%
last summer but the time that process is
 
05:10:43.350 --> 05:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
over we do expect to have a minimum of
 
05:10:47.270 --> 05:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
50,000 new addresses with access to um
 
05:10:50.510 --> 05:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
highspeed fiber uh uh highspeed internet
 
05:10:53.270 --> 05:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
so that does a lot of things it
 
05:10:55.110 --> 05:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
obviously helps people that work
 
05:10:57.830 --> 05:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
remotely it also helps families whose
 
05:10:59.948 --> 05:10:59.958 align:start position:0%
kids are assigned work that they have to
 
05:11:02.990 --> 05:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
do on computer it's it helps you know
 
05:11:05.868 --> 05:11:05.878 align:start position:0%
older people who can't get to see their
 
05:11:07.470 --> 05:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
doctor to be able to have a video
 
05:11:09.470 --> 05:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
conference you know all the things we
 
05:11:11.548 --> 05:11:11.558 align:start position:0%
sort of do on a regular basis uh in the
 
05:11:13.190 --> 05:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
business World these days just about a
 
05:11:16.310 --> 05:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
lot more accessible um the other thing
 
05:11:19.310 --> 05:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
that it does is it levels the playing
 
05:11:22.110 --> 05:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
field for a lot of communities where um
 
05:11:24.910 --> 05:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
you've had for years situations um in
 
05:11:26.548 --> 05:11:26.558 align:start position:0%
rural New Hampshire where you have one
 
05:11:29.390 --> 05:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
town that might have um access to fiber
 
05:11:31.150 --> 05:11:31.160 align:start position:0%
and highspeed internet another that next
 
05:11:32.868 --> 05:11:32.878 align:start position:0%
door that does not guess what the
 
05:11:34.430 --> 05:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
property values are like in those two
 
05:11:37.548 --> 05:11:37.558 align:start position:0%
towns right so um leveling that playing
 
05:11:40.948 --> 05:11:40.958 align:start position:0%
field giving uh a new uh important
 
05:11:44.270 --> 05:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
foundation to the Future uh trajectory
 
05:11:46.270 --> 05:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire economy it's pretty
 
05:11:49.788 --> 05:11:49.798 align:start position:0%
exciting stuff so uh I I I have said and
 
05:11:51.270 --> 05:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to say it again that by the
 
05:11:53.150 --> 05:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
time we're done with these resources we
 
05:11:56.430 --> 05:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
will have 100% access uh to people that
 
05:11:58.270 --> 05:11:58.280 align:start position:0%
want in for high-speed internet in New
 
05:12:01.948 --> 05:12:01.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which for individuals uh who
 
05:12:03.670 --> 05:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
have been working on this for the last
 
05:12:06.190 --> 05:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
10 or 15 years and struggling to get
 
05:12:07.910 --> 05:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
peanuts from the federal government to
 
05:12:09.910 --> 05:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
assist with broadband expans
 
05:12:12.110 --> 05:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
this is a truly a once in a-lifetime
 
05:12:14.990 --> 05:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get this taken care of
 
05:12:17.390 --> 05:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
and and do you know what do you have a
 
05:12:20.510 --> 05:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
kind of a completion date in mind so for
 
05:12:22.868 --> 05:12:22.878 align:start position:0%
the two uh for so we have two contracts
 
05:12:24.310 --> 05:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
one with New Hampshire Electric
 
05:12:26.708 --> 05:12:26.718 align:start position:0%
Cooperative and one with Consolidated
 
05:12:29.628 --> 05:12:29.638 align:start position:0%
Communications those two have to be
 
05:12:33.150 --> 05:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
complete by the end of 2026 but both are
 
05:12:34.470 --> 05:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
telling me right now that they will be
 
05:12:35.350 --> 05:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
done in
 
05:12:39.788 --> 05:12:39.798 align:start position:0%
2025 and so again speaking to our
 
05:12:42.628 --> 05:12:42.638 align:start position:0%
experience versus other states we will
 
05:12:44.910 --> 05:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
be the first state in the Northeast
 
05:12:47.270 --> 05:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
maybe even on the east coast to reach
 
05:12:50.670 --> 05:12:50.680 align:start position:0%
that 100% number uh than any other state
 
05:12:52.628 --> 05:12:52.638 align:start position:0%
uh because a lot of other states have
 
05:12:55.548 --> 05:12:55.558 align:start position:0%
been going about this quite differently
 
05:12:58.470 --> 05:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
um not better not worse better in my
 
05:13:00.190 --> 05:13:00.200 align:start position:0%
view but you know that's a debate for
 
05:13:03.190 --> 05:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
some for others to have but um we will
 
05:13:05.708 --> 05:13:05.718 align:start position:0%
be able to offer that to our citizens
 
05:13:07.230 --> 05:13:07.240 align:start position:0%
sooner than anyone
 
05:13:09.708 --> 05:13:09.718 align:start position:0%
else so
 
05:13:11.590 --> 05:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
wow that's amazing so by the end of this
 
05:13:15.670 --> 05:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
year we'll be 100% end of 2025 oh 2025
 
05:13:18.590 --> 05:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
don't skip ahead representative 2024
 
05:13:21.190 --> 05:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
well I'm skipping ahead all this talk
 
05:13:21.200 --> 05:13:22.788 align:start position:0%
well I'm skipping ahead all this talk
about

05:13:22.788 --> 05:13:22.798 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:13:27.788 --> 05:13:27.798 align:start position:0%
Co represent PO is off uh thank you so
 
05:13:31.110 --> 05:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
so you had some questions about uh
 
05:13:35.230 --> 05:13:35.240 align:start position:0%
whether paying L unemployment benefits
 
05:13:40.310 --> 05:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh for incentivizing people from looking
 
05:13:43.390 --> 05:13:43.400 align:start position:0%
uh employment when they could so in
 
05:13:46.750 --> 05:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
similar line of thinking if we were
 
05:13:50.750 --> 05:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
paying businesses for their expected
 
05:13:53.548 --> 05:13:53.558 align:start position:0%
losses and then we were telling them if
 
05:13:56.030 --> 05:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
you will overcome it and be more
 
05:13:59.070 --> 05:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
successful you you have to pay us back
 
05:14:02.070 --> 05:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
so in my view it it
 
05:14:04.788 --> 05:14:04.798 align:start position:0%
also probably incentivized some
 
05:14:08.750 --> 05:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
businesses not to work as hard as as
 
05:14:12.948 --> 05:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
they good so what's your
 
05:14:15.670 --> 05:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
SS I don't know too many businesses that
 
05:14:18.030 --> 05:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
are looking to reduce their profit to
 
05:14:21.830 --> 05:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
avoid having to pay back a grant um but
 
05:14:24.070 --> 05:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
um I suppose that might might have been
 
05:14:26.628 --> 05:14:26.638 align:start position:0%
the case here or there but you know most
 
05:14:29.070 --> 05:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
businesses and there were some that that
 
05:14:31.990 --> 05:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
that did not uh have as as good a year
 
05:14:33.788 --> 05:14:33.798 align:start position:0%
as they had anticipated and so they were
 
05:14:35.548 --> 05:14:35.558 align:start position:0%
able to hold on to those funds and use
 
05:14:38.070 --> 05:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
them however they saw fit but by the
 
05:14:39.270 --> 05:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
same token they were plenty of
 
05:14:40.910 --> 05:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
businesses and on my sense is that most
 
05:14:42.708 --> 05:14:42.718 align:start position:0%
of them were happy to have not had the
 
05:14:44.628 --> 05:14:44.638 align:start position:0%
year that they had anticipated so they
 
05:14:48.430 --> 05:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
they were uh our our repayment rate was
 
05:14:48.440 --> 05:14:53.350 align:start position:0%
they were uh our our repayment rate was
quite

05:14:53.350 --> 05:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:56.830 --> 05:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
High um I know you didn't have anything
 
05:14:59.628 --> 05:14:59.638 align:start position:0%
to do with the PPP loans but uh with the
 
05:15:02.430 --> 05:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
SBA but Main Street
 
05:15:05.788 --> 05:15:05.798 align:start position:0%
grant program was really good um it
 
05:15:09.470 --> 05:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't a ton of money um but they made
 
05:15:12.110 --> 05:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
it as simple as possible uh for
 
05:15:16.070 --> 05:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
businesses to apply and to report back
 
05:15:18.430 --> 05:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
little bit strenuous um but not as bad
 
05:15:21.230 --> 05:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
as the other reports that are
 
05:15:25.868 --> 05:15:25.878 align:start position:0%
required um the one thing I would note
 
05:15:28.830 --> 05:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
when dealing with any of these
 
05:15:34.390 --> 05:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:37.708 --> 05:15:37.718 align:start position:0%
is a lot of them were based on sales not
 
05:15:39.270 --> 05:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily the Main Street Grant but
 
05:15:42.030 --> 05:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
they were based on sales and during that
 
05:15:44.990 --> 05:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
time everyone had to raise their
 
05:15:48.150 --> 05:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
prices just to cover the increase in
 
05:15:52.110 --> 05:15:52.120 align:start position:0%
costs of goods so your sales number
 
05:15:53.990 --> 05:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
actually increased more than what you
 
05:15:56.548 --> 05:15:56.558 align:start position:0%
would have thought it would be although
 
05:15:58.590 --> 05:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
your losses were
 
05:16:03.230 --> 05:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
greater um and I think and I'm not I
 
05:16:05.350 --> 05:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
can't remember cuz you know all the
 
05:16:07.628 --> 05:16:07.638 align:start position:0%
numbers are jumbled together but that
 
05:16:09.350 --> 05:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
was one of the things I found very
 
05:16:13.230 --> 05:16:13.240 align:start position:0%
disconcerting is they um based it on
 
05:16:16.590 --> 05:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
sales numbers and not actually sales you
 
05:16:19.190 --> 05:16:19.200 align:start position:0%
know gross profit because of that
 
05:16:23.548 --> 05:16:23.558 align:start position:0%
increase in uh cost of goods um that I
 
05:16:25.948 --> 05:16:25.958 align:start position:0%
think every business was experiencing
 
05:16:28.190 --> 05:16:28.200 align:start position:0%
and there was no way you could even
 
05:16:32.110 --> 05:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
capture those costs because you would be
 
05:16:35.390 --> 05:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
out of business uh cuz you people would
 
05:16:38.150 --> 05:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
not buy the product um what are your
 
05:16:39.390 --> 05:16:39.400 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that
 
05:16:42.350 --> 05:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
um in in the future just well I mean
 
05:16:45.470 --> 05:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
again going back in time I think we
 
05:16:48.590 --> 05:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
were and the federal government uh
 
05:16:50.910 --> 05:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
probably I had nothing to do with that
 
05:16:53.390 --> 05:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:56.310 --> 05:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
think basic it on sales and as you're
 
05:16:58.750 --> 05:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
saying the increase of those costs that
 
05:17:02.270 --> 05:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
that came after right so I think the
 
05:17:05.590 --> 05:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
decision to at least ours in terms of uh
 
05:17:08.548 --> 05:17:08.558 align:start position:0%
anticipated Revenue was was solid
 
05:17:10.470 --> 05:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
because we were we were kind of still
 
05:17:13.830 --> 05:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
living in 2019 right so the the increase
 
05:17:16.150 --> 05:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
in cost of goods came from supply chain
 
05:17:19.150 --> 05:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
disruptions that occurred um once the
 
05:17:22.110 --> 05:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
pandemic took hold and then those we're
 
05:17:24.868 --> 05:17:24.878 align:start position:0%
still recovering from that
 
05:17:27.430 --> 05:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
frankly right so like I said uh the Main
 
05:17:30.628 --> 05:17:30.638 align:start position:0%
Street Grant much simpler uh might much
 
05:17:33.590 --> 05:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
straightforward in in my view to fill
 
05:17:37.070 --> 05:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
out um but if we were to do something
 
05:17:39.150 --> 05:17:39.160 align:start position:0%
like that again I think um one of the
 
05:17:41.430 --> 05:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
things we would look at or should look
 
05:17:44.470 --> 05:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
at is if there are increased cost to go
 
05:17:47.670 --> 05:17:47.680 align:start position:0%
along with those numbers um well that in
 
05:17:49.150 --> 05:17:49.160 align:start position:0%
the mechanism too I mean we went
 
05:17:51.230 --> 05:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
directly to the businesses whereas PPP
 
05:17:54.910 --> 05:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
went through banks primarily right so
 
05:17:57.470 --> 05:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
um and I think you I mean you talked to
 
05:17:59.708 --> 05:17:59.718 align:start position:0%
a lot of businesses that PPP saved them
 
05:18:01.310 --> 05:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
probably just as much if not more than
 
05:18:03.990 --> 05:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
Main Street but um that was an important
 
05:18:07.110 --> 05:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
part of the puzzle but um exactly what
 
05:18:09.030 --> 05:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
the mechanism should be in that type of
 
05:18:10.750 --> 05:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
an emergency situation what's the most
 
05:18:13.230 --> 05:18:13.240 align:start position:0%
effective way to get relief to a
 
05:18:15.750 --> 05:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
business and to as many businesses as we
 
05:18:19.868 --> 05:18:19.878 align:start position:0%
can um are are probably questions that
 
05:18:22.070 --> 05:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
we should be taking some time to
 
05:18:23.910 --> 05:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
consider because you know who knows
 
05:18:23.920 --> 05:18:25.310 align:start position:0%
consider because you know who knows
hopefully

05:18:25.310 --> 05:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
05:18:27.990 --> 05:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
never any of us around but you know
 
05:18:29.948 --> 05:18:29.958 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe future versions of us will
 
05:18:31.830 --> 05:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
watch this video and have couple of
 
05:18:33.628 --> 05:18:33.638 align:start position:0%
couple of Clues so what they could try
 
05:18:33.638 --> 05:18:34.430 align:start position:0%
couple of Clues so what they could try
to

05:18:34.430 --> 05:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:18:36.788 --> 05:18:36.798 align:start position:0%
do at least now we have a little bit
 
05:18:38.830 --> 05:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
more of a road map than we did before
 
05:18:41.470 --> 05:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
for yeah I mean well you could take this
 
05:18:42.990 --> 05:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
and apply it to a lot of different types
 
05:18:44.430 --> 05:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
of instances right it doesn't have to be
 
05:18:48.510 --> 05:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
a global pandemic right and and we're
 
05:18:51.110 --> 05:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
we're our report is not only to look to
 
05:18:53.788 --> 05:18:53.798 align:start position:0%
see what we could what we got right too
 
05:18:56.110 --> 05:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
right so what did we do right not just
 
05:18:59.350 --> 05:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
what we did wrong so um that's really
 
05:19:01.708 --> 05:19:01.718 align:start position:0%
important too so that if anyone looks at
 
05:19:05.628 --> 05:19:05.638 align:start position:0%
it they understand you know our approach
 
05:19:07.830 --> 05:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
versus other approaches like you said
 
05:19:09.590 --> 05:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
the Main Street Grant anch you were able
 
05:19:11.948 --> 05:19:11.958 align:start position:0%
to because you use Dr so you were able
 
05:19:13.628 --> 05:19:13.638 align:start position:0%
to get that out to businesses where some
 
05:19:15.990 --> 05:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
of the other stuff if they weren't you
 
05:19:17.628 --> 05:19:17.638 align:start position:0%
didn't belong to an association you
 
05:19:20.190 --> 05:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
probably weren't really familiar yeah or
 
05:19:22.270 --> 05:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
or was it the PPP loan that did the deer
 
05:19:25.230 --> 05:19:25.240 align:start position:0%
I can't remember yeah they're all yeah
 
05:19:28.070 --> 05:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
do we know how much money the PPP
 
05:19:28.080 --> 05:19:31.310 align:start position:0%
do we know how much money the PPP
program

05:19:31.310 --> 05:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:35.990 --> 05:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
provided I'm going really fast um I
 
05:19:37.310 --> 05:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
don't know off the top of my head but
 
05:19:39.430 --> 05:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that's data EAS
 
05:19:42.830 --> 05:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
easily found yeah um well we probably
 
05:19:44.830 --> 05:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
should let you go but I was just going
 
05:19:46.670 --> 05:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
to say from the talking about the
 
05:19:48.910 --> 05:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
Broadband I mean and health bringing us
 
05:19:51.868 --> 05:19:51.878 align:start position:0%
back to us from a tella Health
 
05:19:55.030 --> 05:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
standpoint Behavioral Health mental
 
05:19:58.510 --> 05:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
health I'm sure uh getting people access
 
05:20:00.750 --> 05:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
to broadband must have been tremendously
 
05:20:03.788 --> 05:20:03.798 align:start position:0%
helpful yes yes and it continues to be
 
05:20:06.948 --> 05:20:06.958 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean it got us going right and
 
05:20:08.390 --> 05:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
one of the positives that came out of it
 
05:20:10.830 --> 05:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
is that teleah Health medicine right so
 
05:20:13.230 --> 05:20:13.240 align:start position:0%
um that is that is really a positive I
 
05:20:16.590 --> 05:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
think and it gives people better access
 
05:20:21.670 --> 05:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh to good medicine are there any other
 
05:20:23.750 --> 05:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you so much commissioner
 
05:20:25.390 --> 05:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
for being here this been a pleasure I
 
05:20:27.230 --> 05:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
truly appreciate your time thank you so
 
05:20:28.670 --> 05:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
much and thank you for doing this this
 
05:20:30.548 --> 05:20:30.558 align:start position:0%
is an important part of the equation
 
05:20:34.390 --> 05:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
it's U it's a lot to take in I'm sure um
 
05:20:36.230 --> 05:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
but I'm happily happy to travel down the
 
05:20:39.190 --> 05:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
PTSD road with you uh anytime it's been
 
05:20:41.708 --> 05:20:41.718 align:start position:0%
an interesting Journey this afternoon
 
05:20:43.948 --> 05:20:43.958 align:start position:0%
and if you could get those numbers to us
 
05:20:45.070 --> 05:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
yes I'll get you those numbers and if
 
05:20:46.430 --> 05:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
you think of anything else in the
 
05:20:47.830 --> 05:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
interum be sure to just shoot me an
