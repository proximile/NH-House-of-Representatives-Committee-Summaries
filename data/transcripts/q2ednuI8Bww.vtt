00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
so as I mentioned to several here I just
 
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
enjoyed the drive down today because I
 
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 align:start position:0%
had Glen Campbell and Ann Murray right
 
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
with me and it was very comfortable and
 
00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 align:start position:0%
relaxing um for uh all those that are
 
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
here um I want to make a reference to
 
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 align:start position:0%

calendar it indicates that there is a
 
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 align:start position:0%
bill that we've already
 
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
EXA and so obviously we're not going to
 
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 align:start position:0%
be exacting that particular bill that is
 
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
1397 that's the last bill identified uh
 
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
for action on Wednesday that's already
 
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 align:start position:0%
been taken care of so that will not be
 
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
discussed we've already done
 
00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 align:start position:0%
it all right so what I'd like to do now
 
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 align:start position:0%

1312 it's uh kind of a two-part Bill an
 
00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 align:start position:0%
act requiring parental
 
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
notification this bill will expand the
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
notification that prohibits policies
 
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
that would stop the notification about
 
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
students well-being I want to direct you
 
00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:10.759 align:start position:0%
to the technical advisory that I had
 
00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 align:start position:0%
passed out to all of you um This was um
 
00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 align:start position:0%
issued by the Department of Education on
 
00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
May 12th
 
00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
2023 this advisory provided gance to
 
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
Educators when discussing issues related
 
00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
to human sexuality outside the contents
 
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
of health and sex
 
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
education it reminds Educators that
 
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
parental notification is law when
 
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
discussing human sexuality in any course
 
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
context for examples English language
 
00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:49.639 align:start position:0%
arts or other areas of study uh this
 
00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
bill would add the word any in front of
 
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
clarify it will also expand the
 
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
definition of course material to include
 
00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
sexual orientation gender gender
 
00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
identity or gender expression and that
 
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
not less than two weeks notice will be
 
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
required now in doing some resch for
 
00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:16.919 align:start position:0%
this right in my own town of London da I
 
00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
found that their
 
00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
notification um policy was from
 
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
2012 um as far as I'm concerned it might
 
00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
might as well have been
 
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
1812 it had not been updated ated after
 
00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:32.879 align:start position:0%
the law it became law in
 
00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:36.039 align:start position:0%
2017 that parental two weeks notice of
 
00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
Parental notification had been
 
00:07:42.869 --> 00:07:42.879 align:start position:0%
required um it does not prevent an
 
00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
educator for answering any questions in
 
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
the classroom or sharing incidental um
 
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
information for example if I was a
 
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
teacher and someone asked me um if I was
 
00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
married I certainly could say I was
 
00:07:59.430 --> 00:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
married if they asked me if I was was
 
00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:01.159 align:start position:0%
married to a male or female I could
 
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
certainly answer that it does not exempt
 
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
that type of thing it does exempt actual
 
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
teaching outside of health and sex
 
00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:16.039 align:start position:0%
education there's another part of
 
00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
this that would also and I feel it's a
 
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
protection actually for for um teachers
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
um it would require that the schools may
 
00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:32.599 align:start position:0%
not adopt policies that would stop
 
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
Personnel okay may not adopt a policy
 
00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
that would stop Personnel from notifying
 
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
a parent about a child's mental
 
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
emotional physical health or well-being
 
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
sexuality or changes in services so if I
 
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
am a health an an educator and I feel it
 
00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:57.959 align:start position:0%
is very important to notify a parent
 
00:08:59.949 --> 00:08:59.959 align:start position:0%
about an issue that that is going on
 
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:03.160 align:start position:0%
with their child in any of these areas
 
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:06.200 align:start position:0%
this the district cannot adopt a policy
 
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
stopping me from doing that it also
 
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
allows them to have
 
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:17.560 align:start position:0%
policies that information could be
 
00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
withheld if a reasonably prudent and I
 
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
did look that up and research that
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
believe that the child could be harmed
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
by that information being given out so I
 
00:09:31.389 --> 00:09:31.399 align:start position:0%
looked up reasonably prudent and
 
00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:33.800 align:start position:0%
basically it's a person seeking in good
 
00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
faith to perform a contractual
 
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
obligation so if someone in good faith
 
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
felt that if I said something to a
 
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
parent in that child's specific instance
 
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
there could be a possibility for
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
harm the policy would there would be a
 
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
policy that would say that I could
 
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
withhold that
 
00:09:59.389 --> 00:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
information so I believe that in view if
 
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:01.480 align:start position:0%
you read carefully the technical
 
00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:04.519 align:start position:0%
advisory that came out basically it is
 
00:10:07.949 --> 00:10:07.959 align:start position:0%
enforcing this bill it's saying that you
 
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
cannot teach things in art or in English
 
00:10:17.829 --> 00:10:17.839 align:start position:0%
or in other subjects and if you do it
 
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
needs a parental notification of two
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
weeks so and I'm willing to take
 
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
questions I hope I can answer them thank
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
you very much representative Perez are
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
yes represent whitcock thank you
 
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
chairman good morning representative
 
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
good morning just want to be clear on
 
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
the clarification made so if I am te
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
teaching a literature course or world
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
literature course right and I want to
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
reflect back on the uh some of the art
 
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
and some of the uh parts of the story or
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
shakan story something of that nature I
 
00:10:57.069 --> 00:10:57.079 align:start position:0%
would and it has some sexual overtones
 
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
or Inu windows or direct fact in it in
 
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
the in the literature I would have to
 
00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:04.839 align:start position:0%
receive two week notice from the parents
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
is that correct I knew that was going to
 
00:11:08.829 --> 00:11:08.839 align:start position:0%
come up
 
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
good and my answer to that
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
is many years ago in middle school I
 
00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:16.959 align:start position:0%
used to teach to go in and talk to the
 
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
young girls um in Middle School of
 
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
course this is many years ago about what
 
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
was normal and what was not normal it's
 
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:25.720 align:start position:0%
a tough time to be in the middle school
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
and that it is all right and it is all
 
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
right and one of the things that I
 
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
brought out was things that had happened
 
00:11:35.949 --> 00:11:35.959 align:start position:0%
in the past for example if you did not
 
00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:39.079 align:start position:0%
have if you were not volumptuous way
 
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
back you were considered poor because
 
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
you couldn't afford food to be sure oh
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
wa this is not going to stop that type
 
00:11:54.269 --> 00:11:54.279 align:start position:0%
of thing I mean if you are talking
 
00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:56.519 align:start position:0%
about human
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
sexuality as we know it
 
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
and not trying
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
to push a subject this won't cover this
 
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
this is human sexuality gender gender
 
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:13.160 align:start position:0%
identification specifically specifically
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
as we know
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
it in
 
00:12:21.389 --> 00:12:21.399 align:start position:0%
2024 I believe I I believe thank you Mr
 
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
chair I I just want I didn't really get
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
the not the answer I wanted particular I
 
00:12:27.189 --> 00:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
didn't get the answer with my question
 
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
which was a on health sexual education
 
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
instruction I'm talking about I'm
 
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
talking literature or something history
 
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh particular back or Shakespeare um
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
with and it's going to involve dialogue
 
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
from the script in Shakespeare or
 
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
theater so with those folks those
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
teachers need to receive get the two
 
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
weeks parental uh uh notification in
 
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
English I do not believe so I think that
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
the district could look at the syllabus
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
and look and see what it is the syllabus
 
00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
that we have in London are right now
 
00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:05.839 align:start position:0%
is is going to be updated because I'm
 
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
going to push it because it's very vague
 
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
I would think that that would be on a
 
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
could certainly be if the school
 
00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
district approves the syllabus and what
 
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
is in that syllabus okay thank you thank
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair further questions from the
 
00:13:25.189 --> 00:13:25.199 align:start position:0%

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:37.269 align:start position:0%
like to invite gues
Banette

00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
ACLU good morning good morning Mr
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:57.759 --> 00:14:02.590 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
U thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
committee gbad I'm the legal director of
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
the ACLU of New Hampshire uh we oppose
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
this bill um I want to go through kind
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
of the two what I think are kind of very
 
00:14:15.389 --> 00:14:15.399 align:start position:0%
different and distinct components um of
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
the bill the first being the changes to
 
00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.030 align:start position:0%
the bill the first being the changes to
RSA

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
18611 uh Ral 9C which is the uh 14-day
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
notification requirement it also then
 
00:14:28.749 --> 00:14:28.759 align:start position:0%
provides an opportunity of course
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
through that notification uh period to
 
00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:34.519 align:start position:0%
allow students to to opt out I think
 
00:14:36.189 --> 00:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
with respect to that first section of
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
the bill um I think there are two
 
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
problems with it and I I think the first
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
is I think we're targeting in many ways
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
lgbtq plus students and I think the
 
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
second problem is that is Impractical
 
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
and for for many of the uh reasons that
 
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
I think were're articulated in some of
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
the prior questioning um uh before my
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
testimony so first I just want to be
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
very clear at least how I read the bill
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
and what its scope is maybe that's not
 
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
the intent but it's certainly how I read
 
00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
it this bill expands the scope of that
 
00:15:10.749 --> 00:15:10.759 align:start position:0%
14-day notice and opt out period not
 
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
just to sexual education but it goes
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
beyond that to any type of curriculum or
 
00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:20.839 align:start position:0%
instruction um or program of sexual
 
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
orientation gender gender identity or
 
00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
gender expression so we're taking this
 
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
statute where we're now expanding it far
 
00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
beyond what think what was its intent
 
00:15:33.949 --> 00:15:33.959 align:start position:0%
back in 2017 which was to address sexual
 
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
education and I would note that
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the department of
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
education's recent technical advisory
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
they issued a technical advisory right
 
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
when this 2017 law was adopted that I
 
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
think made clear that this was a statute
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
limited to sexual health so this is very
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
very expansive and I just think we need
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
to be clear um about that and so in so
 
00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
doing I think again I think it is
 
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
targeting and stigmatizes any
 
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
instruction concerning lgbtq plus people
 
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
and I think it sends the message to
 
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
those students that their identities are
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
something to be shunned feared and uh
 
00:16:12.189 --> 00:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
potentially even chilled with respect to
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
instruction and I just think that's a
 
00:16:14.829 --> 00:16:14.839 align:start position:0%
concerning message and I don't think
 
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
that's a message that we should be
 
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:19.160 align:start position:0%
sending to those students in our schools
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
but I think the second concern is that
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
is it is
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
Impractical um again when you take this
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
outside the context of sex sexual
 
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.069 align:start position:0%
outside the context of sex sexual
education

00:16:29.069 --> 00:16:29.079 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
and sexual instruction you are taking
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
this right into classrooms like history
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
English social studies um and of course
 
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:41.240 align:start position:0%
in those classes there's going to be
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
discussion about sexual orientation
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
there's going to be discussion about
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
gender you might talk about the 2015
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
marriage equality decision you might
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
talk about the 1848 Seno Falls
 
00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
Convention which is addresses directly
 
00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
gender um you might talk about the
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
Stonewall incident of
 
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
1969 all of which I think plausibly are
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
covered by it again may not be the
 
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
intent but I think when you read the
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
bill course uh materials instructions on
 
00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
gender sexual orientation that falls
 
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
within its scope so I just want to
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
express those those
 
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
concerns lastly with respect to um uh
 
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
section two I do want to convey the the
 
00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:26.839 align:start position:0%
real concerns that we have um about
 
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
potential um for outing so we believe
 
00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:32.360 align:start position:0%
that a school district policy of course
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
should not categorically prevent a
 
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
teacher from making a determination to
 
00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
disclose uh uh such information
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
concerning gender identity um for
 
00:17:44.909 --> 00:17:44.919 align:start position:0%
example um but of course School personel
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh should never encourage students to
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
withhold information from parents but
 
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
problems arise when school districts are
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
forced to implement policies that
 
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
mandate disclosure taking away this
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
discretion and that is what I fear
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
section two of this bill would do and
 
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:01.720 align:start position:0%
our position is that students learn best
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
when they feel safe to be themselves
 
00:18:06.149 --> 00:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
with their fellow students with other
 
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
teachers but this uh bill in our view
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
would drive young people away from
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
trusted adults with whom they may feel
 
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
more comfortable discussing sensitive
 
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
subjects especially if they are going
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
through the process of preparing
 
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
themselves for how to have those
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
discussions with their parents which is
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
what we do as young people right you
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
know as we're grappling with certain
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
things we talk to our friends sometimes
 
00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:28.919 align:start position:0%
we talk to trusted advisers to figure
 
00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
out how to even not only uh kind of
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
recognize what's going on within us but
 
00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to best approach that
 
00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
with our families and I think this
 
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:39.400 align:start position:0%
actually interferes with that in many
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
ways so with that I'll conclude Our
 
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
Testimony but for those reasons we
 
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:44.799 align:start position:0%
oppose this legislation thank you very
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
much are there
 
00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
H Damon not he's not even here thank you
 
00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:55.640 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question
 
00:18:59.630 --> 00:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
thank you could you comment on how you
 
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:03.640 align:start position:0%
perceive both parts of this proposed law
 
00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:08.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
level yeah I think um this this will
 
00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
come up more obviously in some of the
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
later bills today I think there
 
00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
are certainly some legal concerns on no
 
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
tier 9 to the extent that these bills
 
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
Target and discriminate against
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
individuals uh who are transits which
 
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
are protected under under Federal law
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
and protected of course to under our
 
00:19:32.909 --> 00:19:32.919 align:start position:0%
state separate laws so those those are
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
real concerns I think what I'm trying to
 
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
do here is in addition to all of those
 
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
concerns kind of bring this back to just
 
00:19:40.149 --> 00:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
the humanity of these students and what
 
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
they're going through number one and
 
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
number two just try to in my advocacy
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
just kind of get the committee to think
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
practically just about how this would
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
work right if you're an educator you
 
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
know how do you comply with section two
 
00:19:55.549 --> 00:19:55.559 align:start position:0%
you know um if
 
00:19:58.510 --> 00:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
um in response to questions that you may
 
00:20:00.149 --> 00:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
get from a student or even a parent and
 
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
also with respect to section one like
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
just what's covered if there's going to
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
be any reference to gender and sexual
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
orientation and I just think for many
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
reasons not only is this unworkable but
 
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
also again we have separate concerns
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
just about the targeting of this of
 
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:17.320 align:start position:0%
these um community members thank you
 
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
thank you further
 
00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
questions represent cordelli uh thank
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh thank you for being
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
here thank you um I just wanted to go
 
00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:28.919 align:start position:0%
back to your comments about section one
 
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
um and um what courses this uh applies
 
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
to uh because the um topic heading for
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
9C is uh adopt a policy allowing an
 
00:20:44.669 --> 00:20:44.679 align:start position:0%
exception to specific course material
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
based on a parent's determination that
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
the material is objectionable it does
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
not specify there that this is related
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
to sex education uh specifically um and
 
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:01.480 align:start position:0%
then it it does list um down in lines 9
 
00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
and 10 in the original bill um sex uh
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
education human sexuality and so forth
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
but uh I'm not
 
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
sure how um you come to the um
 
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:19.400 align:start position:0%
determination that this whole section
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
relates just to sex
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
education I to me I think that's clear
 
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
when you look at the legislative history
 
00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
and tent behind the 2017 law here which
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
is what this is amending and I think
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
also reflective of that you could just
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
look at the department of education's
 
00:21:39.149 --> 00:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
2017 technical advisory that they
 
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
promulgated to school districts after
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
that 2017 law was enacted and what they
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
said is quote it is important to note
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
that the legislative intent of HB 103
 
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
does not apply to literature or other
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
content that might have or be perceived
 
00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:55.799 align:start position:0%
to have sexual content that is what the
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
doe said in 2017 that is I think what
 
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
the legislative intent was um back in
 
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
2017 this fundamentally changes that and
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
runs completely contrary to it I just
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
think we all need to know that that is
 
00:22:11.549 --> 00:22:11.559 align:start position:0%
what would occur if this were to be
 
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
passed thank you represent of uh
 
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
Ford thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:22:20.909 --> 00:22:20.919 align:start position:0%
for taking my question thank you
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
sir I think we're all concerned about
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%
this issue because we're all cutely
 
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:31.240 align:start position:0%
aware how sensitive the subject is in
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
communities I once lived in a community
 
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
that can you get to a question quickly
 
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
please I am but I have to give him the
 
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
information before I can ask him the
 
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
question I lived in a community was
 
00:22:43.789 --> 00:22:43.799 align:start position:0%
evenly divided between Roman Catholics
 
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
and fundamentalists Sir they were not in
 
00:22:49.149 --> 00:22:49.159 align:start position:0%
favor of discussing these subjects in
 
00:22:52.029 --> 00:22:52.039 align:start position:0%
public and yet my son asked a young girl
 
00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
out to date your date regular Junior
 
00:22:59.269 --> 00:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
High School activity and she SP upon him
 
00:23:02.269 --> 00:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
because he studied art with a man who
 
00:23:02.279 --> 00:23:03.590 align:start position:0%
because he studied art with a man who
was

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:23:06.029 --> 00:23:06.039 align:start position:0%
homosexual and she didn't said I don't
 
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
date and she used the disparaging term
 
00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.750 align:start position:0%
date and she used the disparaging term
for

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
homosexuals she had concluded that
 
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
because he studied with that teacher he
 
00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.590 align:start position:0%
because he studied with that teacher he
must

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
must
 
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
be now how does the school deal with
 
00:23:21.789 --> 00:23:21.799 align:start position:0%
that kind of
 
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
response I don't know and I think it's
 
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
it's Case by case and I think one of the
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
things that we have concerns about when
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
you have policies like this right when
 
00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:32.039 align:start position:0%
you essentially have categorical
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
mandates um is that it takes that caseby
 
00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:39.320 align:start position:0%
case determination away from from from
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
school district so I I'm not going to
 
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
pretend like this is easy in every
 
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
instance um but that that is why we are
 
00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
precisely concerned about mandates is to
 
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
provide that discretion for um for
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
districts I mean we we do not I mean as
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
I said in my opening remarks you know
 
00:23:58.669 --> 00:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
don't advocate for in every instance
 
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
that this information not be disclosed
 
00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's not our position but that
 
00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
it is uh something that um you know uh
 
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
should be left to the discretion of
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
school districts in consultation with
 
00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:11.720 align:start position:0%
administrators thank repres
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
Dr thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question thank you so I'm
 
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
trying to reconcile your last statement
 
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
about they shouldn't um make a
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
determination about disclosure with the
 
00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
jbab policy that our school district has
 
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
adopted that says that school Personnel
 
00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
should not disclose information that may
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
reveal a student's transgender status uh
 
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
to others including parents and other
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
school Personnel unless legally required
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
to do so or unless the student has
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
authorized that disclosure so I'm trying
 
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
to they seem to be at ought yeah I I'd
 
00:24:48.669 --> 00:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
have to look more closely at that policy
 
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
the policy that I have more familiarity
 
00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:52.120 align:start position:0%
with is is the one arising out of
 
00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:54.440 align:start position:0%
Manchester which is not a mandate for
 
00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
all the reasons that I articulated that
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
you know again our um our position is
 
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
that a school district policy shouldn't
 
00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
prevent a teacher from making a
 
00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
determination to disclose such
 
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
information that it is discretionary In
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
Case by case and and that's what I've
 
00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
advocated and it's not a new position
 
00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:11.320 align:start position:0%
from our
 
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
office repr
 
00:25:17.789 --> 00:25:17.799 align:start position:0%
leus thank you for taking my question it
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
seems like what you just said is exactly
 
00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
what's in this bill so I'm not sure why
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
you object to this bill because it's
 
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
laying out that the teacher can use her
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
discretion and that the school district
 
00:25:33.789 --> 00:25:33.799 align:start position:0%
can't say not
 
00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:37.240 align:start position:0%
to and interrup you could you explain to
 
00:25:38.909 --> 00:25:38.919 align:start position:0%
me sure that's not how I read this bill
 
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
at all in fact um and I think that is
 
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:43.640 align:start position:0%
the underlying concern that I have there
 
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
is a carve out for abuse and neglect
 
00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
situations I think the concern obviously
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
that we have there and why that uh
 
00:25:52.389 --> 00:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover all of our concerns is
 
00:25:54.269 --> 00:25:54.279 align:start position:0%
that you can easily imagine where a
 
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
school maybe would not necessarily have
 
00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
an indicia of something that met the
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
standard of abuse in neglect but there
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
could be other indicia you know that
 
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
might lead a district to decide that it
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
may not be appropriate so I I just think
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
again these are local decisions local
 
00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:13.480 align:start position:0%
school district um uh concerns um and I
 
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
I that's why I just don't think this is
 
00:26:17.549 --> 00:26:17.559 align:start position:0%
really ripe for adjudication at uh the
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
state level and you should allow
 
00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
districts to address this but not
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
through mandates that would be imposed
 
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
by school policy under this Bill thank
 
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
you representative bony thank you Mr
 
00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
question so in reading this bill is it
 
00:26:34.029 --> 00:26:34.039 align:start position:0%
your understanding that if an English
 
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
teacher was taking up a unit on poetry
 
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
that dealt with the works of say um Alan
 
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
Ginsburg um would that because of
 
00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
potential um issues that might arise
 
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
with conversations about the Poetry um
 
00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:52.039 align:start position:0%
is it your understanding that the uh
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
teacher would have to give a 14-day
 
00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039 align:start position:0%
notice uh if if there's reference to
 
00:26:59.149 --> 00:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
gender sexual orientation gender
 
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
identity I mean I think the answer is
 
00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:04.919 align:start position:0%
plausibly and and quite probably yes
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
under this that's my interpretation at
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
least yes um so could this create a lot
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
of confusion for teachers in terms of
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
trying to put together curriculums and
 
00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
what poems or what um material that
 
00:27:18.669 --> 00:27:18.679 align:start position:0%
they're going to present in the
 
00:27:20.909 --> 00:27:20.919 align:start position:0%
classroom I mean I think that's kind of
 
00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
goes to the Impractical argument that
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
I'm making I just if I'm a teacher I'm
 
00:27:26.269 --> 00:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
looking at this I I just don't think
 
00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:28.120 align:start position:0%
particularly in an English class or high
 
00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
school history class I'm just not going
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
to know what's what how to how to deal
 
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
with it to be honest with you are there
 
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.470 align:start position:0%
with it to be honest with you are there
further

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:38.480 align:start position:0%

of our 14-year-old transgender daughter

Iris and so I'm going to skip over that
 
00:28:22.669 --> 00:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
part of my testimony today though it is
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
in the written testimony that I'll um
 
00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.110 align:start position:0%

in theond our family's personal story we
 
00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to share with you how that story
 
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
fits into the context of our joint
 
00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
shared American history which I have
 
00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
previously shared also um putting
 
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
together some of our key historical
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
Supreme United States Supreme Court
 
00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:49.799 align:start position:0%

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
V Virginia Reed V Reed or berel V
 
00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
Hodes and just like our daughter IA
 
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
the plaintiffs in these cases they
 
00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.430 align:start position:0%
the plaintiffs in these cases they
weren't

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:02.440 align:start position:0%
weren't
 
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
dangerous they didn't need to be
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
excluded from the
 
00:29:10.029 --> 00:29:10.039 align:start position:0%
conversation indeed these plaintiffs
 
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
just like my daughter
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
Iris they only wanted to live their
 
00:29:18.909 --> 00:29:18.919 align:start position:0%
lives with the freedoms Americans enjoy
 
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
under our nation's great
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
laws and the United States Supreme Court
 
00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
found the laws in those cases prevented
 
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
them from doing so the laws in those
 
00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:33.640 align:start position:0%
cases I cited were on the wrong side of
 
00:29:36.269 --> 00:29:36.279 align:start position:0%
History just like this law would be if
 
00:29:37.389 --> 00:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
it were
 
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
passed I want to expand on this
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
theme that enacting laws that Target
 
00:29:48.669 --> 00:29:48.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:51.549 --> 00:29:51.559 align:start position:0%
unamerican laws that have targeted
 
00:29:54.029 --> 00:29:54.039 align:start position:0%
minorities have not withstood the test
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
of time because our understandings of
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
fre Freedom changes over
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
Generations think about categorizing
 
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
today every
 
00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:09.919 align:start position:0%
woman or every brown or black skinned
 
00:30:12.029 --> 00:30:12.039 align:start position:0%
person as
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
property instead of people with equal
 
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
rights as white people or as
 
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
men nowadays we would never ever enact
 
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
laws that exclude women from owning real
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
estate that exclude black people from
 
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
taking out mortgages that exclude
 
00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
asian-americans from voting our
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
changed understandings of Freedom over
 
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
Generations would not allow
 
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
that and as a back stop if laws of that
 
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
type were passed they would not pass
 
00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.789 align:start position:0%

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
Muster that is the same for these laws
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
such as
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
13312 t targeting the lgbtq plus

00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
1312 thank you thank you very much are
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
rep and
 
00:32:03.549 --> 00:32:03.559 align:start position:0%
leus you have me confused but thank you
 
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
question I'm reading this just as having
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
to give notice and then if a parent
 
00:32:15.509 --> 00:32:15.519 align:start position:0%
objects to particular material you doing
 
00:32:18.149 --> 00:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
a substitute but that's a parent and a
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
particular child in particular material
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure how what this is doing
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
is what you were talking talking
 
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
about as far
 
00:32:34.269 --> 00:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
as um
 
00:32:34.279 --> 00:32:35.870 align:start position:0%
as um
limiting

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
limiting
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
curriculum in general Etc and how it
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
goes specifically against lgbtq since it
 
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
talks about human sexuality human sexual
 
00:32:50.629 --> 00:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
education Etc which I believe involves
 
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
All Humans thank you representative leus
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your question there's two
 
00:32:59.470 --> 00:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
levels of answer to to that first is the
 
00:33:03.029 --> 00:33:03.039 align:start position:0%
philosophical reasoning behind writing
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
sexual identity and gender identity into
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
this law which is an unfounded belief
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
that these topics are dangerous bad
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
unsafe Etc that sends a signal to the
 
00:33:19.149 --> 00:33:19.159 align:start position:0%
lgbtq plus community and the rest of the
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
community that is unwarranted unhealthy
 
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
unsafe for that Community it's wrong the
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
second thing is the Notions of
 
00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:31.240 align:start position:0%
impracticality that the ACLU testified
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
about teachers are exceedingly busy
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
teachers are not just teachers anymore
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
teachers are guidance counselors
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
psychologists safety managers they do
 
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
all sorts of things they are sometimes
 
00:33:47.789 --> 00:33:47.799 align:start position:0%
lesson planning from day to day to day
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
they may not know 14 days in advance
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
exactly what they're going to be
 
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
teaching sometimes they need to teach in
 
00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
response to current events what will
 
00:33:57.669 --> 00:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
likely happen
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
is that teachers will avoid gender
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
identity and sexual orientation topics
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
100% because of inability to comply or
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
confusion and fear about what is and is
 
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
not allowed thank you represent cordelli
 
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um aren't you trying to
 
00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:23.839 align:start position:0%
ascribe um motives for this legislation
 
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
to the sponsors of the bill based on
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
your own
 
00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint yes I am but I think it's a
 
00:34:31.359 --> 00:34:34.550 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint yes I am but I think it's a

have lived in New Hampshire my whole
 
00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359 align:start position:0%

these bills are passed my family and I
 
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
might not be able to stay in New
 
00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire please vote no to house bills
 
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
1312 um I'm not going to repeat my
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
personal story because I shared that
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
with you last week and it's in my
 
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
written testimony I'm giving you for HB
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
1312 what does this mean for me I think
 
00:35:52.109 --> 00:35:52.119 align:start position:0%
teachers would be busy and would
 
00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
probably just skip any teaching that
 
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
involved lgbtq plus issues that would
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
leave me and the rest of the lgbtq plus
 
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
students student body completely left
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
out and isolated from our entire
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
education even worse than the other bill
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
this would mean no representation of
 
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
lgbtq plus anywhere in my education part
 
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
of my identity would be ignored thrown
 
00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
away the fact in fact all of these
 
00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
proposed laws targeting me and the rest
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
of the lgbtq plus Community have been
 
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
like torture and I wish you would stop
 
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:27.000 align:start position:0%

00:47:43.549 --> 00:47:43.559 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
um we call this uh HB
 
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
1356 the given name act a child's name
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
is one of the very first parenting
 
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
choices parents make until very recently
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
there was no question about who gets
 
00:47:59.710 --> 00:47:59.720 align:start position:0%
aside this fundamental piece of the
 
00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:00.790 align:start position:0%
aside this fundamental piece of the
child's

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
child's
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
identity but activists in school are
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
allowing teaches to switch a child's
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
name and pronouns without the parents no
 
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge or
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
consent the hijacking of names rights is
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
more widespread than you might think in
 
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
Michigan a state department of education
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
official encouraged Educators to use the

students's chosen name and pronounce
 
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
without notifying the parents as did
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
schools in Indiana Ohio Virginia
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
Maryland and even in lllo
 
00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts like these parents may
 
00:48:32.589 --> 00:48:32.599 align:start position:0%
have no idea that their child is
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
questioning his or her gender
 
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
identity this robs parents opportunity
 
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
to support their child or to address
 
00:48:43.549 --> 00:48:43.559 align:start position:0%
what might be causing the child's gender
 
00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:45.640 align:start position:0%
discomfort the given name act would
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
restore control over child's name to the
 
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
parents where it rightfully belongs this
 
00:48:51.309 --> 00:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
bill will require schools to obtain
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
parent written consent before referring
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
to a student by a name other than his or
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
her birth name or pronouns other than
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
biological the ACT protects Free Speech
 
00:49:07.309 --> 00:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
as is defined by the Constitution in the
 
00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court in instan where the
 
00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
parents agreed to let a child use a new
 
00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
name in pronouns it protects School
 
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
Employees from being forced to use new
 
00:49:17.789 --> 00:49:17.799 align:start position:0%
identifiers where doing so would violate
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:23.549 --> 00:49:23.559 align:start position:0%
beliefs but it recognizes that on a
 
00:49:26.109 --> 00:49:26.119 align:start position:0%
Garcetti versus cabellos a teacher has
 
00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
no constitutional right to use a child's
 
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
chosen name and pronounce against the
 
00:49:32.789 --> 00:49:32.799 align:start position:0%
parents wishes in that case the Supreme
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
Court ruled the speech used in official
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
capacity as a government employee is not

00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment social transition is a step
 
00:49:44.069 --> 00:49:44.079 align:start position:0%
not to be taken lightly and certainly
 
00:49:46.589 --> 00:49:46.599 align:start position:0%
not to be taken without parental consent
 
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
Dr Hillary Cass the former president of
 
00:49:50.549 --> 00:49:50.559 align:start position:0%
the Royal College of Pediatrics and
 
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
Child Health Care said it best when she
 
00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
described social transition as an active
 
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.510 align:start position:0%
described social transition as an active
intervention

00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
intervention
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
with potentially serious as with any
 
00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
intervention in the life of a child
 
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
parents have a right to know about about
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
it and accept or refuse intervention as
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
they see
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
best the only issue with the bill may be
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
a current nickname the child has
 
00:50:13.549 --> 00:50:13.559 align:start position:0%
attached them there's an easy solution
 
00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
here ask parents uh for any approved
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
nicknames on the forms they fill out at
 
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:19.640 align:start position:0%
the start of the school year if Robert
 
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
wants to go by Bobby his parents would
 
00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
not object but if Robert wants to go by
 
00:50:26.349 --> 00:50:26.359 align:start position:0%
Rhonda the permission slip he brings

for kids like
 
00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:49.960 align:start position:0%
flash um sometimes we called them by
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
their last name like Tanner come over
 
00:50:56.589 --> 00:50:56.599 align:start position:0%
here um doesn't this bill
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh say that you can't do
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
that this bill says that any name other
 
00:51:07.109 --> 00:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
than their birth name um you would have
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
to have permission from the parent to do
 
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
so so follow up on that yes so
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%

00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
to the parent and say you know the kids
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
are have found a nickname for Judy inner
 
00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
it's Flash and uh I I'd have to do that
 
00:51:28.829 --> 00:51:28.839 align:start position:0%
rather than just be normal and react to
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
that like I would in normal
 
00:51:34.109 --> 00:51:34.119 align:start position:0%
situations that's what you're asking me
 
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
to do as a
 
00:51:40.109 --> 00:51:40.119 align:start position:0%

representative morning um I I have two
 
00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
questions one just a clarification if I
 
00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:54.680 align:start position:0%
may and then a question I'm looking on
 
00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
the uh bill bill in line 18 under
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
employer contractor shall not you're
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
talking about derivative Z what does
 
00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:03.430 align:start position:0%
talking about derivative Z what does
that

00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:05.549 --> 00:52:05.559 align:start position:0%
mean I don't have it right in front of
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
me if you could uh expound a little bit
 
00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
it says a contractor employer shall not
 
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
use a name or address to refer a student
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
that does not match the name list on the
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
students first certificate or
 
00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:24.270 align:start position:0%
students first certificate or
derivatives

00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:26.109 align:start position:0%
 
thereof

00:52:26.109 --> 00:52:26.119 align:start position:0%
thereof
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure uh and I apologize for that
 
00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
that's okay chairman lad may just do the
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
second yes sure thank you and I but I do
 
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
have qu a question on line 256 and 7
 
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
part three and it talks about an
 
00:52:42.789 --> 00:52:42.799 align:start position:0%
employer contractor not being not
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
required to address youngster um because
 
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
of their religious moral conviction and
 
00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
what's really difficult for me is we've
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
been hearing over and over and over
 
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
again te
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
cannot uh use their uh their position
 
00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
they cannot provide their opinions on
 
00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
things they can't do this now they can't
 
00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
do that and now all of a sudden we're
 
00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
saying but a teacher or an employer can
 
00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:12.760 align:start position:0%
make the choice I choose not to do that
 
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
because on my so if I choose not to do
 
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
that isn't that violation all the other
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
bills we been getting that says a
 
00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
teacher you can't do that you can't show
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
that you don't agree with that the
 
00:53:25.789 --> 00:53:25.799 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has stated that
 
00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
that um a teacher does not have to um
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
call a student by uh uh another name
 
00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
than their birth name and it's protected
 
00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
uh at the same way because of a
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs or or their their
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
beliefs but in the same way that the
 
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
like I had mentioned through Garcetti
 
00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
and um cellos that
 
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
um teacher has no constitutional right
 
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
to use a child child's chosen name or
 
00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
pronounce without the parents permission
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
could you just give me the citation on
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
that so I could check that out please I
 
00:54:03.549 --> 00:54:03.559 align:start position:0%
will get that back to you thank you so
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
much and again I apologize represent

questions from the committee represented
 
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:54:16.789 --> 00:54:16.799 align:start position:0%
taking my question I actually have two
 
00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
so the first is clarification if I'm
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
understanding your
 
00:54:21.119 --> 00:54:23.190 align:start position:0%
understanding your
introduction

00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
introduction
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
um so my youngest daughter whose first
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
name is Nadia did not like her name when
 
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
she was an elementary school student she
 
00:54:33.309 --> 00:54:33.319 align:start position:0%
does in adulthood thank you she went by
 
00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:36.760 align:start position:0%
peanut which was her given name from her
 
00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
favored grandfather and informed at
 
00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
school that she would be peanut you I
 
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
think please confirm if I'm correct here
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
are saying that the school could not
 
00:54:47.230 --> 00:54:47.240 align:start position:0%
accept that they would have to get
 
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
consent from the parents for the name
 
00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
that the child was going by and provided
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
to them nothing to do with sexuality
 
00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:56.549 align:start position:0%
to them nothing to do with sexuality
just

00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:54:59.549 --> 00:54:59.559 align:start position:0%
a nickname it it's trying to you're
 
00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:01.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely right and that's it's a
 
00:55:05.349 --> 00:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
difficult uh situation
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
um but somehow it's on the other end of
 
00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
the spectrum it's got to be controlled I
 
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
believe um my daughter's nickname was
 
00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
Doodles so I I know exactly what you're
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%

00:55:26.349 --> 00:55:26.359 align:start position:0%
yes what does this bill do do or does it
 
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:29.400 align:start position:0%

00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
are calling each other so for example
 
00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
following up on representative Tanner's
 
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
inquiry if the students on a team are
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:45.789 --> 00:55:45.799 align:start position:0%
whatever does the law comment on that it
 
00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:47.640 align:start position:0%

00:56:39.549 --> 00:56:39.559 align:start position:0%
that correct that is correct thank you
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Al bony
 
00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:43.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:56:47.349 --> 00:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question um um I taught for a
 
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
while and I was in a school district and
 
00:56:51.069 --> 00:56:51.079 align:start position:0%
one of the things that you have to do at
 
00:56:52.829 --> 00:56:52.839 align:start position:0%
the beginning of school send home a
 
00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:55.720 align:start position:0%
multitude of permission forms and then
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
invariably you end up having to track
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
those down because they don't come back
 
00:57:04.349 --> 00:57:04.359 align:start position:0%
so I have a student as um both
 
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative Damon Damon Ander has
 
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
suggested that want to be called a
 
00:57:11.789 --> 00:57:11.799 align:start position:0%
particular name um that they're
 
00:57:14.349 --> 00:57:14.359 align:start position:0%
comfortable with and yet that permission
 
00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
slip never gets returned so that means
 
00:57:20.109 --> 00:57:20.119 align:start position:0%
that student is has to always be
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
referred to by the legal
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
name by staff yes further questions from
 
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
the committee representative Cornell
 
00:57:30.349 --> 00:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
Thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
question when you say contractor or
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
staff does that include cafeteria
 
00:57:37.309 --> 00:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
workers bus drivers everybody else that
 
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
comes into contact with the child it
 
00:57:42.069 --> 00:57:42.079 align:start position:0%
does who would have
 
00:57:44.589 --> 00:57:44.599 align:start position:0%
no access
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
to any of their records or know anything
 
00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
about them except they see them in the
 
00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
cafeteria line and they say to them oh H
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
my name is is Sally and it's not but
 
00:57:59.470 --> 00:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
that's what they know them as so they
 
00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
would have to get permission say you
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
know I have can I call your child Sally
 
00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:05.960 align:start position:0%
the um the staff you're talking about
 
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
are School
 
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
Employees and they would have to follow
 
00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
the same rules as every other School
 
00:58:13.829 --> 00:58:13.839 align:start position:0%
employee thank you further questions
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
from the committee represent
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
Cordell thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:58:20.589 --> 00:58:20.599 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing this forward
 
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
um I think you mentioned something about
 
00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:25.240 align:start position:0%
how this would
 
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
um a positive aspect of this law would
 
00:58:30.349 --> 00:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
be that it would help to avoid lawsuits
 
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
and I remember he
 
00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
hearing a a case in California about the
 
00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
idea um you gave me a look where maybe
 
00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:41.240 align:start position:0%
you didn't but there's a positive idea
 
00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
of how it would
 
00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:45.640 align:start position:0%
avoid uh there was a case in California
 
00:58:48.349 --> 00:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
which regarded
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
um a teacher uh being required to call a
 
00:58:54.270 --> 00:58:54.280 align:start position:0%
student by pronouns and it violated her
 
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs maybe that was in
 
00:58:59.309 --> 00:58:59.319 align:start position:0%
regard to so that um you could avoid
 
00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
lawsuits like that
 
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
somehow what what the the research I did
 
00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
it basically said that the um the
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court said that
 
00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
um if it was against your
 
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
religious religion or religious beliefs
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh to call someone other than their um
 
00:59:23.109 --> 00:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
birth name that you didn't have to as a
 
00:59:25.349 --> 00:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
employee if it was your religious
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
beliefs okay I just want some
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%

schools have started doing alumni uh
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
correspondence and they include the by
 
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
addressing to the people by their
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%

01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920 align:start position:0%

Tolen

01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:10.589 --> 01:01:10.599 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Max Tolland my pronouns
 
01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:13.160 align:start position:0%
are they them I live in Canterbury I'm
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
nonbinary and I'm here to testify
 
01:01:19.549 --> 01:01:19.559 align:start position:0%
against this bill if HB 1356 becomes law
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't be able to learn like other
 
01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:23.720 align:start position:0%
kids do my name and my pronouns are who
 
01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:26.680 align:start position:0%
I am KNX is not the name on my birth
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
certificate but it is my name when
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
someone talks about you they use your
 
01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
name and your pronouns when people use
 
01:01:36.029 --> 01:01:36.039 align:start position:0%
the wrong name or pronoun to talk about
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
me or just don't use my name or pronouns
 
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
at all that's like taking away my
 
01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:43.640 align:start position:0%
identity coming out is a
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
journey when you come out you talk to
 
01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
people you can come out publicly you can
 
01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
come out to your parents to your friends
 
01:01:52.589 --> 01:01:52.599 align:start position:0%
but no matter what you're going to come
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
out to someone again and again and again
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
again you feel like you've told people
 
01:01:58.750 --> 01:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
who you are and what your truth is and
 
01:02:00.549 --> 01:02:00.559 align:start position:0%
that you still have to tell people and
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
correct people and remind them you have
 
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
to do this job of convincing people that
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
you are real and you are valid with this
 
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
simple truth once before I came out at
 
01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:12.839 align:start position:0%
school I was sitting at recess with my
 
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
friends when another came up and used
 
01:02:17.349 --> 01:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
the wrong pronouns to talk about me I
 
01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
sat there for the rest of my classes
 
01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
think about being misgendered not about
 
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
was not about whatever was being taught
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
in class I didn't get enough sleep that
 
01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
night I was focused on how I was known
 
01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:29.839 align:start position:0%
as the wrong
 
01:02:32.269 --> 01:02:32.279 align:start position:0%
person last year in math class my
 
01:02:34.269 --> 01:02:34.279 align:start position:0%
teacher was handing out test results and
 
01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
said to me here you go here's your test
 
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
before turning to the rest of the class
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
to say they did a great job they were
 
01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
the only one who got this problem right
 
01:02:44.309 --> 01:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
I felt seen and like I was part of the
 
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
community I felt whole and acknowledged
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
in a good sense when my proun was used
 
01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
casually and
 
01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
correctly HB 1356 is a problem even in
 
01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
the most ideal circumstances where my
 
01:02:58.829 --> 01:02:58.839 align:start position:0%
parents write the note identifying by
 
01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
name and my gender there are still
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
teachers who are going to look at me
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
look at the note and because they don't
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
believe in trans rights because they
 
01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:09.160 align:start position:0%
don't believe that who I am is real they
 
01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
will still use the wrong name and the
 
01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:13.240 align:start position:0%
wrong pronouns to talk to and about me
 
01:03:15.269 --> 01:03:15.279 align:start position:0%
they will take away my
 
01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:17.240 align:start position:0%
identity I think that whether that
 
01:03:19.109 --> 01:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
happens will depend on the school and
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
who teachers are what scares me is there
 
01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:24.559 align:start position:0%
is no way to see which teachers are to
 
01:03:28.109 --> 01:03:28.119 align:start position:0%
be welcoming and which aren't if HB 1356
 
01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
becomes the law there is no way to
 
01:03:32.069 --> 01:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
ensure that students will be able to
 
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
learn in a safe environment with
 
01:03:37.029 --> 01:03:37.039 align:start position:0%
teachers who accept them as they are
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
please vote itl HB 1356 to allow me to
 
01:03:43.150 --> 01:03:43.160 align:start position:0%
learn as I am ma very good timing two
 
01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
minutes is right up um any questions yes
 
01:03:49.269 --> 01:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner yes thank you for your
 
01:03:51.309 --> 01:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
excellent testimony that was great do
 
01:03:53.950 --> 01:03:53.960 align:start position:0%
you feel that if you're misgendered or
 
01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.349 align:start position:0%
you feel that if you're misgendered or
um

01:03:55.349 --> 01:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:57.309 --> 01:03:57.319 align:start position:0%
addressed in a misgendered way it makes
 
01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
you more a target for harassment and
 
01:04:03.309 --> 01:04:03.319 align:start position:0%
bullying it can especially dep it really
 
01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
depends on who the students are who's
 
01:04:08.349 --> 01:04:08.359 align:start position:0%
listening to it but especially if the
 
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
faculty use the wrong name or pronouns
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
these students who would perhaps
 
01:04:17.829 --> 01:04:17.839 align:start position:0%
otherwise not have would definitely feel
 
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
um much more like it would be all right
 
01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
to misgender me and use the wrong name
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
and pronouns because if the staff are
 
01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
doing it shouldn't everyone be able to
 
01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.029 align:start position:0%
doing it shouldn't everyone be able to
do

01:04:28.029 --> 01:04:28.039 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%

01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning thank you Mr
 
01:05:11.309 --> 01:05:11.319 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee uh my
 
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
name is Jonas suon Morse I live in
 
01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
Canterbury I am the proud parent of that
 
01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
trans nonbinary child um I'm a member of

Society of friends the
 
01:05:28.109 --> 01:05:28.119 align:start position:0%
Quakers uh I'm here to oppose this bill
 
01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
HB 1356 dictates that even when I the
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
parent affirm my child's identity
 
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
teachers and staff with religious or
 
01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
moral convictions can disregard my
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
parental wishes and the identity of my
 
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
child that exception is immoral and
 
01:05:44.589 --> 01:05:44.599 align:start position:0%
unfairly discriminates against me and my
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
child it also perpetuates the false
 
01:05:49.069 --> 01:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
notion that religious convictions oppose
 
01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799 align:start position:0%
inclusion and
 
01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
love following the biblical injunction
 
01:05:55.549 --> 01:05:55.559 align:start position:0%
to let your yes be yes and your no be no
 
01:05:58.269 --> 01:05:58.279 align:start position:0%
Quakers do not swear Oaths but when I
 
01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
say that I am clear to affirm this
 
01:06:02.589 --> 01:06:02.599 align:start position:0%
testimony to the committee the committee
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
should understand that I am stating my
 
01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:07.240 align:start position:0%
religious and moral convictions trans
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
men are men trans women are women trans
 
01:06:14.029 --> 01:06:14.039 align:start position:0%
non-binary people exist and their gender
 
01:06:17.069 --> 01:06:17.079 align:start position:0%
identity is real and valid this is an
 
01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
incomplete catalog of the variety of
 
01:06:20.670 --> 01:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
gender varieties of gender identity in
 
01:06:23.269 --> 01:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
the world the biological sex assigned at
 
01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:24.799 align:start position:0%
Birth is at times useful medical
 
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
indicator but it is not a more true and
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
accurate marker of identity than a
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
person's own lived
 
01:06:35.069 --> 01:06:35.079 align:start position:0%
experiences I'm not a public school
 
01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:37.640 align:start position:0%
teacher or staff member but if I were HB
 
01:06:40.829 --> 01:06:40.839 align:start position:0%
1356 would require me to violate those
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
religious and moral convictions if I had
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
a trans student whose parents didn't
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
affirm their identity in writing there's
 
01:06:49.029 --> 01:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
no space in this law for my religious or
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
moral convictions when I parent my child
 
01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
but there is space for those who want
 
01:06:55.950 --> 01:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
want to use religion to disregard my
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
wishes as a parent and my child's
 
01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
identity HB 1356 is unethical immoral
 
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
and should not be the law of this state
 
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
thank you V are there questions from the
 
01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much for coming
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
Ty curse of writing
 
01:07:25.230 --> 01:07:25.240 align:start position:0%

Thompson I live in noning hun New
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm a transgender non-beer
 
01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
person my pronouns are they them it took
 
01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
me a long time to be able to say that in
 
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
the world with confidence and conviction
 
01:07:41.309 --> 01:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm so proud of young people today
 
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
who are able to step into the space of
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
knowing and owning themselves in public
 
01:07:50.269 --> 01:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
ways we need to support that this law as
 
01:07:52.589 --> 01:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
we've heard with such eloquent testimony
 
01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:58.430 align:start position:0%
 
unjust

01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
unjust
 
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
ideally family spaces are supportive and
 
01:08:03.549 --> 01:08:03.559 align:start position:0%
allow young people to blossom into
 
01:08:05.829 --> 01:08:05.839 align:start position:0%
themselves in ways that are safe
 
01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
encouraging and helpful unfortunately
 
01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
this is not always
 
01:08:12.829 --> 01:08:12.839 align:start position:0%
true sometimes families have their own
 
01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
learning curve my family had their own
 
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
learning curve they are loving and well
 
01:08:20.749 --> 01:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
meaning people I needed the opportunity
 
01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
to choose where and when to have those
 
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
convers ations with them at the same
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
time I need a community for young people
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
schools are Community being able to
 
01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
explore aspects of self with the same
 
01:08:37.390 --> 01:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
freedom and celebrate aspects of self
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
with the same Freedom as everybody else
 
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
in the school who may be
 
01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
self-identifying with athletic
 
01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
qualities uh Scholastic strengths that
 
01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
um incur the same nicknames or
 
01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
self-identification of choice es of
 
01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:55.799 align:start position:0%
names and the ways that they are called
 
01:08:57.749 --> 01:08:57.759 align:start position:0%
in the world this law really just
 
01:09:01.149 --> 01:09:01.159 align:start position:0%
singles out that a trans identity is
 
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
unacceptable you are the only ones that
 
01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
cannot do that young people are required
 
01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
to emerge in the world with increasing
 
01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
agency self-direction and responsibility
 
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
we need to affirm that by being able to
 
01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
support the choices that they make in
 
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
schools and in the
 
01:09:21.749 --> 01:09:21.759 align:start position:0%
communities that's all I have thank you
 
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
very much are there questions from the
 
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
committee thank you
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:52.719 --> 01:09:59.550 align:start position:0%
 
inette

01:09:59.550 --> 01:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members good
 
01:10:03.229 --> 01:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
morning again good morning again thank
 
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman members of the committee
 
01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
G viset with the ACLU of New Hampshire I
 
01:10:08.910 --> 01:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
know I have very limited time so I'll
 
01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
try to keep this brief I know there are
 
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
many speakers behind me who I think
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
frankly have more powerful stories about
 
01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
um why this bill is problematic and for
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
those reasons for the reasons that I'm
 
01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
going to go through we oppose this um
 
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
this bill um
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
when the names and pronouns students
 
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
wish to use are
 
01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
respected uh it enhances that student's
 
01:10:35.550 --> 01:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
experience and it cultivates a positive
 
01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:36.830 align:start position:0%
experience and it cultivates a positive
School

01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
School
 
01:10:39.870 --> 01:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
environment um I think in schools let's
 
01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
just remember like what schools are at
 
01:10:45.149 --> 01:10:45.159 align:start position:0%
the end of the day they are places where
 
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
students ought to be able to figure out
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
who they are uh and I think frankly
 
01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
without formalistic and rigid rules from
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
um you know a state government regarding
 
01:10:57.709 --> 01:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
names and pronouns every student is
 
01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
engaged in school every one of us
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
probably when we were in high school
 
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
even younger were engaging in identity
 
01:11:09.149 --> 01:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
exploration we were sometimes
 
01:11:11.669 --> 01:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
communicating that that identity
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
intimate parts and concepts of who we
 
01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
are to friends maybe even a trusted
 
01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:18.790 align:start position:0%
are to friends maybe even a trusted
school

01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
teacher and I think it's so critical to
 
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
understand that that's just what schools
 
01:11:28.669 --> 01:11:28.679 align:start position:0%
are and respecting that
 
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
um that aspect of of one's education and
 
01:11:33.149 --> 01:11:33.159 align:start position:0%
frankly I think this bill would
 
01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
undermine that aspect of the school
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
environment under this bill Public
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
School Employees or contractors will be
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
barred from using a name or pronoun to
 
01:11:43.229 --> 01:11:43.239 align:start position:0%
refer or address a student that doesn't
 
01:11:44.590 --> 01:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
align with that student's birth
 
01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
certificate and the result will be that
 
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
schools will no longer become that space
 
01:11:51.709 --> 01:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
many students need to prepare to have
 
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
important conversations about their
 
01:11:55.629 --> 01:11:55.639 align:start position:0%
identity at home and I think that's
 
01:11:57.629 --> 01:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
going to hinder the ability of these
 
01:11:59.950 --> 01:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
students to safely seek to be identified
 
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
by their preferred names and
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
pronouns that is I think just using the
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
right pronouns is like the bare minimum
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
of human decency right that I think we
 
01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
could provide for these students so
 
01:12:14.189 --> 01:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
stripping that away I can't articulate
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
enough the harm that that creates to uh
 
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
you know a group of students where like
 
01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
let's be real it's already pretty hard
 
01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
right your your time is up the last the
 
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
last point I will make I'm going to
 
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
there's a whole host of legal concerns
 
01:12:31.149 --> 01:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
please read my testimony but I do want
 
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
to just get at the impracticality the
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
derivatives language I don't know what
 
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
that means um also this bill covers just
 
01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
Communications as well it's very
 
01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
expansive and also includes contractors
 
01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
which I think is also problematic for
 
01:12:46.510 --> 01:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
all the reasons that were conveyed in in
 
01:12:48.189 --> 01:12:48.199 align:start position:0%
testimony so I think for all of those
 
01:12:49.790 --> 01:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
reasons uh we would ask that this
 
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:51.760 align:start position:0%

advocate for all of my children from the
 
01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
moment they entered my world I have
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
never felt that they belong to me they
 
01:13:48.189 --> 01:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
are not my possessions I have always
 
01:13:50.590 --> 01:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
called them my little people as I as
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
they are just that their own person I
 
01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
believe that they have the same rights
 
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
as we adults have and Par as parents we
 
01:13:59.709 --> 01:13:59.719 align:start position:0%
are here to see that they are allowed
 
01:14:02.189 --> 01:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
those rights I did not become a parent
 
01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
to control their path and future I am
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
here as their mother only to love them
 
01:14:07.629 --> 01:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
unconditionally and care for them with
 
01:14:10.629 --> 01:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
no bounds my now 17-year-old has been
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
experiencing gender dysphoria along with
 
01:14:14.830 --> 01:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
severe depression over the past few
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
years it has been several years that
 
01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
they have been experiencing the feeling
 
01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
of being lost in their own body but I
 
01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
did not hear of this until their 16th
 
01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
year last year my te was in such a dark
 
01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
place that they tried to take their own
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
life while feeling incredibly isolated
 
01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
and alone in their thoughts today they
 
01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
have the full support of their parents
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
their family and their friends as they
 
01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
begin their own journey to living in a
 
01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
body that feels more like their home in
 
01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
October they asked all of us to begin to
 
01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
use they them pronouns and continue to
 
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
support them in this journey I cannot
 
01:14:45.709 --> 01:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
help but think how they would have felt
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
if they had reached out to someone
 
01:14:49.709 --> 01:14:49.719 align:start position:0%
sooner up until last January they
 
01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
attended public school if my team had
 
01:14:53.709 --> 01:14:53.719 align:start position:0%
chosen to speak to to one of their
 
01:14:55.669 --> 01:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
teachers and ask them to use they them
 
01:14:57.550 --> 01:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
pronouns before they were ready to ask
 
01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
me to use new pronouns I can say with
 
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
confidence that I would have been
 
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
incredibly thankful for the support of
 
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
their teachers being able to share who
 
01:15:07.149 --> 01:15:07.159 align:start position:0%
you are with the world is incredibly
 
01:15:09.390 --> 01:15:09.400 align:start position:0%
important to all human beings feeling
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
accepted and uplifted by others when
 
01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
sharing who we are is one of the
 
01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
healthiest experiences we can have as
 
01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
people having the support accessible in
 
01:15:18.669 --> 01:15:18.679 align:start position:0%
any and every way is essential to
 
01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
allowing all people to thrive in their
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
own lives as a parent I do not feel
 
01:15:24.629 --> 01:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
threatened or G by others supporting my
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
child I am grateful every day that each
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%

01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
have for them and I wish this for all
 
01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
the little people in the granite state
 
01:15:33.550 --> 01:15:33.560 align:start position:0%

01:15:35.229 --> 01:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
school Community what pronouns they wish
 
01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
to use in school will only allow them to

1356 Nami New Hampshire believes that

acceptance and support within one's
 
01:16:36.629 --> 01:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
Community is a key factor of mental
 
01:16:38.709 --> 01:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
wellness and should be a goal across all
 
01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
aspects of everyday life for Youth and
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
Young adults and as such I would ask
 
01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
that you give a lot of weight to the
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
lived experience of the folks who shared
 
01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
before me and the folks who will share
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
after me and the importance of
 
01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
maintaining affirming environments for
 
01:16:53.070 --> 01:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
transgender youth cannot be overstated
 
01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
according to the Trevor Project in 2023
 
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
roughly half of transgender and
 
01:16:58.510 --> 01:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
non-binary young people found their
 
01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:00.159 align:start position:0%
school to be gender affirming and those
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
who did reported lower rates of
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
attempting suicide for transgender
 
01:17:06.189 --> 01:17:06.199 align:start position:0%
non-binary youth specifically respect
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
for their chosen name in pronouns is a
 
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
critical aspect of the support according
 
01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
to a study in the Journal of adolescent
 
01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
Health compared with youth who could not
 
01:17:15.669 --> 01:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
use their chosen name young people who
 
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
could use their name across all areas of
 
01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
their life experienced 71% fewer
 
01:17:22.510 --> 01:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
symptoms of spear depression a 34%
 
01:17:24.629 --> 01:17:24.639 align:start position:0%
decrease in reported thoughts of suicide
 
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
and a 65% decrease in suicidal attempts
 
01:17:30.430 --> 01:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
HB 1356 jeopardizes schools and
 
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
affirming environment for transgender
 
01:17:34.030 --> 01:17:34.040 align:start position:0%

mental health and safety at risk for
 
01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
these reasons we urge the committee to

01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning my name is
 
01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
Sarah Smith uh although I was known as
 
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
Sally for 21 years without any question
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
from anyone I'm a retired public school
 
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
teacher a good portion of our training
 
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
was in developing respect for children's
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
differences I spent many years among
 
01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:21.560 align:start position:0%
other activities supervising children on
 
01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
the playground if a child on the
 
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
playground reported that another child
 
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
had misgendered them I would consider
 
01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
that bullying of the most serious sort
 
01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
if an adult in the school employe had
 
01:18:35.709 --> 01:18:35.719 align:start position:0%
done that I would have considered an
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
abuse of treatment and reported them for
 
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
it for a person in power and all adults
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
in school fall into this category to
 
01:18:46.229 --> 01:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
treat a vulnerable child in that manner
 
01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
is no different from using a racially
 
01:18:52.189 --> 01:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
derogative term no matter your religious
 
01:18:55.229 --> 01:18:55.239 align:start position:0%
beliefs no one would consider that
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
acceptable that is hate speech
 
01:19:00.910 --> 01:19:00.920 align:start position:0%

$260,000 for these reasons I I oppose

this bill as inexpedient to legislate
 
01:19:49.950 --> 01:19:49.960 align:start position:0%

most in serious sense happen to take
 
01:19:55.149 --> 01:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
questions that's all I to say are there
 
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:56.880 align:start position:0%

Futures is here in opposition to house
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
1356 because young people have the best
 
01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
mental health outcomes when they feel
 
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
supported in their communities and
 
01:20:35.470 --> 01:20:35.480 align:start position:0%
schools Hospital 1356 is in direct
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
opposition to this
 
01:20:40.590 --> 01:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
goal um we all envision a New Hampshire
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
in which children feel welcome and
 
01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
supported in their communities um using
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
their gender uh their names and
 
01:20:50.669 --> 01:20:50.679 align:start position:0%
pronounce that they that align with
 
01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
their gender identity is a simple and
 
01:20:56.510 --> 01:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
Safe Way of affirming our children and
 
01:20:58.990 --> 01:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
making them feel safe and
 
01:21:03.149 --> 01:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
welcome um Hospital 1356 would limit a
 
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
Young Person's ability to use those
 
01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
pronouns and names that align with their
 
01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
gender identities without parents WR
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
written permission even in the best
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
families where children are supported
 
01:21:16.030 --> 01:21:16.040 align:start position:0%
and loved um many children feel safe
 
01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:17.800 align:start position:0%
exploring their gender identities in
 
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
schools prior to coming to their
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
parents and in those worst case
 
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
scenarios the very very slim worst case
 
01:21:26.189 --> 01:21:26.199 align:start position:0%
scenarios where children are in
 
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
non-supported families it's even more
 
01:21:29.310 --> 01:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
important for children to be able to
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
explore their gender identities through
 
01:21:34.110 --> 01:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
the use of names and pronouns in schools
 
01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
we know that when young people are not
 
01:21:37.870 --> 01:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
supported in families and face familial
 
01:21:41.790 --> 01:21:41.800 align:start position:0%
rejection they are 18 8.4 times more
 
01:21:43.709 --> 01:21:43.719 align:start position:0%
likely to report having attempted
 
01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
suicide 5.9 times more likely to report
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
high levels of depression uh 3.4 times
 
01:21:52.990 --> 01:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
more likely to use illegal drugs um and
 
01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
other serious consequences when compared
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
to their um other lgbtq plus peers who
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh reported no to low levels of family
 
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
rejection but we know that when children
 
01:22:07.149 --> 01:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
have at least one trusted adult outside
 
01:22:09.790 --> 01:22:09.800 align:start position:0%
of their families um typically a teacher
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
or maybe a coach somebody um who is an
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
adult that they can turn to for support
 
01:22:17.629 --> 01:22:17.639 align:start position:0%
we know that their um mental health is
 
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
on par with their peers and we know that
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
those uh that one trusted person adult
 
01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
is a mitigating factor to uh childhood
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
trauma or an adverse childhood
 
01:22:30.669 --> 01:22:30.679 align:start position:0%
experience um with that being said I
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
would ask this committee to itl this
 
01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:33.960 align:start position:0%

with our 14-year-old transgender
 
01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
daughter Iris having come out um when

the United States Supreme Court
 
01:23:31.470 --> 01:23:31.480 align:start position:0%

is to Target minorities and what that H
 
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
what happens at home when laws like this
 
01:23:50.590 --> 01:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
are proposed in our family we sit down
 
01:23:52.189 --> 01:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
together every single morning before
 
01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
school school um every morning on the
 
01:23:57.550 --> 01:23:57.560 align:start position:0%

01:24:06.669 --> 01:24:06.679 align:start position:0%
share with you some of the questions
 
01:24:07.830 --> 01:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
that have come
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
up uh why do people think iris is too
 
01:24:12.910 --> 01:24:12.920 align:start position:0%
dangerous to use the girls
 
01:24:15.229 --> 01:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
bathroom what do people think Iris will
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
do to them in the
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
bathroom why can't Iris play on the
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
girls team
 
01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.110 align:start position:0%
girls team

anymore
 
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
what do you mean that people think iris
 
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
is not
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
safe why do people think iris is
 
01:24:33.070 --> 01:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
dangerous to other players on sports
 
01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
teams didn't a judge order that iris is
 
01:24:41.950 --> 01:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
female and that iris is iris's
 
01:24:45.070 --> 01:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
name um wait a minute I thought it was
 
01:24:46.830 --> 01:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
not okay to talk about other people's
 
01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:47.750 align:start position:0%
not okay to talk about other people's
private

01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
private
 
01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
parts why do people care about other
 
01:24:52.590 --> 01:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
people's private parts you mean a
 
01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:55.400 align:start position:0%
teacher might have to be talking about
 
01:24:58.709 --> 01:24:58.719 align:start position:0%
iris's private parts and other lgbtq
 
01:25:00.590 --> 01:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
people's private
 
01:25:04.870 --> 01:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
parts and lastly and most importantly I
 
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
thought I had civil rights at
 
01:25:11.390 --> 01:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
school as a parent it has become nearly
 
01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:14.119 align:start position:0%
impossible to feeli these questions
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
while also maintaining a positive
 
01:25:19.950 --> 01:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
attitude and a positive morale in our
 
01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
home and it will become absolutely
 
01:25:25.950 --> 01:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
impossible if this and the other Litany
 
01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
of of laws targeting the lgbtq community
 
01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:32.960 align:start position:0%

01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire please vote no on House Bill
 
01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
1356 I'm not going to repeat my personal
 
01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
story because I shared that with you
 
01:26:41.669 --> 01:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
last week and it's in my written
 
01:26:46.030 --> 01:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm giving you for HB 1356
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
this could mean teachers could use my
 
01:26:49.709 --> 01:26:49.719 align:start position:0%
dad name I would not want to go to
 
01:26:51.550 --> 01:26:51.560 align:start position:0%
school anymore if that happened I would
 
01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:52.719 align:start position:0%
never want to learn learned from an
 
01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
educator who called me by my dead name
 
01:26:57.149 --> 01:26:57.159 align:start position:0%
if any teacher did that I fear students
 
01:26:59.430 --> 01:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
would start to use my dead name again
 
01:27:02.109 --> 01:27:02.119 align:start position:0%
also that would be like torture for me
 
01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:06.280 align:start position:0%
in fact all these prosecuted Pro words
 
01:27:07.709 --> 01:27:07.719 align:start position:0%
in fact all these proposed laws
 
01:27:10.109 --> 01:27:10.119 align:start position:0%
targeting me and the rest of the lgbtq
 
01:27:11.870 --> 01:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
community have been like torture and I
 
01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
wish you would stop I would like it if
 
01:27:16.030 --> 01:27:16.040 align:start position:0%

01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:23.189 align:start position:0%
if from where thank you very

01:28:23.189 --> 01:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um committee
 
01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
members my name is David Trumble and
 
01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
from the town of we I oppose this bill
 
01:28:30.310 --> 01:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
first of all I think the most important
 
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
thing is that when we use somebody's
 
01:28:35.109 --> 01:28:35.119 align:start position:0%
pronouns that they want we are showing
 
01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
them respect and when a school has a
 
01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:41.560 align:start position:0%
policy that follows that same guideline
 
01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
the school is showing respect and when
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
Society has rules that Implement that
 
01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
Society is showing respect and this bill
 
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
would destroy that respect for lgbtq
 
01:28:56.229 --> 01:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
children it is very clear that the
 
01:28:59.229 --> 01:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
policies that you make will affect the
 
01:29:00.750 --> 01:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
mental health and well-being of
 
01:29:02.590 --> 01:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
transgender children you've heard
 
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
statistics I won't read any more for you
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
but is worth noting that 25% of lgbtq
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
students use pronouns that are outside
 
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:12.870 align:start position:0%
students use pronouns that are outside
the

01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:16.629 --> 01:29:16.639 align:start position:0%
binary that would be he she and or they
 
01:29:19.229 --> 01:29:19.239 align:start position:0%
or they them only or Neo pronouns and
 
01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
most children have friends who use
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh gender neutral pronouns so this bill
 
01:29:28.270 --> 01:29:28.280 align:start position:0%
would affect a large number of people
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
not just the general concept of Rights
 
01:29:33.390 --> 01:29:33.400 align:start position:0%
we have to balance rights sure parents
 
01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
have fundamental rights to raise their
 
01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
children but there is not a single
 
01:29:39.109 --> 01:29:39.119 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case that stands for the
 
01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
proposition that parents can use the
 
01:29:44.669 --> 01:29:44.679 align:start position:0%
school as a surveillance tool to find
 
01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
out if their children have different
 
01:29:48.870 --> 01:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
pronouns there is no Supreme Court case
 
01:29:50.189 --> 01:29:50.199 align:start position:0%
that would carry the fundamental right
 
01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
of parents to that extreme whose life
 
01:29:55.149 --> 01:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
are we talking about here the parents
 
01:29:57.669 --> 01:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
life or the child's life in the end the
 
01:29:59.709 --> 01:29:59.719 align:start position:0%
child is the one who goes to school
 
01:30:02.030 --> 01:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
every day who grows up and has a future
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
and we should be looking at the children
 
01:30:06.430 --> 01:30:06.440 align:start position:0%
and their future well-being as The
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
Guiding interest in our state making
 
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
this decision thank you very much thank
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
you very much other questions from the
 
01:30:16.510 --> 01:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much you're
 
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:30.189 align:start position:0%
 
engleberg

01:30:30.189 --> 01:30:30.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Mia Engelbert I live in
 
01:30:35.950 --> 01:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire and I use
 
01:30:37.950 --> 01:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
pronouns as you might have guessed from
 
01:30:41.109 --> 01:30:41.119 align:start position:0%
those pronouns I am a transgender woman
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
and if I if my school outed me to my
 
01:30:49.109 --> 01:30:49.119 align:start position:0%
parents I would have been absolutely
 
01:30:52.149 --> 01:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
horrified I believe that all all my
 
01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
transgender siblings deserve control
 
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
over their own personal stories their
 
01:31:00.189 --> 01:31:00.199 align:start position:0%
their own bodies and anything else that
 
01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
anything else about
 
01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:03.510 align:start position:0%
anything else about
them

01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:31:06.830 --> 01:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
so and if they're outed at the wrong
 
01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
time by the wrong person the results
 
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
could be disastrous not everybody has a
 
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
supportive family not everybody has a
 
01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
supportive peer group not everybody has
 
01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:16.950 align:start position:0%
supportive peer group not everybody has
supportive

01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
supportive
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
teachers they could be bullied harassed
 
01:31:24.149 --> 01:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
um yeah I yeah I simply believe that all
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
my transgender siblings deserve to
 
01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:35.830 align:start position:0%
my transgender siblings deserve to
be

01:31:35.830 --> 01:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
respected they deserve to be addressed
 
01:31:42.149 --> 01:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:44.270 --> 01:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
choose and I don't think I have anything
 
01:31:46.709 --> 01:31:46.719 align:start position:0%
else to add so thank you for letting me

hormones and having healthy body parts

01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
kindergarten
 
01:33:53.950 --> 01:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
actually I have taught kindergarten
 
01:33:57.629 --> 01:33:57.639 align:start position:0%
first grade and 7 through 12 mostly High
 
01:34:01.550 --> 01:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
School um and from where I got many
 
01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
awards for my teaching including New
 
01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire teacher of the year I prided
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
myself on paying attention to my
 
01:34:13.189 --> 01:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
students and um helping them when they
 
01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
needed not grooming them just listening
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
to them so I have a story when I was at
 
01:34:22.109 --> 01:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
a theater Festival after I retire ired I
 
01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
was one of the adjudicators and I was
 
01:34:25.070 --> 01:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
handing out the
 
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
prizes we had a person from another
 
01:34:31.390 --> 01:34:31.400 align:start position:0%
school whose parents had vehemently
 
01:34:34.709 --> 01:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
insisted that in the program their dead
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
name which is what a transperson calls
 
01:34:40.189 --> 01:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
the name they no longer use be put in
 
01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
the program this
 
01:34:46.030 --> 01:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
child received the highest award for
 
01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
acting and it was my privilege to give
 
01:34:49.870 --> 01:34:49.880 align:start position:0%
it to
 
01:34:54.030 --> 01:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
them and when I called them up I called
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
them by their true name not their dead
 
01:35:00.310 --> 01:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
name and when they thanked me they threw
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
their arms around me and said thank you
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
so much and I said you deserve it you
 
01:35:08.510 --> 01:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
were the best actor here and they said
 
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
no you used my
 
01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:15.119 align:start position:0%

congratulations on being teacher of the
 
01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
year it's a tough tough thing to make so
 
01:35:33.070 --> 01:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
we have one that usually is on our
 
01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
committee as well I know
 
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
I'm so um my question is uh what do you
 
01:35:44.189 --> 01:35:44.199 align:start position:0%
think it it does to a student in
 
01:35:47.229 --> 01:35:47.239 align:start position:0%
school um to be misgender what do you
 
01:35:49.629 --> 01:35:49.639 align:start position:0%
what do you see as some of the side
 
01:35:53.709 --> 01:35:53.719 align:start position:0%
effects that happen I I just I can't
 
01:35:57.669 --> 01:35:57.679 align:start position:0%
imagine um I have transgender friends
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
I've met transgender children the kids
 
01:36:03.310 --> 01:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
that I know that grew up that are
 
01:36:06.910 --> 01:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
transgender were not out in school um I
 
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
stopped teaching in public school a few
 
01:36:12.270 --> 01:36:12.280 align:start position:0%
years ago so but I cannot imagine
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
because I've seen bullying I was very
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
often okay I was the theater teacher um
 
01:36:21.790 --> 01:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
so I was very often I also taught
 
01:36:25.470 --> 01:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
algebra um I was very often the teacher
 
01:36:29.709 --> 01:36:29.719 align:start position:0%
that kids would come to to say Mrs
 
01:36:32.590 --> 01:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
Brennan I'm gay and I'm trying to figure
 
01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
out how to tell my parents and I would
 
01:36:38.109 --> 01:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
listen I didn't feel like I groomed or
 
01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
anything like that um but I do know what
 
01:36:45.990 --> 01:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
bullying does and I remember one kid um
 
01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:48.679 align:start position:0%
I don't know if he was gay but he was
 
01:36:51.669 --> 01:36:51.679 align:start position:0%
being bullied by another kid they were
 
01:36:52.910 --> 01:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
using the
 
01:36:56.910 --> 01:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
FW and um I spoke to that kid he was
 
01:36:59.590 --> 01:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
very belligerent um he wasn't one of my
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
students I called his mother and his
 
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
mother came in and she said in our house
 
01:37:09.149 --> 01:37:09.159 align:start position:0%
in our
 
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
church there are no gays my son is free
 
01:37:18.910 --> 01:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
to use that word against those kids in
 
01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
the school of course then we had to get
 
01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:23.679 align:start position:0%
other people involved and say yeah do it
 
01:37:26.470 --> 01:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
at home you can't do it here but um I
 
01:37:29.229 --> 01:37:29.239 align:start position:0%
just know how hurt kids are when they're
 
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
bullied and to
 
01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:35.159 align:start position:0%

of the committee for considering my
 
01:51:29.149 --> 01:51:29.159 align:start position:0%
testimony with the intent to repeal the
 
01:51:32.350 --> 01:51:32.360 align:start position:0%
law known as the right to freedom from
 
01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
discrimination in public workplaces and
 
01:51:37.470 --> 01:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
in education so thank you so much for
 
01:51:39.629 --> 01:51:39.639 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony I am state
 
01:51:42.030 --> 01:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
representative Peter patrino from
 
01:51:46.270 --> 01:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 43 the town of Milford so this
 
01:51:48.870 --> 01:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
is a law that frankly should not be on
 
01:51:50.830 --> 01:51:50.840 align:start position:0%
the books
 
01:51:53.470 --> 01:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
I do believe that it is an insult to
 
01:51:56.030 --> 01:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
public school teachers and it impunes
 
01:51:56.040 --> 01:51:57.430 align:start position:0%
public school teachers and it impunes
their

01:51:57.430 --> 01:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:51:59.550 --> 01:51:59.560 align:start position:0%
professionalism now I was a high school
 
01:52:01.790 --> 01:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
social studies teacher for 40 years both
 
01:52:03.950 --> 01:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
in private and public schools and I
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
served as department head and I chaired
 
01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
my District's K through2 social studies
 
01:52:11.990 --> 01:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
curriculum revision and in all that time
 
01:52:14.430 --> 01:52:14.440 align:start position:0%
I never ever heard of critical race
 
01:52:17.390 --> 01:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
Theory are divisive Concepts so I had to
 
01:52:20.069 --> 01:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
do a little digging and I was surprised
 
01:52:21.950 --> 01:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
to learn that this was not a New
 
01:52:25.790 --> 01:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire issue but rather a national
 
01:52:28.149 --> 01:52:28.159 align:start position:0%
effort on the part of certain political
 
01:52:29.830 --> 01:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
action groups who believe that public
 
01:52:32.470 --> 01:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
schools are indoctrinating children with
 
01:52:35.390 --> 01:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
certain beliefs about race and gender
 
01:52:37.870 --> 01:52:37.880 align:start position:0%
and other so-called divisive
 
01:52:40.589 --> 01:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
Concepts as I see it the law has little
 
01:52:42.030 --> 01:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
to do with real
 
01:52:44.069 --> 01:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
discrimination but everything to do with
 
01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
silencing teachers voices on topics that
 
01:52:49.109 --> 01:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
some just don't want discussed now the
 
01:52:54.790 --> 01:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
bottom line is this racism is real it is
 
01:52:57.830 --> 01:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
ugly and it's Insidious and it has no
 
01:53:01.629 --> 01:53:01.639 align:start position:0%
place in New Hampshire or anywhere in
 
01:53:04.750 --> 01:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
America now we know that the only way to
 
01:53:10.350 --> 01:53:10.360 align:start position:0%
cure a disease is to confront it racism
 
01:53:11.950 --> 01:53:11.960 align:start position:0%
in all forms of hatred and
 
01:53:14.990 --> 01:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
discrimination is a social disease and
 
01:53:16.510 --> 01:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
the only way to stamp it out just like
 
01:53:20.189 --> 01:53:20.199 align:start position:0%
any disease is to confront it headon and
 
01:53:22.709 --> 01:53:22.719 align:start position:0%
you can't do that if you cannot talk
 
01:53:22.719 --> 01:53:23.589 align:start position:0%
you can't do that if you cannot talk
about

01:53:23.589 --> 01:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:53:26.750 --> 01:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
it now look it's true that the law does
 
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
allow for the teaching of History
 
01:53:31.629 --> 01:53:31.639 align:start position:0%
slavery the Civil War the civil rights
 
01:53:34.629 --> 01:53:34.639 align:start position:0%
movement and so forth it can be taught
 
01:53:37.109 --> 01:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
but teaching history is more than just
 
01:53:40.709 --> 01:53:40.719 align:start position:0%
knowing about the who the what the where
 
01:53:45.030 --> 01:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
and the when it is also understanding
 
01:53:48.990 --> 01:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
the why and the how students need to
 
01:53:52.709 --> 01:53:52.719 align:start position:0%
know how to conduct unbiased research
 
01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
they need to be able to synthesize and
 
01:53:57.870 --> 01:53:57.880 align:start position:0%
evaluate analyze the information that
 
01:54:00.109 --> 01:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
they've gathered in order to form
 
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
well-reasoned evaluations about the
 
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
world they live in and this cannot
 
01:54:06.390 --> 01:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
happen without honest and open
 
01:54:08.069 --> 01:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
discussions when
 
01:54:12.350 --> 01:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
learning about these topics now it's one
 
01:54:14.550 --> 01:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
thing to tell students that the Civil
 
01:54:16.709 --> 01:54:16.719 align:start position:0%
Rights Movement happened in the
 
01:54:19.830 --> 01:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
1960s it's another thing to freely
 
01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
discuss why it occurred in the first
 
01:54:25.069 --> 01:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
place so when students are watching a
 
01:54:26.950 --> 01:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
video on the civil rights movement and
 
01:54:28.830 --> 01:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
they see the police dogs attacking and
 
01:54:30.149 --> 01:54:30.159 align:start position:0%
the fire hoses spraying
 
01:54:31.950 --> 01:54:31.960 align:start position:0%
African-Americans who are protesting for
 
01:54:35.310 --> 01:54:35.320 align:start position:0%
equal rights and a student asks why were
 
01:54:38.229 --> 01:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
so many white people racist back then
 
01:54:41.589 --> 01:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
does racism like this still occur today
 
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
can an honest discussion ensue or does
 
01:54:47.310 --> 01:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
the teacher have to say the law doesn't
 
01:54:50.270 --> 01:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
allow us to attribute motivation for
 
01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:52.109 align:start position:0%
allow us to attribute motivation for
such

01:54:52.109 --> 01:54:52.119 align:start position:0%
such
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
Behavior now this is where the
 
01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:56.639 align:start position:0%
disconnect is this is why teachers are
 
01:54:59.189 --> 01:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
uncertain as to what they can and cannot
 
01:55:02.069 --> 01:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
say in the classroom and more so there
 
01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
is fear of Retribution should they allow
 
01:55:07.350 --> 01:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
such conversations to take
 
01:55:09.870 --> 01:55:09.880 align:start position:0%
place let's take a look specifically at
 
01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:10.589 align:start position:0%
place let's take a look specifically at
the

01:55:10.589 --> 01:55:10.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:55:14.510 --> 01:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
law I fully agree with many of the Law's
 
01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:15.550 align:start position:0%
law I fully agree with many of the Law's
main

01:55:15.550 --> 01:55:15.560 align:start position:0%
main
 
01:55:19.109 --> 01:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
principles but where it teach is really
 
01:55:21.830 --> 01:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
telling students that they were Superior
 
01:55:24.189 --> 01:55:24.199 align:start position:0%
to others
 
01:55:27.870 --> 01:55:27.880 align:start position:0%
or that others should be discriminated
 
01:55:31.229 --> 01:55:31.239 align:start position:0%
against or that they should be treated
 
01:55:33.510 --> 01:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
less than equal those are three
 
01:55:35.830 --> 01:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
Provisions in the law well such
 
01:55:37.550 --> 01:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
discriminatory classroom instruction
 
01:55:39.550 --> 01:55:39.560 align:start position:0%
really happening in schools that this
 
01:55:41.510 --> 01:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
law was needed to
 
01:55:44.589 --> 01:55:44.599 align:start position:0%
prohibit of course not but those
 
01:55:46.669 --> 01:55:46.679 align:start position:0%
Provisions make the law sound perfectly
 
01:55:50.430 --> 01:55:50.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable and anti-discriminatory
 
01:55:54.669 --> 01:55:54.679 align:start position:0%
the real concern is the one provision
 
01:55:56.669 --> 01:55:56.679 align:start position:0%
which prohibits
 
01:56:00.990 --> 01:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
identifying an individual or a group as
 
01:56:04.510 --> 01:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
inherently racist sexist or oppressive
 
01:56:06.550 --> 01:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
whether consciously or unconsciously by
 
01:56:09.430 --> 01:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
virtue of their various protected
 
01:56:11.390 --> 01:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
classifications now within that list of
 
01:56:13.069 --> 01:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
all those classifications I bring to
 
01:56:14.950 --> 01:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
your attention the word
 
01:56:18.310 --> 01:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
creed by virtue of one's
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
Creed a Creed is a set of beliefs or
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
aims which guide someone's actions and
 
01:56:28.069 --> 01:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is that there are
 
01:56:31.790 --> 01:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
beliefs in this country which are racist
 
01:56:34.229 --> 01:56:34.239 align:start position:0%
oppressive to women discriminatory to
 
01:56:38.189 --> 01:56:38.199 align:start position:0%
the lgbtq plus Community anti-semitic
 
01:56:41.550 --> 01:56:41.560 align:start position:0%
islamophobic and more Creeds are not
 
01:56:43.790 --> 01:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
just formal statements of beliefs but
 
01:56:45.870 --> 01:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
they're also manifested by words and
 
01:56:48.790 --> 01:56:48.800 align:start position:0%
actions such as by those of the numerous
 
01:56:49.990 --> 01:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
hate groups
 
01:56:51.709 --> 01:56:51.719 align:start position:0%
identified by the State's Attorney
 
01:56:54.589 --> 01:56:54.599 align:start position:0%
General's office does this law give
 
01:56:57.109 --> 01:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
cover to those hate groups or can
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
classro discussions identify them for
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
what they
 
01:57:03.709 --> 01:57:03.719 align:start position:0%
are well not everyone who agrees with
 
01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
this law is racist it is safe to say
 
01:57:08.069 --> 01:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
that every racist supports this
 
01:57:10.430 --> 01:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
law some will say that the teachers are
 
01:57:12.149 --> 01:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
wrong that they can still Teach as they
 
01:57:14.390 --> 01:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
always have and others will say the
 
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
racists are wrong that this laar is
 
01:57:17.950 --> 01:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
meant to prevent
 
01:57:21.470 --> 01:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
discrimination but what as wrong as this
 
01:57:25.310 --> 01:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
law it's a detriment to meaningful
 
01:57:28.229 --> 01:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
education and it must be overturned so
 
01:57:31.270 --> 01:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
we ask for your consideration to
 
01:57:34.069 --> 01:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
recommend or to pass thank you so much
 
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take any questions
 
01:57:37.030 --> 01:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative uh
 
01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
representative cordello thank you Mr
 
01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:57:43.550 --> 01:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
question my concern as I read this um
 
01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
very short law which seeks to repeal uh
 
01:57:49.669 --> 01:57:49.679 align:start position:0%
what is on the books is um I won't read
 
01:57:50.990 --> 01:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
every word it's sort of in the middle
 
01:57:52.709 --> 01:57:52.719 align:start position:0%
there starting at line
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
four um nothing in title 15 shall be
 
01:58:01.109 --> 01:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
construed as barring any School employee
 
01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
kind of goes on from engaging in any
 
01:58:07.790 --> 01:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
form of instruction this is the phrase
 
01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:10.719 align:start position:0%
that concerns me a bit any form of
 
01:58:12.470 --> 01:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
instruction it seems to me that the
 
01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
current law provides what I think a lot
 
01:58:17.870 --> 01:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
of people would identify as guard rails
 
01:58:20.030 --> 01:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
because um
 
01:58:22.990 --> 01:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
I I won't go into details of anecdotal
 
01:58:24.750 --> 01:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
evidence but a number of stories that
 
01:58:27.109 --> 01:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
I've read about children come home they
 
01:58:28.510 --> 01:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
they go to their parents they're very
 
01:58:31.149 --> 01:58:31.159 align:start position:0%
upset because they feel like they they
 
01:58:33.470 --> 01:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
um after a class that they feel that
 
01:58:36.229 --> 01:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
they're oh Mommy am I am I a racist and
 
01:58:39.310 --> 01:58:39.320 align:start position:0%
I um you know oppressor um things like
 
01:58:42.870 --> 01:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
this uh so if a teacher employs a form
 
01:58:44.950 --> 01:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
of instruction that makes a child feel
 
01:58:48.550 --> 01:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
that way um is that okay cuz you're
 
01:58:51.069 --> 01:58:51.079 align:start position:0%
saying any form of instruction and I'm
 
01:58:54.229 --> 01:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
concerned about that lack of guide rails
 
01:58:57.990 --> 01:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
guard rails as I had mentioned
 
01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
earlier there are a number of Provisions
 
01:59:02.270 --> 01:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
in this law that sound perfectly
 
01:59:05.470 --> 01:59:05.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable you have to ask
 
01:59:08.589 --> 01:59:08.599 align:start position:0%
yourself okay were teachers really
 
01:59:10.589 --> 01:59:10.599 align:start position:0%
instructing students that they are
 
01:59:13.270 --> 01:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
superior to others I don't know of any
 
01:59:14.669 --> 01:59:14.679 align:start position:0%
classroom teacher that has ever done
 
01:59:17.830 --> 01:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
that or for that matter that they should
 
01:59:20.030 --> 01:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
discriminate against and this is
 
01:59:21.990 --> 01:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
actually in the law okay that you're not
 
01:59:23.870 --> 01:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to go and teach that somebody
 
01:59:26.069 --> 01:59:26.079 align:start position:0%
should be discriminated against or that
 
01:59:28.950 --> 01:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
somebody should be treated less than
 
01:59:33.109 --> 01:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
equal the only thing that's in this law
 
01:59:35.629 --> 01:59:35.639 align:start position:0%
that I and many disagree with is the
 
01:59:37.830 --> 01:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
provision that says that we can't
 
01:59:40.790 --> 01:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
address the issue if whether or not
 
01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
certain individuals and groups are
 
01:59:46.589 --> 01:59:46.599 align:start position:0%
inherently racist and guess what there
 
01:59:49.550 --> 01:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
are individuals in groups who who are
 
01:59:52.669 --> 01:59:52.679 align:start position:0%
inherently racist we see it all the time
 
01:59:54.669 --> 01:59:54.679 align:start position:0%
many of our colleagues have received
 
01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
emails and letters from racists who have
 
02:00:00.069 --> 02:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
called us awful names because of our
 
02:00:02.550 --> 02:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
position regarding equality for all
 
02:00:05.189 --> 02:00:05.199 align:start position:0%
people I don't know of any public school
 
02:00:07.589 --> 02:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
teacher who has ever ever instructed
 
02:00:11.750 --> 02:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
their students to be discriminatory or
 
02:00:14.430 --> 02:00:14.440 align:start position:0%
racist thank you are there further
 
02:00:17.470 --> 02:00:17.480 align:start position:0%
questions representative uh Damon thank
 
02:00:19.350 --> 02:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for bringing this
 
02:00:23.069 --> 02:00:23.079 align:start position:0%
spill forward and taking my question um
 
02:00:24.950 --> 02:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
and I guess I should just clarify you
 
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
are not currently teaching is that right
 
02:00:29.229 --> 02:00:29.239 align:start position:0%
I'm retired after 40 years and that's
 
02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
what afforded me the opportunity to R
 
02:00:32.510 --> 02:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
the state representative thank you for
 
02:00:36.430 --> 02:00:36.440 align:start position:0%
your service so my question is if you
 
02:00:37.870 --> 02:00:37.880 align:start position:0%
were teaching
 
02:00:42.189 --> 02:00:42.199 align:start position:0%
today would you feel a need to teach
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
differently than the way that you did
 
02:00:47.030 --> 02:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
before you reti absolutely and could you
 
02:00:49.830 --> 02:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
give us a couple of examples please well
 
02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
again who what where when the basic
 
02:00:56.270 --> 02:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
facts can be taught but when you get to
 
02:00:59.109 --> 02:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
the why and the how if you know Bloom's
 
02:01:03.709 --> 02:01:03.719 align:start position:0%
taxonomy you go from the basic knowledge
 
02:01:06.030 --> 02:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
and you have to work yourself up to a
 
02:01:08.430 --> 02:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
place where you can begin to have honest
 
02:01:10.390 --> 02:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
and open discussions particularly on the
 
02:01:11.830 --> 02:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
high school level where I taught for
 
02:01:15.470 --> 02:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
many for many many years uh it is really
 
02:01:18.149 --> 02:01:18.159 align:start position:0%
about uh students being able to Grapple
 
02:01:20.830 --> 02:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
with all kinds of information and to
 
02:01:25.709 --> 02:01:25.719 align:start position:0%
synthesize it analyze it and then form
 
02:01:28.990 --> 02:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
independent thinking there's a real big
 
02:01:32.510 --> 02:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
difference between education and
 
02:01:35.589 --> 02:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
indoctrination it's a fine line but good
 
02:01:38.589 --> 02:01:38.599 align:start position:0%
teaching is about education not
 
02:01:40.550 --> 02:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
indoctrination there's a big difference
 
02:01:43.790 --> 02:01:43.800 align:start position:0%
between teaching and preaching it's a
 
02:01:46.510 --> 02:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
fine line but it can only happen when
 
02:01:49.270 --> 02:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
you go up to taxonomy and you actually
 
02:01:53.830 --> 02:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
start to have serious critical thinking
 
02:01:56.990 --> 02:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
issues and so to be honest this law
 
02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
prevents that kind of discussion can we
 
02:02:02.189 --> 02:02:02.199 align:start position:0%
actually talk about why racism has
 
02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
occurred or how we deal with it right
 
02:02:08.510 --> 02:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
now guess what folks racism is real it's
 
02:02:10.470 --> 02:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
real we need to be able to talk about it
 
02:02:12.189 --> 02:02:12.199 align:start position:0%
and honestly I don't think we can
 
02:02:13.470 --> 02:02:13.480 align:start position:0%
because I'm always looking over my
 
02:02:14.830 --> 02:02:14.840 align:start position:0%
shoulder to wonder whether or not
 
02:02:16.589 --> 02:02:16.599 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to misinterpret what's
 
02:02:19.629 --> 02:02:19.639 align:start position:0%
going on in the classroom so
 
02:02:21.870 --> 02:02:21.880 align:start position:0%
thank you represent
 
02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:02:26.229 --> 02:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um you presented
 
02:02:28.750 --> 02:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
some analysis a fair bit of which I tend
 
02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
to agree with I think there like you I
 
02:02:32.629 --> 02:02:32.639 align:start position:0%
said I think there's good Provisions in
 
02:02:35.669 --> 02:02:35.679 align:start position:0%
the existing uh in the existing law I
 
02:02:36.629 --> 02:02:36.639 align:start position:0%
think there's some areas that are
 
02:02:38.589 --> 02:02:38.599 align:start position:0%
imperfect you really identified the
 
02:02:42.669 --> 02:02:42.679 align:start position:0%
Creed portion as being a major problem
 
02:02:46.270 --> 02:02:46.280 align:start position:0%
um I kind of tend to agree with that um
 
02:02:48.229 --> 02:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
however my question to you then is is
 
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
why did you bring a bill to propeal the
 
02:02:53.669 --> 02:02:53.679 align:start position:0%
entire law instead of narrowly tailoring
 
02:02:56.229 --> 02:02:56.239 align:start position:0%
it to that Creed provision well because
 
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
I think that uh three of the four
 
02:02:59.830 --> 02:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
Provisions in the law really are
 
02:03:01.950 --> 02:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and it's an insult you know
 
02:03:03.030 --> 02:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I've learned
 
02:03:05.910 --> 02:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
since being here is if you want um a
 
02:03:08.550 --> 02:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
chance for a bill to pass you have to
 
02:03:10.910 --> 02:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
give it a very nice sounding title so
 
02:03:14.069 --> 02:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
that um it sounds reasonable and then
 
02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
you have to take your real intent and
 
02:03:18.589 --> 02:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
you have to bury it within a whole bunch
 
02:03:21.430 --> 02:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
of stuff that sounds very reasonable so
 
02:03:23.950 --> 02:03:23.960 align:start position:0%
when you read this law it sounds pretty
 
02:03:26.870 --> 02:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable you know we should not be
 
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
instructing students that they are
 
02:03:31.589 --> 02:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
superior to others we should not be
 
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
instructing students that they should
 
02:03:35.669 --> 02:03:35.679 align:start position:0%
discriminate against others we should
 
02:03:38.430 --> 02:03:38.440 align:start position:0%
not be instructing students that that
 
02:03:40.470 --> 02:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
they should treat others less than equal
 
02:03:42.589 --> 02:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
really seriously do those three
 
02:03:45.549 --> 02:03:45.559 align:start position:0%
Provisions need to be in this law
 
02:03:47.470 --> 02:03:47.480 align:start position:0%
because teachers aren't teaching
 
02:03:50.470 --> 02:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
students that but you put it in the law
 
02:03:52.709 --> 02:03:52.719 align:start position:0%
and it sounds really nice it sounds
 
02:03:55.229 --> 02:03:55.239 align:start position:0%
anti-discriminatory but wait a second
 
02:03:57.109 --> 02:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
let's look at that other provision
 
02:03:59.709 --> 02:03:59.719 align:start position:0%
that's the Crux of it that's really what
 
02:04:02.430 --> 02:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
we want we don't want teachers to talk
 
02:04:05.149 --> 02:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
about issues regarding race and gender
 
02:04:07.510 --> 02:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
in the classroom we cannot call out
 
02:04:10.870 --> 02:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
somebody who is inherently racist or
 
02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
groups and you just go up to the
 
02:04:14.310 --> 02:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and there's a
 
02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
whole list of hate groups that we can't
 
02:04:19.629 --> 02:04:19.639 align:start position:0%
identify and so when I brought up the
 
02:04:22.030 --> 02:04:22.040 align:start position:0%
example of the student who asks the
 
02:04:25.310 --> 02:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
teacher um are are some people racist
 
02:04:28.149 --> 02:04:28.159 align:start position:0%
today oh I'm I'm sorry U I guess you'll
 
02:04:29.870 --> 02:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
have to infer that on your own because
 
02:04:31.390 --> 02:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
we really can't talk about that we're
 
02:04:33.750 --> 02:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
not allowed to attribute motivation to
 
02:04:35.669 --> 02:04:35.679 align:start position:0%
other people's behaviors we we don't
 
02:04:37.109 --> 02:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
really know if they're racist they're
 
02:04:39.669 --> 02:04:39.679 align:start position:0%
acting this way but we we can't talk
 
02:04:42.790 --> 02:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
about it so again very very quickly most
 
02:04:44.229 --> 02:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
of the provisions which sound really
 
02:04:45.950 --> 02:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
good that you and I agree with aren't
 
02:04:47.470 --> 02:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
even necessary to begin with because
 
02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
those things aren't happen happening but
 
02:04:51.189 --> 02:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
the one thing that you and I do agree
 
02:04:54.830 --> 02:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
with that's going to go one followup if
 
02:04:56.629 --> 02:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
I may just a follow up because I think
 
02:04:58.310 --> 02:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
you clarified that the other the other
 
02:05:00.589 --> 02:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
things are are issues the idea that
 
02:05:01.750 --> 02:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
they're not necessary because isn't
 
02:05:03.709 --> 02:05:03.719 align:start position:0%
happening but if if you're familiar with
 
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
it um can you talk to the um the
 
02:05:09.470 --> 02:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
teaching of the concept of privilege
 
02:05:12.149 --> 02:05:12.159 align:start position:0%
based on things such as race gender or
 
02:05:14.510 --> 02:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
religion and how that concept is
 
02:05:16.629 --> 02:05:16.639 align:start position:0%
actually different from teaching any
 
02:05:19.350 --> 02:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
sort of superiority or inferiority
 
02:05:21.149 --> 02:05:21.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I do understand uh your
 
02:05:23.310 --> 02:05:23.320 align:start position:0%
question please re re restate that or I
 
02:05:25.310 --> 02:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
didn't hear everything you said uh well
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
if if you are familiar with the concept
 
02:05:29.149 --> 02:05:29.159 align:start position:0%
of privilege that is taught in schools
 
02:05:30.709 --> 02:05:30.719 align:start position:0%
can you explain how the concept of
 
02:05:33.030 --> 02:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
privilege is not is a concept that is
 
02:05:35.310 --> 02:05:35.320 align:start position:0%
not fundamentally similar to the concept
 
02:05:36.910 --> 02:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
of Supremacy or
 
02:05:39.189 --> 02:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
inferiority well I think with any uh
 
02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
topic whether it's a privilege or
 
02:05:44.750 --> 02:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
superiority uh honest open discussion a
 
02:05:48.030 --> 02:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
free exchange of ideas um because one
 
02:05:51.270 --> 02:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
person's a concept a definition uh maybe
 
02:05:53.870 --> 02:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
different from somebody else's but again
 
02:05:55.390 --> 02:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
that's the whole difference between
 
02:05:57.510 --> 02:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
teaching and preaching when you when you
 
02:05:59.069 --> 02:05:59.079 align:start position:0%
put something on the table and you have
 
02:06:01.149 --> 02:06:01.159 align:start position:0%
an honest open discussion you can have a
 
02:06:03.910 --> 02:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
free-for-all of ideas you don't want to
 
02:06:07.229 --> 02:06:07.239 align:start position:0%
define something okay but you want to be
 
02:06:10.149 --> 02:06:10.159 align:start position:0%
able to offer different perspectives and
 
02:06:13.750 --> 02:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
then have students um take that in and
 
02:06:16.109 --> 02:06:16.119 align:start position:0%
make their own opinions I mean we here
 
02:06:18.189 --> 02:06:18.199 align:start position:0%
we are um all of us sitting around this
 
02:06:20.430 --> 02:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
table with different points of view and
 
02:06:22.189 --> 02:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
the point of view that we have comes
 
02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
from a place of reading reflecting
 
02:06:29.350 --> 02:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
thinking conversing with one another
 
02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
rather than just be close-minded into
 
02:06:34.069 --> 02:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
our own little world we try to open up
 
02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
discussion and be honest with one
 
02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
another and that's how you have
 
02:06:41.549 --> 02:06:41.559 align:start position:0%
education the other way is to tell
 
02:06:44.069 --> 02:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
people that's indoctrinating I'm going
 
02:06:46.629 --> 02:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
to tell you what is right and wrong this
 
02:06:49.589 --> 02:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
is what is this is what is isn't that's
 
02:06:52.030 --> 02:06:52.040 align:start position:0%
indoctrination but when you have open
 
02:06:54.830 --> 02:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
discussion and a free exchange of ideas
 
02:06:56.750 --> 02:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
and people are free to have their own
 
02:06:59.310 --> 02:06:59.320 align:start position:0%
thoughts now we're talking education as
 
02:07:01.069 --> 02:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:08.910 --> 02:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
leus I'm going to ask
 
02:07:12.830 --> 02:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
you what you think of a few things that
 
02:07:15.069 --> 02:07:15.079 align:start position:0%
I and friends of mine actually
 
02:07:17.189 --> 02:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
experienced I had a
 
02:07:21.229 --> 02:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
friend she very blonde lady married to a
 
02:07:26.149 --> 02:07:26.159 align:start position:0%
very black man six kids all different
 
02:07:26.159 --> 02:07:27.790 align:start position:0%
very black man six kids all different
colors

02:07:27.790 --> 02:07:27.800 align:start position:0%
colors
 
02:07:31.229 --> 02:07:31.239 align:start position:0%
the palest one of the kids came home
 
02:07:32.629 --> 02:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
from school I was there when this
 
02:07:36.030 --> 02:07:36.040 align:start position:0%
happened came home from school in tears
 
02:07:39.310 --> 02:07:39.320 align:start position:0%
because she was a racist because she was
 
02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
white and her teacher said all white
 
02:07:45.109 --> 02:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
people are racist and she was very upset
 
02:07:46.629 --> 02:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
because did that mean she didn't love
 
02:07:49.470 --> 02:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
her brothers and sisters or her father
 
02:07:51.870 --> 02:07:51.880 align:start position:0%
just because she was paler than her
 
02:07:54.549 --> 02:07:54.559 align:start position:0%
siblings she was very upset by that and
 
02:07:56.270 --> 02:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
a young boy came
 
02:07:58.910 --> 02:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
home very unhappy because his best
 
02:08:01.589 --> 02:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
friend was a girl and he was told that
 
02:08:03.549 --> 02:08:03.559 align:start position:0%
all men were
 
02:08:05.910 --> 02:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
oppressors and he was in tears I don't
 
02:08:08.189 --> 02:08:08.199 align:start position:0%
want to hurt my best friend she's my
 
02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
best friend but she's a girl and they
 
02:08:12.109 --> 02:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
said that all all boys are oppressors
 
02:08:14.830 --> 02:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
and that means I'm going to hurt her so
 
02:08:17.350 --> 02:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
are those things and those happened
 
02:08:20.229 --> 02:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
before this law was past are those
 
02:08:22.270 --> 02:08:22.280 align:start position:0%
things things that should have been
 
02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
being taught and that maybe this law
 
02:08:28.030 --> 02:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
might have curtailed well what I would
 
02:08:29.629 --> 02:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
say is that there's something wrong with
 
02:08:31.069 --> 02:08:31.079 align:start position:0%
that teacher that's not that's an
 
02:08:32.830 --> 02:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
individual who should not be in the
 
02:08:36.149 --> 02:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
classroom and so absolutely but I think
 
02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
you can look at every single profession
 
02:08:41.470 --> 02:08:41.480 align:start position:0%
whether they're police offices whether
 
02:08:43.950 --> 02:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
they're Catholic priests whether they're
 
02:08:46.350 --> 02:08:46.360 align:start position:0%
elected officials where you will find
 
02:08:49.990 --> 02:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
individuals who violate the public trust
 
02:08:52.990 --> 02:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
and in each of those instances we deal
 
02:08:56.750 --> 02:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
with the individual who has perpetrated
 
02:08:59.910 --> 02:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
um uh the situation and we deal with it
 
02:09:02.990 --> 02:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
accordingly and so
 
02:09:04.990 --> 02:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah so there are some people who
 
02:09:06.830 --> 02:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
should not be in the classroom but we
 
02:09:08.950 --> 02:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
don't paint everyone with the same brush
 
02:09:10.350 --> 02:09:10.360 align:start position:0%
and one of the things I find most
 
02:09:12.910 --> 02:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
offensive as a former educator and now
 
02:09:14.709 --> 02:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
being a legislator and seeing some of
 
02:09:16.589 --> 02:09:16.599 align:start position:0%
the bills that are coming forth it's
 
02:09:18.069 --> 02:09:18.079 align:start position:0%
like we're painting all Educators with
 
02:09:20.350 --> 02:09:20.360 align:start position:0%
the same brush we want to use that
 
02:09:23.990 --> 02:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
example to go and say look at all these
 
02:09:25.709 --> 02:09:25.719 align:start position:0%
teachers and look what's going on in the
 
02:09:28.990 --> 02:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
schools and that's not true we have
 
02:09:30.830 --> 02:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
quality police officers who should not
 
02:09:32.709 --> 02:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
be malign because of the inactions of
 
02:09:35.470 --> 02:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
others we have very good priests we have
 
02:09:38.229 --> 02:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
excellent legislators and we should not
 
02:09:41.189 --> 02:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
be judging all because of the misdeeds
 
02:09:43.950 --> 02:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
of the few if I was the administrator
 
02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
and that teacher was in my school I
 
02:09:47.950 --> 02:09:47.960 align:start position:0%
would see to it that we'd be taking
 
02:09:49.470 --> 02:09:49.480 align:start position:0%
action against that
 
02:09:53.750 --> 02:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
person thank you very much we have 10
 
02:09:55.750 --> 02:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
cards up here and we're running out of
 
02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:57.599 align:start position:0%
time I'm already going to have to nail
 
02:09:59.910 --> 02:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
down the those tesy to two minutes we'll
 
02:10:01.589 --> 02:10:01.599 align:start position:0%
have to go less is this an imperative
 
02:10:05.310 --> 02:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:09.109 --> 02:10:09.119 align:start position:0%
for is it relevant to the
 
02:10:13.470 --> 02:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:16.430 --> 02:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you for taking my question
 
02:10:19.350 --> 02:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
recently for um
 
02:10:21.149 --> 02:10:21.159 align:start position:0%
all of us have discussed there was a
 
02:10:23.189 --> 02:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
politician who was asked a question
 
02:10:26.390 --> 02:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
about the cause of the Civil War and the
 
02:10:28.669 --> 02:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
answer was not satisfactory to all
 
02:10:31.750 --> 02:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
people in the community each group for a
 
02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:32.790 align:start position:0%
people in the community each group for a
different

02:10:32.790 --> 02:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
reason when I heard it as someone who
 
02:10:36.830 --> 02:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
grew up in
 
02:10:39.510 --> 02:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
Louisiana a white
 
02:10:43.790 --> 02:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
person and was taught that the Civil War
 
02:10:45.950 --> 02:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
began at a point and it was a question
 
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
of states rights to do a whole whole
 
02:10:51.430 --> 02:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
category of things I think of the war
 
02:10:53.830 --> 02:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
starting at a different time than
 
02:10:56.510 --> 02:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
someone who says it only started when
 
02:11:00.870 --> 02:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
Lincoln decided to make race the issue
 
02:11:03.790 --> 02:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
and then it pivoted and that became the
 
02:11:06.669 --> 02:11:06.679 align:start position:0%
prevailing issue and it carried the
 
02:11:10.310 --> 02:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
day but it wasn't the start of the war
 
02:11:13.069 --> 02:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
and so if I raise that question am I a
 
02:11:14.470 --> 02:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
racist for
 
02:11:17.069 --> 02:11:17.079 align:start position:0%
saying the war started before you said
 
02:11:19.350 --> 02:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
it started or before became about your
 
02:11:21.669 --> 02:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
group of people or my group of people or
 
02:11:24.149 --> 02:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
whatever I'm just trying to get at the
 
02:11:26.830 --> 02:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
historical truth and yet the
 
02:11:29.149 --> 02:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
interpretation is you're a this or
 
02:11:31.109 --> 02:11:31.119 align:start position:0%
you're a that because we live in that
 
02:11:33.750 --> 02:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
kind of society today as does the
 
02:11:37.189 --> 02:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
teacher and the students so how does
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
that affect what you're trying to object
 
02:11:44.589 --> 02:11:44.599 align:start position:0%
to when what I would say we're trying to
 
02:11:46.709 --> 02:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
teach the truth there are a lot of
 
02:11:49.109 --> 02:11:49.119 align:start position:0%
reasons for that war a lot of people
 
02:11:51.910 --> 02:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
died before you think it even started
 
02:11:54.870 --> 02:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
some were white and some were
 
02:11:58.229 --> 02:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
black and I grew up with people and
 
02:12:00.870 --> 02:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
another weapon I talked about is people
 
02:12:03.790 --> 02:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
who were reared by black people like us
 
02:12:05.270 --> 02:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
people like
 
02:12:07.830 --> 02:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
us we knew who ruled do you have a
 
02:12:10.270 --> 02:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
question yes I do well get it done
 
02:12:12.830 --> 02:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
quickly please okay thank
 
02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
you my question is what's the truth and
 
02:12:18.709 --> 02:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
how do you teach that absolutely
 
02:12:20.669 --> 02:12:20.679 align:start position:0%
so first of all history is written by
 
02:12:22.629 --> 02:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
those who study historiography and
 
02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
they're the ones who write the textbooks
 
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
but even then what is written is always
 
02:12:30.830 --> 02:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh up for further discussion and
 
02:12:33.109 --> 02:12:33.119 align:start position:0%
interpretation and that is why when you
 
02:12:35.030 --> 02:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
teach and you're only teaching about the
 
02:12:37.709 --> 02:12:37.719 align:start position:0%
who what where and when you're giving
 
02:12:40.350 --> 02:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
the basic facts and maybe there is a
 
02:12:42.430 --> 02:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
different perspective and that's where
 
02:12:44.229 --> 02:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
you come up with the wise and the house
 
02:12:46.069 --> 02:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
and you start reaching those higher
 
02:12:48.390 --> 02:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
order thinking skills qual quality
 
02:12:51.109 --> 02:12:51.119 align:start position:0%
education is about having honest and
 
02:12:53.790 --> 02:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
open discussions where everything is on
 
02:12:56.430 --> 02:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
the table whether we agree or we
 
02:12:59.390 --> 02:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
disagree but yet we're able to talk
 
02:13:02.709 --> 02:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
about it and when the day is done we can
 
02:13:04.950 --> 02:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
all walk away with our own points of
 
02:13:08.470 --> 02:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
view you know we all have opinions but I
 
02:13:09.950 --> 02:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
like to say that opinions mean
 
02:13:14.390 --> 02:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing if it's not based on
 
02:13:19.069 --> 02:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
well reasoned research come with the
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
information and present it and then have
 
02:13:24.510 --> 02:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
sound arguments otherwise opinions are
 
02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
really meaningless because it's yeah
 
02:13:29.030 --> 02:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
this is how I feel really why did you do
 
02:13:32.950 --> 02:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
the research did you look it up you did
 
02:13:35.229 --> 02:13:35.239 align:start position:0%
let's hear it oh wow I never considered
 
02:13:36.910 --> 02:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
that point of view before thank you very
 
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
much honest and open discussions this
 
02:13:42.589 --> 02:13:42.599 align:start position:0%
law does not allow for honest and open
 
02:13:44.589 --> 02:13:44.599 align:start position:0%
discussions because frankly there are
 
02:13:46.750 --> 02:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
some things that are just a little too
 
02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
sensitive for people to talk about this
 
02:13:52.310 --> 02:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
is really about education not
 
02:13:53.910 --> 02:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
indoctrination thank you very much
 
02:13:55.830 --> 02:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
committee I appreciate it thank you very

you I've
 
02:14:32.750 --> 02:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
been discriminated against by saying
 
02:14:33.709 --> 02:14:33.719 align:start position:0%
that I'm
 
02:14:36.669 --> 02:14:36.679 align:start position:0%
AO I'm very proud that my mom was an
 
02:14:40.069 --> 02:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
indigenous person my dad was from Spain
 
02:14:44.069 --> 02:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
a white person when my dad met my mom
 
02:14:46.790 --> 02:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
she was an indigenous person who never

artist around the world but people don't
 
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
know that because people only take the
 
02:15:03.669 --> 02:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
time to tell me that I need to go back
 
02:15:06.390 --> 02:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
what I came from that my family doesn't
 
02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:07.510 align:start position:0%
what I came from that my family doesn't
belong

belong

here the people who look like me we only
 
02:15:12.310 --> 02:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
here to cause troubles and we don't give
 
02:15:14.350 --> 02:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
anything back to the community or we
 
02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
taken away from people
 
02:15:21.030 --> 02:15:21.040 align:start position:0%

02:15:22.470 --> 02:15:22.480 align:start position:0%

02:16:44.240 --> 02:16:46.669 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

02:16:46.669 --> 02:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
02:16:49.509 --> 02:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
welcome good good morning still good
 
02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
morning right it's uh Deon for New
 
02:16:54.190 --> 02:16:54.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state representative for
 
02:16:57.509 --> 02:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
district 40 That's Manchester WS 1 3 10
 
02:17:01.030 --> 02:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
11 and 12 um but more importantly I come
 
02:17:04.349 --> 02:17:04.359 align:start position:0%
before you today as a parent and a
 
02:17:06.669 --> 02:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
Community member of Manchester New
 
02:17:10.429 --> 02:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and I am here to support uh
 
02:17:12.389 --> 02:17:12.399 align:start position:0%
this bill um
 
02:17:15.270 --> 02:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
1162 um for multiple reasons but I will
 
02:17:17.150 --> 02:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
keep it short because 2 minutes is a not
 
02:17:19.870 --> 02:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
a long time so um part of the problem
 
02:17:21.990 --> 02:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
that I have with the current law is that
 
02:17:24.870 --> 02:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
it says historical um and so when I
 
02:17:26.429 --> 02:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
think about what's happening now where
 
02:17:28.270 --> 02:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
we have um conflicts in the Middle East
 
02:17:30.309 --> 02:17:30.319 align:start position:0%
where we could talk historical pieces of
 
02:17:31.669 --> 02:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
it but we should also be talking about
 
02:17:33.629 --> 02:17:33.639 align:start position:0%
the current issue at hand with these
 
02:17:35.589 --> 02:17:35.599 align:start position:0%
particular topics especially in the high
 
02:17:38.509 --> 02:17:38.519 align:start position:0%
schools um and so what about the present
 
02:17:39.990 --> 02:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
and what about the future of these
 
02:17:42.070 --> 02:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
conversations the current law states
 
02:17:44.230 --> 02:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
that is only a larger conversation can
 
02:17:46.429 --> 02:17:46.439 align:start position:0%
happen when in regards to the historical
 
02:17:48.750 --> 02:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
nature of the issue um and so I think
 
02:17:50.469 --> 02:17:50.479 align:start position:0%
about conversations that we can have
 
02:17:52.110 --> 02:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
currently with our
 
02:17:55.309 --> 02:17:55.319 align:start position:0%
students and then secondly I want to
 
02:17:57.750 --> 02:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
point out that complete history is
 
02:17:59.830 --> 02:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
important hearing from the winners and
 
02:18:01.709 --> 02:18:01.719 align:start position:0%
losers gives us a full picture of what
 
02:18:04.389 --> 02:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
happened and so uh a member on this
 
02:18:05.870 --> 02:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
committee stated that they were from a
 
02:18:07.030 --> 02:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
certain area and this is what they
 
02:18:08.910 --> 02:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
learned well that's what you learned at
 
02:18:10.990 --> 02:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
that time we have more information we
 
02:18:13.110 --> 02:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
have more voices we have more opinions
 
02:18:15.709 --> 02:18:15.719 align:start position:0%
when it comes to historical pieces right
 
02:18:16.870 --> 02:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh George Washington crossed the
 
02:18:18.910 --> 02:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
Delaware River but that we just heard
 
02:18:20.070 --> 02:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
that from the outside perspective what
 
02:18:21.469 --> 02:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
did George Washington think what did the
 
02:18:22.910 --> 02:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
guys who were roaring the boat right we
 
02:18:25.110 --> 02:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
need all of those P perspectives to
 
02:18:27.790 --> 02:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
fully understand the important American
 
02:18:29.950 --> 02:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
history that we have in this country and
 
02:18:34.030 --> 02:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
so if this law is repealed and Bill 1162
 
02:18:35.950 --> 02:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
is passed we will be able to get the
 
02:18:39.070 --> 02:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
complete and colorful history of America
 
02:18:41.309 --> 02:18:41.319 align:start position:0%
without hiding behind well this is what
 
02:18:43.750 --> 02:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
I learned and I think it's important or
 
02:18:45.190 --> 02:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh we're going to stop the conversation
 
02:18:46.589 --> 02:18:46.599 align:start position:0%
right here let's keep having the
 
02:18:48.830 --> 02:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
conversations um and I will leave with
 
02:18:53.309 --> 02:18:53.319 align:start position:0%
this final note we just had um M day um
 
02:18:54.669 --> 02:18:54.679 align:start position:0%
and I spoke in front of some students
 
02:18:56.750 --> 02:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
about the Beloved Community um and the
 
02:18:58.750 --> 02:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
Beloved Community is not the avoidance
 
02:19:00.509 --> 02:19:00.519 align:start position:0%
of conflict but is the meeting of
 
02:19:02.549 --> 02:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
conflict and having conversations and so
 
02:19:04.549 --> 02:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
if we want to build a Beloved Community
 
02:19:06.429 --> 02:19:06.439 align:start position:0%
um here in New Hampshire we should pass
 
02:19:09.309 --> 02:19:09.319 align:start position:0%
HB 1162 and repeal the current law thank
 
02:19:10.629 --> 02:19:10.639 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much representative
 
02:19:12.270 --> 02:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
Ford are you willing to take questions
 
02:19:15.429 --> 02:19:15.439 align:start position:0%
yes representative Pell thank you very
 
02:19:16.870 --> 02:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
much and thank you for taking my
 
02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:17.990 align:start position:0%
much and thank you for taking my
question

02:19:17.990 --> 02:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:19:21.870 --> 02:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
um this bill would repeal RSA 193 colon
 
02:19:25.190 --> 02:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
40 and I'm curious if you act um are
 
02:19:29.230 --> 02:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
familiar with 193 col 40 Roman numeral 2
 
02:19:31.270 --> 02:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
which states nothing in this section
 
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
shall be construed to prohibit
 
02:19:36.030 --> 02:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
discussing as part of a larger course of
 
02:19:38.870 --> 02:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
academic instruction the historical
 
02:19:40.709 --> 02:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
existence of ideas and subjects
 
02:19:44.509 --> 02:19:44.519 align:start position:0%
identified in this section do you think
 
02:19:47.110 --> 02:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
that that section of the law prohibits
 
02:19:49.270 --> 02:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
having conversations about any of the
 
02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
topics in in the earlier section of this
 
02:19:56.950 --> 02:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
law I did the reverse thing uh I think
 
02:19:58.750 --> 02:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
uh that section is actually the part
 
02:20:01.309 --> 02:20:01.319 align:start position:0%
that got me the most because academic
 
02:20:04.230 --> 02:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
instruction we hear I I work with high
 
02:20:05.429 --> 02:20:05.439 align:start position:0%
schoolers and there are a lot of
 
02:20:07.309 --> 02:20:07.319 align:start position:0%
conversations that are about academics
 
02:20:09.990 --> 02:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
but are not academic instruction um and
 
02:20:12.429 --> 02:20:12.439 align:start position:0%
so how do you have a conversation with a
 
02:20:15.150 --> 02:20:15.160 align:start position:0%
student will not violate this particular
 
02:20:18.030 --> 02:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
piece of the law um is really diff IAL
 
02:20:19.630 --> 02:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
and so let's say we're talking about
 
02:20:22.309 --> 02:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
race and slavery or let's talk about
 
02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
reconstruction and black businesses um
 
02:20:27.429 --> 02:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
and a student is talking about how their
 
02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
parent is trying to get a a a bank loan
 
02:20:31.510 --> 02:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
and they think it may be related to race
 
02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
right do you say let I don't want to
 
02:20:35.389 --> 02:20:35.399 align:start position:0%
talk about your family trying to open up
 
02:20:37.270 --> 02:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
a business student because it's about
 
02:20:39.710 --> 02:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
your black parent trying to uh get a
 
02:20:43.389 --> 02:20:43.399 align:start position:0%
loan or um and it has no academic
 
02:20:45.309 --> 02:20:45.319 align:start position:0%
instruction and is not historically tied
 
02:20:48.630 --> 02:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
to uh the Tulsa Race riots which were
 
02:20:50.150 --> 02:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
also known as the Black Wall Street
 
02:20:52.469 --> 02:20:52.479 align:start position:0%
which is financial hub for black people
 
02:20:54.270 --> 02:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
in Oklahoma at the time right so you can
 
02:20:56.710 --> 02:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
make these academic connections but if
 
02:20:58.270 --> 02:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
you stop the conversation of where
 
02:21:00.429 --> 02:21:00.439 align:start position:0%
students are right they only have their
 
02:21:02.550 --> 02:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
perspective so race to them is what they
 
02:21:03.790 --> 02:21:03.800 align:start position:0%
learn from their family from their
 
02:21:05.950 --> 02:21:05.960 align:start position:0%
community and from their their their
 
02:21:07.950 --> 02:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
their their local community and so when
 
02:21:09.950 --> 02:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
they bring that into the classroom you
 
02:21:12.510 --> 02:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
cannot say your lived experiences must
 
02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
stop at the door because we're having
 
02:21:16.309 --> 02:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
academic instructions in this room and
 
02:21:18.030 --> 02:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
so when you do that you prevent students
 
02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
from actually bringing their full s to
 
02:21:21.510 --> 02:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
the classroom and so because there's no
 
02:21:23.510 --> 02:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
student that I work with who lives in
 
02:21:25.070 --> 02:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
the history there's no student I work
 
02:21:27.030 --> 02:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
with that lived in the 1960s so when we
 
02:21:28.950 --> 02:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
talk about historical that has already
 
02:21:30.670 --> 02:21:30.680 align:start position:0%
been written and there are other stories
 
02:21:32.870 --> 02:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
and voices that need to be heard and you
 
02:21:36.150 --> 02:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
cannot relate that to um real lived
 
02:21:37.429 --> 02:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
experience that students are having
 
02:21:40.030 --> 02:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
today in an academic instruction way
 
02:21:42.870 --> 02:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
that this bill the current law states it
 
02:21:44.670 --> 02:21:44.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
02:21:47.550 --> 02:21:47.560 align:start position:0%
followup so do you think that that if
 
02:21:50.550 --> 02:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
section if Roman numeral 2 was Rewritten
 
02:21:53.550 --> 02:21:53.560 align:start position:0%
to incorporate some of the your concerns
 
02:21:56.110 --> 02:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
would that affect the way the current
 
02:21:57.309 --> 02:21:57.319 align:start position:0%
law is
 
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
written to make it more
 
02:22:02.830 --> 02:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
palatable to be honest I dislike this
 
02:22:06.309 --> 02:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
law in general and I will state
 
02:22:09.190 --> 02:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
personally the intent behind this bill
 
02:22:12.670 --> 02:22:12.680 align:start position:0%
is um it's not great what has been
 
02:22:15.110 --> 02:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
written here parts of it and has been
 
02:22:17.230 --> 02:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned multiple times from the the
 
02:22:18.750 --> 02:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
primary sponsor and others on this
 
02:22:20.550 --> 02:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
committee there are great pieces here
 
02:22:22.710 --> 02:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
yes we love that part but what was the
 
02:22:25.030 --> 02:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
intent behind the law so let's get rid
 
02:22:27.150 --> 02:22:27.160 align:start position:0%
of the law completely because we can
 
02:22:29.110 --> 02:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
continue to have these conversations and
 
02:22:32.950 --> 02:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
this this the current HB 1162 gets to
 
02:22:34.469 --> 02:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
let's not discriminate let's keep the
 
02:22:36.550 --> 02:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
parts that really work well um and I
 
02:22:39.469 --> 02:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
think if the only the only thing is is
 
02:22:41.190 --> 02:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
once again we're creating legislation
 
02:22:43.429 --> 02:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
that hinders the ability to have
 
02:22:45.670 --> 02:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
conversations and have these topics
 
02:22:48.230 --> 02:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
discussed in an academic class room um
 
02:22:52.950 --> 02:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
and so let's repal the entire uh RSA um
 
02:22:55.389 --> 02:22:55.399 align:start position:0%
for that for that matter thank you very
 
02:22:56.710 --> 02:22:56.720 align:start position:0%

02:22:59.190 --> 02:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you very much thank
 
02:23:08.990 --> 02:23:09.000 align:start position:0%

progress and I am here in support of HB
 
02:23:23.990 --> 02:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
1162 by now we are all aware of the
 
02:23:25.750 --> 02:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
effect the band Concepts law has had on
 
02:23:27.389 --> 02:23:27.399 align:start position:0%
our Public School classrooms and I want
 
02:23:29.510 --> 02:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
to speak today uh what I want to speak
 
02:23:30.950 --> 02:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
about today is the effect this is having
 
02:23:33.150 --> 02:23:33.160 align:start position:0%
on my own children and their future as
 
02:23:35.150 --> 02:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
members of a local and ultimately Global
 
02:23:37.349 --> 02:23:37.359 align:start position:0%
Community my daughters attend a public
 
02:23:39.110 --> 02:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
school that my family is very proud of
 
02:23:40.269 --> 02:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
my husband and I have strong
 
02:23:41.510 --> 02:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
relationships with our daughters
 
02:23:43.590 --> 02:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
teachers our girls are excited to go to
 
02:23:45.670 --> 02:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
school and are valued in their classroom
 
02:23:47.389 --> 02:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
the Dark Cloud that the band con concept
 
02:23:49.630 --> 02:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
bill or law pardon me has cast over our
 
02:23:51.590 --> 02:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
Public School classrooms will not Escape
 
02:23:53.230 --> 02:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
our experience despite our strong
 
02:23:54.469 --> 02:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
involvement with our children's
 
02:23:56.630 --> 02:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
education when I was going to school I
 
02:23:59.230 --> 02:23:59.240 align:start position:0%
was taught that states rights uh were
 
02:24:00.990 --> 02:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
the cause of the Civil War while the
 
02:24:03.230 --> 02:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
role of slavery was minimized instead of
 
02:24:04.710 --> 02:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
being taught to fully examine the
 
02:24:07.030 --> 02:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
pivotal role racism played its lasting
 
02:24:10.110 --> 02:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
Legacy and how to build a better future
 
02:24:11.870 --> 02:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
I want better for my children so that
 
02:24:13.309 --> 02:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
they are able to treat their peers of
 
02:24:15.389 --> 02:24:15.399 align:start position:0%
all Races genders and backgrounds with
 
02:24:18.510 --> 02:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
dignity and respect a small group of
 
02:24:20.269 --> 02:24:20.279 align:start position:0%
anti-public school politicians want to
 
02:24:22.110 --> 02:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
fear Monger instead of examine what
 
02:24:23.910 --> 02:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
looks what it looks like to talk about
 
02:24:26.230 --> 02:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
the past in an honest way we can all
 
02:24:27.910 --> 02:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
come together to overturn this law and
 
02:24:29.469 --> 02:24:29.479 align:start position:0%
start working toward a better future for
 
02:24:31.630 --> 02:24:31.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's public school kids I
 
02:24:33.070 --> 02:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
want my children and their peers to be
 
02:24:34.510 --> 02:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
prepared for interacting with a wide
 
02:24:36.349 --> 02:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
range of individuals as they continue to
 
02:24:38.630 --> 02:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
grow on their individual paths and to
 
02:24:40.230 --> 02:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
have an honest shared understanding of
 
02:24:42.150 --> 02:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
the world around them and I don't want
 
02:24:44.309 --> 02:24:44.319 align:start position:0%
laws like band Concepts to make teachers
 
02:24:45.990 --> 02:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
fear for their livelihoods when they
 
02:24:47.790 --> 02:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
teach our country's hist history or
 
02:24:49.710 --> 02:24:49.720 align:start position:0%
explore difficult concepts related to
 
02:24:52.510 --> 02:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
race gender ableism and more there is a
 
02:24:54.469 --> 02:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
clear and consistent attempt by certain
 
02:24:56.469 --> 02:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
decisionmakers to minimize an honest
 
02:24:58.590 --> 02:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
education to seow doubt in our public
 
02:25:00.630 --> 02:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
schools and defund those institutions of
 
02:25:02.389 --> 02:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
public good to make it harder for
 
02:25:04.070 --> 02:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
certain students to see a healthy
 
02:25:05.630 --> 02:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
thriving future for themselves and
 
02:25:08.550 --> 02:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
ultimately to dismantle public education
 
02:25:10.670 --> 02:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
the band Concepts law is a part of this
 
02:25:12.950 --> 02:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
effort now that the anti- critical race
 
02:25:15.110 --> 02:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
Theory hysteria has died down as part of
 
02:25:16.990 --> 02:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
the culture wars and ultimately has
 
02:25:18.429 --> 02:25:18.439 align:start position:0%
evolved into the
 
02:25:21.550 --> 02:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
anti-lgbtq and anti-al uh rhetoric we
 
02:25:23.670 --> 02:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
are now seeing it's clear that the band
 
02:25:25.870 --> 02:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
Concepts law was one part of a larger
 
02:25:28.710 --> 02:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
plan your your time is up thank you very
 
02:25:30.309 --> 02:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair I'm happy to take
 
02:25:32.469 --> 02:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
questions you have written testimony I
 
02:25:34.790 --> 02:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
will submit them electronically are
 
02:25:35.950 --> 02:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the committee
 
02:25:39.070 --> 02:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative Tanner thank you yeah
 
02:25:40.950 --> 02:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for taking my question
 
02:25:42.710 --> 02:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
do you ever think that your daughter
 
02:25:45.469 --> 02:25:45.479 align:start position:0%
comes home from public school and maybe
 
02:25:47.790 --> 02:25:47.800 align:start position:0%
says to you something like
 
02:25:50.830 --> 02:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
you know I I was called a racist today
 
02:25:53.670 --> 02:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
or your son said you know I was called a
 
02:25:56.190 --> 02:25:56.200 align:start position:0%
sexist so that means I'm going to hurt
 
02:25:58.990 --> 02:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
my girlfriend that maybe that was a
 
02:26:00.950 --> 02:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding with what was going on
 
02:26:03.670 --> 02:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
in school did have you ever had any uh
 
02:26:06.349 --> 02:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
situation where your children have
 
02:26:08.830 --> 02:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
misunderstood and maybe you needed to
 
02:26:11.030 --> 02:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
clarify some things uh my kiddos do
 
02:26:12.550 --> 02:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
attend a very diverse school which is
 
02:26:14.309 --> 02:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
something we're really proud of and I
 
02:26:16.389 --> 02:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
like to consider those teachable moments
 
02:26:17.990 --> 02:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
where my kiddos and I can have an honest
 
02:26:19.710 --> 02:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
conversation they can give me more
 
02:26:21.469 --> 02:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
context about their feelings and the way
 
02:26:23.670 --> 02:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
they're interpreting something at school
 
02:26:24.630 --> 02:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
kids are going to question their
 
02:26:26.030 --> 02:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
surrounding that's a normal part of
 
02:26:29.110 --> 02:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
growing and my role as an adult
 
02:26:31.110 --> 02:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
especially one that values diversity
 
02:26:32.910 --> 02:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
equity and inclusion is to talk about
 
02:26:35.269 --> 02:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
our role as people in that system and
 
02:26:37.150 --> 02:26:37.160 align:start position:0%
our responsibility to dismantle white
 
02:26:39.550 --> 02:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
supremacy within it um I have frequent
 
02:26:41.309 --> 02:26:41.319 align:start position:0%
conversations with my kiddos about what
 
02:26:43.150 --> 02:26:43.160 align:start position:0%
does it mean to be a white person what
 
02:26:44.910 --> 02:26:44.920 align:start position:0%
is whiteness it's not something that
 
02:26:46.510 --> 02:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
they asked for but it is something that
 
02:26:48.750 --> 02:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
they live with and there's no need for
 
02:26:50.990 --> 02:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
that to interrupt their ability to build
 
02:26:53.750 --> 02:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
great relationships but again I'm their
 
02:26:55.429 --> 02:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
parent that's my job to guide them
 
02:26:57.590 --> 02:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
through uh understanding these
 
02:26:59.990 --> 02:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
situations um and Educators can be
 
02:27:01.830 --> 02:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
trusted to do the same
 
02:27:03.950 --> 02:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
thing thank you further questions
 
02:27:05.550 --> 02:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
02:27:07.710 --> 02:27:07.720 align:start position:0%
dry thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:27:09.670 --> 02:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question what would you
 
02:27:12.349 --> 02:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
consider the band
 
02:27:15.910 --> 02:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
Concepts um I think it's vague on
 
02:27:18.550 --> 02:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
purpose it is difficult for the law to
 
02:27:21.550 --> 02:27:21.560 align:start position:0%
be interpreted accurately by Educators
 
02:27:24.469 --> 02:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
so the the vagueness being if you
 
02:27:28.030 --> 02:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
approach uh topics such as race gender
 
02:27:30.190 --> 02:27:30.200 align:start position:0%
uh those two in particular or even
 
02:27:34.150 --> 02:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
ableism agism any of the isms it can put
 
02:27:37.910 --> 02:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
Educators in danger of Retribution from
 
02:27:40.269 --> 02:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
a small a minority of people who are
 
02:27:42.110 --> 02:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
looking to sew distrust within the
 
02:27:44.790 --> 02:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
public education system so instead of
 
02:27:47.230 --> 02:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
putting their livelihood at risk
 
02:27:50.110 --> 02:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
um some choose to step away from even
 
02:27:52.389 --> 02:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
attempting to walk into those Waters and
 
02:27:54.110 --> 02:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
have those
 
02:27:56.150 --> 02:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
conversations represent
 
02:27:58.950 --> 02:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chairman L thank you
 
02:28:00.950 --> 02:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
for being here almost good afternoon
 
02:28:03.950 --> 02:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
yeah you seem to be like uh very well
 
02:28:05.389 --> 02:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
connected with your youngsters your
 
02:28:09.510 --> 02:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
youngsters so um as they come home from
 
02:28:14.349 --> 02:28:14.359 align:start position:0%
school uh do you notice anything missing
 
02:28:16.110 --> 02:28:16.120 align:start position:0%
uh in there in your interaction with
 
02:28:17.630 --> 02:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
them in terms of information because of
 
02:28:20.469 --> 02:28:20.479 align:start position:0%
the being concept act I'm very lucky
 
02:28:23.269 --> 02:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
that my uh kiddos have very Savvy
 
02:28:26.230 --> 02:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
long-term Educators who um feel
 
02:28:28.469 --> 02:28:28.479 align:start position:0%
confident in uh the teaching that they
 
02:28:30.389 --> 02:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
do in their classrooms I cannot speak
 
02:28:33.269 --> 02:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
for every educator um or for the
 
02:28:35.950 --> 02:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
environment that they teach in um so I
 
02:28:37.349 --> 02:28:37.359 align:start position:0%
think it has a lot to do with the
 
02:28:39.990 --> 02:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
community that folks are teaching within
 
02:28:41.630 --> 02:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
um and their feel for the community and
 
02:28:43.070 --> 02:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
if they feel supported by their
 
02:28:46.309 --> 02:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
community in in teaching such things um
 
02:28:49.349 --> 02:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
but again if our Educators don't feel
 
02:28:51.630 --> 02:28:51.640 align:start position:0%
that they have the support of the law to
 
02:28:53.429 --> 02:28:53.439 align:start position:0%
be able to teach the way that they feel
 
02:28:56.469 --> 02:28:56.479 align:start position:0%
is just and honest and inclusive uh then
 
02:28:58.830 --> 02:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
they will miss things thank you thank
 
02:28:59.910 --> 02:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
you for the question thank you very much
 
02:29:02.070 --> 02:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli thank you thank
 
02:29:04.389 --> 02:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
you for being here yeah um I think you
 
02:29:06.670 --> 02:29:06.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned something about dismantling
 
02:29:12.190 --> 02:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
whiteness um aren't you stereotyping in
 
02:29:14.870 --> 02:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
um place of maybe other stereotypes that
 
02:29:17.990 --> 02:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
this language is trying to get rid of
 
02:29:19.630 --> 02:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understand your question
 
02:29:22.870 --> 02:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
could you reframe it for me sure um if
 
02:29:25.030 --> 02:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
someone said they wanted to dismantle
 
02:29:28.190 --> 02:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
Blackness I'm sure you would not be
 
02:29:31.309 --> 02:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
supportive of that kind of discussion so
 
02:29:34.190 --> 02:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
why is I'm understanding I think I'm
 
02:29:36.990 --> 02:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
understanding so um the black community
 
02:29:39.670 --> 02:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
has a very rich culture that is separate
 
02:29:43.830 --> 02:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
from whiteness um that involves uh
 
02:29:46.030 --> 02:29:46.040 align:start position:0%
ethnicity um different cultural
 
02:29:49.230 --> 02:29:49.240 align:start position:0%
experience is whiteness is not a culture
 
02:29:50.950 --> 02:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
whiteness is a structure that was
 
02:29:52.910 --> 02:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
established to create a hierarchy within
 
02:29:56.110 --> 02:29:56.120 align:start position:0%
our society I am French Canadian that's
 
02:29:58.630 --> 02:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
an identity that's a culture whiteness
 
02:30:01.510 --> 02:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
is not it's just a tool of a system so
 
02:30:03.070 --> 02:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I would very much like to dismantle
 
02:30:05.150 --> 02:30:05.160 align:start position:0%
a tool of a system that's being used to
 
02:30:06.469 --> 02:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
oppress other
 
02:30:12.550 --> 02:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
people than follow um and so whiteness
 
02:30:16.550 --> 02:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
is that saying that white people is
 
02:30:17.910 --> 02:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
that's part of the structure that you
 
02:30:22.150 --> 02:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
want to get rid of um in in terms of any
 
02:30:24.790 --> 02:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
um positions held by white people of
 
02:30:26.670 --> 02:30:26.680 align:start position:0%
Authority or I'm not sure where are you
 
02:30:28.910 --> 02:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
going with that I'm not sure where your
 
02:30:31.750 --> 02:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
questioning is going with that actually
 
02:30:36.030 --> 02:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
um I think there are ways that we can
 
02:30:39.269 --> 02:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
identify a structure that does not serve
 
02:30:42.750 --> 02:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
the entirety of our communities um I'm
 
02:30:45.230 --> 02:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
not asking that folks be removed from
 
02:30:47.309 --> 02:30:47.319 align:start position:0%
positions only that we examine the ways
 
02:30:49.630 --> 02:30:49.640 align:start position:0%
in which we interact with each other and
 
02:30:51.510 --> 02:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
use different systems to keep people
 
02:30:55.750 --> 02:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
away from positions of power repr
 
02:30:58.309 --> 02:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr Speaker and thank
 
02:30:59.670 --> 02:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
you for your
 
02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
testimony I agree with a lot of what the
 
02:31:04.990 --> 02:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor stated the intent of this
 
02:31:07.950 --> 02:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
was to be anti-discriminatory I think
 
02:31:09.750 --> 02:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
the disconnect is along the lines of the
 
02:31:12.590 --> 02:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
word inherent I know he mentioned that
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
there were inherent groups that could be
 
02:31:18.030 --> 02:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
racist do you believe that there are
 
02:31:20.190 --> 02:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
racial groups that are inherently racist
 
02:31:22.550 --> 02:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
and if so is that something that should
 
02:31:24.830 --> 02:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
we should be teaching in schools so I
 
02:31:27.230 --> 02:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
can only speak to my experience as a
 
02:31:30.030 --> 02:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
white person existing in New Hampshire
 
02:31:33.830 --> 02:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
and in the United States um as far as
 
02:31:35.990 --> 02:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
inherency that feels like we're sort of
 
02:31:37.830 --> 02:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
playing with semantics what I'm really
 
02:31:40.910 --> 02:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about is removing a bill that
 
02:31:42.670 --> 02:31:42.680 align:start position:0%
has put a chill on our classrooms and
 
02:31:45.150 --> 02:31:45.160 align:start position:0%
has made it difficult for educators to
 
02:31:47.590 --> 02:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
teach to their fullest capacity and has
 
02:31:49.550 --> 02:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
limited our kiddos from being able to
 
02:31:52.030 --> 02:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
learn to their fullest capacity may I
 
02:31:56.349 --> 02:31:56.359 align:start position:0%
ask a followup yes do you believe that
 
02:31:58.910 --> 02:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
there is any role in the department and
 
02:32:01.389 --> 02:32:01.399 align:start position:0%
I it is my understanding they have tried
 
02:32:03.510 --> 02:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
to correct the issue or clarify how the
 
02:32:06.269 --> 02:32:06.279 align:start position:0%
laws to be interpreted do you believe
 
02:32:09.269 --> 02:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
that could alleviate the chilling effect
 
02:32:11.790 --> 02:32:11.800 align:start position:0%
as you put it and clarify how the law is
 
02:32:14.469 --> 02:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
in at least intended to be interpreted I
 
02:32:16.990 --> 02:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
think providing Clarity to a bad law
 
02:32:19.510 --> 02:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't make the law any better I think
 
02:32:22.550 --> 02:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
removal of the law is the ideal uh step
 
02:32:25.710 --> 02:32:25.720 align:start position:0%
forward okay thank you y thank you repr
 
02:32:27.670 --> 02:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:32:28.910 --> 02:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
for your testimony I just want to make
 
02:32:31.309 --> 02:32:31.319 align:start position:0%
sure I have a prop understanding uh see
 
02:32:33.710 --> 02:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
your testimony regarding whiteness are
 
02:32:34.990 --> 02:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting that there was a
 
02:32:37.150 --> 02:32:37.160 align:start position:0%
historical construct that we call
 
02:32:39.590 --> 02:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
whiteness that was set up in order to
 
02:32:42.030 --> 02:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
reproduce itself and elevate a certain
 
02:32:45.630 --> 02:32:45.640 align:start position:0%
Class cast of people in America to um to
 
02:32:48.190 --> 02:32:48.200 align:start position:0%
again to reproduce this culture of
 
02:32:50.830 --> 02:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
whiteness is that what you're you're s
 
02:32:53.550 --> 02:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
suggesting yeah and if I may have a
 
02:32:56.630 --> 02:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
followup is that not the exact same
 
02:32:58.870 --> 02:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
language and theory of Carl Marx's
 
02:33:01.309 --> 02:33:01.319 align:start position:0%
theory of Marxism with whiteness instead
 
02:33:03.269 --> 02:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
of capitalism I don't know how that's
 
02:33:04.790 --> 02:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
relevant to the conversation that we're
 
02:33:06.510 --> 02:33:06.520 align:start position:0%
having here or how it's relevant to the
 
02:33:09.030 --> 02:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
bill itself um and I don't feel
 
02:33:12.550 --> 02:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
qualified to speak to Marxism but thanks
 
02:33:14.950 --> 02:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
for the attempt thank you further
 
02:33:16.309 --> 02:33:16.319 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee thank thank
 
02:33:18.630 --> 02:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
you very much over represent pil did you
 
02:33:21.230 --> 02:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
have a question yes thank you so um I
 
02:33:23.950 --> 02:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
want to go back to oh sorry thank you
 
02:33:26.469 --> 02:33:26.479 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question so
 
02:33:28.510 --> 02:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
I just want to use your concept of
 
02:33:32.190 --> 02:33:32.200 align:start position:0%
whiteness and insert it in the statute
 
02:33:33.950 --> 02:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
the way it's written right now so
 
02:33:36.550 --> 02:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
because there are various groups
 
02:33:39.750 --> 02:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned um in this bill so if we say
 
02:33:41.590 --> 02:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
no pupil in any public school in the
 
02:33:43.110 --> 02:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
state shall be taught instructed
 
02:33:44.990 --> 02:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
inculcated or compelled to express
 
02:33:47.750 --> 02:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
belief in or support for any one or more
 
02:33:49.910 --> 02:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
of the following that
 
02:33:53.389 --> 02:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
one's whiteness I'm using that for to
 
02:33:57.070 --> 02:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
replace color is inherently Superior to
 
02:33:59.309 --> 02:33:59.319 align:start position:0%
people of another
 
02:34:02.110 --> 02:34:02.120 align:start position:0%
color it sounds like what you're saying
 
02:34:04.150 --> 02:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
agrees with what is written in the law
 
02:34:05.550 --> 02:34:05.560 align:start position:0%
that you would not teach that your
 
02:34:09.910 --> 02:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
whiteness is superior to anybody else's
 
02:34:13.030 --> 02:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
color so first off whiteness is not a
 
02:34:18.950 --> 02:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:22.070 --> 02:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
correct so then I don't have concerns my
 
02:34:24.110 --> 02:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
concerns are for federally protected
 
02:34:26.510 --> 02:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
classes of people not being properly
 
02:34:28.590 --> 02:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
represented in our education whiteness
 
02:34:30.790 --> 02:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
is very well represented in education in
 
02:34:33.309 --> 02:34:33.319 align:start position:0%
the United States and in New Hampshire
 
02:34:33.319 --> 02:34:34.910 align:start position:0%
the United States and in New Hampshire
one

02:34:34.910 --> 02:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
followup the law is written mentions
 
02:34:43.550 --> 02:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
color which people are often yeah people
 
02:34:46.110 --> 02:34:46.120 align:start position:0%
are often discriminated against because
 
02:34:47.710 --> 02:34:47.720 align:start position:0%
of the color of their skin you would
 
02:34:50.510 --> 02:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:50.520 --> 02:34:52.469 align:start position:0%
 
right

02:34:52.469 --> 02:34:52.479 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:34:55.550 --> 02:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much thank you very
 
02:34:57.150 --> 02:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
much for testifying today thank you Mr
 
02:35:12.190 --> 02:35:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:14.150 --> 02:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
Wilson thank you very much
 
02:35:17.950 --> 02:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
representatives for having me
 
02:35:21.590 --> 02:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
um I've shortened my speech to get right
 
02:35:25.230 --> 02:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
to the most important point my name
 
02:35:27.230 --> 02:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
excuse me my name is Holly Wilson I
 
02:35:29.790 --> 02:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
teach us history and world history as
 
02:35:31.389 --> 02:35:31.399 align:start position:0%
well as English language arts at we
 
02:35:34.590 --> 02:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
Middle School in moer New Hampshire I've
 
02:35:36.670 --> 02:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
been an educator and an Alpine Ski coach
 
02:35:40.110 --> 02:35:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:42.830 --> 02:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
life I would like to tell you that I'm
 
02:35:45.230 --> 02:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
here in support of this to repeal the
 
02:35:48.150 --> 02:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
divice of con Concepts law and I want
 
02:35:50.950 --> 02:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
like to tell you an personal experience
 
02:35:53.349 --> 02:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
the outcome of that
 
02:35:55.950 --> 02:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
law has caused teachers to avoid
 
02:35:58.550 --> 02:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
controversial subjects thus not helping
 
02:36:00.830 --> 02:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
students learn how to form their own
 
02:36:03.630 --> 02:36:03.640 align:start position:0%
opinion using facts and deductive
 
02:36:05.750 --> 02:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
reasoning this law has created a sense
 
02:36:08.150 --> 02:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
of fear in teachers it contributes
 
02:36:09.950 --> 02:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
enough fear that teachers will avoid
 
02:36:12.790 --> 02:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
those Rich discussions only give facts
 
02:36:15.469 --> 02:36:15.479 align:start position:0%
and thus neglect the basic element that
 
02:36:19.150 --> 02:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
all history is jelled in P perspective
 
02:36:20.309 --> 02:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
and its
 
02:36:22.830 --> 02:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
formation I experienced this firsthand
 
02:36:25.389 --> 02:36:25.399 align:start position:0%
when I unknowingly became wrapped up in
 
02:36:28.030 --> 02:36:28.040 align:start position:0%
this law two years ago I was teaching US
 
02:36:30.590 --> 02:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
history and supplemented my curriculum
 
02:36:32.870 --> 02:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
with the young adult version of stamped
 
02:36:36.230 --> 02:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
by ibam keny and Jason Reynolds I was so
 
02:36:39.469 --> 02:36:39.479 align:start position:0%
scared of this law I studied it to make
 
02:36:41.230 --> 02:36:41.240 align:start position:0%
certain I was not in violation of the
 
02:36:43.150 --> 02:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
law before we read this controversial
 
02:36:46.230 --> 02:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
book in my classroom which by the way
 
02:36:47.710 --> 02:36:47.720 align:start position:0%
was very
 
02:36:50.950 --> 02:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
entertaining and the students loved it
 
02:36:53.389 --> 02:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
it inspired Rich discussion and debate
 
02:36:56.030 --> 02:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
in my classroom yet somebody who did not
 
02:36:58.510 --> 02:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
agree with the politics of it came into
 
02:37:00.269 --> 02:37:00.279 align:start position:0%
my classroom and anonymously took
 
02:37:02.590 --> 02:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
pictures of the decor the posters that I
 
02:37:05.550 --> 02:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
had in my classroom my lesson plans and
 
02:37:07.750 --> 02:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
notes and turned me into the state in
 
02:37:10.429 --> 02:37:10.439 align:start position:0%
September of 2002 claiming I was
 
02:37:13.630 --> 02:37:13.640 align:start position:0%
violating the divis divisive concept law
 
02:37:16.269 --> 02:37:16.279 align:start position:0%
then to top that off our commissioner of
 
02:37:19.630 --> 02:37:19.640 align:start position:0%
Education used them them in an oped
 
02:37:21.910 --> 02:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
supporting his idea of family values in
 
02:37:25.510 --> 02:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:28.110 --> 02:37:28.120 align:start position:0%
up thank you want any
 
02:37:30.630 --> 02:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
02:37:33.030 --> 02:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
Miler I'd like to thank you for being
 
02:37:35.070 --> 02:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
here thank you Mr chair I'd like to have
 
02:37:39.389 --> 02:37:39.399 align:start position:0%
you continue to talk about the impact of
 
02:37:41.910 --> 02:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh your teaching and what happened when
 
02:37:45.110 --> 02:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
that case was filed with the state is
 
02:37:50.389 --> 02:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:50.399 --> 02:37:53.750 align:start position:0%
 
happened

02:37:53.750 --> 02:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:57.670 --> 02:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately the law was vague and the
 
02:38:00.389 --> 02:38:00.399 align:start position:0%
doe the the superintendent got involved
 
02:38:02.590 --> 02:38:02.600 align:start position:0%
and the doe sent all of my lesson plans
 
02:38:04.750 --> 02:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
up to the doe and they looked at what I
 
02:38:07.389 --> 02:38:07.399 align:start position:0%
was doing and said there's no violation
 
02:38:10.630 --> 02:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
of any law although they are not a body
 
02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:11.590 align:start position:0%
of any law although they are not a body
who

02:38:11.590 --> 02:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:38:15.910 --> 02:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
would reprimand for for Vi for breaking
 
02:38:19.230 --> 02:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
law it's so vague that no one could
 
02:38:22.030 --> 02:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
really pinpoint and so ultimately uh
 
02:38:24.269 --> 02:38:24.279 align:start position:0%
nothing happened I was worried about
 
02:38:25.870 --> 02:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
losing my teaching certificate my
 
02:38:27.710 --> 02:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
principal thought she could lose her
 
02:38:29.030 --> 02:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
principal certificate and of course
 
02:38:30.469 --> 02:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
ultimately the superintendent's
 
02:38:32.830 --> 02:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
responsible but thank
 
02:38:35.870 --> 02:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
you so as a result of this experience
 
02:38:38.910 --> 02:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
that you had what impact did this have
 
02:38:42.830 --> 02:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:46.349 --> 02:38:46.359 align:start position:0%
History the impact that this has had on
 
02:38:50.110 --> 02:38:50.120 align:start position:0%
my teaching of history is I am very
 
02:38:52.870 --> 02:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
careful with the words that I choose
 
02:38:52.880 --> 02:38:54.110 align:start position:0%
careful with the words that I choose
with

02:38:54.110 --> 02:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:38:56.349 --> 02:38:56.359 align:start position:0%
students represent
 
02:38:59.790 --> 02:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
Tanner could you tell me um or I guess
 
02:39:04.309 --> 02:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
I'll ask did it change the um dynamic
 
02:39:06.510 --> 02:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
between you and your students in class
 
02:39:09.750 --> 02:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
or fellow Educators because this was all
 
02:39:09.760 --> 02:39:14.070 align:start position:0%
or fellow Educators because this was all
done

02:39:14.070 --> 02:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:17.790 --> 02:39:17.800 align:start position:0%

is how can we end the scourge of racism
 
02:40:43.790 --> 02:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
that breeds fear suspicion distrust hate
 
02:40:46.630 --> 02:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
and intolerance in our country

armed with true and accurate knowledge
 
02:40:50.990 --> 02:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
of our history and encouraged by

teachers to discuss and examine the
 
02:40:56.269 --> 02:40:56.279 align:start position:0%
accomplishments and flaws of our
 
02:40:59.070 --> 02:40:59.080 align:start position:0%
policies students will gain a deeper
 
02:41:00.990 --> 02:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
understanding of how history has
 
02:41:03.150 --> 02:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
influenced the beliefs and opinions we
 
02:41:03.160 --> 02:41:04.030 align:start position:0%
influenced the beliefs and opinions we
have

02:41:04.030 --> 02:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:41:06.870 --> 02:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
today we must not threaten teachers with
 
02:41:10.269 --> 02:41:10.279 align:start position:0%
disciplinary sanctions or civil action
 
02:41:12.389 --> 02:41:12.399 align:start position:0%
for allowing open and honest discussions
 
02:41:13.309 --> 02:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
in their
 
02:41:16.469 --> 02:41:16.479 align:start position:0%
classrooms in fact it is only with open
 
02:41:17.590 --> 02:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
and honest
 
02:41:19.990 --> 02:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
discussions that students can learn the
 
02:41:22.990 --> 02:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
underlying causes of racism and can then
 
02:41:25.710 --> 02:41:25.720 align:start position:0%
explore how to move us forward toward a
 
02:41:28.190 --> 02:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
more tolerant and peaceful
 
02:41:31.630 --> 02:41:31.640 align:start position:0%
Society I urge you to support House Bill
 
02:41:34.349 --> 02:41:34.359 align:start position:0%
1162 to give teachers the tools and
 
02:41:37.190 --> 02:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
confidence to provide diverse approaches
 
02:41:40.469 --> 02:41:40.479 align:start position:0%
to instruction that encourage critical
 
02:41:42.990 --> 02:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
thinking and an understanding of how
 
02:41:45.590 --> 02:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
history affects our attitudes today
 
02:41:48.429 --> 02:41:48.439 align:start position:0%
let's end the scourge of racism once and
 
02:41:50.910 --> 02:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
for all by supporting our teachers and
 
02:41:52.790 --> 02:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
allowing openness and honesty to
 
02:41:54.389 --> 02:41:54.399 align:start position:0%

comment how you think the current
law

02:42:09.429 --> 02:42:09.439 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:42:13.710 --> 02:42:13.720 align:start position:0%
might affect a teacher today who wants
 
02:42:16.309 --> 02:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
to help students look at the current
 
02:42:19.070 --> 02:42:19.080 align:start position:0%

um yeah that would be an important issue
 
02:42:32.349 --> 02:42:32.359 align:start position:0%
for teachers to discuss but I think the
 
02:42:36.349 --> 02:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
law is so vague the teachers are afraid
 
02:42:38.870 --> 02:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
to dig into it very
 
02:42:41.269 --> 02:42:41.279 align:start position:0%

02:43:49.190 --> 02:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
about four or five months after the law
 
02:43:51.429 --> 02:43:51.439 align:start position:0%
was enacted that is still going through
 
02:43:53.070 --> 02:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
the court process there was a motion to
 
02:43:55.349 --> 02:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
dismiss filed the court rejected that
 
02:43:58.110 --> 02:43:58.120 align:start position:0%
motion to dismiss there was since uh a
 
02:44:00.830 --> 02:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
period of Discovery where information uh
 
02:44:03.790 --> 02:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
you know was um um um information was

presented by the state to the the
 
02:44:07.349 --> 02:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs and then there was oral
 
02:44:09.750 --> 02:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
argument on on what the outcome should
 
02:44:12.349 --> 02:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
be in that case um that occurred uh in
 
02:44:14.630 --> 02:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
mid January so we're just on the tail

end of we're awaiting a decision so I
 
02:44:17.750 --> 02:44:17.760 align:start position:0%

committee just knew obviously that
 
02:44:20.990 --> 02:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
there's there's some litigation on this
 
02:44:22.750 --> 02:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
law uh and I'm one of the lawyers
 
02:44:25.429 --> 02:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
involved in it and uh the reasons that
 
02:44:26.790 --> 02:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
that lawsuit was brought are just the
 
02:44:28.150 --> 02:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
same reasons that I'm going to evate to
 
02:44:30.070 --> 02:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
you the concerns that we have is that
 
02:44:33.030 --> 02:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
this law um is so unclear and vague that
 
02:44:34.950 --> 02:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
it it fails to provide necessary
 
02:44:37.230 --> 02:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
guidance to Educators about what they
 
02:44:40.870 --> 02:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
can and cannot teach uh in their uh
 
02:44:42.630 --> 02:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
their courses and I think the ultimate
 
02:44:44.230 --> 02:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
concern that we have is kind of the
 
02:44:46.429 --> 02:44:46.439 align:start position:0%
ambiguity surround rounding the concepts
 
02:44:47.870 --> 02:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
but it's accompanied with real real
 
02:44:50.630 --> 02:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
penalties right for educators um this
 
02:44:52.389 --> 02:44:52.399 align:start position:0%
has been bootstrapped into the educator
 
02:44:54.550 --> 02:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
code of conduct so you know if there's a
 
02:44:56.590 --> 02:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
violation there could be a whole host of
 
02:44:58.750 --> 02:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
of sanctions you know um going all the
 
02:45:00.950 --> 02:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
way up to um loss of license which is
 
02:45:02.150 --> 02:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
one of the the penalties under the
 
02:45:05.150 --> 02:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
educator code of conduct so the dynamic
 
02:45:07.429 --> 02:45:07.439 align:start position:0%
under this law right when you have uh
 
02:45:10.190 --> 02:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
ambiguous terms uh combined with real
 
02:45:11.990 --> 02:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
penalties for violations it just creates
 
02:45:14.150 --> 02:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
a natural chill in classrooms with
 
02:45:16.510 --> 02:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
respect to educators not wanting to get
 
02:45:18.590 --> 02:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
anywhere close to the perceived line
 
02:45:20.630 --> 02:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
whatever that line is when we're talking
 
02:45:23.110 --> 02:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
about race gender any any of those
 
02:45:25.750 --> 02:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
things so those are the core concerns um
 
02:45:29.349 --> 02:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
that we have had throughout um and you
 
02:45:31.269 --> 02:45:31.279 align:start position:0%
know I I I do just want to be very clear
 
02:45:32.389 --> 02:45:32.399 align:start position:0%
I just think there is tremendous
 
02:45:34.510 --> 02:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
uncertainty among Educators about what
 
02:45:37.790 --> 02:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
is is covered here you know is the book
 
02:45:39.389 --> 02:45:39.399 align:start position:0%
is Tiffany jueles book this is
 
02:45:41.349 --> 02:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
anti-racist Ban under the ACT which is
 
02:45:43.349 --> 02:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
one of the the books you know it's for
 
02:45:45.349 --> 02:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
middle school kids um it's about and you
 
02:45:47.190 --> 02:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
know kind of you know self-empowerment
 
02:45:48.750 --> 02:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
right including for students of color is
 
02:45:49.990 --> 02:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
that covered and it was one of the books
 
02:45:53.349 --> 02:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
flagged by various proponents um of this
 
02:45:54.910 --> 02:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
law and we can't even kind of get
 
02:45:56.550 --> 02:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
answers as to what's covered so I think
 
02:45:58.349 --> 02:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
that is really the underlying concern
 
02:45:59.950 --> 02:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
that that we have throughout so for all
 
02:46:01.750 --> 02:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
those reasons we would just ask and the
 
02:46:03.670 --> 02:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
reasons in my written testimony we would
 
02:46:05.110 --> 02:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
ask uh for the support of this
 
02:46:06.790 --> 02:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you very much
 
02:46:10.309 --> 02:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli thank you thank
 
02:46:12.190 --> 02:46:12.200 align:start position:0%
you for still being here thank you
 
02:46:13.990 --> 02:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative maybe you could point out
 
02:46:17.870 --> 02:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
to us um you mentioned um vague terms
 
02:46:19.269 --> 02:46:19.279 align:start position:0%
should you point out a couple of vague
 
02:46:21.870 --> 02:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
terms to us absolutely um how long do
 
02:46:23.349 --> 02:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
you have
 
02:46:26.990 --> 02:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
um so uh you know if you want to buy
 
02:46:29.870 --> 02:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
lunch let let me just start with there's
 
02:46:32.870 --> 02:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
really two I mean I can okay I'll keep
 
02:46:34.590 --> 02:46:34.600 align:start position:0%
it very succinct just to just some of
 
02:46:36.349 --> 02:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
the core problems but there are many
 
02:46:39.469 --> 02:46:39.479 align:start position:0%
right so look at Concepts band Concepts
 
02:46:41.790 --> 02:46:41.800 align:start position:0%
three and four right there are questions
 
02:46:43.870 --> 02:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
does this include instruction or even
 
02:46:45.750 --> 02:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
teaching or even discuss ing things like
 
02:46:48.469 --> 02:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
affirmative action right which is a race
 
02:46:51.429 --> 02:46:51.439 align:start position:0%
conscious approach to remedying racism
 
02:46:53.990 --> 02:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
well I think arguably that would be
 
02:46:56.269 --> 02:46:56.279 align:start position:0%
covered under Roman numerals 3 or 4 or
 
02:46:58.349 --> 02:46:58.359 align:start position:0%
maybe not depending on who you talk to
 
02:47:00.790 --> 02:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
right Could you teach Justice Sodom
 
02:47:02.269 --> 02:47:02.279 align:start position:0%
mayor's descent in the Reese's
 
02:47:03.790 --> 02:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
affirmative action case which talks
 
02:47:05.670 --> 02:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
about the importance of race conscious
 
02:47:07.910 --> 02:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
remedies could that be included in a
 
02:47:09.670 --> 02:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
discussion right because it's not just
 
02:47:11.630 --> 02:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
the teaching that's baned under this law
 
02:47:14.389 --> 02:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
it shall be taught we all know that in
 
02:47:16.190 --> 02:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
in school it's not just teachers that
 
02:47:17.990 --> 02:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
are instructing it's also things are
 
02:47:19.590 --> 02:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
done you know can be done through kind
 
02:47:21.990 --> 02:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
of the Socratic method style right all
 
02:47:23.830 --> 02:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
of those things highlight the
 
02:47:26.469 --> 02:47:26.479 align:start position:0%
uncertainty that exists with this law
 
02:47:28.070 --> 02:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
right we all know that Educators like
 
02:47:29.710 --> 02:47:29.720 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and other professionals
 
02:47:31.230 --> 02:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
have to make split-second decisions in
 
02:47:32.910 --> 02:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
the classroom they need to respond to
 
02:47:35.389 --> 02:47:35.399 align:start position:0%
students and their questions and their
 
02:47:37.309 --> 02:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
concerns and so with all of these terms
 
02:47:39.389 --> 02:47:39.399 align:start position:0%
they just don't know where the the line
 
02:47:41.150 --> 02:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
is even to do something as simple and
 
02:47:43.349 --> 02:47:43.359 align:start position:0%
basic as to validate the concerns that a
 
02:47:46.389 --> 02:47:46.399 align:start position:0%
student may be presenting right so I I I
 
02:47:48.190 --> 02:47:48.200 align:start position:0%
don't mean to give a longwinded answer
 
02:47:50.230 --> 02:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
um I just I think that's just one of
 
02:47:52.150 --> 02:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
many concerns that that we have had and
 
02:47:54.429 --> 02:47:54.439 align:start position:0%
why the litigation was brought thank you
 
02:47:56.710 --> 02:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
representative Damon thank you thank you
 
02:47:58.710 --> 02:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question thank you
 
02:48:01.590 --> 02:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative could you comment about
 
02:48:03.150 --> 02:48:03.160 align:start position:0%
the existing
 
02:48:06.389 --> 02:48:06.399 align:start position:0%
law and how it could
 
02:48:10.030 --> 02:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
impact uh a health teacher or school
 
02:48:12.630 --> 02:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
nurse perhaps talking with students
 
02:48:15.349 --> 02:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
about body size and
 
02:48:19.630 --> 02:48:19.640 align:start position:0%
about the fact that large
 
02:48:22.150 --> 02:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
people are often discriminated
 
02:48:23.910 --> 02:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
discriminated against for instance in
 
02:48:27.670 --> 02:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
hiring decisions yeah and how does that
 
02:48:30.110 --> 02:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
uh how is that in I think that's a great
 
02:48:32.510 --> 02:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
question and it is um you know one of
 
02:48:34.790 --> 02:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
the examples right is just look at kind
 
02:48:37.910 --> 02:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
of disability Doctrine right one of the
 
02:48:40.150 --> 02:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
concepts that we have under the Ada is
 
02:48:42.630 --> 02:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
that we don't treat all individuals
 
02:48:44.950 --> 02:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
equally but as a matter of equity we we
 
02:48:46.429 --> 02:48:46.439 align:start position:0%
actually give certain individuals
 
02:48:47.950 --> 02:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
including those with disabilities
 
02:48:50.670 --> 02:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
actually different treatment in order to
 
02:48:52.750 --> 02:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
create Equity we're actually uh you know
 
02:48:54.710 --> 02:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
providing reasonable com accommodations
 
02:48:57.269 --> 02:48:57.279 align:start position:0%
in part because of those differences by
 
02:48:58.870 --> 02:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
kind of throwing disability in the
 
02:49:01.389 --> 02:49:01.399 align:start position:0%
statute it kind of really it it it
 
02:49:02.870 --> 02:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
creates these questions well like gosh
 
02:49:04.070 --> 02:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
could you even like talk about that
 
02:49:06.990 --> 02:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
basic concept um so I just want to throw
 
02:49:08.910 --> 02:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
but put that example out there because I
 
02:49:10.830 --> 02:49:10.840 align:start position:0%
think it's even outside the race gender
 
02:49:12.309 --> 02:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
context in which we kind of normally
 
02:49:13.790 --> 02:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
discuss some of the concerns we have
 
02:49:16.269 --> 02:49:16.279 align:start position:0%
with this bill there are other areas as
 
02:49:18.110 --> 02:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
well and I just think it it shows the
 
02:49:20.190 --> 02:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
Law's amb ambiguity the kind of
 
02:49:22.550 --> 02:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
clunkiness you know in in just how it's
 
02:49:24.229 --> 02:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
was originally written I'm not accusing
 
02:49:26.150 --> 02:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
anyone here of clunkiness I'm just as a
 
02:49:27.590 --> 02:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
lawyer kind of looking at it and trying
 
02:49:30.429 --> 02:49:30.439 align:start position:0%
to think about its practical effect
 
02:49:32.990 --> 02:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Ron
 
02:49:36.349 --> 02:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
Damon so if I were that health teacher
 
02:49:39.229 --> 02:49:39.239 align:start position:0%
and I prior to this
 
02:49:43.190 --> 02:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
law might have presented or fostered
 
02:49:46.389 --> 02:49:46.399 align:start position:0%
discussion with students
 
02:49:48.110 --> 02:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
around the possibility that a large
 
02:49:51.070 --> 02:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
person can also be a very healthy person
 
02:49:53.309 --> 02:49:53.319 align:start position:0%
depending on their life style behaviors
 
02:49:55.429 --> 02:49:55.439 align:start position:0%
and how they take care of themselves
 
02:49:58.750 --> 02:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
would I now be on a uncomfortable
 
02:50:00.990 --> 02:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
terrain to do that well you you
 
02:50:03.110 --> 02:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
certainly would be if you suggested that
 
02:50:05.389 --> 02:50:05.399 align:start position:0%
you know to to um accommodate that
 
02:50:06.990 --> 02:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
individual to make sure that they have
 
02:50:08.670 --> 02:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
all the opportunities that everyone else
 
02:50:10.469 --> 02:50:10.479 align:start position:0%
has they they should be treated a
 
02:50:11.590 --> 02:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
certain way maybe in ways that's
 
02:50:13.030 --> 02:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
different from someone else in order to
 
02:50:15.349 --> 02:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
ensure equity in school I think that's
 
02:50:17.590 --> 02:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
actually precisely where um you could be
 
02:50:19.590 --> 02:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
running a foul of this lost terms and
 
02:50:21.190 --> 02:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that you know this the
 
02:50:22.429 --> 02:50:22.439 align:start position:0%
proponents of this say that's not what
 
02:50:25.630 --> 02:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
we meant but you know it it I think it's
 
02:50:27.630 --> 02:50:27.640 align:start position:0%
in the text of the statute and when you
 
02:50:29.990 --> 02:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
combine it with penalties boy that's the
 
02:50:34.670 --> 02:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
recipe for real real concerns represent
 
02:50:36.830 --> 02:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
R thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:50:37.830 --> 02:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you
 
02:50:39.190 --> 02:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
representative is the intent of the
 
02:50:41.190 --> 02:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
lawsuit the same as the intent of this
 
02:50:43.910 --> 02:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
bill and when are you thinking there
 
02:50:47.150 --> 02:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
might be a decision uh the the um the
 
02:50:48.950 --> 02:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
relief that's sought in the lawsuit is
 
02:50:52.190 --> 02:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
is a a junction against the law um when
 
02:50:54.830 --> 02:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
there would uh which when will that
 
02:50:56.750 --> 02:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
happen I don't know I don't think we
 
02:50:58.870 --> 02:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
should be discussing that here I I don't
 
02:51:00.429 --> 02:51:00.439 align:start position:0%
the short answer is I don't know but I
 
02:51:01.590 --> 02:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure the committee
 
02:51:03.750 --> 02:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
knew thank you very much than you
 
02:51:05.870 --> 02:51:05.880 align:start position:0%

officing

02:51:18.830 --> 02:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:20.469 --> 02:51:20.479 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good afternoon chairman
 
02:51:21.870 --> 02:51:21.880 align:start position:0%
lad members of the House Education
 
02:51:23.030 --> 02:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
committee I will submit written
 
02:51:24.670 --> 02:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
testimony I have three paragraphs to
 
02:51:26.110 --> 02:51:26.120 align:start position:0%
read because most of what I was going to
 
02:51:27.510 --> 02:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
say has already been said and so I don't
 
02:51:29.070 --> 02:51:29.080 align:start position:0%
want to repeat anything in interest of
 
02:51:30.950 --> 02:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
time for the record I'm Megan tutle
 
02:51:32.110 --> 02:51:32.120 align:start position:0%
president for NAA New Hampshire
 
02:51:33.790 --> 02:51:33.800 align:start position:0%
representing about 177,000 Educators
 
02:51:36.190 --> 02:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
across the state I'm also a mom of three
 
02:51:37.870 --> 02:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
boys that do attend public school so
 
02:51:40.070 --> 02:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
this does affect me that way as well and
 
02:51:41.990 --> 02:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
an 18year veteran social studies teacher
 
02:51:44.590 --> 02:51:44.600 align:start position:0%
of 8th grade and New Hampshire from the
 
02:51:46.550 --> 02:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
beginning has held that the current laws
 
02:51:47.830 --> 02:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
vagueness would have that chilling
 
02:51:50.269 --> 02:51:50.279 align:start position:0%
effect on Educators throughout the state
 
02:51:51.710 --> 02:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
we've watched this law in action for the
 
02:51:53.750 --> 02:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
past 2 and a half years we know it's
 
02:51:56.150 --> 02:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
true and I can't say anything else other
 
02:51:57.830 --> 02:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
than what M Wilson has said and so I'm
 
02:51:59.110 --> 02:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
just going to leave the testimony for
 
02:52:01.309 --> 02:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
that um for how it's actually impacted
 
02:52:03.510 --> 02:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
them last thing teachers are trained and
 
02:52:05.349 --> 02:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
experienced in education they have a
 
02:52:06.710 --> 02:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
duty to set their students up to be
 
02:52:09.030 --> 02:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
successful contributors to society an
 
02:52:10.349 --> 02:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
educator should have that freedom to
 
02:52:11.950 --> 02:52:11.960 align:start position:0%
teach honest complete facts about
 
02:52:13.590 --> 02:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
historical events like slavery civil
 
02:52:15.309 --> 02:52:15.319 align:start position:0%
rights without their licenses and
 
02:52:17.870 --> 02:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
livelihoods put at risk by the vague law
 
02:52:20.110 --> 02:52:20.120 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1162 restores the ability to
 
02:52:21.710 --> 02:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
provide diverse educational approaches
 
02:52:23.590 --> 02:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
to instruction and curriculum that's
 
02:52:25.269 --> 02:52:25.279 align:start position:0%
tailored to meet students needs our
 
02:52:27.030 --> 02:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
students deserve that freedom to learn
 
02:52:28.150 --> 02:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
they deserve to be partner with
 
02:52:29.469 --> 02:52:29.479 align:start position:0%
education that helps them learn from the
 
02:52:31.229 --> 02:52:31.239 align:start position:0%
mistakes of the past so they're better
 
02:52:32.510 --> 02:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
prepared to
 
02:52:34.550 --> 02:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
succeed and on behalf of Na New
 
02:52:35.750 --> 02:52:35.760 align:start position:0%

thank you very much are there any
 
02:52:45.429 --> 02:52:45.439 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
02:52:49.309 --> 02:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
Woodcock good afternoon good afternoon a
 
02:52:52.510 --> 02:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
quick question do you believe that um
 
02:52:57.910 --> 02:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
your fellow Nea teachers um have backed
 
02:53:01.590 --> 02:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
away from the how and wise sensus or do
 
02:53:02.830 --> 02:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
you think they just saw said forget
 
02:53:05.150 --> 02:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
about just gone on thank you for the
 
02:53:06.870 --> 02:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
question I absolutely believe they have
 
02:53:09.229 --> 02:53:09.239 align:start position:0%
backed away from it and part of the
 
02:53:11.950 --> 02:53:11.960 align:start position:0%
lawsuit is a lot of those examples on
 
02:53:13.630 --> 02:53:13.640 align:start position:0%
what teachers have not done and what
 
02:53:14.990 --> 02:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
they've stopped doing from what they did
 
02:53:17.190 --> 02:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
before and I I know I've submitted those
 
02:53:19.630 --> 02:53:19.640 align:start position:0%
examples before as well welcome further
 
02:53:22.990 --> 02:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee represent
 
02:53:26.510 --> 02:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
laus thank you for taking my question do
 
02:53:28.710 --> 02:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
you believe that there's a difference
 
02:53:33.030 --> 02:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
between teaching that somebody believes
 
02:53:36.910 --> 02:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
that um let's take one example that
 
02:53:39.950 --> 02:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
whites are better than blacks or that is
 
02:53:43.790 --> 02:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
different or the same as teaching that
 
02:53:46.990 --> 02:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
there are people who believe that black
 
02:53:48.710 --> 02:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
whites are better than blacks thank you
 
02:53:50.150 --> 02:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
for the question I do believe there's a
 
02:53:51.870 --> 02:53:51.880 align:start position:0%
difference but what is happening with
 
02:53:53.950 --> 02:53:53.960 align:start position:0%
this law is educators are so afraid
 
02:53:55.110 --> 02:53:55.120 align:start position:0%
teachers are so afraid that they're
 
02:53:57.070 --> 02:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
going to lose their license over this
 
02:53:58.670 --> 02:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to lose their livelihood
 
02:54:01.070 --> 02:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
and when you have that consequence as
 
02:54:03.269 --> 02:54:03.279 align:start position:0%
part of a law that's I'll be honest
 
02:54:04.870 --> 02:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
vague I mean that's what the lawsuit is
 
02:54:07.429 --> 02:54:07.439 align:start position:0%
about and we ask for clarification on
 
02:54:08.630 --> 02:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
what couldn't couldn't be taught
 
02:54:09.990 --> 02:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
specifics from the Department of
 
02:54:11.269 --> 02:54:11.279 align:start position:0%
Education and from the Attorney
 
02:54:12.870 --> 02:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
General's office and never received any
 
02:54:15.110 --> 02:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
answers and so
 
02:54:16.990 --> 02:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
what's happening is you know I've been
 
02:54:18.790 --> 02:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
asked many times in this committee what
 
02:54:21.469 --> 02:54:21.479 align:start position:0%
is vague about it and the the problem is
 
02:54:23.510 --> 02:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
it it just truly is vague educators are
 
02:54:25.469 --> 02:54:25.479 align:start position:0%
too afraid that something's going to
 
02:54:26.830 --> 02:54:26.840 align:start position:0%
happen they'll be brought up on an
 
02:54:28.590 --> 02:54:28.600 align:start position:0%
investigation it's going to get through
 
02:54:29.990 --> 02:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
social media they're going to be dragged
 
02:54:31.590 --> 02:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
through the mud their their potential of
 
02:54:33.309 --> 02:54:33.319 align:start position:0%
losing their livelihood their license to
 
02:54:35.389 --> 02:54:35.399 align:start position:0%
teach is what's stopping them from
 
02:54:37.150 --> 02:54:37.160 align:start position:0%
teaching some of the things that this
 
02:54:38.590 --> 02:54:38.600 align:start position:0%
part people have said that they could
 
02:54:38.600 --> 02:54:39.950 align:start position:0%
part people have said that they could
still

02:54:39.950 --> 02:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
still
 
02:54:42.429 --> 02:54:42.439 align:start position:0%
teach thank you very
 
02:54:45.309 --> 02:54:45.319 align:start position:0%
much thank you thank you I like to call
 
02:54:45.319 --> 02:54:54.710 align:start position:0%
much thank you thank you I like to call
Maya

02:54:54.710 --> 02:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:57.910 --> 02:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
angelbert hello my name is m Mia long
 
02:55:03.710 --> 02:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
time no see um I yeah I might not be a
 
02:55:05.750 --> 02:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
lawyer or a teacher or anything like
 
02:55:07.750 --> 02:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
that but like everyone else in this room
 
02:55:10.309 --> 02:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
I have been a student and I would like
 
02:55:13.750 --> 02:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
to tell a story um when I was in school
 
02:55:16.950 --> 02:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
I learned like most of you that
 
02:55:18.670 --> 02:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
Christopher Columbus sailed the ocean
 
02:55:20.469 --> 02:55:20.479 align:start position:0%
blue in
 
02:55:23.550 --> 02:55:23.560 align:start position:0%
1492 in high school I learned there was
 
02:55:25.630 --> 02:55:25.640 align:start position:0%
more to the story than that I learned
 
02:55:29.349 --> 02:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
about how he took the natives as slaves
 
02:55:31.790 --> 02:55:31.800 align:start position:0%
how he subjugated them how he stole the
 
02:55:34.190 --> 02:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
natural resources of the West Indies and
 
02:55:35.750 --> 02:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
brought them back to
 
02:55:38.309 --> 02:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
Spain and I don't think that students
 
02:55:40.150 --> 02:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
could learn that sort of thing nowadays
 
02:55:43.190 --> 02:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
because it makes some people feel
 
02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:44.950 align:start position:0%
because it makes some people feel
uncomfortable

02:55:44.950 --> 02:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable
 
02:55:47.950 --> 02:55:47.960 align:start position:0%
and also history isn't just a set of
 
02:55:52.150 --> 02:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
facts it it's a series of events that
 
02:55:53.550 --> 02:55:53.560 align:start position:0%
relate to each
 
02:55:57.870 --> 02:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
other that what happened in the past is
 
02:55:59.550 --> 02:55:59.560 align:start position:0%
directly related to what's happening
 
02:56:02.269 --> 02:56:02.279 align:start position:0%
today and we need the historical context
 
02:56:05.670 --> 02:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
to understand current world
 
02:56:09.870 --> 02:56:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:12.510 --> 02:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
um I feel like I'm just rambling but the
 
02:56:16.070 --> 02:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
point is I think students can be trusted
 
02:56:19.630 --> 02:56:19.640 align:start position:0%
with not just facts but how to interpret
 
02:56:19.640 --> 02:56:21.710 align:start position:0%
with not just facts but how to interpret
those

02:56:21.710 --> 02:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:56:24.150 --> 02:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
facts uh not how to interpret those
 
02:56:25.830 --> 02:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
facts I can learn how to interpret those
 
02:56:28.510 --> 02:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
facts in a way that supports their own
 
02:56:31.950 --> 02:56:31.960 align:start position:0%
worldview with facts and logic and yeah
 
02:56:34.510 --> 02:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
I yeah I'm definitely rambling but thank
 
02:56:36.750 --> 02:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
you for listening to me thank you very
 
02:56:38.510 --> 02:56:38.520 align:start position:0%

02:57:30.229 --> 02:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
behalf of our 3700 members across the
 
02:57:32.070 --> 02:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
state and all the public school students
 
02:57:36.710 --> 02:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
that we uh educate in support of HB
 
02:57:39.550 --> 02:57:39.560 align:start position:0%
1162 and um the main reason we are
 
02:57:44.269 --> 02:57:44.279 align:start position:0%
supporting this is as has been so um a
 
02:57:46.190 --> 02:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
really testified to
 
02:57:49.750 --> 02:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
already the divisive Concepts law is one
 
02:57:51.309 --> 02:57:51.319 align:start position:0%
we didn't need it was a problem we
 
02:57:54.229 --> 02:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
didn't have we didn't have public school
 
02:57:56.269 --> 02:57:56.279 align:start position:0%
teachers teaching any curriculum in the
 
02:57:59.269 --> 02:57:59.279 align:start position:0%
state that was uh instructing students
 
02:58:01.830 --> 02:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
that anyone was inherently Superior or
 
02:58:04.389 --> 02:58:04.399 align:start position:0%
inferior to anyone else it just wasn't
 
02:58:06.870 --> 02:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
going on as a curriculum if there were
 
02:58:08.469 --> 02:58:08.479 align:start position:0%
individual instances they should have
 
02:58:11.550 --> 02:58:11.560 align:start position:0%
been handled uh through the local
 
02:58:11.560 --> 02:58:12.910 align:start position:0%
been handled uh through the local
disciplinary

02:58:12.910 --> 02:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
disciplinary
 
02:58:16.309 --> 02:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
procedures so that was casting a broad
 
02:58:18.510 --> 02:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
net and taring all of our Educators in
 
02:58:21.070 --> 02:58:21.080 align:start position:0%
the State uh with allegations that
 
02:58:22.389 --> 02:58:22.399 align:start position:0%
something was going on in schools that
 
02:58:26.389 --> 02:58:26.399 align:start position:0%
just wasn't happening um getting rid of
 
02:58:28.710 --> 02:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
that law would really be a relief
 
02:58:31.990 --> 02:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
because the effect of this law this
 
02:58:34.750 --> 02:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
divisive Concepts law has been
 
02:58:38.590 --> 02:58:38.600 align:start position:0%
to make the education all Republic scho
 
02:58:40.510 --> 02:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
school students are getting
 
02:58:43.309 --> 02:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
worse they are not receiving the rich
 
02:58:45.990 --> 02:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
robust instruction in history that they
 
02:58:49.670 --> 02:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
deserve the teachers are concerned
 
02:58:49.680 --> 02:58:51.190 align:start position:0%
deserve the teachers are concerned
about

02:58:51.190 --> 02:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:58:53.870 --> 02:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
teaching in ways where students are able
 
02:58:56.670 --> 02:58:56.680 align:start position:0%
to connect events to each other to go
 
02:58:59.469 --> 02:58:59.479 align:start position:0%
beyond just the straightforward here are
 
02:59:01.389 --> 02:59:01.399 align:start position:0%
the who what and why and make
 
02:59:03.190 --> 02:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
connections between what happened in the
 
02:59:05.229 --> 02:59:05.239 align:start position:0%
past and how they relate to each other
 
02:59:08.910 --> 02:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
and what's happening now um you have
 
02:59:11.150 --> 02:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
language arts teachers who are concerned
 
02:59:14.229 --> 02:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
about teaching specific novels they have
 
02:59:16.150 --> 02:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
already taught in the past they've
 
02:59:18.070 --> 02:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
always taught in the past a middle
 
02:59:20.349 --> 02:59:20.359 align:start position:0%
school teacher who has always taught to
 
02:59:23.950 --> 02:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
Kill a Mocking Bird has not assigned it
 
02:59:26.429 --> 02:59:26.439 align:start position:0%
since this law is passed she is afraid
 
02:59:29.790 --> 02:59:29.800 align:start position:0%
of losing her license because she does
 
02:59:33.590 --> 02:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
not want to be brought up on um a
 
02:59:35.630 --> 02:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
complaint under this law even though
 
02:59:37.269 --> 02:59:37.279 align:start position:0%
it's been part of the curriculum in the
 
02:59:39.950 --> 02:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
past and uh there's been exactly one
 
02:59:42.269 --> 02:59:42.279 align:start position:0%
complaint filed under this law since it
 
02:59:44.710 --> 02:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
was passed one
 
02:59:46.070 --> 02:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
so if this is such a problem that we
 
02:59:48.750 --> 02:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
need a law against it how come there's
 
02:59:50.349 --> 02:59:50.359 align:start position:0%
only been one complaint I do ever in
 
02:59:51.790 --> 02:59:51.800 align:start position:0%
testimony and it will pass that around
 
02:59:53.229 --> 02:59:53.239 align:start position:0%
very much thank you very much other
 
02:59:58.070 --> 02:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:01.110 --> 03:00:01.120 align:start position:0%
leus you said and we've heard from
 
03:00:04.510 --> 03:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
others that we're brushing teachers with
 
03:00:08.550 --> 03:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
a broad Stroke by this law that somehow
 
03:00:11.070 --> 03:00:11.080 align:start position:0%
we're saying that all teachers are
 
03:00:14.550 --> 03:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
bad and I'm wondering if we pass law
 
03:00:18.510 --> 03:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
that says people should not steal are we
 
03:00:21.870 --> 03:00:21.880 align:start position:0%
then brushing all people with a brush
 
03:00:23.870 --> 03:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
that says all people are bad because we
 
03:00:26.229 --> 03:00:26.239 align:start position:0%
passed a law saying what people
 
03:00:26.239 --> 03:00:39.710 align:start position:0%
passed a law saying what people
shouldn't

03:00:39.710 --> 03:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:42.670 --> 03:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
do you don't have to answer questions
 
03:00:44.990 --> 03:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I I don't think that really is a
 
03:00:47.630 --> 03:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
serious question so thank you yeah are
 
03:00:49.429 --> 03:00:49.439 align:start position:0%
further questions from the
 
03:00:52.070 --> 03:00:52.080 align:start position:0%

Bill thank you Mr chair um for the
 
03:58:31.990 --> 03:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
record I'm representative Linda Tanner I
 
03:58:35.550 --> 03:58:35.560 align:start position:0%
represent Sullivan 5 District 5 uh the
 
03:58:38.229 --> 03:58:38.239 align:start position:0%
beautiful towns of Springfield and cipy
 
03:58:38.239 --> 03:58:39.710 align:start position:0%
beautiful towns of Springfield and cipy
and

03:58:39.710 --> 03:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:58:46.349 --> 03:58:46.359 align:start position:0%
um this bill that I did in September
 
03:58:49.990 --> 03:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
um uh has two issues basically within
 
03:58:55.110 --> 03:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
the bill uh first um it's the code of e
 
03:58:57.510 --> 03:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
ethics um IT addresses the code of
 
03:59:01.189 --> 03:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
ethics used as a a weapon um that it was
 
03:59:03.030 --> 03:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
not meant to be nor should be used as a
 
03:59:04.910 --> 03:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
sticker of punishment for intimidating
 
03:59:07.030 --> 03:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
investigating or threatening the loss of
 
03:59:08.670 --> 03:59:08.680 align:start position:0%
a teaching credential for what how
 
03:59:11.510 --> 03:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
teachers teach uh the committee that
 
03:59:13.070 --> 03:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
wrote the code never meant to punish
 
03:59:15.510 --> 03:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
teachers for doing their job and then
 
03:59:17.790 --> 03:59:17.800 align:start position:0%
the second part uh that I tried to
 
03:59:19.429 --> 03:59:19.439 align:start position:0%
address was I tried to give a Band-Aid
 
03:59:21.510 --> 03:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
for teachers who are wrongly accused and
 
03:59:23.830 --> 03:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
investigated as well as boost morale by
 
03:59:26.070 --> 03:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
providing a bill that was meant to help
 
03:59:26.080 --> 03:59:27.630 align:start position:0%
providing a bill that was meant to help
teachers

03:59:27.630 --> 03:59:27.640 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
03:59:31.110 --> 03:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
um I did this bill back in September and
 
03:59:33.030 --> 03:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
I have to be honest that as I looked at
 
03:59:34.469 --> 03:59:34.479 align:start position:0%
the bill last week when I was getting
 
03:59:37.429 --> 03:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
ready for this um that the first part of
 
03:59:39.070 --> 03:59:39.080 align:start position:0%
it with the Band-Aid
 
03:59:42.469 --> 03:59:42.479 align:start position:0%
part um is not written the way I would
 
03:59:44.590 --> 03:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
really like it to be written it isn't
 
03:59:46.550 --> 03:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
precise enough it doesn't it's kind of
 
03:59:49.630 --> 03:59:49.640 align:start position:0%
vague and uh leaves a lot of loose ends
 
03:59:51.710 --> 03:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
um but the second part of the bill the
 
03:59:54.510 --> 03:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
part about the code of ethics um I think
 
03:59:56.349 --> 03:59:56.359 align:start position:0%
is still really important and that's why
 
04:00:01.550 --> 04:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
I'm here presenting this bill um and
 
04:00:05.309 --> 04:00:05.319 align:start position:0%
um you know my my intent was to stop and
 
04:00:07.070 --> 04:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
reverse the trend of unreasonable
 
04:00:09.030 --> 04:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
unfounded attacks on public education
 
04:00:09.040 --> 04:00:09.830 align:start position:0%
unfounded attacks on public education
and

04:00:09.830 --> 04:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:00:12.750 --> 04:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
teachers which uh demoralizes threatens
 
04:00:14.349 --> 04:00:14.359 align:start position:0%
those currently in the classroom with
 
04:00:15.590 --> 04:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
the loss of their livelihood and
 
04:00:18.950 --> 04:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
dissuades those seeking to enter the
 
04:00:21.309 --> 04:00:21.319 align:start position:0%
profession therefore I'm offering an
 
04:00:25.229 --> 04:00:25.239 align:start position:0%
amendment uh which I put on your desk um
 
04:00:25.239 --> 04:00:27.469 align:start position:0%
amendment uh which I put on your desk um
Amendment

04:00:27.469 --> 04:00:27.479 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
04:00:31.750 --> 04:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
0499 um which is going to uh replace the
 
04:00:35.229 --> 04:00:35.239 align:start position:0%
bill and really focus on the code of
 
04:00:37.990 --> 04:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
ethics and the New Hampshire code of
 
04:00:40.349 --> 04:00:40.359 align:start position:0%
ethics I was around when it was uh
 
04:00:43.149 --> 04:00:43.159 align:start position:0%
developed it was had a really nice
 
04:00:46.189 --> 04:00:46.199 align:start position:0%
Commission of a lot of stakeholders and
 
04:00:47.990 --> 04:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
it was meant to provide professional
 
04:00:50.710 --> 04:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
Educators with guidance for all and all
 
04:00:56.189 --> 04:00:56.199 align:start position:0%
School Personnel um and it was laid out
 
04:00:59.830 --> 04:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
so that it would be well understood and
 
04:01:02.630 --> 04:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
and easy to kind of easy to follow and
 
04:01:04.830 --> 04:01:04.840 align:start position:0%
then as it progressed after it came in
 
04:01:07.550 --> 04:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
and uh it seemed like it popped up in
 
04:01:10.070 --> 04:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
various laws as the last little stick
 
04:01:13.630 --> 04:01:13.640 align:start position:0%
that you know this um this bill if you
 
04:01:16.790 --> 04:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
violate this bill um it it's considered
 
04:01:18.830 --> 04:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
a violation of the code of ethics in
 
04:01:21.550 --> 04:01:21.560 align:start position:0%
fact we find we got a technical advisory
 
04:01:23.149 --> 04:01:23.159 align:start position:0%
this morning that just about set me off
 
04:01:25.429 --> 04:01:25.439 align:start position:0%
the roof um from the Department of
 
04:01:28.349 --> 04:01:28.359 align:start position:0%
Education about the code of ethics um
 
04:01:30.550 --> 04:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
involved with teachers talking to
 
04:01:32.830 --> 04:01:32.840 align:start position:0%
students outside of health and sex ed
 
04:01:35.110 --> 04:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
classes uh which if you haven't read yet
 
04:01:38.590 --> 04:01:38.600 align:start position:0%
you should anyway um as you can see this
 
04:01:42.070 --> 04:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
this amendment what the amendment does
 
04:01:45.469 --> 04:01:45.479 align:start position:0%
is it takes this the same language from
 
04:01:47.750 --> 04:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
the code of ethics so the code of ethics
 
04:01:49.349 --> 04:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh the New Hampshire code of ethics for
 
04:01:52.110 --> 04:01:52.120 align:start position:0%
professional Educators shall establish
 
04:01:54.550 --> 04:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
guidance for all School personnel and
 
04:01:57.349 --> 04:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
then the addition really is and shall
 
04:01:57.359 --> 04:01:58.550 align:start position:0%
then the addition really is and shall
not

04:01:58.550 --> 04:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:02:01.229 --> 04:02:01.239 align:start position:0%
be uh in the code of ethics it says it
 
04:02:04.469 --> 04:02:04.479 align:start position:0%
is not intended for but I Chang that to
 
04:02:06.670 --> 04:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
shall not be the basis for civil
 
04:02:09.269 --> 04:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
liability nor basis for employment
 
04:02:11.670 --> 04:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
action and then the last sentence again
 
04:02:14.149 --> 04:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
is something that I added further the
 
04:02:15.790 --> 04:02:15.800 align:start position:0%
code shall not be used to limit or
 
04:02:18.790 --> 04:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
restrict the Educator's use of pedagogy
 
04:02:20.790 --> 04:02:20.800 align:start position:0%
or curriculum approved by the local
 
04:02:23.469 --> 04:02:23.479 align:start position:0%
school board and that sometimes
 
04:02:26.550 --> 04:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
conflicts with there's all kinds of con
 
04:02:28.830 --> 04:02:28.840 align:start position:0%
conf conflictions with
 
04:02:28.840 --> 04:02:30.389 align:start position:0%
conf conflictions with
different

04:02:30.389 --> 04:02:30.399 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:02:34.149 --> 04:02:34.159 align:start position:0%
um state laws federal laws Schoolboard
 
04:02:37.590 --> 04:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
decisions that sort of thing um I don't
 
04:02:39.990 --> 04:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
think sometimes people realize how hard
 
04:02:42.189 --> 04:02:42.199 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:02:45.830 --> 04:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
um for people who have worked in schools
 
04:02:48.269 --> 04:02:48.279 align:start position:0%
um for the teachers that come to testify
 
04:02:50.149 --> 04:02:50.159 align:start position:0%
or those Educators listening to this
 
04:02:53.110 --> 04:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
committee meetings to sit and listen to
 
04:02:55.990 --> 04:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
being disrespected accusations inuendos
 
04:02:58.070 --> 04:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
about our competency or
 
04:02:58.080 --> 04:02:59.950 align:start position:0%
about our competency or
professionalism

04:02:59.950 --> 04:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
professionalism
 
04:03:02.790 --> 04:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
um it to spend hours listening to the
 
04:03:04.469 --> 04:03:04.479 align:start position:0%
persistent drone of bills based on
 
04:03:07.070 --> 04:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
problems that don't exist on incomplete
 
04:03:09.670 --> 04:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
misinformation or unfounded antidotes
 
04:03:10.910 --> 04:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
taken out of
 
04:03:14.070 --> 04:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
context on a distorted focus on student
 
04:03:15.870 --> 04:03:15.880 align:start position:0%
underachievement and hear a total
 
04:03:17.670 --> 04:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
mistrust and dis disrespect for
 
04:03:20.269 --> 04:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
educators in the public school and then
 
04:03:22.309 --> 04:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
have the professional code of ethics
 
04:03:25.189 --> 04:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
used against us we have dedicated our
 
04:03:27.070 --> 04:03:27.080 align:start position:0%
career to public education to teaching
 
04:03:29.469 --> 04:03:29.479 align:start position:0%
and helping students grow we know the
 
04:03:31.269 --> 04:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
hard work and dedication that actually
 
04:03:33.710 --> 04:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
goes on into teaching every day in the
 
04:03:36.670 --> 04:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
classrooms around our state we know the
 
04:03:38.070 --> 04:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
skills needed to meet the chall
 
04:03:40.910 --> 04:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
challenges and responsibilities with 30
 
04:03:43.030 --> 04:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
or more Elementary children in a
 
04:03:46.030 --> 04:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
classroom all day or work with 100 or
 
04:03:47.910 --> 04:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
150 middle school or high school
 
04:03:50.870 --> 04:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
students each day we know what it's like
 
04:03:53.389 --> 04:03:53.399 align:start position:0%
to be that trusted adult for students to
 
04:03:55.710 --> 04:03:55.720 align:start position:0%
celebrate their joy and in the tough
 
04:03:58.189 --> 04:03:58.199 align:start position:0%
times their sadness we know the
 
04:04:00.030 --> 04:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
challenges we set before our students
 
04:04:01.790 --> 04:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
and see them succeed and reach those
 
04:04:03.870 --> 04:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
goals and
 
04:04:06.110 --> 04:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
Beyond I'm proud of all our public
 
04:04:08.189 --> 04:04:08.199 align:start position:0%

04:04:11.349 --> 04:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
thank them educat are professionals and
 
04:04:14.070 --> 04:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
they needed to be treated as such so
 
04:04:16.630 --> 04:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
that's the basis for my Amendment and
 
04:04:20.149 --> 04:04:20.159 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you thank you uh questions
 
04:04:21.550 --> 04:04:21.560 align:start position:0%
for representative Tanner uh
 
04:04:21.560 --> 04:04:24.349 align:start position:0%
for representative Tanner uh
representative

04:04:24.349 --> 04:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:26.710 --> 04:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
lakas thank you and thank you for taking
 
04:04:29.790 --> 04:04:29.800 align:start position:0%
my question sure my question has to do
 
04:04:33.229 --> 04:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
with the nor a basis for employment
 
04:04:37.189 --> 04:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
action and my understanding was that the
 
04:04:40.750 --> 04:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
very end of the code of ethics and
 
04:04:44.030 --> 04:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
conduct section the parts did have to do
 
04:04:44.040 --> 04:04:44.950 align:start position:0%
conduct section the parts did have to do
with

04:04:44.950 --> 04:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:04:49.349 --> 04:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
employment was reserved for very gross
 
04:04:53.469 --> 04:04:53.479 align:start position:0%
misconduct such as sexually assaulting a
 
04:04:57.269 --> 04:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
student and if we take that out can we
 
04:05:00.269 --> 04:05:00.279 align:start position:0%
still use that this is this is still
 
04:05:02.910 --> 04:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
here um there's still a section in
 
04:05:06.389 --> 04:05:06.399 align:start position:0%
statute about dismissal of teachers um
 
04:05:08.710 --> 04:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
when I first started teaching I was told
 
04:05:10.110 --> 04:05:10.120 align:start position:0%
that it was
 
04:05:12.750 --> 04:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
incompetence uh insubordination and
 
04:05:14.870 --> 04:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
immoral behavior that those were the
 
04:05:17.670 --> 04:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
general categories that were left I
 
04:05:20.670 --> 04:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
would you know I would assume um and I
 
04:05:23.429 --> 04:05:23.439 align:start position:0%
probably shouldn't assume but in law we
 
04:05:27.510 --> 04:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
have 21 different violations which uh if
 
04:05:29.710 --> 04:05:29.720 align:start position:0%
a person if that pops up in their
 
04:05:31.389 --> 04:05:31.399 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks are
 
04:05:33.590 --> 04:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
ineligible so I would assume those
 
04:05:36.510 --> 04:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
affect employment as well um and
 
04:05:38.389 --> 04:05:38.399 align:start position:0%
educators are supposed to
 
04:05:42.030 --> 04:05:42.040 align:start position:0%
reveal um if that happens if they
 
04:05:45.070 --> 04:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
get um criminally charged for any of
 
04:05:47.469 --> 04:05:47.479 align:start position:0%
those things um and usually the public
 
04:05:50.950 --> 04:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
knows before the everybody else knows so
 
04:05:53.469 --> 04:05:53.479 align:start position:0%
um yes this is this is like I said the
 
04:05:56.070 --> 04:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
only change in this particular sentence
 
04:05:59.790 --> 04:05:59.800 align:start position:0%
is that uh the shall not instead of not
 
04:06:03.309 --> 04:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
intended to be and the last uh sentence
 
04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
about the pedagogi and curriculum
 
04:06:09.229 --> 04:06:09.239 align:start position:0%

here um on this committee when the code
 
04:06:24.469 --> 04:06:24.479 align:start position:0%

04:06:32.349 --> 04:06:32.359 align:start position:0%
creation of the code of contract and the
 
04:06:34.349 --> 04:06:34.359 align:start position:0%

04:06:39.149 --> 04:06:39.159 align:start position:0%

of ethics and a code of conduct and
 
04:06:44.229 --> 04:06:44.239 align:start position:0%

04:15:12.990 --> 04:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
to one a particular variety
 
04:15:16.830 --> 04:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:20.550 --> 04:15:20.560 align:start position:0%

yesterday well I was thinking I usually
 
04:15:27.670 --> 04:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:31.349 --> 04:15:31.359 align:start position:0%

it do get home
 
04:15:36.000 --> 04:15:38.830 align:start position:0%
it do get home
t

04:15:38.830 --> 04:15:38.840 align:start position:0%

04:18:33.670 --> 04:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
excuse 147 totally different SI a long
 
04:18:37.070 --> 04:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
day um so uh we're on 164 three
 
04:18:38.429 --> 04:18:38.439 align:start position:0%
requiring school districts to make
 
04:18:39.910 --> 04:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum and instructional materials
 
04:18:41.910 --> 04:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
available on their web
 
04:18:44.070 --> 04:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
pages and let's
 
04:18:49.030 --> 04:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
see we have no reps represent leus would
 
04:19:05.630 --> 04:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:05.640 --> 04:19:11.109 align:start position:0%
 
co-sponsor

04:19:11.109 --> 04:19:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:14.189 --> 04:19:14.199 align:start position:0%
Alicia leus Hillsboro 38 Hudson and
 
04:19:19.030 --> 04:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:21.590 --> 04:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
1643 requiring school districts to make
 
04:19:23.389 --> 04:19:23.399 align:start position:0%
curriculum and instructional materials
 
04:19:25.630 --> 04:19:25.640 align:start position:0%
available on their web
 
04:19:30.349 --> 04:19:30.359 align:start position:0%
pages um I think when I at one point
 
04:19:32.189 --> 04:19:32.199 align:start position:0%
when I was a teacher this would have
 
04:19:32.199 --> 04:19:34.469 align:start position:0%
when I was a teacher this would have
been

04:19:34.469 --> 04:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
been
 
04:19:37.269 --> 04:19:37.279 align:start position:0%
complicated because I did lots of
 
04:19:39.990 --> 04:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
handouts that I did up and moted off but
 
04:19:43.109 --> 04:19:43.119 align:start position:0%
now we have computers and so
 
04:19:46.309 --> 04:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
now not only do I think it would be much
 
04:19:48.990 --> 04:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
simpler than it used to be but I also
 
04:19:50.309 --> 04:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
have always
 
04:19:53.070 --> 04:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
appreciated those teachers who posted
 
04:19:56.910 --> 04:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
those things on the web pages every day
 
04:19:58.510 --> 04:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
or at least weekly what they were going
 
04:20:01.950 --> 04:20:01.960 align:start position:0%
to be do as a parent it helped me um
 
04:20:03.990 --> 04:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
keep up with what my kids were doing and
 
04:20:06.630 --> 04:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
make sure they got their work done and
 
04:20:09.469 --> 04:20:09.479 align:start position:0%
that was really the biggest part for me
 
04:20:11.590 --> 04:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
was making sure they were doing what
 
04:20:14.670 --> 04:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
they were supposed to be doing and um I
 
04:20:16.429 --> 04:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
know one of her teachers every day would
 
04:20:17.950 --> 04:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
post this is what we
 
04:20:20.189 --> 04:20:20.199 align:start position:0%
covered and given that I'd have been
 
04:20:22.550 --> 04:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
doing my handouts based on the computer
 
04:20:24.670 --> 04:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
would have been nothing for me to upload
 
04:20:27.269 --> 04:20:27.279 align:start position:0%
it and it's not even asking for this as
 
04:20:29.030 --> 04:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
a daily it's saying at the end of the
 
04:20:29.040 --> 04:20:30.349 align:start position:0%
a daily it's saying at the end of the
year

04:20:30.349 --> 04:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:20:34.229 --> 04:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
but I appreciate when teachers do this
 
04:20:37.070 --> 04:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
on their website on a regular basis
 
04:20:39.070 --> 04:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
cuz it just helps with that
 
04:20:43.030 --> 04:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
communication and with let's face it
 
04:20:44.309 --> 04:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
most kids don't like doing their
 
04:20:48.590 --> 04:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
homework so it helps that's that's all I
 
04:20:49.790 --> 04:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
have to
 
04:20:51.870 --> 04:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
say thank you are you willing to take
 
04:20:51.880 --> 04:20:52.990 align:start position:0%
say thank you are you willing to take
any

04:20:52.990 --> 04:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:20:56.670 --> 04:20:56.680 align:start position:0%
questions I can try okay let me start
 
04:21:00.349 --> 04:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
out with one the title of the bill deals
 
04:21:02.590 --> 04:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
with to make curriculum and
 
04:21:05.109 --> 04:21:05.119 align:start position:0%
instructional materials available on
 
04:21:08.790 --> 04:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
their web page PES mhm I go into the
 
04:21:12.750 --> 04:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
bill itself and I see you're referencing
 
04:21:14.630 --> 04:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
the bill references in line six
 
04:21:14.640 --> 04:21:16.510 align:start position:0%
the bill references in line six
instructional

04:21:16.510 --> 04:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
instructional
 
04:21:19.790 --> 04:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
material but
 
04:21:22.870 --> 04:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
what the
 
04:21:25.750 --> 04:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
curriculum are they how much are they
 
04:21:27.389 --> 04:21:27.399 align:start position:0%
supposed to be putting on the web page
 
04:21:29.429 --> 04:21:29.439 align:start position:0%
here this curriculum all these textbooks
 
04:21:32.590 --> 04:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
and just just what they are I mean if
 
04:21:36.149 --> 04:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
you go down further you go ahead you
 
04:21:40.670 --> 04:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
would say the name the book published by
 
04:21:43.229 --> 04:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
and the whatever version you're using
 
04:21:45.670 --> 04:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
you don't have to have you're not even
 
04:21:47.309 --> 04:21:47.319 align:start position:0%
supposed to put because most of that is
 
04:21:48.790 --> 04:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
copyrighted you're not going to put that
 
04:21:51.389 --> 04:21:51.399 align:start position:0%
on the website you're just going to say
 
04:21:54.429 --> 04:21:54.439 align:start position:0%
we're using this book like I used a
 
04:21:56.790 --> 04:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
particular math book that the school
 
04:21:59.750 --> 04:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
provided so I would have just said this
 
04:22:03.070 --> 04:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
math book and then any additional stuff
 
04:22:05.910 --> 04:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
that I did which I did a lot of I would
 
04:22:07.469 --> 04:22:07.479 align:start position:0%
have posted
 
04:22:11.389 --> 04:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
did sorry okay any further questions
 
04:22:13.590 --> 04:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
represent McDonald thank
 
04:22:16.590 --> 04:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
you what you just explained in terms of
 
04:22:19.670 --> 04:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
the books used not necessarily the book
 
04:22:21.990 --> 04:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
itself sounds similar to me to like a
 
04:22:24.229 --> 04:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
college syllabus is that kind of the
 
04:22:27.590 --> 04:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
intent of this that's my understanding
 
04:22:31.149 --> 04:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Tanner
 
04:22:33.229 --> 04:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm I'm going to talk about
 
04:22:34.990 --> 04:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
the lesson plan part of
 
04:22:38.149 --> 04:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
this um and ask some questions and give
 
04:22:41.590 --> 04:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
some comments I guess first of all um
 
04:22:43.510 --> 04:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
this sounds something like I had in
 
04:22:45.389 --> 04:22:45.399 align:start position:0%
student teaching when they were right on
 
04:22:47.309 --> 04:22:47.319 align:start position:0%
my back and to know what I was doing
 
04:22:50.109 --> 04:22:50.119 align:start position:0%
every minute of the day um as an
 
04:22:52.870 --> 04:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
experienced teacher I didn't I didn't do
 
04:22:59.070 --> 04:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
this okay um and so H I don't know what
 
04:23:01.469 --> 04:23:01.479 align:start position:0%
you're digging for I guess that's that's
 
04:23:03.870 --> 04:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
um maybe the first question what's your
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
intent with this what are you digging
 
04:23:07.830 --> 04:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
for when you ask for for procedures for
 
04:23:10.109 --> 04:23:10.119 align:start position:0%
documentation review approval of lesson
 
04:23:14.550 --> 04:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
plans when you um talk about uh volumes
 
04:23:17.149 --> 04:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
the volumes of lesson plans from the
 
04:23:20.830 --> 04:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
year um and identify the teacher uh in
 
04:23:24.229 --> 04:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
part section two part
 
04:23:29.269 --> 04:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
a um I'm not entirely sure what all of
 
04:23:32.229 --> 04:23:32.239 align:start position:0%
this was what the intent was I
 
04:23:34.070 --> 04:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored it because I thought there
 
04:23:37.109 --> 04:23:37.119 align:start position:0%
were some good ideas in it but not
 
04:23:39.389 --> 04:23:39.399 align:start position:0%
because I understood completely the
 
04:23:42.510 --> 04:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
intent when it was filed so I can't say
 
04:23:42.520 --> 04:23:46.349 align:start position:0%
intent when it was filed so I can't say
that

04:23:46.349 --> 04:23:46.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:50.229 --> 04:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
um I was looking at it not so much as a
 
04:23:54.109 --> 04:23:54.119 align:start position:0%
record at the end of the year as an
 
04:23:57.109 --> 04:23:57.119 align:start position:0%
ongoing as a communication between
 
04:23:59.030 --> 04:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
parents and teachers is a easy way of
 
04:24:02.189 --> 04:24:02.199 align:start position:0%
communicating what we're working on and
 
04:24:05.830 --> 04:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
so I wouldn't I mean as a teacher if I
 
04:24:07.630 --> 04:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
assign a particular homework assignment
 
04:24:10.149 --> 04:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
in the book I would put that there so
 
04:24:12.030 --> 04:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
that the parent knows okay this is
 
04:24:14.469 --> 04:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
what's expected and they can get on
 
04:24:17.550 --> 04:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
their student and say is it done right I
 
04:24:20.429 --> 04:24:20.439 align:start position:0%
mean I know I did that once we got to
 
04:24:23.590 --> 04:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
this online thing and my granddaughter
 
04:24:25.429 --> 04:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
was living with me for her four years of
 
04:24:29.070 --> 04:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
high school I looked to see what the
 
04:24:32.790 --> 04:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
assignments were and was she doing it um
 
04:24:35.429 --> 04:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
and I that's what I was looking at
 
04:24:37.950 --> 04:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
myself but the other part of that I know
 
04:24:39.189 --> 04:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
parents want to
 
04:24:41.630 --> 04:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
know what's being taught
 
04:24:44.309 --> 04:24:44.319 align:start position:0%
so so again you would put if you use
 
04:24:46.070 --> 04:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
particular books you'd put the books so
 
04:24:48.149 --> 04:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
that they would know as far as at the
 
04:24:49.590 --> 04:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
end of the
 
04:24:53.429 --> 04:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
year I actually don't know I follow up
 
04:24:56.189 --> 04:24:56.199 align:start position:0%
on that please yes go ahead so the other
 
04:24:58.429 --> 04:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
thing about lessons lesson plans and I'm
 
04:25:01.229 --> 04:25:01.239 align:start position:0%
sure you you experienced this as well is
 
04:25:04.189 --> 04:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
that you the best laid plans don't work
 
04:25:07.830 --> 04:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
out and not only do do they not work out
 
04:25:11.349 --> 04:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
but a good teacher has a toolkit to
 
04:25:13.429 --> 04:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
bring up other things and and work
 
04:25:17.030 --> 04:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
around that um and yet this is the type
 
04:25:20.790 --> 04:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
of legislation that I feel parents want
 
04:25:22.510 --> 04:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
to know each and every little thing that
 
04:25:24.950 --> 04:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
you do and then it's kind of a got you
 
04:25:26.550 --> 04:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
if you don't do it or a got you if you
 
04:25:30.510 --> 04:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
do do it so um I was just wondering if
 
04:25:34.109 --> 04:25:34.119 align:start position:0%
if I made a lesson plan for next Monday
 
04:25:35.790 --> 04:25:35.800 align:start position:0%
and next Monday rolls around and it's
 
04:25:37.830 --> 04:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
snow sow day or next Monday rolls around
 
04:25:39.990 --> 04:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden the kids can't
 
04:25:41.910 --> 04:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
figure out what I'm trying to tell them
 
04:25:43.870 --> 04:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to revise the plan and
 
04:25:46.469 --> 04:25:46.479 align:start position:0%
move around how does how do I have to
 
04:25:48.830 --> 04:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
submit a new plan that's that's reviewed
 
04:25:52.030 --> 04:25:52.040 align:start position:0%
and approved um before I can do anything
 
04:26:03.469 --> 04:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:07.670 --> 04:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
B I think at that level I mean nobody
 
04:26:09.830 --> 04:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
looked at every plan every handout I
 
04:26:12.670 --> 04:26:12.680 align:start position:0%
made I was always making handouts and
 
04:26:14.630 --> 04:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
quizzes and everything to try to get my
 
04:26:17.670 --> 04:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
kid you know so I could see how they did
 
04:26:21.070 --> 04:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
and that would happen daily based on how
 
04:26:22.109 --> 04:26:22.119 align:start position:0%
they where they were what they
 
04:26:23.309 --> 04:26:23.319 align:start position:0%
understood what they needed more
 
04:26:23.319 --> 04:26:24.469 align:start position:0%
understood what they needed more
practice

04:26:24.469 --> 04:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
practice
 
04:26:28.229 --> 04:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
in and I think where it comes for that
 
04:26:31.830 --> 04:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
is if you're planning on like I used the
 
04:26:33.990 --> 04:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
book and we
 
04:26:37.229 --> 04:26:37.239 align:start position:0%
had by Department
 
04:26:39.469 --> 04:26:39.479 align:start position:0%
that these things would be done by these
 
04:26:42.149 --> 04:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
times Etc I think that's what that's
 
04:26:46.030 --> 04:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:46.040 --> 04:26:47.870 align:start position:0%
 
overall

04:26:47.870 --> 04:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
overall
 
04:26:52.590 --> 04:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
um and the the plans I
 
04:26:57.990 --> 04:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
mean if I had had access to a website
 
04:27:01.469 --> 04:27:01.479 align:start position:0%
which I didn't when I was teaching
 
04:27:03.870 --> 04:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
math I would have and I would have done
 
04:27:05.189 --> 04:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
what the science teacher that my
 
04:27:08.070 --> 04:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
granddaughter had was at the end of each
 
04:27:12.070 --> 04:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
day put on there what we had
 
04:27:15.149 --> 04:27:15.159 align:start position:0%
done and not in advance but at the end
 
04:27:18.269 --> 04:27:18.279 align:start position:0%
of each day because my papers would have
 
04:27:20.189 --> 04:27:20.199 align:start position:0%
been done on the computer and I could
 
04:27:22.750 --> 04:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
have just uploaded
 
04:27:25.229 --> 04:27:25.239 align:start position:0%
them fur further questions
 
04:27:28.870 --> 04:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:33.510 --> 04:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
Woodcock afternoon R lakas um I have a
 
04:27:35.469 --> 04:27:35.479 align:start position:0%
concern when I read when I read the
 
04:27:37.830 --> 04:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
depth of bread of this bill I don't know
 
04:27:40.109 --> 04:27:40.119 align:start position:0%
when teachers are going to do it at the
 
04:27:42.189 --> 04:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
end of the day they're beat let take a a
 
04:27:43.750 --> 04:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
science teacher with five sections to
 
04:27:46.349 --> 04:27:46.359 align:start position:0%
five different preps in a high school
 
04:27:47.990 --> 04:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
they run that every single day it seems
 
04:27:49.950 --> 04:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
like an enormous amount of work for
 
04:27:52.830 --> 04:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
limited value I mean they get it Mo a
 
04:27:55.149 --> 04:27:55.159 align:start position:0%
lot of teachers have their own websites
 
04:27:56.990 --> 04:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
particular in the middle in elementary U
 
04:27:58.030 --> 04:27:58.040 align:start position:0%
you can see some of the text they're
 
04:28:00.309 --> 04:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
using but to put their day by day by day
 
04:28:02.550 --> 04:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
lesson plans and and and if the things
 
04:28:04.109 --> 04:28:04.119 align:start position:0%
happen to change for the youngster ask
 
04:28:06.070 --> 04:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
question that grabs you that that's way
 
04:28:08.109 --> 04:28:08.119 align:start position:0%
it goes you why had out here I'd be
 
04:28:09.389 --> 04:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
petrified well I didn't do the thing I
 
04:28:11.389 --> 04:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
was supposed to do cuz on the plan I
 
04:28:13.389 --> 04:28:13.399 align:start position:0%
just think this is uh it's almost like a
 
04:28:16.830 --> 04:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
big brother watching and and a second
 
04:28:17.790 --> 04:28:17.800 align:start position:0%
hand it's
 
04:28:20.269 --> 04:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
like in the back of my head I'm thinking
 
04:28:22.189 --> 04:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
well I'm giving you all the stuff I do
 
04:28:23.510 --> 04:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
in public school you can take it and do
 
04:28:26.030 --> 04:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
it at home or you can take it and do in
 
04:28:28.309 --> 04:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
your child school after I've done all
 
04:28:30.109 --> 04:28:30.119 align:start position:0%
the work here's all the stuff you can do
 
04:28:32.790 --> 04:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
and that scares me so I I just think
 
04:28:35.550 --> 04:28:35.560 align:start position:0%
this is a huge burden on on teachers
 
04:28:37.590 --> 04:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
time time wise sex wise I mean in terms
 
04:28:38.910 --> 04:28:38.920 align:start position:0%
of the text M I don't have a problem
 
04:28:40.990 --> 04:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
with that uh putting it out there but
 
04:28:42.309 --> 04:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
they give out syllabus at least in high
 
04:28:43.750 --> 04:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
school that's all I'm familiar with they
 
04:28:44.950 --> 04:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
give out syllabus to the start of the
 
04:28:46.710 --> 04:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
class that has those things we're not
 
04:28:48.790 --> 04:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
going and I wouldn't want my students
 
04:28:50.510 --> 04:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
parents to tell High School youngster
 
04:28:51.590 --> 04:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
check your homework check your homework
 
04:28:53.149 --> 04:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
check your homework and we're trying to
 
04:28:54.830 --> 04:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
build maturity in these kids the next
 
04:28:56.269 --> 04:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
day John you check your homework we got
 
04:28:57.990 --> 04:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
a problem here now now we start that
 
04:28:59.469 --> 04:28:59.479 align:start position:0%
communication we start to build what'
 
04:29:02.229 --> 04:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
you miss I just I like the concept in
 
04:29:04.030 --> 04:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
terms of the thinking behind it
 
04:29:06.550 --> 04:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
represent but Bo I would I can never a
 
04:29:09.670 --> 04:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
support this just like the big brother I
 
04:29:12.870 --> 04:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
I I think whether how much or whether or
 
04:29:14.670 --> 04:29:14.680 align:start position:0%
not you have to ask your child to check
 
04:29:17.790 --> 04:29:17.800 align:start position:0%
their homework depends upon the child
 
04:29:19.790 --> 04:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
certainly I would have never asked my
 
04:29:21.990 --> 04:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
oldest if he did his homework or what it
 
04:29:25.590 --> 04:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
was he was generally so far ahead of the
 
04:29:30.309 --> 04:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
school I didn't worry about it but I did
 
04:29:32.990 --> 04:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
have kids who I did have to check every
 
04:29:34.990 --> 04:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
day or they did not do their homework
 
04:29:37.550 --> 04:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
and they did not do well and so having
 
04:29:37.560 --> 04:29:38.590 align:start position:0%
and they did not do well and so having
it

04:29:38.590 --> 04:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:29:40.750 --> 04:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
available I mean if I didn't have to
 
04:29:42.590 --> 04:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
check my kid I wouldn't be spending my
 
04:29:44.550 --> 04:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
time as a parent going on and looking
 
04:29:48.229 --> 04:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
but if I did it was a very nice resource
 
04:29:51.630 --> 04:29:51.640 align:start position:0%
one of the teachers did it but as I
 
04:29:55.950 --> 04:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
said it was easy it would I had to do
 
04:29:59.870 --> 04:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
these Pages up anyways so just to upload
 
04:30:03.830 --> 04:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
a copy of it would have been you know
 
04:30:06.550 --> 04:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
almost no when I send it to PR I can
 
04:30:09.750 --> 04:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
upload it at the same time it's not
 
04:30:13.349 --> 04:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
like I'm doing a lot it's online and
 
04:30:17.710 --> 04:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
it's just upload the file no big
 
04:30:20.189 --> 04:30:20.199 align:start position:0%
deal I understand I understand the
 
04:30:21.429 --> 04:30:21.439 align:start position:0%
upload of the documents I understand the
 
04:30:23.750 --> 04:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
books I don't I don't understand the
 
04:30:25.070 --> 04:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
amount of time in terms of what you
 
04:30:26.670 --> 04:30:26.680 align:start position:0%
think is available for teachers if
 
04:30:28.269 --> 04:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
you're an English teacher you have to go
 
04:30:30.030 --> 04:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
home and correct or rewrite and help
 
04:30:31.830 --> 04:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
edit now they do it on the computer and
 
04:30:34.070 --> 04:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
the do document they have hours to do it
 
04:30:35.510 --> 04:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
afterwards why and God's neighb they
 
04:30:37.109 --> 04:30:37.119 align:start position:0%
want want to be put spend doing this is
 
04:30:38.349 --> 04:30:38.359 align:start position:0%
just going to be up on a website they're
 
04:30:40.030 --> 04:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
trying to work with kids instructionally
 
04:30:41.429 --> 04:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
honestly I just think this is way too
 
04:30:43.630 --> 04:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
much for teachers to
 
04:30:45.870 --> 04:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
do further questions from the committee
 
04:30:47.990 --> 04:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell Thank you thank
 
04:30:49.510 --> 04:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question this says it
 
04:30:51.990 --> 04:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
has a local fiscal note that was the
 
04:30:54.510 --> 04:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
department was asked for on no October
 
04:30:58.229 --> 04:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
10th any idea of how much it local no
 
04:31:00.429 --> 04:31:00.439 align:start position:0%
idea why it costs anything this is
 
04:31:02.469 --> 04:31:02.479 align:start position:0%
another downshifting to the local of
 
04:31:04.550 --> 04:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
another cost it may
 
04:31:04.560 --> 04:31:06.109 align:start position:0%
another cost it may
be

04:31:06.109 --> 04:31:06.119 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:31:08.790 --> 04:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
I mean they're supposed
 
04:31:08.800 --> 04:31:13.830 align:start position:0%
I mean they're supposed
to

04:31:13.830 --> 04:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:17.189 --> 04:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
um have a collective software document
 
04:31:19.469 --> 04:31:19.479 align:start position:0%
or spreadsheet to
 
04:31:22.469 --> 04:31:22.479 align:start position:0%
allow up you know to update so I think
 
04:31:25.109 --> 04:31:25.119 align:start position:0%
that I mean a Google doc I would think
 
04:31:27.030 --> 04:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
could just take care of that and as a
 
04:31:29.990 --> 04:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
teacher okay I've done my thing now I
 
04:31:33.990 --> 04:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
have to print it I just send a copy to
 
04:31:39.070 --> 04:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
Google Docs it's done I spend much more
 
04:31:42.109 --> 04:31:42.119 align:start position:0%
time creating that thing than to just
 
04:31:44.149 --> 04:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
send it
 
04:31:47.870 --> 04:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
off but but we don't know yeah I there's
 
04:31:50.030 --> 04:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
a lot I no I don't
 
04:31:52.750 --> 04:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
know were there further questions from
 
04:31:56.269 --> 04:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you very
 
04:32:02.429 --> 04:32:02.439 align:start position:0%

04:32:05.800 --> 04:32:19.710 align:start position:0%
administrator Association interested and
saying

04:32:19.710 --> 04:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:21.870 --> 04:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
anything uh good afternoon House
 
04:32:23.590 --> 04:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
Education committee chairman lad thank

you for taking my testimony today we
 
04:32:26.840 --> 04:32:29.670 align:start position:0%
you for taking my testimony today we
are

04:32:29.670 --> 04:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:32:31.790 --> 04:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
fault uh Becky Wilson for the New
 
04:32:33.990 --> 04:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school boards Association uh
 
04:32:36.030 --> 04:32:36.040 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to this bill
 
04:32:38.070 --> 04:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
um last year some of you may recall
 
04:32:39.550 --> 04:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
there was a very similar bill in terms
 
04:32:41.710 --> 04:32:41.720 align:start position:0%
of posting curriculum to the website of
 
04:32:43.990 --> 04:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
the school district which we also uh
 
04:32:47.429 --> 04:32:47.439 align:start position:0%
opposed at that time first we would uh
 
04:32:50.990 --> 04:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
say that RSA 186 colon 11 uh Roman
 
04:32:53.550 --> 04:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
numeral 9-c already requires school
 
04:32:54.950 --> 04:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
districts to make curriculum course
 
04:32:56.670 --> 04:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
materials available to parents or
 
04:33:00.750 --> 04:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
Guardians for review upon request um so
 
04:33:04.470 --> 04:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
certainly while we would not um like to
 
04:33:06.629 --> 04:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
suggest that right to know request be
 
04:33:08.230 --> 04:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
put in every time someone wants to look
 
04:33:09.590 --> 04:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
at something from the school district
 
04:33:10.949 --> 04:33:10.959 align:start position:0%
that's already covered under the right
 
04:33:13.470 --> 04:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
to know law and can be publicly viewed
 
04:33:15.429 --> 04:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
by anyone who wants to put in that
 
04:33:18.629 --> 04:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
request um we would however just suggest
 
04:33:20.590 --> 04:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
that a concerned parent or an individual
 
04:33:22.189 --> 04:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
speak with the school superintendent and
 
04:33:23.869 --> 04:33:23.879 align:start position:0%
set up a time to go in and look at
 
04:33:26.869 --> 04:33:26.879 align:start position:0%
whatever the material or instructional
 
04:33:28.189 --> 04:33:28.199 align:start position:0%
uh materials and curriculum that are
 
04:33:31.109 --> 04:33:31.119 align:start position:0%
being used are viewed between the parent
 
04:33:33.349 --> 04:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
and the superintendent um I would like
 
04:33:34.949 --> 04:33:34.959 align:start position:0%
to speak to the fact that there's a very
 
04:33:36.830 --> 04:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
big difference between posting a
 
04:33:38.629 --> 04:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
homework blog of what assignments are
 
04:33:40.590 --> 04:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
due the next day or that week most
 
04:33:42.830 --> 04:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
teachers do that already if they are
 
04:33:44.590 --> 04:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
teaching at an age where there's
 
04:33:46.830 --> 04:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
required instruction and homework that
 
04:33:48.750 --> 04:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
is available that is very different than
 
04:33:50.590 --> 04:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
what the intention it seems of this bill
 
04:33:53.070 --> 04:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
is uh this bill requires much more than
 
04:33:54.750 --> 04:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
that it requires it seems that the
 
04:33:57.470 --> 04:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
lesson plans of every teacher in every
 
04:33:59.629 --> 04:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
classroom for every block that they
 
04:34:02.789 --> 04:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
teach be posted on the website um not
 
04:34:04.349 --> 04:34:04.359 align:start position:0%
only for the current year but for the
 
04:34:05.789 --> 04:34:05.799 align:start position:0%
year prior
 
04:34:08.310 --> 04:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
um so that that is an extraordinary
 
04:34:11.910 --> 04:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
number of lesson plans I was just doing
 
04:34:13.869 --> 04:34:13.879 align:start position:0%
some quick math in the back I went on
 
04:34:15.949 --> 04:34:15.959 align:start position:0%
the doe website and because I was
 
04:34:17.429 --> 04:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
watching their deliberative session last
 
04:34:21.551 --> 04:34:21.561 align:start position:0%
night Windham has 338 Educators um if
 
04:34:23.390 --> 04:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
those people teach four periods a day
 
04:34:25.590 --> 04:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
which is small compared to what most
 
04:34:27.551 --> 04:34:27.561 align:start position:0%
teachers would teach at a high school
 
04:34:30.470 --> 04:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
could be up to eight periods a day um
 
04:34:34.029 --> 04:34:34.039 align:start position:0%
five days a week that's about 1352
 
04:34:37.429 --> 04:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
lesson plans a day for that district and
 
04:34:39.949 --> 04:34:39.959 align:start position:0%
6,000 per week
 
04:34:42.390 --> 04:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
6,760 uh if you go to school for 36
 
04:34:44.910 --> 04:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
weeks that's about 250,000 lesson plans
 
04:34:47.709 --> 04:34:47.719 align:start position:0%
per year with no straying from what you
 
04:34:50.189 --> 04:34:50.199 align:start position:0%
have created for that day's lesson um if
 
04:34:51.750 --> 04:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
you have strong Educators who are doing
 
04:34:53.390 --> 04:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
formative assessment during the class
 
04:34:55.949 --> 04:34:55.959 align:start position:0%
and changing up the lesson plan I'm not
 
04:34:58.070 --> 04:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
sure you could be doing four or five
 
04:35:00.709 --> 04:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
lesson plans per period so you could
 
04:35:02.590 --> 04:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
multiply that times five or 10 or
 
04:35:06.670 --> 04:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to do um so this bill
 
04:35:08.269 --> 04:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
is really focused on paperwork and
 
04:35:10.990 --> 04:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
administrative tasks not really the art
 
04:35:14.470 --> 04:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
of teaching or any pedagogy um a list of
 
04:35:17.230 --> 04:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
books is not descriptive of what
 
04:35:19.269 --> 04:35:19.279 align:start position:0%
curriculum or instruction is so while I
 
04:35:20.830 --> 04:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate if that's what the intent of
 
04:35:22.830 --> 04:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is for then it should just say
 
04:35:25.109 --> 04:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
a list of books it shouldn't talk about
 
04:35:27.590 --> 04:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
curriculum and instructional materials
 
04:35:29.429 --> 04:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
while I appreciate that the sponsors at
 
04:35:30.869 --> 04:35:30.879 align:start position:0%
this bill tried to Define that it's
 
04:35:33.109 --> 04:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
still very vague um I don't know if it
 
04:35:35.349 --> 04:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
applies to students who are on an IEP
 
04:35:36.949 --> 04:35:36.959 align:start position:0%
who potentially have individualized
 
04:35:40.269 --> 04:35:40.279 align:start position:0%
instruction blocks are there are their
 
04:35:41.709 --> 04:35:41.719 align:start position:0%
uh instructional materials going to be
 
04:35:43.590 --> 04:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
posted online for people to look at that
 
04:35:46.990 --> 04:35:47.000 align:start position:0%
seems like it could be concerning um so
 
04:35:48.990 --> 04:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
I would just the last point I would make
 
04:35:51.310 --> 04:35:51.320 align:start position:0%
is very important to consider whether
 
04:35:53.029 --> 04:35:53.039 align:start position:0%
the district even has the storage
 
04:35:55.510 --> 04:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
capability technology-wise to manage
 
04:35:58.390 --> 04:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
this bill um I understand that it seems
 
04:36:01.510 --> 04:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
like it might not be um a cost to the
 
04:36:03.349 --> 04:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
district on its face but I will tell you
 
04:36:06.230 --> 04:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
that storage especially with information
 
04:36:08.789 --> 04:36:08.799 align:start position:0%
that is related at all to students um
 
04:36:11.750 --> 04:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
you has to be kept at a very high level
 
04:36:13.990 --> 04:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
um last year's Bill I know that's not
 
04:36:15.470 --> 04:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about said well we'll
 
04:36:17.709 --> 04:36:17.719 align:start position:0%
just combat this problem by offering the
 
04:36:19.949 --> 04:36:19.959 align:start position:0%
district could hold it all physically
 
04:36:22.029 --> 04:36:22.039 align:start position:0%
somewhere but if you go back to the
 
04:36:23.830 --> 04:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
example I just gave that's you know half
 
04:36:26.910 --> 04:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
a million lesson plans for two years
 
04:36:29.310 --> 04:36:29.320 align:start position:0%
where are you housing that online or
 
04:36:31.709 --> 04:36:31.719 align:start position:0%
otherwise um so there's absolutely a
 
04:36:34.269 --> 04:36:34.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact to your local District um
 
04:36:36.670 --> 04:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
it may even involved having to hire more
 
04:36:39.709 --> 04:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
Tech staff just to do that um teachers
 
04:36:42.310 --> 04:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
are not uploading their documents as
 
04:36:44.150 --> 04:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
they make them according to this bill
 
04:36:45.709 --> 04:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
because they have to be vetted by some
 
04:36:48.429 --> 04:36:48.439 align:start position:0%
sort of admin process each lesson plan
 
04:36:49.990 --> 04:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
has to go through some sort of approval
 
04:36:52.949 --> 04:36:52.959 align:start position:0%
process that is posted also on the
 
04:36:56.189 --> 04:36:56.199 align:start position:0%
website um and lastly the bill does
 
04:36:58.429 --> 04:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
create what appears to be a possible
 
04:37:00.390 --> 04:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
Statewide lesson plan template that
 
04:37:02.670 --> 04:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
would come from the Department um I'm
 
04:37:05.590 --> 04:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
not sure if that's something that
 
04:37:07.230 --> 04:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
would make people more or less
 
04:37:09.310 --> 04:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
comfortable um and the effective date is
 
04:37:11.310 --> 04:37:11.320 align:start position:0%
July one of this coming year but it
 
04:37:14.429 --> 04:37:14.439 align:start position:0%
requires last year's lesson plans to be
 
04:37:16.590 --> 04:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
posted so how are you expecting
 
04:37:18.510 --> 04:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
districts to comply with this if it goes
 
04:37:21.789 --> 04:37:21.799 align:start position:0%
into effect on July 1 we're already in
 
04:37:24.830 --> 04:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
February so where are this past
 
04:37:27.230 --> 04:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
semester's lesson plans I'm happy to
 
04:37:30.551 --> 04:37:30.561 align:start position:0%
take questions I got a question for you
 
04:37:34.750 --> 04:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
um having been a a teacher Becky you uh
 
04:37:36.510 --> 04:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
I asked ask
 
04:37:39.390 --> 04:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
you in looking at lesson plans
 
04:37:41.150 --> 04:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
especially when you were in the area of
 
04:37:41.160 --> 04:37:41.990 align:start position:0%
especially when you were in the area of
special

04:37:41.990 --> 04:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
special
 
04:37:44.629 --> 04:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
education did you ever in your lesson
 
04:37:46.830 --> 04:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
plan book said today I'm going to meet
 
04:37:48.949 --> 04:37:48.959 align:start position:0%
with a small group and we're going to be
 
04:37:52.269 --> 04:37:52.279 align:start position:0%
dealing with whatever is on that
 
04:37:54.709 --> 04:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
IEP uh so there's a reference to how
 
04:37:56.390 --> 04:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
many times you had the contacts and all
 
04:37:58.390 --> 04:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
that is there any confidentiality to
 
04:38:00.349 --> 04:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
that lesson plan thank you for the
 
04:38:02.949 --> 04:38:02.959 align:start position:0%
question yes is the very short answer to
 
04:38:05.109 --> 04:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
that often times again when I was
 
04:38:07.510 --> 04:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
educator um I ran a program for students
 
04:38:09.590 --> 04:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
with emotional behavioral disorders so
 
04:38:11.349 --> 04:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
those students had some similar needs
 
04:38:13.349 --> 04:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
some different we ran lots of social
 
04:38:16.629 --> 04:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
skills groups which targeted certain uh
 
04:38:18.029 --> 04:38:18.039 align:start position:0%
emotional and social needs that those
 
04:38:20.709 --> 04:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
students needed to work on you could you
 
04:38:22.629 --> 04:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
needed to keep track of that in terms of
 
04:38:25.510 --> 04:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
your compliance with Federal um idea
 
04:38:26.949 --> 04:38:26.959 align:start position:0%
regulations in terms of making sure
 
04:38:29.029 --> 04:38:29.039 align:start position:0%
you're meeting Services Etc and tracking
 
04:38:32.189 --> 04:38:32.199 align:start position:0%
students progress but of course um you
 
04:38:33.709 --> 04:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
know the names of who are in those
 
04:38:35.949 --> 04:38:35.959 align:start position:0%
groups or what you're working on Etc
 
04:38:37.910 --> 04:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
that would not ever be something that
 
04:38:39.349 --> 04:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
you would want a special educator be
 
04:38:39.359 --> 04:38:41.029 align:start position:0%
you would want a special educator be
posting

04:38:41.029 --> 04:38:41.039 align:start position:0%
posting
 
04:38:43.990 --> 04:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
online thank you further
 
04:38:46.510 --> 04:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very
 
04:38:49.070 --> 04:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
much all rep
 
04:38:52.869 --> 04:38:52.879 align:start position:0%
Le sorry thank you I'm reading and
 
04:38:55.510 --> 04:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
rereading and trying to put all this
 
04:38:55.520 --> 04:38:57.869 align:start position:0%
rereading and trying to put all this
together

04:38:57.869 --> 04:38:57.879 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:39:01.029 --> 04:39:01.039 align:start position:0%
and a number of people have talked about
 
04:39:03.510 --> 04:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
lesson plan is in that thing you write
 
04:39:06.551 --> 04:39:06.561 align:start position:0%
up as to what you hope to accomplish
 
04:39:06.561 --> 04:39:07.349 align:start position:0%
up as to what you hope to accomplish
that

04:39:07.349 --> 04:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:39:07.359 --> 04:39:09.429 align:start position:0%
that
week

04:39:09.429 --> 04:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
week
 
04:39:12.869 --> 04:39:12.879 align:start position:0%
and here it seems like it's a past tense
 
04:39:16.629 --> 04:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
lesson time the instruction
 
04:39:20.510 --> 04:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
provided um of all instructions assigned
 
04:39:23.310 --> 04:39:23.320 align:start position:0%
distributed Etc
 
04:39:27.830 --> 04:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
so am I reading it wrong I see it as a
 
04:39:31.429 --> 04:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
past tense as opposed to a what you were
 
04:39:33.990 --> 04:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
planning on doing so maybe lesson plan
 
04:39:37.750 --> 04:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
is not the right
 
04:39:41.110 --> 04:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
term uh thank you for the question I
 
04:39:43.110 --> 04:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to try to Define what the
 
04:39:44.868 --> 04:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill meant by lesson
 
04:39:47.270 --> 04:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
plan I don't know what the intention is
 
04:39:50.868 --> 04:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
of having to post the lesson plan
 
04:39:52.550 --> 04:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
because I'm not really clear as you said
 
04:39:55.190 --> 04:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
on what what it is that's being posted
 
04:39:56.430 --> 04:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
if it is a
 
04:40:00.310 --> 04:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
syllabus that or a list of materials
 
04:40:01.788 --> 04:40:01.798 align:start position:0%
that's very different than what an
 
04:40:04.270 --> 04:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
educator would call a lesson plan that's
 
04:40:06.390 --> 04:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
that's what I was wondering thank you
 
04:40:08.470 --> 04:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions thank you
 
04:40:12.670 --> 04:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:24.750 --> 04:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:28.628 --> 04:40:28.638 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr chairman Jerry
 
04:40:30.910 --> 04:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
FW associate executive director of the
 
04:40:32.190 --> 04:40:32.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire school administrators
 
04:40:34.150 --> 04:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
Association and I'm here today to
 
04:40:37.390 --> 04:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
express our our opposition and concerns
 
04:40:39.868 --> 04:40:39.878 align:start position:0%
with this particular piece of
 
04:40:42.230 --> 04:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
legislation uh the first thing that came
 
04:40:46.030 --> 04:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
to mind in reading the the title an act
 
04:40:47.910 --> 04:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
requiring school districts first
 
04:40:49.670 --> 04:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
question that came to mind was should
 
04:40:53.150 --> 04:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:55.030 --> 04:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
schools to make curriculum and
 
04:40:57.230 --> 04:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
instruction materials available that was
 
04:41:01.310 --> 04:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
uh the first question in um line seven
 
04:41:02.628 --> 04:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
there's reference to other reading
 
04:41:05.990 --> 04:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
materials and I'm sure that those of you
 
04:41:07.868 --> 04:41:07.878 align:start position:0%
uh who have been in classrooms and in
 
04:41:10.670 --> 04:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
education circles uh might be familiar
 
04:41:12.750 --> 04:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
with the fact that in many Elementary
 
04:41:14.510 --> 04:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
School classrooms and Middle School
 
04:41:16.430 --> 04:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
classrooms teachers have classroom
 
04:41:19.150 --> 04:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
libraries available for kids to choose a
 
04:41:22.670 --> 04:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
book read a book during you know rest
 
04:41:27.190 --> 04:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
time or downtime or wind time or anytime
 
04:41:29.670 --> 04:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh and so was this include listing all
 
04:41:31.270 --> 04:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
of the materials in those classroom
 
04:41:33.110 --> 04:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
libraries that are accessible and
 
04:41:37.110 --> 04:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
available for kids uh to look at uh line
 
04:41:39.350 --> 04:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
21 lesson plans used during the prior
 
04:41:40.948 --> 04:41:40.958 align:start position:0%
school year just the question is what is
 
04:41:44.390 --> 04:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
the purpose of that uh it seems to be an
 
04:41:44.400 --> 04:41:45.390 align:start position:0%
the purpose of that uh it seems to be an
an

04:41:45.390 --> 04:41:45.400 align:start position:0%
an
 
04:41:48.788 --> 04:41:48.798 align:start position:0%
honorous uh administrative burden uh and
 
04:41:51.350 --> 04:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
teacher burden to
 
04:41:53.990 --> 04:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
include I just don't know what the what
 
04:41:55.750 --> 04:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
the purpose of including the previous
 
04:41:57.990 --> 04:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
year's lesson plans would be uh it's
 
04:42:01.150 --> 04:42:01.160 align:start position:0%
already difficult uh in a timely way to
 
04:42:05.310 --> 04:42:05.320 align:start position:0%
to do a an an on time or in time lesson
 
04:42:05.320 --> 04:42:13.868 align:start position:0%
to do a an an on time or in time lesson
plan

04:42:13.868 --> 04:42:13.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:16.070 --> 04:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh make sure I hit
 
04:42:18.350 --> 04:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
everything I do want to appreciate
 
04:42:20.590 --> 04:42:20.600 align:start position:0%
representative leus acknowledgement of a
 
04:42:22.670 --> 04:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
hard work the teachers do to kind of
 
04:42:25.110 --> 04:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
Keep Their Heads above water every day
 
04:42:27.190 --> 04:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
um it's not an easy business it's not
 
04:42:29.590 --> 04:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
like when I won't speak for you all when
 
04:42:32.550 --> 04:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
I was in school um I think it was a
 
04:42:36.070 --> 04:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
simpler time and my teachers worked real
 
04:42:38.110 --> 04:42:38.120 align:start position:0%
hard and some of them worked real hard
 
04:42:39.628 --> 04:42:39.638 align:start position:0%
just to get me through their
 
04:42:42.990 --> 04:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
coursework um and and thank goodness
 
04:42:45.150 --> 04:42:45.160 align:start position:0%
that there wasn't a parent portal on the
 
04:42:46.628 --> 04:42:46.638 align:start position:0%
web where my parents could go in and see
 
04:42:48.350 --> 04:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
whether I got my homework done or not or
 
04:42:50.430 --> 04:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
how I done on a test or a quiz because
 
04:42:52.628 --> 04:42:52.638 align:start position:0%
that's the current reality folks parents
 
04:42:55.150 --> 04:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
can access grades they can access course
 
04:42:57.390 --> 04:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
materials they can access lesson plans
 
04:42:58.868 --> 04:42:58.878 align:start position:0%
they can access what's going on in the
 
04:43:00.910 --> 04:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
classroom it's included in program of
 
04:43:04.708 --> 04:43:04.718 align:start position:0%
studies it's included in in it's access
 
04:43:06.830 --> 04:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
for anyone who wants to pick the fruit
 
04:43:09.550 --> 04:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
the fruit is there for the picking and I
 
04:43:11.430 --> 04:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
think it's important to acknowledge the
 
04:43:13.590 --> 04:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
hard work that teachers put into to
 
04:43:16.430 --> 04:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
having that done already we don't need a
 
04:43:19.670 --> 04:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
state law to to to have a gotcha with
 
04:43:21.230 --> 04:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
you didn't get this requirement done you
 
04:43:23.510 --> 04:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
didn't get that piece done and so we're
 
04:43:26.788 --> 04:43:26.798 align:start position:0%
going to sanction you somehow um this is
 
04:43:28.788 --> 04:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
local work and local if a local school
 
04:43:30.550 --> 04:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
board wants their teachers to post
 
04:43:33.110 --> 04:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
things on the web then they can say we
 
04:43:34.470 --> 04:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
that this is an expectation of
 
04:43:35.868 --> 04:43:35.878 align:start position:0%
employment in the school district we
 
04:43:38.628 --> 04:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
want you to do this um it has collective
 
04:43:41.628 --> 04:43:41.638 align:start position:0%
bargaining implications uh this is a lot
 
04:43:44.628 --> 04:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
of work and all due respect it will cost
 
04:43:46.628 --> 04:43:46.638 align:start position:0%
money and there's no money in here to
 
04:43:49.990 --> 04:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
help uh help support this particular
 
04:43:51.350 --> 04:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
additional work teachers are going to
 
04:43:53.590 --> 04:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
have to take additional time to upload
 
04:43:55.670 --> 04:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
things and I won't I won't uh restate
 
04:43:57.550 --> 04:43:57.560 align:start position:0%
the things that that Becky uh talked
 
04:43:59.550 --> 04:43:59.560 align:start position:0%
about in terms of storage space and all
 
04:44:01.390 --> 04:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
those things that become then District
 
04:44:04.430 --> 04:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
problems to to mitigate um High School
 
04:44:06.628 --> 04:44:06.638 align:start position:0%
teacher could have several preps in each
 
04:44:07.990 --> 04:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
day and you're going to differentiate
 
04:44:09.990 --> 04:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
and personalize instruction do all of
 
04:44:12.230 --> 04:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
those pieces have to be posted on the
 
04:44:14.750 --> 04:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
web where do you want teaching where do
 
04:44:17.310 --> 04:44:17.320 align:start position:0%
you want time to go meeting
 
04:44:19.830 --> 04:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic uh regulations and laws
 
04:44:20.990 --> 04:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
passed down by the state of New
 
04:44:22.430 --> 04:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or do you want it to be
 
04:44:25.550 --> 04:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
invested in teaching and learning with
 
04:44:28.070 --> 04:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
children and Remediation and supporting
 
04:44:29.990 --> 04:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
their individual needs because there are
 
04:44:31.670 --> 04:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
only so many hours in the day folks and
 
04:44:33.830 --> 04:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
oh by the way if that teacher in that
 
04:44:38.030 --> 04:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
classroom advises a club or a or uh
 
04:44:41.030 --> 04:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
coaches a sport they then may have to
 
04:44:42.550 --> 04:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
contact based on another piece of
 
04:44:44.070 --> 04:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
legislation that you heard this morning
 
04:44:45.550 --> 04:44:45.560 align:start position:0%
they may have to go home and call
 
04:44:47.550 --> 04:44:47.560 align:start position:0%
parents to see if their if their
 
04:44:50.550 --> 04:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
nickname kid you know flash or Sparky if
 
04:44:51.750 --> 04:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
they have permission to call the Kid
 
04:44:54.868 --> 04:44:54.878 align:start position:0%
Flash or Sparky so when is when does all
 
04:44:57.270 --> 04:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
this get done there are only so many
 
04:44:59.190 --> 04:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
quality hours in the day don't know
 
04:45:00.990 --> 04:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
about you all I get tired at the end of
 
04:45:02.670 --> 04:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
the day thankfully the teaching
 
04:45:04.590 --> 04:45:04.600 align:start position:0%
profession has wonderful people they
 
04:45:06.910 --> 04:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
used to working 12 hours a day I can't
 
04:45:09.230 --> 04:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
do that at my age anymore it's it's it's
 
04:45:12.150 --> 04:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
tough um people work really hard and I
 
04:45:14.470 --> 04:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
think that we have to be mindful of the
 
04:45:16.590 --> 04:45:16.600 align:start position:0%
fact of what we already asked them to do
 
04:45:18.310 --> 04:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
tests and quizzes are instructional
 
04:45:19.990 --> 04:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
materials ises that does this mean it
 
04:45:21.550 --> 04:45:21.560 align:start position:0%
says instructional materials have to be
 
04:45:23.270 --> 04:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
posted tests and quizzes are going to be
 
04:45:25.190 --> 04:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
posted on the web as well this says
 
04:45:27.070 --> 04:45:27.080 align:start position:0%
instructional materials those are
 
04:45:29.788 --> 04:45:29.798 align:start position:0%
instructional materials so I think this
 
04:45:33.150 --> 04:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
is well- intended I also um would bring
 
04:45:34.910 --> 04:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
to the attention that three of the
 
04:45:38.310 --> 04:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill are from the North
 
04:45:42.990 --> 04:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
country and I find it um puzzling that
 
04:45:44.948 --> 04:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
an observation that three of those
 
04:45:46.990 --> 04:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
sponsors represent the North Country
 
04:45:50.070 --> 04:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
probably the region least equipped to
 
04:45:52.350 --> 04:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
have curriculum directors and additional
 
04:45:54.910 --> 04:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
teachers that have time to review things
 
04:45:56.510 --> 04:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
they don't have curriculum and we
 
04:45:58.070 --> 04:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
experience that right now we have a
 
04:45:59.910 --> 04:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
group of curriculum and and instruction
 
04:46:01.628 --> 04:46:01.638 align:start position:0%
assessment folks from the state we don't
 
04:46:03.510 --> 04:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
have anybody on the North country that
 
04:46:06.830 --> 04:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
can afford one hour a month to come to a
 
04:46:08.430 --> 04:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
meeting to get support in curriculum
 
04:46:09.830 --> 04:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
instruction and assessment from their
 
04:46:12.510 --> 04:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
colleagues how the heck can we ask those
 
04:46:14.150 --> 04:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
small School principles because that's
 
04:46:16.470 --> 04:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
where it's going to land to enter all of
 
04:46:18.470 --> 04:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
this information on behalf of their
 
04:46:20.390 --> 04:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
teachers or to support their teachers
 
04:46:22.150 --> 04:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
you know and I I cite another small and
 
04:46:25.310 --> 04:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
then I'll stop promise Mr chair um I'll
 
04:46:27.230 --> 04:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
site the the commun the small community
 
04:46:29.910 --> 04:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
of Hill okay only because I'm familiar
 
04:46:30.948 --> 04:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
with the
 
04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
situation Brian connley is a
 
04:46:36.070 --> 04:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
superintendent he's the principal for a
 
04:46:37.590 --> 04:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
while he was a special education
 
04:46:40.270 --> 04:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
director for a few days he was the cook
 
04:46:41.670 --> 04:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
because the cook got injured and
 
04:46:43.868 --> 04:46:43.878 align:start position:0%
couldn't come to work and so then you're
 
04:46:46.230 --> 04:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
going to say oh by the way Brian you've
 
04:46:47.830 --> 04:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
got to interrupt you know if your
 
04:46:50.910 --> 04:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
teachers aren't aren't uh available or
 
04:46:54.070 --> 04:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
able to enter their curriculum materials
 
04:46:56.910 --> 04:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
guess what briy good luck now you're
 
04:46:58.350 --> 04:46:58.360 align:start position:0%
you're an administrative assistant for
 
04:47:01.868 --> 04:47:01.878 align:start position:0%
yourself so I think that this is the
 
04:47:03.628 --> 04:47:03.638 align:start position:0%
transparency of knowing what kids are
 
04:47:06.430 --> 04:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
doing in school is available to people
 
04:47:09.190 --> 04:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
now as they as they want to choose it uh
 
04:47:11.708 --> 04:47:11.718 align:start position:0%
and I'm not quite certain that um this
 
04:47:14.390 --> 04:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
bill serves any great purpose if you if
 
04:47:17.390 --> 04:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
you support
 
04:47:21.030 --> 04:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
um if you support increasing the burden
 
04:47:22.590 --> 04:47:22.600 align:start position:0%
on teachers and administrators and
 
04:47:25.190 --> 04:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayers then you'll support this bill
 
04:47:29.708 --> 04:47:29.718 align:start position:0%
if you feel that the energy of teachers
 
04:47:32.150 --> 04:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
and administrators need to be put into
 
04:47:34.670 --> 04:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
kids and instruction and learning and
 
04:47:36.310 --> 04:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
you're serious about not wanting to
 
04:47:38.670 --> 04:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
increase burden on local taxpayers
 
04:47:40.430 --> 04:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
having to pay for the increased cost due
 
04:47:42.350 --> 04:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
to the implementation of this then
 
04:47:43.830 --> 04:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
you'll find this bill inexpedient to
 
04:47:46.110 --> 04:47:46.120 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you thank you I have one
 
04:47:50.390 --> 04:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
question for you Jerry um a as a past
 
04:47:53.190 --> 04:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
principal as a past teacher we had a
 
04:47:55.230 --> 04:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
little book called The the plan
 
04:47:58.628 --> 04:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
book and in the plan book we put down
 
04:48:00.030 --> 04:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
what we were doing whether it was
 
04:48:01.910 --> 04:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
reading math social studies whether
 
04:48:04.070 --> 04:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
reading about ell wazelle the Holocaust
 
04:48:06.670 --> 04:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
or book night or whatever it was put
 
04:48:10.070 --> 04:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
down in there are you saying that this
 
04:48:12.110 --> 04:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
is this still being being done in
 
04:48:14.750 --> 04:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
schools I've been out there since 2004
 
04:48:16.910 --> 04:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
out of it but I would assume that this
 
04:48:19.510 --> 04:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
is being done by teachers still thank
 
04:48:22.190 --> 04:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman for that question yes
 
04:48:24.430 --> 04:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
extensive planning is taking place in
 
04:48:25.868 --> 04:48:25.878 align:start position:0%
the part of teachers and unlike my
 
04:48:28.390 --> 04:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
teaching experience when I might say I
 
04:48:29.948 --> 04:48:29.958 align:start position:0%
taught four High School classes of
 
04:48:32.548 --> 04:48:32.558 align:start position:0%
social studies very different levels
 
04:48:34.628 --> 04:48:34.638 align:start position:0%
senior Theory political Theory down to
 
04:48:36.110 --> 04:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire history and government
 
04:48:38.390 --> 04:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
level four when everything was leveled
 
04:48:40.390 --> 04:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
they were very different pieces of my
 
04:48:44.708 --> 04:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
day um and the plan book would would be
 
04:48:47.310 --> 04:48:47.320 align:start position:0%
very cryptic for lack of a better term
 
04:48:49.470 --> 04:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
you know two or three words cover this
 
04:48:53.270 --> 04:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
topic today teachers have much more
 
04:48:55.390 --> 04:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
extensive planning that they illustrate
 
04:48:57.628 --> 04:48:57.638 align:start position:0%
what technology they're using what
 
04:49:00.670 --> 04:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
competencies they measuring that day um
 
04:49:02.670 --> 04:49:02.680 align:start position:0%
you know the administrators have to have
 
04:49:04.830 --> 04:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
planned observations and walkthroughs
 
04:49:06.390 --> 04:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
and the administrative burden has
 
04:49:10.030 --> 04:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
increased so uh all due respect Mr
 
04:49:11.628 --> 04:49:11.638 align:start position:0%
chairman the plan books that you and I
 
04:49:14.350 --> 04:49:14.360 align:start position:0%
fill out in our days of teaching they
 
04:49:16.750 --> 04:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
belong in the museum these days is it
 
04:49:18.750 --> 04:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
safe to say is it safe to say though in
 
04:49:20.190 --> 04:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
the left hand drawer the right hand
 
04:49:21.910 --> 04:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
drawer there is a plan book for when the
 
04:49:23.788 --> 04:49:23.798 align:start position:0%
teacher is absent for The Substitute
 
04:49:26.190 --> 04:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
Teacher there's a stack of plans like
 
04:49:27.670 --> 04:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
that when a teacher is absent for a
 
04:49:29.070 --> 04:49:29.080 align:start position:0%
substitute teacher so plans are
 
04:49:31.390 --> 04:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
occurring yes sir that's what I'm trying
 
04:49:35.750 --> 04:49:35.760 align:start position:0%

04:49:38.708 --> 04:49:38.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for your
 
04:49:40.070 --> 04:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
testimony Dr
 
04:49:45.110 --> 04:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
FW um you've outlined a fairly rigorous
 
04:49:47.190 --> 04:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
program that current teachers are and
 
04:49:49.990 --> 04:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that is based on your
 
04:49:52.390 --> 04:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
previous role as a as a
 
04:49:56.150 --> 04:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
teacher as a principal as an assistant
 
04:49:58.070 --> 04:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
principal as a
 
04:50:00.470 --> 04:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
superintendent so you've seen the all
 
04:50:02.788 --> 04:50:02.798 align:start position:0%
the levels that have gone through and
 
04:50:05.070 --> 04:50:05.080 align:start position:0%
it's based upon that experience that you
 
04:50:08.230 --> 04:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
have that you view this bill as being
 
04:50:10.670 --> 04:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
much more intrusive to the learning and
 
04:50:13.230 --> 04:50:13.240 align:start position:0%
instruction process based on your
 
04:50:15.310 --> 04:50:15.320 align:start position:0%
education experience thank you
 
04:50:17.470 --> 04:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
representative for that question and yes
 
04:50:20.030 --> 04:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
that is correct thank
 
04:50:22.350 --> 04:50:22.360 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
04:50:25.910 --> 04:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much is this on
 
04:50:28.150 --> 04:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
this other bill came this on this one on
 
04:50:32.830 --> 04:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:32.840 --> 04:50:35.270 align:start position:0%

04:50:35.270 --> 04:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
Horgan
 
04:50:40.190 --> 04:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:43.190 --> 04:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
done okay thank you I just
 
04:50:48.470 --> 04:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh I I anyway I like a few few pretty
 
04:50:50.868 --> 04:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
severe RIS few sever reservations of
 
04:50:52.430 --> 04:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
Bill one thing that's common to a lot of
 
04:50:55.190 --> 04:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
these bills is uh talks about what the
 
04:50:57.948 --> 04:50:57.958 align:start position:0%
school board is supposed to do um there
 
04:51:00.750 --> 04:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
are public charter schools and guess
 
04:51:03.190 --> 04:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
there's other other school and there
 
04:51:05.310 --> 04:51:05.320 align:start position:0%
similar schools that don't have a school
 
04:51:07.150 --> 04:51:07.160 align:start position:0%
board I guess usually we tend to
 
04:51:08.948 --> 04:51:08.958 align:start position:0%
interpret these bills to mean that the
 
04:51:10.590 --> 04:51:10.600 align:start position:0%
board of the Charter Public Schools
 
04:51:12.270 --> 04:51:12.280 align:start position:0%
stands in place of the school board if
 
04:51:14.390 --> 04:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's unless it's a Charter Public School
 
04:51:16.190 --> 04:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
which has a school board with some do so
 
04:51:19.628 --> 04:51:19.638 align:start position:0%
that's one um that's one big ambiguity
 
04:51:22.948 --> 04:51:22.958 align:start position:0%
in this um also like the lesson plans
 
04:51:24.990 --> 04:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
not every kid child in the classroom is
 
04:51:26.470 --> 04:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily following the exact same
 
04:51:29.788 --> 04:51:29.798 align:start position:0%
lesson plan they often have customized
 
04:51:32.270 --> 04:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
materials cuz for children who either
 
04:51:35.030 --> 04:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know either either need need help
 
04:51:36.470 --> 04:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
getting up to the grade level or are
 
04:51:38.470 --> 04:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
above the grade level so there isn't
 
04:51:40.510 --> 04:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily just one lesson plan
 
04:51:44.270 --> 04:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
although that's probably and also um
 
04:51:46.310 --> 04:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
there's licensing issues with the
 
04:51:48.628 --> 04:51:48.638 align:start position:0%
contents a lot this most of this content
 
04:51:51.350 --> 04:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
is is copyrighted um so they you know we
 
04:51:52.670 --> 04:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
may not
 
04:51:54.990 --> 04:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
even some publisher educational
 
04:51:57.230 --> 04:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
Publishers might not even want to let us
 
04:51:58.868 --> 04:51:58.878 align:start position:0%
use materials here in New Hampshire if
 
04:52:00.230 --> 04:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
they can put them in a website where
 
04:52:02.788 --> 04:52:02.798 align:start position:0%
like anybody can you know look at it
 
04:52:06.150 --> 04:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
pirated copy Etc and
 
04:52:09.310 --> 04:52:09.320 align:start position:0%
um also and this is probably by Design
 
04:52:12.628 --> 04:52:12.638 align:start position:0%
but it seems to be set up so anybody can
 
04:52:14.788 --> 04:52:14.798 align:start position:0%
object to what's being taught in the
 
04:52:17.350 --> 04:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
school even if their child is not in
 
04:52:19.110 --> 04:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
school if they're not otherwise directly
 
04:52:22.030 --> 04:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
involved and I suppose I can see the r
 
04:52:23.670 --> 04:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
now where the taxpayer dollars are
 
04:52:25.548 --> 04:52:25.558 align:start position:0%
paying for it but that could be a lot of
 
04:52:27.910 --> 04:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
problem you could have somebody who's
 
04:52:29.670 --> 04:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
you know doesn't have a child in the
 
04:52:33.270 --> 04:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
school you know isn't a you know maybe
 
04:52:34.670 --> 04:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
not doesn't even live in the school
 
04:52:37.310 --> 04:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
district uh taking up the school board's
 
04:52:40.470 --> 04:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
time or the chartered or presumably the
 
04:52:43.270 --> 04:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
chartered schools uh board's time um you
 
04:52:46.390 --> 04:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
know on disputes which maybe don't
 
04:52:48.350 --> 04:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
really have
 
04:52:50.190 --> 04:52:50.200 align:start position:0%
anything because they're upset about
 
04:52:52.230 --> 04:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
material like even though they really it
 
04:52:53.948 --> 04:52:53.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't really directly affect them at
 
04:52:55.788 --> 04:52:55.798 align:start position:0%
all what's being taught in the classroom
 
04:52:57.708 --> 04:52:57.718 align:start position:0%
so um I
 
04:53:00.990 --> 04:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
think I think this uh I think this bill
 
04:53:03.230 --> 04:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
is just looking at it seems poorly
 
04:53:05.670 --> 04:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
thought and it goes too far so certainly
 
04:53:08.470 --> 04:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
um if you do try to pass it you need you
 
04:53:10.708 --> 04:53:10.718 align:start position:0%
probably need to address just some of
 
04:53:12.070 --> 04:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
the issues I've thought of in many
 
04:53:13.470 --> 04:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
others which I hadn't thought of because
 
04:53:14.548 --> 04:53:14.558 align:start position:0%
I'm just
 
04:53:16.830 --> 04:53:16.840 align:start position:0%
uh I just signed up for speak to two
 
04:53:18.670 --> 04:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
minutes and uh you know on the fly so I
 
04:53:20.190 --> 04:53:20.200 align:start position:0%
didn't he any prepared remarks so I
 
04:53:21.948 --> 04:53:21.958 align:start position:0%
think this uh Bill certainly should not
 
04:53:23.830 --> 04:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
be passed in its current form if it is
 
04:53:26.788 --> 04:53:26.798 align:start position:0%
passed it needs pretty uh pretty major
 
04:53:28.830 --> 04:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
changes I would suggest either it owning
 
04:53:30.948 --> 04:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
it or sending it sending it to interim
 
04:53:33.948 --> 04:53:33.958 align:start position:0%
study and in any case uh what's being
 
04:53:35.350 --> 04:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
taught at school is certainly not a
 
04:53:37.430 --> 04:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
secret from the uh child and hence it's
 
04:53:39.150 --> 04:53:39.160 align:start position:0%
not a secret from the parents so I'm not
 
04:53:41.070 --> 04:53:41.080 align:start position:0%
sure like
 
04:53:44.590 --> 04:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not really sure who else who else
 
04:53:47.150 --> 04:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not really sure like who else
 
04:53:49.150 --> 04:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
is directly involved in it that even you
 
04:53:51.548 --> 04:53:51.558 align:start position:0%
know should be objecting to it espec I
 
04:53:53.430 --> 04:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
mean certain especially if it meets the
 
04:53:56.030 --> 04:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
curriculum standards so that's uh that's
 
04:53:58.230 --> 04:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
why I think this bill is that's why I
 
04:54:00.390 --> 04:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
think this bill is a bad idea so I just
 
04:54:02.548 --> 04:54:02.558 align:start position:0%
uh just put in my two cents and say you
 
04:54:05.670 --> 04:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
should you should we've not pass it so
 
04:54:07.430 --> 04:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
thanks I happy to take any questions
 
04:54:09.150 --> 04:54:09.160 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for
 
04:54:11.788 --> 04:54:11.798 align:start position:0%
represent Horgan yeah thank you very
 
04:54:13.670 --> 04:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
much thank you we do not have any other
 
04:54:15.548 --> 04:54:15.558 align:start position:0%
cards so we're closing this hearing and
 
04:54:18.510 --> 04:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to move on to the next bill
 
04:54:21.548 --> 04:54:21.558 align:start position:0%
which we have before us which is 12:30
 
04:54:25.430 --> 04:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:28.390 --> 04:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
12:35 yeah 12:35 relative high school

welcome
 
04:54:37.390 --> 04:54:37.400 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman
 
04:54:38.910 --> 04:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee uh my
 
04:54:42.070 --> 04:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
name is David rord I'm from Grafton
 
04:54:45.548 --> 04:54:45.558 align:start position:0%
one uh from the great town of Littleton
 
04:54:47.548 --> 04:54:47.558 align:start position:0%
and Littleton has the
 
04:54:50.070 --> 04:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
distinct uh recognition of being the
 
04:54:53.110 --> 04:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
largest town north of the notch we're
 
04:54:56.590 --> 04:54:56.600 align:start position:0%
not a city we we have the city uh but
 
04:54:58.830 --> 04:54:58.840 align:start position:0%
the largest town north of the Notch and
 
04:55:01.030 --> 04:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
really it's even despite the fact that
 
04:55:03.548 --> 04:55:03.558 align:start position:0%
we have the largest town we have some
 
04:55:04.750 --> 04:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
problems that I think we're we're going
 
04:55:07.750 --> 04:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
to hopefully address today um hb1 1235
 
04:55:10.830 --> 04:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
was actually brought to me by a teacher
 
04:55:14.190 --> 04:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
in the school um Mr Jeremy Brown who you
 
04:55:17.430 --> 04:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
have a copy of a letter that he gave me
 
04:55:21.070 --> 04:55:21.080 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh he came to me 6 months nine
 
04:55:23.510 --> 04:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
months ago uh with a problem that
 
04:55:25.390 --> 04:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can solve here today and it
 
04:55:27.430 --> 04:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
revolves around the bill that that the
 
04:55:29.510 --> 04:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
law that came out of here a few years
 
04:55:32.990 --> 04:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
ago that put a a student on the school
 
04:55:34.708 --> 04:55:34.718 align:start position:0%
board so the school boards are required
 
04:55:37.628 --> 04:55:37.638 align:start position:0%
to have a student representative which I
 
04:55:39.670 --> 04:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
know him and I both agree is a wonderful
 
04:55:43.708 --> 04:55:43.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity for these kids um and it's
 
04:55:45.390 --> 04:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
good for the school board to get
 
04:55:47.390 --> 04:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
feedback from from the students to
 
04:55:49.628 --> 04:55:49.638 align:start position:0%
understand really what they're doing but
 
04:55:52.390 --> 04:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
in a small town like Littleton uh and I
 
04:55:53.990 --> 04:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
say it's a large town the largest town
 
04:55:57.110 --> 04:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
we have is a population 5,800 uh we have
 
04:55:59.590 --> 04:55:59.600 align:start position:0%
our own high school but the problem that
 
04:56:01.670 --> 04:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
we're having up there because the school
 
04:56:04.548 --> 04:56:04.558 align:start position:0%
is so small we are having a problem
 
04:56:07.070 --> 04:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
finding students enough students to to
 
04:56:10.310 --> 04:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
fill this position uh when you take just
 
04:56:11.750 --> 04:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
to give it to perspective my daughter
 
04:56:13.070 --> 04:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
graduated from Littleton high school
 
04:56:16.510 --> 04:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
last year in a class of 35 so uh it's
 
04:56:18.868 --> 04:56:18.878 align:start position:0%
not a huge School uh but they do have
 
04:56:21.350 --> 04:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
participation but in they want they have
 
04:56:25.230 --> 04:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
desire for participation in this um but
 
04:56:26.430 --> 04:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
the problem is we just don't have the
 
04:56:28.070 --> 04:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
students to do it uh you know when you
 
04:56:32.270 --> 04:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
take students who are active in sports
 
04:56:36.190 --> 04:56:36.200 align:start position:0%
extracurriculars after school jobs um it
 
04:56:38.510 --> 04:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
limits the ability uh it limits the pool
 
04:56:40.230 --> 04:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
that we can draw off of and the reason
 
04:56:41.788 --> 04:56:41.798 align:start position:0%
why is because it has one you know the
 
04:56:43.470 --> 04:56:43.480 align:start position:0%
current law has one student
 
04:56:45.430 --> 04:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative and they have to attend
 
04:56:47.270 --> 04:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
all the meetings so if you have one
 
04:56:49.310 --> 04:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
student who has to attend all the
 
04:56:51.430 --> 04:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
meetings it kind of takes away from
 
04:56:54.548 --> 04:56:54.558 align:start position:0%
their ability to take do Sports um uh
 
04:56:58.750 --> 04:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
work etc um so if you look at the bill
 
04:57:00.548 --> 04:57:00.558 align:start position:0%
uh what we've done here we worked with
 
04:57:02.150 --> 04:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
him and this a lot this came from him
 
04:57:04.910 --> 04:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
this came right from the the the the
 
04:57:07.230 --> 04:57:07.240 align:start position:0%
teachers uh with a recommendation how to
 
04:57:10.030 --> 04:57:10.040 align:start position:0%
make this better um and he proposed that
 
04:57:11.390 --> 04:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
the student government shall determine
 
04:57:12.548 --> 04:57:12.558 align:start position:0%
the number of student school board
 
04:57:15.510 --> 04:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
members so it could be more than uh one
 
04:57:18.548 --> 04:57:18.558 align:start position:0%
um but not more than three
 
04:57:20.910 --> 04:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
uh up to a maximum of three and
 
04:57:23.070 --> 04:57:23.080 align:start position:0%
establish procedures for each for each
 
04:57:24.948 --> 04:57:24.958 align:start position:0%
of them to share the responsibilities
 
04:57:27.390 --> 04:57:27.400 align:start position:0%
that are defined in paragraph 4 and then
 
04:57:29.070 --> 04:57:29.080 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we change in this
 
04:57:30.868 --> 04:57:30.878 align:start position:0%
is just the attendance that rather than
 
04:57:33.350 --> 04:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
attending all board meetings uh they
 
04:57:34.868 --> 04:57:34.878 align:start position:0%
have to attend at least one school
 
04:57:36.948 --> 04:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
meeting per month during the regular
 
04:57:38.430 --> 04:57:38.440 align:start position:0%
school year of course we know these
 
04:57:41.548 --> 04:57:41.558 align:start position:0%
school boards meet year round um and
 
04:57:43.750 --> 04:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
this this adds a little more flexibility
 
04:57:45.868 --> 04:57:45.878 align:start position:0%
it makes it a little more friendly and
 
04:57:48.230 --> 04:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
attractive for students to get involved
 
04:57:50.628 --> 04:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
and uh it it's an opportunity that we
 
04:57:55.070 --> 04:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
want to succeed but we've uh we think it
 
04:57:56.830 --> 04:57:56.840 align:start position:0%
will succeed more likelihood of
 
04:58:00.350 --> 04:58:00.360 align:start position:0%
succeeding with these changes so pretty
 
04:58:03.628 --> 04:58:03.638 align:start position:0%
simple um and I entertaining questions
 
04:58:05.910 --> 04:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
that that you might have thank you very
 
04:58:08.510 --> 04:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
much representative cordelli uh thank
 
04:58:10.070 --> 04:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative for being
 
04:58:13.510 --> 04:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
here um um a little bit confused by a
 
04:58:17.990 --> 04:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
few things in here um uh I gather from
 
04:58:20.910 --> 04:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
what you said the intent is for a shared
 
04:58:20.920 --> 04:58:21.670 align:start position:0%
what you said the intent is for a shared
uh

04:58:21.670 --> 04:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:58:27.190 --> 04:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
position um now uh a a school board can
 
04:58:29.670 --> 04:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
like to have more than one student
 
04:58:33.670 --> 04:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
representative so how would that work in
 
04:58:33.680 --> 04:58:34.788 align:start position:0%
representative so how would that work in
your

04:58:34.788 --> 04:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:58:39.350 --> 04:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
bill so the well the the point that he
 
04:58:41.430 --> 04:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to do the the the the objective
 
04:58:42.990 --> 04:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
he want to achieve is actually have this
 
04:58:46.110 --> 04:58:46.120 align:start position:0%
student elected chosen by the school the
 
04:58:48.030 --> 04:58:48.040 align:start position:0%
school council the student council the
 
04:58:50.510 --> 04:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
student government within the school um
 
04:58:53.470 --> 04:58:53.480 align:start position:0%
he thought that uh by by including the
 
04:58:55.708 --> 04:58:55.718 align:start position:0%
student government in the process you
 
04:58:57.750 --> 04:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
get a more you get a better
 
04:58:59.830 --> 04:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
participation from the student body
 
04:59:02.230 --> 04:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
rather than keeping it segregated to a
 
04:59:03.910 --> 04:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
school board
 
04:59:07.070 --> 04:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
followup question thank you um yeah on
 
04:59:10.390 --> 04:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
line three it says that a student member
 
04:59:12.510 --> 04:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
shall be chosen by the high school
 
04:59:17.190 --> 04:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
student body but then on line seven the
 
04:59:19.190 --> 04:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
change you make is that Student
 
04:59:22.030 --> 04:59:22.040 align:start position:0%
Government shall determine the number of
 
04:59:24.270 --> 04:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
school board members up to a maximum of
 
04:59:28.070 --> 04:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
three so is the student is this school
 
04:59:30.910 --> 04:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
board determining the number of student
 
04:59:33.708 --> 04:59:33.718 align:start position:0%
Representatives on the board
 
04:59:37.190 --> 04:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
um and it seems like there's a conflict
 
04:59:39.670 --> 04:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
about who chooses the student
 
04:59:41.350 --> 04:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
Representatives is it the high school
 
04:59:43.830 --> 04:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
student body is in lines three and four
 
04:59:45.470 --> 04:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
or is it the student government it's the
 
04:59:47.310 --> 04:59:47.320 align:start position:0%
intent was the student government so I
 
04:59:49.350 --> 04:59:49.360 align:start position:0%
think that the line three probably
 
04:59:52.830 --> 04:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
should be updated to uh uh or line three
 
04:59:54.590 --> 04:59:54.600 align:start position:0%
and four where the student body that
 
04:59:56.190 --> 04:59:56.200 align:start position:0%
that probably needs to be changed to be
 
05:00:00.350 --> 05:00:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:03.628 --> 05:00:03.638 align:start position:0%
government more yes go ahead um okay
 
05:00:08.470 --> 05:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
then down in um the uh line 16 and
 
05:00:11.390 --> 05:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
17 um where talking about the duties of
 
05:00:14.470 --> 05:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
a student School Board member
 
05:00:19.270 --> 05:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
um if there are as indicated in lines 8
 
05:00:22.910 --> 05:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
and nine up to three I guess who would
 
05:00:25.110 --> 05:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
represent each one of the school board
 
05:00:28.788 --> 05:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
members who could share that position um
 
05:00:31.310 --> 05:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
would each one of the
 
05:00:34.350 --> 05:00:34.360 align:start position:0%
shared Schoolboard members have to
 
05:00:36.270 --> 05:00:36.280 align:start position:0%
attend at least one board meeting per
 
05:00:40.788 --> 05:00:40.798 align:start position:0%
month so the intent was that uh at
 
05:00:45.750 --> 05:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
least um I believe he defined that in
 
05:00:47.590 --> 05:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
there but in speaking with him the other
 
05:00:51.070 --> 05:00:51.080 align:start position:0%
day was that um the the intent was that
 
05:00:53.350 --> 05:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
at least one of those student members
 
05:00:55.110 --> 05:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
would attend at least one meeting per
 
05:00:57.788 --> 05:00:57.798 align:start position:0%
month you know the the the constraint
 
05:00:59.190 --> 05:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
that they had on every single
 
05:01:03.590 --> 05:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard meeting was not attrac to to
 
05:01:05.948 --> 05:01:05.958 align:start position:0%
attract students to participate in this
 
05:01:08.590 --> 05:01:08.600 align:start position:0%
so you know what what he was you know
 
05:01:10.510 --> 05:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
considering and and what his feedback
 
05:01:13.190 --> 05:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
was you know if we could get at least
 
05:01:16.030 --> 05:01:16.040 align:start position:0%
one meeting attended per month that
 
05:01:19.150 --> 05:01:19.160 align:start position:0%
would attract more students into
 
05:01:22.708 --> 05:01:22.718 align:start position:0%
this thank you further questions yes
 
05:01:24.990 --> 05:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell thank you and
 
05:01:27.708 --> 05:01:27.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I'm
 
05:01:30.390 --> 05:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
confused on how this would work in
 
05:01:32.590 --> 05:01:32.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester where we have four High
 
05:01:35.910 --> 05:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
School schools so they each have a
 
05:01:38.270 --> 05:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
student representative on the board so
 
05:01:40.990 --> 05:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
there's four and I I think they take
 
05:01:44.070 --> 05:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
turns attending the full meetings and
 
05:01:46.110 --> 05:01:46.120 align:start position:0%
then the subcommittees are divided among
 
05:01:49.430 --> 05:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
them so they can choose which one best
 
05:01:52.670 --> 05:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
fits them but they are chosen by the
 
05:01:55.390 --> 05:01:55.400 align:start position:0%
high school student body because each
 
05:01:58.070 --> 05:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
senior class or junior class which every
 
05:02:02.510 --> 05:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
year they're elected has 500 students so
 
05:02:05.750 --> 05:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
they run for for the whole class if it's
 
05:02:07.990 --> 05:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
just elected by the student
 
05:02:11.270 --> 05:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
government the four class officers are
 
05:02:13.750 --> 05:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
picking who they want to represent them
 
05:02:16.310 --> 05:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
instead of the whole school student body
 
05:02:19.830 --> 05:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
but if this lives gives up to three per
 
05:02:22.830 --> 05:02:22.840 align:start position:0%
High School we'll have
 
05:02:25.470 --> 05:02:25.480 align:start position:0%
12 or we won't have
 
05:02:27.670 --> 05:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
enough I see where you're coming from
 
05:02:29.750 --> 05:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
that yes yeah and again this was really
 
05:02:31.868 --> 05:02:31.878 align:start position:0%
school specific to how fixing a need in
 
05:02:33.990 --> 05:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
a small school whereas you know you got
 
05:02:36.110 --> 05:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
the other end of the spectrum um there
 
05:02:40.310 --> 05:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
but if we could and I'm not averse to
 
05:02:41.830 --> 05:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
you know mean it's your it's your bill
 
05:02:43.948 --> 05:02:43.958 align:start position:0%
now and and you know you know that I
 
05:02:46.750 --> 05:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
think you know the need um if if this
 
05:02:49.070 --> 05:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
committee can come up with some type of
 
05:02:50.788 --> 05:02:50.798 align:start position:0%
resolution that can accommodate these
 
05:02:54.430 --> 05:02:54.440 align:start position:0%
smaller schools where they're we're not
 
05:02:55.948 --> 05:02:55.958 align:start position:0%
being able to fill those positions
 
05:02:57.470 --> 05:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
because we're so small I mean you've got
 
05:03:00.510 --> 05:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
the opposite problem in that um you know
 
05:03:02.190 --> 05:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
you got to you don't have a problem you
 
05:03:03.910 --> 05:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
don't you don't have a problem this bill
 
05:03:06.270 --> 05:03:06.280 align:start position:0%
would not be a problem as written for a
 
05:03:08.310 --> 05:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
school like yours where the bill as
 
05:03:10.910 --> 05:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
written is a problem for smaller schools
 
05:03:10.920 --> 05:03:13.948 align:start position:0%
written is a problem for smaller schools
like

05:03:13.948 --> 05:03:13.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:16.510 --> 05:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
mine further further
 
05:03:18.868 --> 05:03:18.878 align:start position:0%
questions just rolling around my mind
 
05:03:20.150 --> 05:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
right now how would this work in a
 
05:03:21.548 --> 05:03:21.558 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District where you
 
05:03:24.830 --> 05:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
have many many districts and even with a
 
05:03:26.590 --> 05:03:26.600 align:start position:0%
system where you might have a k through
 
05:03:28.510 --> 05:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
eight and they tuition their high school
 
05:03:31.670 --> 05:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
kids out to another
 
05:03:31.680 --> 05:03:34.030 align:start position:0%
kids out to another
District

05:03:34.030 --> 05:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
District
 
05:03:36.910 --> 05:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
um would the district that's receiving
 
05:03:38.310 --> 05:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
these tuition students in this
 
05:03:38.320 --> 05:03:39.788 align:start position:0%
these tuition students in this
particular

05:03:39.788 --> 05:03:39.798 align:start position:0%
particular
 
05:03:43.030 --> 05:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
case allow for a student to be on that
 
05:03:45.948 --> 05:03:45.958 align:start position:0%
board of the receiving school if they're
 
05:03:47.910 --> 05:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
from a district that's sending tuition
 
05:03:50.708 --> 05:03:50.718 align:start position:0%
wise and if it's 20 miles away from the
 
05:03:53.070 --> 05:03:53.080 align:start position:0%
school or 10 miles away from which may
 
05:03:55.150 --> 05:03:55.160 align:start position:0%
happen yeah I I don't think the law
 
05:03:59.390 --> 05:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
speaks to that now or or as as proposed
 
05:04:02.470 --> 05:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
um you I think that that's uh even
 
05:04:03.868 --> 05:04:03.878 align:start position:0%
though because you know as the law is
 
05:04:05.548 --> 05:04:05.558 align:start position:0%
now I don't think that that addresses
 
05:04:07.750 --> 05:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
that that
 
05:04:10.470 --> 05:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
question are other
 
05:04:13.788 --> 05:04:13.798 align:start position:0%
questions represent Damon thank you
 
05:04:15.548 --> 05:04:15.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
05:04:18.750 --> 05:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
question this could be me but I'm not
 
05:04:21.190 --> 05:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
100% sure that the
 
05:04:23.670 --> 05:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
language clearly states there will be at
 
05:04:28.548 --> 05:04:28.558 align:start position:0%
least one it says up to a maximum of
 
05:04:31.030 --> 05:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
three I mean maybe you can read line
 
05:04:33.948 --> 05:04:33.958 align:start position:0%
three into four
 
05:04:36.310 --> 05:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
to confirm that there will be at least
 
05:04:38.788 --> 05:04:38.798 align:start position:0%
one member I and I have to say I'm
 
05:04:41.628 --> 05:04:41.638 align:start position:0%
coming at this my first elected office
 
05:04:44.270 --> 05:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
was junior in high school Schoolboard
 
05:04:47.230 --> 05:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
member and I learned a lot from it could
 
05:04:49.030 --> 05:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
so I think thatan I think the the the
 
05:04:51.390 --> 05:04:51.400 align:start position:0%
one comes from line three a student
 
05:04:53.670 --> 05:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
School Board member shall be chosen I
 
05:04:55.548 --> 05:04:55.558 align:start position:0%
mean so so that's where you're defining
 
05:04:57.548 --> 05:04:57.558 align:start position:0%
something has to you have to have one
 
05:05:00.510 --> 05:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
there and then line uh Eight Is Where It
 
05:05:02.230 --> 05:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
defines you know the upper limit of that
 
05:05:02.240 --> 05:05:03.670 align:start position:0%
defines you know the upper limit of that
okay

05:05:03.670 --> 05:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:05:08.310 --> 05:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
see Roman one that's not here under this
 
05:05:10.788 --> 05:05:10.798 align:start position:0%
says you can have one or
 
05:05:14.390 --> 05:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
more it's it's not in this part of law
 
05:05:18.110 --> 05:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
it's the first part of the law um so I'm
 
05:05:20.948 --> 05:05:20.958 align:start position:0%
getting really confused on how this
 
05:05:23.670 --> 05:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
whole scheme is going to
 
05:05:26.670 --> 05:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
work so represent Damon you had the FL
 
05:05:28.788 --> 05:05:28.798 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry but for Buton in no that's
 
05:05:31.030 --> 05:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
quite right and actually I just wanted
 
05:05:33.510 --> 05:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
to uh follow follow up on your prior
 
05:05:36.070 --> 05:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
conver comment Mr chair and hear from
 
05:05:36.080 --> 05:05:38.030 align:start position:0%
conver comment Mr chair and hear from
the

05:05:38.030 --> 05:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:05:41.110 --> 05:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
representative would it seem reasonable
 
05:05:43.350 --> 05:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
that tuition students would be eligible
 
05:05:45.390 --> 05:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
to be Schoolboard reps if they were
 
05:05:46.830 --> 05:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
elected by the student body where
 
05:05:48.190 --> 05:05:48.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to
 
05:05:50.350 --> 05:05:50.360 align:start position:0%
school why does it matter that they're a
 
05:05:52.070 --> 05:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
tuition student they're a student at
 
05:05:52.080 --> 05:05:53.990 align:start position:0%
tuition student they're a student at
that

05:05:53.990 --> 05:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:05:56.190 --> 05:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
school I can't think of a reason why
 
05:05:58.110 --> 05:05:58.120 align:start position:0%
that would
 
05:06:00.788 --> 05:06:00.798 align:start position:0%
matter I mean the goal is to the goal is
 
05:06:03.548 --> 05:06:03.558 align:start position:0%
to get students involved and and to be a
 
05:06:05.708 --> 05:06:05.718 align:start position:0%
conduit of information from the students
 
05:06:08.910 --> 05:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
to the the the school board so I don't
 
05:06:10.750 --> 05:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
understand you know I don't I don't uh
 
05:06:12.830 --> 05:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
you know I I don't see how that would be
 
05:06:16.110 --> 05:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
a a problem any further questions
 
05:06:19.110 --> 05:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell yes thank you um
 
05:06:21.868 --> 05:06:21.878 align:start position:0%
the RSA now says one or more students
 
05:06:24.030 --> 05:06:24.040 align:start position:0%
from among its members to be non-voting
 
05:06:26.310 --> 05:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
members so doesn't it so do we need to
 
05:06:28.190 --> 05:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
change it to say up to three when it
 
05:06:31.110 --> 05:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
says one or more already in the
 
05:06:34.548 --> 05:06:34.558 align:start position:0%
RSA the say already says one or more
 
05:06:36.868 --> 05:06:36.878 align:start position:0%
yeah in a different section a different
 
05:06:39.110 --> 05:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
part in Roman one in Roman one right
 
05:06:41.910 --> 05:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
we're in Roman two
 
05:06:44.548 --> 05:06:44.558 align:start position:0%
here I get her point though it already
 
05:06:47.190 --> 05:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
says more than one so we don't have to
 
05:06:50.230 --> 05:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
add that yeah and two because it already
 
05:06:50.240 --> 05:06:52.390 align:start position:0%
add that yeah and two because it already
says

05:06:52.390 --> 05:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
says
 
05:06:55.270 --> 05:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
it Becky do have something back there
 
05:06:55.280 --> 05:06:56.548 align:start position:0%
it Becky do have something back there
that

05:06:56.548 --> 05:06:56.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:07:01.190 --> 05:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
can okay okay so and again if if if that
 
05:07:03.430 --> 05:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
is adequate if that that addresses what
 
05:07:05.948 --> 05:07:05.958 align:start position:0%
what he's looking at that I would also
 
05:07:08.310 --> 05:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
but but I would also contend that 16 and
 
05:07:12.628 --> 05:07:12.638 align:start position:0%
17 line 16 17 move through uh where
 
05:07:14.788 --> 05:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
there's not a requirement for attending
 
05:07:17.470 --> 05:07:17.480 align:start position:0%
every single board meeting year round um
 
05:07:19.990 --> 05:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
you know that's another that's another
 
05:07:22.948 --> 05:07:22.958 align:start position:0%
barrier to entry if you will so if if if
 
05:07:26.190 --> 05:07:26.200 align:start position:0%
we're comfortable with paragraph one no
 
05:07:29.070 --> 05:07:29.080 align:start position:0%
ran number one addressing the number
 
05:07:31.750 --> 05:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
then I you we could keep that the way it
 
05:07:34.548 --> 05:07:34.558 align:start position:0%
is but I would ask that the the the
 
05:07:37.750 --> 05:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
committee keep 16 to 7 line 16 to 17
 
05:07:40.910 --> 05:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you all right any other questions
 
05:07:47.030 --> 05:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:49.830 --> 05:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
today y we already have a pink card for
 
05:07:49.840 --> 05:07:56.910 align:start position:0%
today y we already have a pink card for
you

05:07:56.910 --> 05:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:59.628 --> 05:07:59.638 align:start position:0%
Becky for the record uh Becky Wilson
 
05:08:01.310 --> 05:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
director of governmental relations for
 
05:08:02.590 --> 05:08:02.600 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire school board
 
05:08:04.510 --> 05:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
Association uh we are not taking a
 
05:08:06.430 --> 05:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
position on this bill but I did want to
 
05:08:08.270 --> 05:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
try to clarify I think some of the
 
05:08:09.750 --> 05:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
questions and concerns that were coming
 
05:08:12.430 --> 05:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
from the committee as well as um maybe
 
05:08:14.590 --> 05:08:14.600 align:start position:0%
provide a little situational context
 
05:08:16.548 --> 05:08:16.558 align:start position:0%
potentially that we've heard about over
 
05:08:18.270 --> 05:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
the past year since the original bill
 
05:08:21.110 --> 05:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
was passed so initially when this bill
 
05:08:23.708 --> 05:08:23.718 align:start position:0%
was passed last session two sessions ago
 
05:08:25.310 --> 05:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
they're starting to blur in my mind
 
05:08:28.628 --> 05:08:28.638 align:start position:0%
quite honestly um The Challenge was that
 
05:08:30.230 --> 05:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
or the intention of the bill was to
 
05:08:33.190 --> 05:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
require that every High School in a
 
05:08:35.470 --> 05:08:35.480 align:start position:0%
district had a student representative on
 
05:08:37.030 --> 05:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
the school board and that that position
 
05:08:40.310 --> 05:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
was an elected position it has been very
 
05:08:42.230 --> 05:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
common practice for many years for
 
05:08:44.030 --> 05:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
school boards to have student reps but
 
05:08:45.910 --> 05:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
they not not all of the student reps
 
05:08:48.430 --> 05:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
were elected by the student body they
 
05:08:50.430 --> 05:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
were appointed or maybe they were
 
05:08:52.070 --> 05:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
elected or maybe if you were the student
 
05:08:53.708 --> 05:08:53.718 align:start position:0%
president you also were the student rep
 
05:08:55.270 --> 05:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
so there was different ways of becoming
 
05:08:57.510 --> 05:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
the student rep that bill clarified that
 
05:08:59.150 --> 05:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
that position has to be an elected
 
05:09:01.430 --> 05:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
position by a majority of the student
 
05:09:07.030 --> 05:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
body so this bill I believe um doesn't
 
05:09:09.830 --> 05:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily require that you have more
 
05:09:12.070 --> 05:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
than one but if you wanted to have up to
 
05:09:16.030 --> 05:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
three those would all need to be elected
 
05:09:19.070 --> 05:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
positions so that and as you might know
 
05:09:20.230 --> 05:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
we've talked about it before in
 
05:09:21.390 --> 05:09:21.400 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the New Hampshire
 
05:09:23.230 --> 05:09:23.240 align:start position:0%
school administrators Association we
 
05:09:25.470 --> 05:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
have held three training for student
 
05:09:28.628 --> 05:09:28.638 align:start position:0%
reps um over the past year or so
 
05:09:30.390 --> 05:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
representing about 30 different School
 
05:09:32.948 --> 05:09:32.958 align:start position:0%
boards about 50 student members and we
 
05:09:36.150 --> 05:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
have heard from student Schoolboard reps
 
05:09:39.708 --> 05:09:39.718 align:start position:0%
sometimes it is a challenge to balance
 
05:09:43.190 --> 05:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
um the role with their other obligations
 
05:09:46.430 --> 05:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
that's work Sports other after school
 
05:09:50.948 --> 05:09:50.958 align:start position:0%
activities Family Life Etc um because
 
05:09:53.868 --> 05:09:53.878 align:start position:0%
they are full members of the board other
 
05:09:56.670 --> 05:09:56.680 align:start position:0%
than non- voting for many of them the
 
05:09:57.948 --> 05:09:57.958 align:start position:0%
expectation is not that you're just
 
05:09:59.350 --> 05:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
giving a board report and leaving the
 
05:10:01.270 --> 05:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
board meeting the expectation is you are
 
05:10:03.190 --> 05:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
a full member of the board other than
 
05:10:05.868 --> 05:10:05.878 align:start position:0%
for certain exclusions non-public Etc
 
05:10:08.548 --> 05:10:08.558 align:start position:0%
and that you just can't vote um so the
 
05:10:10.230 --> 05:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
expectation for some of these students
 
05:10:11.788 --> 05:10:11.798 align:start position:0%
is that they are remaining at the school
 
05:10:13.390 --> 05:10:13.400 align:start position:0%
board meeting for the entirety of the
 
05:10:15.910 --> 05:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
school board meeting some school boards
 
05:10:18.070 --> 05:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
only meet once a month some meet every
 
05:10:20.150 --> 05:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
other week some in some of the cities
 
05:10:21.948 --> 05:10:21.958 align:start position:0%
have their regular meetings every other
 
05:10:23.868 --> 05:10:23.878 align:start position:0%
week plus committee meetings so
 
05:10:26.070 --> 05:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
depending on how districts are
 
05:10:27.390 --> 05:10:27.400 align:start position:0%
interpreting this role and how the
 
05:10:29.110 --> 05:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
student government is sort of outlining
 
05:10:30.830 --> 05:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
this role you could have a student who
 
05:10:33.948 --> 05:10:33.958 align:start position:0%
was at school board meetings many times
 
05:10:37.270 --> 05:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
per month um so this would allow the
 
05:10:39.750 --> 05:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
student government not
 
05:10:43.990 --> 05:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
to uh appoint student reps but all that
 
05:10:45.430 --> 05:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
all the student government would be
 
05:10:47.310 --> 05:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
doing is determining the number of
 
05:10:50.430 --> 05:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
elected positions I think and what that
 
05:10:52.708 --> 05:10:52.718 align:start position:0%
would entail so if you want to run for
 
05:10:54.910 --> 05:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
Student Schoolboard rep this is what
 
05:10:57.670 --> 05:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
that means you go to one meeting per
 
05:10:59.868 --> 05:10:59.878 align:start position:0%
month maybe it's the full meeting maybe
 
05:11:01.270 --> 05:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
it's a committee meeting however the
 
05:11:02.868 --> 05:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
student government wants to define the
 
05:11:05.230 --> 05:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
role they aren't telling the individual
 
05:11:06.910 --> 05:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
reps what they're supposed to be doing
 
05:11:10.110 --> 05:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
if that helps with that um we also over
 
05:11:11.750 --> 05:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
the past year since the original bill
 
05:11:13.510 --> 05:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
was put into place have had an
 
05:11:16.470 --> 05:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
occasional situation where student rep
 
05:11:18.548 --> 05:11:18.558 align:start position:0%
would be unable to attend school
 
05:11:20.270 --> 05:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
sponsored events and I will leave it at
 
05:11:22.230 --> 05:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
that uh without getting into a lot of
 
05:11:24.830 --> 05:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
context for some particular reason
 
05:11:26.750 --> 05:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
however because they are an elected in
 
05:11:28.708 --> 05:11:28.718 align:start position:0%
their elected capacity they are still
 
05:11:30.990 --> 05:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
expected to go to Schoolboard meetings
 
05:11:32.910 --> 05:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
that has created some some challenges
 
05:11:35.948 --> 05:11:35.958 align:start position:0%
for those districts I I'm happy to
 
05:11:39.510 --> 05:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
provide more General context if needed
 
05:11:41.510 --> 05:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
the board can't exclude them from the
 
05:11:43.350 --> 05:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
meeting because they are elected as part
 
05:11:45.350 --> 05:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
of the school board at the same time
 
05:11:47.708 --> 05:11:47.718 align:start position:0%
they are not maybe uh available to
 
05:11:49.430 --> 05:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
attend school sponsored events so if you
 
05:11:51.948 --> 05:11:51.958 align:start position:0%
had additional School Board reps that
 
05:11:53.868 --> 05:11:53.878 align:start position:0%
are student reps this would give you
 
05:11:56.110 --> 05:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
some flexibility in terms of how to
 
05:11:58.150 --> 05:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
handle those situations and still meet
 
05:11:59.750 --> 05:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
your obligation of having student voice
 
05:12:02.628 --> 05:12:02.638 align:start position:0%
on the school board um
 
05:12:05.150 --> 05:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
I I'm open to answer any other technical
 
05:12:08.350 --> 05:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you for uh
 
05:12:10.868 --> 05:12:10.878 align:start position:0%
helping us out with this um you
 
05:12:14.150 --> 05:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you believe um lines uh
 
05:12:17.110 --> 05:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
seven and eight um indicate uh the
 
05:12:20.110 --> 05:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
number of elected rep
 
05:12:22.830 --> 05:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
Representatives um but it that's really
 
05:12:25.310 --> 05:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
a School Board responsibility to
 
05:12:27.868 --> 05:12:27.878 align:start position:0%
determine the number of student
 
05:12:29.830 --> 05:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
Representatives on the school board
 
05:12:31.430 --> 05:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
isn't isn't it thank you for the
 
05:12:33.390 --> 05:12:33.400 align:start position:0%
question not the way the current statute
 
05:12:35.150 --> 05:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
is the current statute mandates that you
 
05:12:38.390 --> 05:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
have to have one that is elected by the
 
05:12:39.948 --> 05:12:39.958 align:start position:0%
student body and the way the spill is
 
05:12:41.110 --> 05:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
written the student government is
 
05:12:43.110 --> 05:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
deciding if you want more than one
 
05:12:46.270 --> 05:12:46.280 align:start position:0%
elected position and what their role is
 
05:12:51.910 --> 05:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
follow so basically this language is
 
05:12:54.708 --> 05:12:54.718 align:start position:0%
superseding the will of the school board
 
05:12:57.868 --> 05:12:57.878 align:start position:0%
who might say we want one one
 
05:13:01.030 --> 05:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative for on the student on the
 
05:13:04.788 --> 05:13:04.798 align:start position:0%
board but this is indicating um the
 
05:13:06.670 --> 05:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
Student Government Can overrule that and
 
05:13:08.150 --> 05:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
say they want up to
 
05:13:10.750 --> 05:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
three thank you for the question when
 
05:13:12.390 --> 05:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
the initial bill was put forward the
 
05:13:14.030 --> 05:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
intent of that was to have student voice
 
05:13:15.910 --> 05:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
on the school board it was not a
 
05:13:19.030 --> 05:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard requested position so I
 
05:13:22.110 --> 05:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
believe that the intent of this amended
 
05:13:23.868 --> 05:13:23.878 align:start position:0%
language in this bill allowing the
 
05:13:25.590 --> 05:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
student government to determine how many
 
05:13:28.390 --> 05:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
people they want um would not be out of
 
05:13:29.910 --> 05:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
line with the original intent of having
 
05:13:34.750 --> 05:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:37.590 --> 05:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
further questions represent Damon thank
 
05:13:39.510 --> 05:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for your help with
 
05:13:43.510 --> 05:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
this I was interpreting the uh
 
05:13:46.270 --> 05:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
representative introducing the bill to
 
05:13:49.070 --> 05:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
be suggesting that having more than one
 
05:13:51.190 --> 05:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
student representative would not
 
05:13:53.628 --> 05:13:53.638 align:start position:0%
necessarily be an increased number of
 
05:13:56.190 --> 05:13:56.200 align:start position:0%
positions but more of a job
 
05:13:59.708 --> 05:13:59.718 align:start position:0%
share or it could be either of those but
 
05:14:01.990 --> 05:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
would you comment on the idea of two or
 
05:14:04.670 --> 05:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
three students sort of holding a
 
05:14:07.070 --> 05:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
position that they rotate so no single
 
05:14:09.470 --> 05:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
one has to attend all the meetings thank
 
05:14:11.788 --> 05:14:11.798 align:start position:0%
you for the question so currently there
 
05:14:13.788 --> 05:14:13.798 align:start position:0%
are a number of school boards and
 
05:14:15.910 --> 05:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
student bodies who have two School Board
 
05:14:17.310 --> 05:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
Representatives I'm just going to use
 
05:14:19.670 --> 05:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
that as an example often it is a Junior
 
05:14:21.868 --> 05:14:21.878 align:start position:0%
and senior for lack of a you know better
 
05:14:23.990 --> 05:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
criteria and the intention of that is
 
05:14:26.270 --> 05:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
for the junior student to come in and
 
05:14:27.910 --> 05:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
kind of understand and learn the role of
 
05:14:29.548 --> 05:14:29.558 align:start position:0%
the student School Board member so that
 
05:14:31.708 --> 05:14:31.718 align:start position:0%
when the senior person graduates they
 
05:14:34.670 --> 05:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
can elect yet another Junior scho
 
05:14:36.910 --> 05:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
student rep um and then the senior and
 
05:14:39.708 --> 05:14:39.718 align:start position:0%
so forth so in some of those situations
 
05:14:41.190 --> 05:14:41.200 align:start position:0%
what's currently happening in practice
 
05:14:43.030 --> 05:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
is perhaps not both of those reps are
 
05:14:45.470 --> 05:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
staying for the entire meeting perhaps
 
05:14:46.910 --> 05:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
if one of them has something else the
 
05:14:49.150 --> 05:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
other person is staying vice versa or
 
05:14:50.948 --> 05:14:50.958 align:start position:0%
they have between the two of them
 
05:14:52.670 --> 05:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
figured out how you know okay I'm going
 
05:14:55.030 --> 05:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
to provide a school bull report for the
 
05:14:57.590 --> 05:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
K to six and I'm going to provide a
 
05:15:00.430 --> 05:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
student rep report for 7 to 12 what
 
05:15:02.910 --> 05:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
however they've divied up it between the
 
05:15:06.590 --> 05:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
two reps already um for towns and cities
 
05:15:08.350 --> 05:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
that have more than one high school you
 
05:15:10.310 --> 05:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
have already more than one rep because
 
05:15:11.868 --> 05:15:11.878 align:start position:0%
you need to have one from each High
 
05:15:14.670 --> 05:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
School this would allow each High School
 
05:15:16.910 --> 05:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
to have additional members so that if
 
05:15:18.670 --> 05:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
somebody were unable to attend the
 
05:15:21.070 --> 05:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
meeting that particular High School's
 
05:15:24.030 --> 05:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
voice wouldn't be silent at that
 
05:15:28.030 --> 05:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
meeting further questions repres
 
05:15:28.040 --> 05:15:29.628 align:start position:0%
meeting further questions repres
laus

05:15:29.628 --> 05:15:29.638 align:start position:0%
laus
 
05:15:34.270 --> 05:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
so do you think think that the lines 7
 
05:15:37.868 --> 05:15:37.878 align:start position:0%
through n are necessary in order to
 
05:15:41.230 --> 05:15:41.240 align:start position:0%
do um what
 
05:15:44.190 --> 05:15:44.200 align:start position:0%
was what the intent of the bill is as
 
05:15:46.190 --> 05:15:46.200 align:start position:0%
far as that part goes or do you think
 
05:15:48.548 --> 05:15:48.558 align:start position:0%
the fact that it says one or more
 
05:15:52.910 --> 05:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
students in SE in in the section one
 
05:15:58.190 --> 05:15:58.200 align:start position:0%
before this is sufficient to cover that
 
05:16:01.350 --> 05:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think that
 
05:16:01.360 --> 05:16:02.350 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think that
the

05:16:02.350 --> 05:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:16:05.030 --> 05:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
section one that's not on here requires
 
05:16:07.868 --> 05:16:07.878 align:start position:0%
a student School Board rep to be elected
 
05:16:09.948 --> 05:16:09.958 align:start position:0%
I think without some clarification it
 
05:16:12.030 --> 05:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
might be confusing as to what about if
 
05:16:13.750 --> 05:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
there are more than one rep do they all
 
05:16:15.390 --> 05:16:15.400 align:start position:0%
have to be elected are some of them
 
05:16:17.350 --> 05:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
appointed what's the role of those
 
05:16:19.830 --> 05:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
people so if you want it to be aligned
 
05:16:21.830 --> 05:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
with the other language I
 
05:16:24.110 --> 05:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
think and again I don't know the
 
05:16:25.750 --> 05:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill specifically in
 
05:16:27.390 --> 05:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
terms of what the intent was but it
 
05:16:29.788 --> 05:16:29.798 align:start position:0%
seems to me the intent was to allow the
 
05:16:31.788 --> 05:16:31.798 align:start position:0%
same process for these other additional
 
05:16:32.910 --> 05:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
reps which would be they would be
 
05:16:34.750 --> 05:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
elected and the student government is
 
05:16:38.310 --> 05:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
running that election it's a you know
 
05:16:40.030 --> 05:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
race with the student body and they are
 
05:16:42.070 --> 05:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
electing those people and deciding who's
 
05:16:42.080 --> 05:16:43.430 align:start position:0%
electing those people and deciding who's
doing

05:16:43.430 --> 05:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
doing
 
05:16:45.750 --> 05:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
what thank you further questions from
 
05:16:45.760 --> 05:16:46.548 align:start position:0%
what thank you further questions from
the

05:16:46.548 --> 05:16:46.558 align:start position:0%

05:17:52.190 --> 05:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
here to present the
 
05:17:54.910 --> 05:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
bill uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
05:17:57.510 --> 05:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
honorable colleagues uh for the record
 
05:17:59.910 --> 05:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
Glenn cordelli representing Tuftonboro
 
05:18:01.910 --> 05:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
wolfboro and oy and the Beautiful Lakes
 
05:18:05.670 --> 05:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
Region and uh I'll keep in mind that
 
05:18:09.548 --> 05:18:09.558 align:start position:0%
this is the last bill of the day um but
 
05:18:13.628 --> 05:18:13.638 align:start position:0%
this bill um is pretty simple in its
 
05:18:18.430 --> 05:18:18.440 align:start position:0%
intent um uh I
 
05:18:22.868 --> 05:18:22.878 align:start position:0%
think my goal with this bill is to give
 
05:18:28.548 --> 05:18:28.558 align:start position:0%
uh parents more oversight in terms of um
 
05:18:30.310 --> 05:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
what's going on with their children in
 
05:18:32.430 --> 05:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
school uh
 
05:18:36.868 --> 05:18:36.878 align:start position:0%
currently um if you take a look um at uh
 
05:18:39.628 --> 05:18:39.638 align:start position:0%
the basic onepage Bill the section one
 
05:18:40.948 --> 05:18:40.958 align:start position:0%
and section
 
05:18:44.868 --> 05:18:44.878 align:start position:0%
two um section one is related directly
 
05:18:47.310 --> 05:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
to Medicaid to schools and I've passed
 
05:18:51.948 --> 05:18:51.958 align:start position:0%
out the uh latest um required uh
 
05:18:55.190 --> 05:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
DHHS uh annual report on Medicaid to
 
05:18:58.750 --> 05:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
schools and you can see in uh school
 
05:18:58.760 --> 05:19:00.030 align:start position:0%
schools and you can see in uh school
year

05:19:00.030 --> 05:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:19:03.470 --> 05:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
22 um we're talking about over $113
 
05:19:06.230 --> 05:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
million in federal Medicaid
 
05:19:08.830 --> 05:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursement to New Hampshire schools
 
05:19:14.150 --> 05:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
so it's a healthy sum um and right now
 
05:19:19.230 --> 05:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
it is required that uh written parental
 
05:19:24.070 --> 05:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
consent is required in order to Bill
 
05:19:27.910 --> 05:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid but that's only required one
 
05:19:33.548 --> 05:19:33.558 align:start position:0%
time um the intent here is that
 
05:19:36.990 --> 05:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
whenever uh there is billing for a new
 
05:19:41.708 --> 05:19:41.718 align:start position:0%
service as indicated by a um uh a
 
05:19:47.030 --> 05:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
different um uh service code diagnostic
 
05:19:50.070 --> 05:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
code that there would be written
 
05:19:53.948 --> 05:19:53.958 align:start position:0%
consent uh and at the same time before
 
05:19:58.510 --> 05:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
the service was offered was applied
 
05:20:00.350 --> 05:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
there should be written consent from the
 
05:20:03.070 --> 05:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
parent also to that
 
05:20:06.430 --> 05:20:06.440 align:start position:0%
service uh so two things uh for the
 
05:20:09.590 --> 05:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
service there has to be written consent
 
05:20:11.628 --> 05:20:11.638 align:start position:0%
and for billing um there has to be
 
05:20:11.638 --> 05:20:13.110 align:start position:0%
and for billing um there has to be
written

05:20:13.110 --> 05:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
written
 
05:20:17.948 --> 05:20:17.958 align:start position:0%
consent um the second part uh is already
 
05:20:22.708 --> 05:20:22.718 align:start position:0%
in statute uh Roman 200 excuse me RSA
 
05:20:26.350 --> 05:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
227a um also related to the consent of
 
05:20:30.110 --> 05:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
parents and uh I just try and replicate
 
05:20:32.868 --> 05:20:32.878 align:start position:0%
that requirement in this uh area of
 
05:20:35.628 --> 05:20:35.638 align:start position:0%
Statute so that again uh parental
 
05:20:38.470 --> 05:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
consent is required for each new service
 
05:20:41.350 --> 05:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
based on the diagnostic billing
 
05:20:46.510 --> 05:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
code uh so I think it is um pretty
 
05:20:52.350 --> 05:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
simple in in that regard um
 
05:20:55.310 --> 05:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
one reason I I started thinking about
 
05:20:59.030 --> 05:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
this requirement was um testimony we had
 
05:21:01.628 --> 05:21:01.638 align:start position:0%
um I believe it was last year or it
 
05:21:04.190 --> 05:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
might have been the year before with um
 
05:21:08.270 --> 05:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to schools and um there was
 
05:21:10.470 --> 05:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
even testimony from the Department of
 
05:21:13.150 --> 05:21:13.160 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services that there had
 
05:21:16.788 --> 05:21:16.798 align:start position:0%
been U parental consent um being
 
05:21:16.798 --> 05:21:18.430 align:start position:0%
been U parental consent um being
required

05:21:18.430 --> 05:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
required
 
05:21:22.150 --> 05:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
online um for the billing to take place
 
05:21:25.470 --> 05:21:25.480 align:start position:0%
but due to a previous
 
05:21:29.390 --> 05:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
change by a previous administration that
 
05:21:31.310 --> 05:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
consent was eliminated and the
 
05:21:34.590 --> 05:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
department was working to bring back
 
05:21:36.390 --> 05:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
basically the required written consent
 
05:21:38.628 --> 05:21:38.638 align:start position:0%
so I started thinking about you know do
 
05:21:40.510 --> 05:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
we want
 
05:21:44.788 --> 05:21:44.798 align:start position:0%
billing um or consent just one time and
 
05:21:48.350 --> 05:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
then it's cart blanch to bill for or
 
05:21:51.070 --> 05:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
offer any other services that student uh
 
05:21:53.910 --> 05:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
possibly without the parents knowledge
 
05:21:58.548 --> 05:21:58.558 align:start position:0%
so that was the Genesis of um uh putting
 
05:22:01.190 --> 05:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
this legislation together so that
 
05:22:05.990 --> 05:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
parents know about what uh is being uh
 
05:22:08.110 --> 05:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
offered to their students in school in
 
05:22:10.310 --> 05:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
terms of uh
 
05:22:13.230 --> 05:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
services so I thank you are there any
 
05:22:14.910 --> 05:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
 
05:22:14.920 --> 05:22:16.070 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
representative

05:22:16.070 --> 05:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:22:18.190 --> 05:22:18.200 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:22:21.070 --> 05:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question I actually have two
 
05:22:23.708 --> 05:22:23.718 align:start position:0%
so one is to
 
05:22:26.868 --> 05:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
clarify um it
 
05:22:29.628 --> 05:22:29.638 align:start position:0%
references diagnostic
 
05:22:32.590 --> 05:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
code I'm wondering if maybe that isn't
 
05:22:35.590 --> 05:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
supposed to be procedure code you don't
 
05:22:37.708 --> 05:22:37.718 align:start position:0%
bill for a diagnosis usually you Bill
 
05:22:40.270 --> 05:22:40.280 align:start position:0%
for whatever procedure or service is
 
05:22:44.270 --> 05:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
provided relative to a
 
05:22:44.280 --> 05:22:47.070 align:start position:0%
provided relative to a
diagnosis

05:22:47.070 --> 05:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
diagnosis
 
05:22:51.470 --> 05:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
um uh I'll take that under advisement um
 
05:22:55.110 --> 05:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
I I did work in a medical center um for
 
05:22:58.670 --> 05:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh a decade and um I was very familiar
 
05:23:03.350 --> 05:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
with uh ICD then it was idc9 codes I
 
05:23:05.788 --> 05:23:05.798 align:start position:0%
think now it's 11 12 who knows what it
 
05:23:09.270 --> 05:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
is but um and I did talk to a former
 
05:23:12.510 --> 05:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
nurse about this as well um and that's
 
05:23:15.548 --> 05:23:15.558 align:start position:0%
when we agreed on diagnos diagnostic but
 
05:23:17.310 --> 05:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
um you know we can look into procedure
 
05:23:18.628 --> 05:23:18.638 align:start position:0%
codes as
 
05:23:22.470 --> 05:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
well and then may I follow up yes so the
 
05:23:26.670 --> 05:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
other um question was just to uh
 
05:23:29.390 --> 05:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
confirm it sounds like your the bill is
 
05:23:33.110 --> 05:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
requesting to consents one for the
 
05:23:35.910 --> 05:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
parent or Guardian to consent to
 
05:23:38.750 --> 05:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
whichever service it is right and then a
 
05:23:40.948 --> 05:23:40.958 align:start position:0%
separate one to concept for it to be
 
05:23:46.510 --> 05:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:46.520 --> 05:23:48.510 align:start position:0%
 
correct

05:23:48.510 --> 05:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:23:51.910 --> 05:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
okay Miler thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:23:54.948 --> 05:23:54.958 align:start position:0%
for taking my question once again I see
 
05:23:56.430 --> 05:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
here on line
 
05:23:59.350 --> 05:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
16 that you're using the code of
 
05:24:02.230 --> 05:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
conduct as a punitive measure is there a
 
05:24:05.190 --> 05:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:11.350 --> 05:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
that uh it it's um really just uh to uh
 
05:24:15.548 --> 05:24:15.558 align:start position:0%
ensure that um the consent is being
 
05:24:19.030 --> 05:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
obtained uh primarily because um it
 
05:24:23.708 --> 05:24:23.718 align:start position:0%
wouldn't obtain excuse me pertain to um
 
05:24:26.548 --> 05:24:26.558 align:start position:0%
uh to the billing necess possibly
 
05:24:29.350 --> 05:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
possibly to the billing but when we see
 
05:24:32.150 --> 05:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
that um the system is not actually
 
05:24:35.470 --> 05:24:35.480 align:start position:0%
requiring that consent now um uh I
 
05:24:39.708 --> 05:24:39.718 align:start position:0%
wanted there to be some uh some form of
 
05:24:43.910 --> 05:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
um remediation or penalty if you will um
 
05:24:47.750 --> 05:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
for the uh elimination of that which is
 
05:24:49.470 --> 05:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
required by
 
05:24:53.430 --> 05:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
law yes well on that I mean is isn't
 
05:24:55.230 --> 05:24:55.240 align:start position:0%
there another alternative other than
 
05:24:58.110 --> 05:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
using the code of conduct for example
 
05:25:00.070 --> 05:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
School District could Implement
 
05:25:02.030 --> 05:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
Progressive discipline for example
 
05:25:04.430 --> 05:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
rather than using the code of conduct in
 
05:25:09.470 --> 05:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:09.480 --> 05:25:14.430 align:start position:0%
 
be

05:25:14.430 --> 05:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:17.390 --> 05:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
Alternatives other
 
05:25:19.548 --> 05:25:19.558 align:start position:0%
Alternatives forther questions I do have
 
05:25:22.070 --> 05:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
one in representative
 
05:25:24.750 --> 05:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
casken on line 14 it says any AG
 
05:25:26.948 --> 05:25:26.958 align:start position:0%
educator who orders refers prescribes
 
05:25:32.628 --> 05:25:32.638 align:start position:0%
renders or provides services if the IEP
 
05:25:35.230 --> 05:25:35.240 align:start position:0%
specifies goals and objectives for this
 
05:25:35.240 --> 05:25:36.270 align:start position:0%
specifies goals and objectives for this
particular

05:25:36.270 --> 05:25:36.280 align:start position:0%

nurse goes ahead and prescribes some of
 
05:25:42.638 --> 05:25:44.310 align:start position:0%
nurse goes ahead and prescribes some of
these

05:25:44.310 --> 05:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:25:48.230 --> 05:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
Services um is the IEP enough or do you
 
05:25:50.390 --> 05:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
have to go back and every time you do
 
05:25:52.670 --> 05:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
this do you have to get support or
 
05:25:59.590 --> 05:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:59.600 --> 05:26:02.030 align:start position:0%
 
parent

05:26:02.030 --> 05:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
parent
 
05:26:04.310 --> 05:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you you think I have know by now
 
05:26:07.470 --> 05:26:07.480 align:start position:0%
would you um uh if it's required in the
 
05:26:11.548 --> 05:26:11.558 align:start position:0%
IEP and and the parent has signed off on
 
05:26:11.558 --> 05:26:12.350 align:start position:0%
IEP and and the parent has signed off on
that

05:26:12.350 --> 05:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:26:14.830 --> 05:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
IEP um you know then I think we could
 
05:26:18.070 --> 05:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
make an adjustment there represent
 
05:26:20.750 --> 05:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
cascaden I was thinking WR those same
 
05:26:23.788 --> 05:26:23.798 align:start position:0%
lines if it's a 504 plan or an
 
05:26:26.868 --> 05:26:26.878 align:start position:0%
IEP if there's a change an addition or a
 
05:26:29.350 --> 05:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
deletion of a
 
05:26:32.150 --> 05:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
service that team has to convene and get
 
05:26:32.160 --> 05:26:33.830 align:start position:0%
service that team has to convene and get
parental

05:26:33.830 --> 05:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
parental
 
05:26:36.270 --> 05:26:36.280 align:start position:0%
permission but the members on the team
 
05:26:38.628 --> 05:26:38.638 align:start position:0%
are not privy who's a Medicaid student
 
05:26:42.030 --> 05:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
or not that's all internal within an
 
05:26:45.270 --> 05:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
office that connects um the students
 
05:26:46.670 --> 05:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
name so an
 
05:26:49.310 --> 05:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
educator can't just automatically call
 
05:26:51.350 --> 05:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
the speech person and say I want that
 
05:26:54.310 --> 05:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
student to have more time it doesn't
 
05:26:56.830 --> 05:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
happen that way the parent has to be at
 
05:26:58.948 --> 05:26:58.958 align:start position:0%
the table if there's a need for more
 
05:27:00.948 --> 05:27:00.958 align:start position:0%
time then it's a team meeting and they
 
05:27:03.948 --> 05:27:03.958 align:start position:0%
have to sign consent for that so I don't
 
05:27:06.590 --> 05:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
know if you've got specific examples
 
05:27:10.150 --> 05:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
that identify what additional consent
 
05:27:12.110 --> 05:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
because students on Medicaid is
 
05:27:12.120 --> 05:27:13.788 align:start position:0%
because students on Medicaid is
confidential

05:27:13.788 --> 05:27:13.798 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
05:27:17.030 --> 05:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
information so providers don't know
 
05:27:20.510 --> 05:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
which students are Medicaid and which is
 
05:27:23.110 --> 05:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
so I do you have any specific I do not
 
05:27:25.830 --> 05:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
have any specific
 
05:27:28.948 --> 05:27:28.958 align:start position:0%
information repres
 
05:27:31.708 --> 05:27:31.718 align:start position:0%
leus my question is also with that
 
05:27:35.830 --> 05:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
section Roman numeral 9 but my question
 
05:27:39.430 --> 05:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
is what about an emergency situation is
 
05:27:44.750 --> 05:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:48.548 --> 05:27:48.558 align:start position:0%
that uh exception for what are you
 
05:27:51.868 --> 05:27:51.878 align:start position:0%
looking at I was looking at an emergency
 
05:27:54.110 --> 05:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
situation for instance
 
05:27:56.590 --> 05:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
epipens um they there wouldn't
 
05:27:59.510 --> 05:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily be prior parental consent
 
05:28:01.230 --> 05:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
but it might but you wouldn't have time
 
05:28:05.470 --> 05:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
to get it either right yeah I I I would
 
05:28:09.110 --> 05:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
see that um emergency situations like we
 
05:28:12.310 --> 05:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
talked about with that specific um Bill
 
05:28:14.110 --> 05:28:14.120 align:start position:0%
emergency set situations could be
 
05:28:16.948 --> 05:28:16.958 align:start position:0%
handled differently but um you know
 
05:28:18.830 --> 05:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
whether you would still need a parental
 
05:28:21.390 --> 05:28:21.400 align:start position:0%
consent to bill for that um you know
 
05:28:23.910 --> 05:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
that we could talk about
 
05:28:27.670 --> 05:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
okay further questions representative
 
05:28:29.390 --> 05:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank
 
05:28:33.788 --> 05:28:33.798 align:start position:0%
you I'm still uh hung up in the the the
 
05:28:37.990 --> 05:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
punitive nature of item nine uh uh to
 
05:28:41.190 --> 05:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
start with and and if an educator is is
 
05:28:42.910 --> 05:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
doing an action and the parent has
 
05:28:44.948 --> 05:28:44.958 align:start position:0%
already had to sign off on
 
05:28:46.868 --> 05:28:46.878 align:start position:0%
it because that's how we're doing the
 
05:28:47.910 --> 05:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
action because they has to come back to
 
05:28:50.390 --> 05:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
he I I don't understand why there is why
 
05:28:53.310 --> 05:28:53.320 align:start position:0%
there is a a double issue here that if
 
05:28:55.190 --> 05:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
they do that then without the second
 
05:28:57.110 --> 05:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
signature that they're it's punitive
 
05:29:01.830 --> 05:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
they've already agreed to it yeah
 
05:29:06.390 --> 05:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
as we discussed U if this is in the IEP
 
05:29:09.270 --> 05:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
and the IEP has been signed off on um
 
05:29:10.948 --> 05:29:10.958 align:start position:0%
then I think that um you know we could
 
05:29:12.628 --> 05:29:12.638 align:start position:0%
modify this
 
05:29:16.470 --> 05:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
language okay so when yeah thank you so
 
05:29:18.190 --> 05:29:18.200 align:start position:0%
when would this occur that there a
 
05:29:20.750 --> 05:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
student wasn't in an IEP they had
 
05:29:20.760 --> 05:29:21.990 align:start position:0%
student wasn't in an IEP they had
prescribed

05:29:21.990 --> 05:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
prescribed
 
05:29:24.350 --> 05:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
Services if I will for not an IEP but
 
05:29:25.628 --> 05:29:25.638 align:start position:0%
still prescrib
 
05:29:28.310 --> 05:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
service I I believe that there would be
 
05:29:30.470 --> 05:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh children who qualified who did not
 
05:29:34.030 --> 05:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
have an IEP um and perhaps uh someone
 
05:29:36.708 --> 05:29:36.718 align:start position:0%
behind me can uh speak to
 
05:29:39.548 --> 05:29:39.558 align:start position:0%
that thank you thank you Mr
 
05:29:42.470 --> 05:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
chair further questions yes represent
 
05:29:44.990 --> 05:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you I think I asked my in
 
05:29:46.628 --> 05:29:46.638 align:start position:0%
the weeds question and I should have
 
05:29:48.868 --> 05:29:48.878 align:start position:0%
asked the broader question
 
05:29:52.948 --> 05:29:52.958 align:start position:0%
first is there a perception or
 
05:29:57.430 --> 05:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
um awareness of a problem in the
 
05:29:59.628 --> 05:29:59.638 align:start position:0%
utilization of Medicaid for services in
 
05:29:59.638 --> 05:30:06.230 align:start position:0%
utilization of Medicaid for services in
schools

05:30:06.230 --> 05:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:08.990 --> 05:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
I think a couple of things one we had
 
05:30:11.030 --> 05:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
heard that there was in terms of getting
 
05:30:15.670 --> 05:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
parental consent uh two um there are new
 
05:30:18.670 --> 05:30:18.680 align:start position:0%
guidelines um that have been coming down
 
05:30:22.628 --> 05:30:22.638 align:start position:0%
um from from the feds and I had
 
05:30:25.590 --> 05:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
correspondence with um
 
05:30:29.070 --> 05:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
DHHS and um they are looking to uh
 
05:30:30.830 --> 05:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
modify rules
 
05:30:35.350 --> 05:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
um based on new guidance so um you know
 
05:30:39.030 --> 05:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
whether those uh new rules will include
 
05:30:41.070 --> 05:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
05:30:45.190 --> 05:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
alter alternative um uh written consent
 
05:30:49.030 --> 05:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
from parents uh I'm not sure but um I
 
05:30:51.708 --> 05:30:51.718 align:start position:0%
wanted to get a get out ahead of that in
 
05:30:54.030 --> 05:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
terms of this
 
05:30:54.040 --> 05:30:56.390 align:start position:0%
terms of this
requirement

05:30:56.390 --> 05:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
05:30:58.548 --> 05:30:58.558 align:start position:0%
yes has there been communication with
 
05:31:03.110 --> 05:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:07.948 --> 05:31:07.958 align:start position:0%
it um it was in relation to um
 
05:31:10.470 --> 05:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
specifically the uh new federal
 
05:31:13.990 --> 05:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines that were being um worked on
 
05:31:16.670 --> 05:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
and the new rules that would accompany
 
05:31:20.910 --> 05:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
that um have they seen the bill uh I am
 
05:31:20.920 --> 05:31:23.110 align:start position:0%
that um have they seen the bill uh I am
not

05:31:23.110 --> 05:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:31:25.868 --> 05:31:25.878 align:start position:0%
sure I I have a question that follows up
 
05:31:27.750 --> 05:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
from our discussion when we had the last
 
05:31:30.750 --> 05:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid School stype
 
05:31:35.430 --> 05:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
debate um if in fact the parent or the
 
05:31:38.670 --> 05:31:38.680 align:start position:0%
person that's qualifying for
 
05:31:42.430 --> 05:31:42.440 align:start position:0%
Medicade working with HHS checks off on
 
05:31:42.440 --> 05:31:43.470 align:start position:0%
Medicade working with HHS checks off on
the

05:31:43.470 --> 05:31:43.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:31:49.708 --> 05:31:49.718 align:start position:0%
box that Bo I I agree to the person at
 
05:31:52.350 --> 05:31:52.360 align:start position:0%
the school be it the nurse whatever
 
05:31:54.990 --> 05:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
doing what you're saying right here does
 
05:31:57.470 --> 05:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
the does that then take care of the
 
05:31:59.750 --> 05:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the school having to
 
05:32:01.788 --> 05:32:01.798 align:start position:0%
do this
 
05:32:04.470 --> 05:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
um I think in that instance it's a it's
 
05:32:08.150 --> 05:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
a onetime check off I'm looking for um
 
05:32:11.510 --> 05:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
for each new uh service being pro being
 
05:32:16.190 --> 05:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
provided and I I hope that uh possibly
 
05:32:19.868 --> 05:32:19.878 align:start position:0%
that check off box um has been made
 
05:32:22.868 --> 05:32:22.878 align:start position:0%
available since um our last discussion
 
05:32:25.948 --> 05:32:25.958 align:start position:0%
where it had was not available further
 
05:32:28.230 --> 05:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee one more
 
05:32:31.510 --> 05:32:31.520 align:start position:0%

account is a direct is a direct service

you're not bilding Medicaid for um free
 
05:32:58.110 --> 05:32:58.120 align:start position:0%

know we all go to the doctor and we sit
 
05:34:29.948 --> 05:34:29.958 align:start position:0%
there for the first 15 minutes and and
 
05:34:32.190 --> 05:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
they ask you questions have you received
 
05:34:34.430 --> 05:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
your colonoscopy have you received this
 
05:34:36.350 --> 05:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
test have you received that test and you
 
05:34:39.350 --> 05:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
sit there and you answer yes yes yes you
 
05:34:41.070 --> 05:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
sit there politely for a little while
 
05:34:43.548 --> 05:34:43.558 align:start position:0%
until the 10th or 11th question and then
 
05:34:45.990 --> 05:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
you're finally like okay how come this
 
05:34:47.910 --> 05:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
is not in the system when the doctor
 
05:34:49.310 --> 05:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
you're questioning me about is literally
 
05:34:52.948 --> 05:34:52.958 align:start position:0%
right next door to you and there's no
 
05:34:56.990 --> 05:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
comprehensive database even for shared
 
05:35:00.150 --> 05:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
um doctors on the same office now
 
05:35:02.150 --> 05:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
imagine being a parent of a child with a
 
05:35:05.230 --> 05:35:05.240 align:start position:0%
disability you go to the primary care
 
05:35:07.390 --> 05:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
doctor who refers you to Dartmouth for a
 
05:35:10.670 --> 05:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
test you go to Boston for a specialist
 
05:35:13.150 --> 05:35:13.160 align:start position:0%
you go to someone on the Southshore for
 
05:35:15.830 --> 05:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
therapy and then the one common
 
05:35:18.430 --> 05:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
denominator amongst all of that is the
 
05:35:20.510 --> 05:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
parent they're the ones who can answer
 
05:35:23.110 --> 05:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
the questions when you go to the next
 
05:35:25.110 --> 05:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
doctor's appointment the next therapist
 
05:35:26.868 --> 05:35:26.878 align:start position:0%
has your child had this service has your
 
05:35:29.548 --> 05:35:29.558 align:start position:0%
child had this test you know that might
 
05:35:32.350 --> 05:35:32.360 align:start position:0%
not be recorded in the system there is
 
05:35:35.310 --> 05:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
no perfect continuity of care in the
 
05:35:38.750 --> 05:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
healthare system so knowing that and now
 
05:35:41.150 --> 05:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
what we're faced with um in this
 
05:35:43.548 --> 05:35:43.558 align:start position:0%
situation with Medicaid to schools is
 
05:35:45.390 --> 05:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
we're seeing an expansion of services
 
05:35:47.750 --> 05:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
which can be great a lot of offerings
 
05:35:49.948 --> 05:35:49.958 align:start position:0%
here but now there's regulations coming
 
05:35:53.070 --> 05:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
down with the safer communities act um
 
05:35:55.868 --> 05:35:55.878 align:start position:0%
there is free care system that's being
 
05:35:59.230 --> 05:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
adopted that does not require parental
 
05:36:01.788 --> 05:36:01.798 align:start position:0%
consent for services delivered and build
 
05:36:03.390 --> 05:36:03.400 align:start position:0%
directly to
 
05:36:05.948 --> 05:36:05.958 align:start position:0%
Medicaid there also with these news
 
05:36:08.110 --> 05:36:08.120 align:start position:0%
legislations you can build outside of an
 
05:36:11.230 --> 05:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
IEP so Services might be provided and
 
05:36:13.670 --> 05:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
you don't know what type of service that
 
05:36:16.350 --> 05:36:16.360 align:start position:0%
is and that might be okay for your child
 
05:36:19.830 --> 05:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
who's healthy and and and has a good
 
05:36:24.070 --> 05:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
Suite of of care defined but for a child
 
05:36:26.750 --> 05:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
with a disability that might not be okay
 
05:36:28.548 --> 05:36:28.558 align:start position:0%
you might have a child that doesn't
 
05:36:31.310 --> 05:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
react well to a certain certain therapy
 
05:36:34.350 --> 05:36:34.360 align:start position:0%
or treatment and the only common
 
05:36:35.868 --> 05:36:35.878 align:start position:0%
denominator at this point in time till
 
05:36:37.470 --> 05:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
we get to a place where we have a great
 
05:36:39.510 --> 05:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
system of continuity of care is the
 
05:36:41.830 --> 05:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
parent so it's really important to a
 
05:36:44.590 --> 05:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
child's health that they're tied into
 
05:36:46.310 --> 05:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
all of the Care decisions they might not
 
05:36:47.788 --> 05:36:47.798 align:start position:0%
choose to do anything with it but the
 
05:36:48.830 --> 05:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
fact that they're armed with that
 
05:36:50.670 --> 05:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge can only contribute to the
 
05:36:52.590 --> 05:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
health and well-being of the child so
 
05:36:54.070 --> 05:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
that's why I urge you to consider
 
05:36:55.390 --> 05:36:55.400 align:start position:0%
passing this
 
05:36:58.150 --> 05:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
bill so I got a question for would
 
05:37:00.430 --> 05:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
School personnel
 
05:37:04.708 --> 05:37:04.718 align:start position:0%
be billing out uh outside the I for
 
05:37:07.670 --> 05:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
services outside the IEP of any kind or
 
05:37:09.510 --> 05:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
would they all be associated with the I
 
05:37:12.548 --> 05:37:12.558 align:start position:0%
AP or 504 there are new um guidelines
 
05:37:14.910 --> 05:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
coming down one is I think Moyer will
 
05:37:16.470 --> 05:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
talk to this with the Federal Register
 
05:37:17.510 --> 05:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
that does not
 
05:37:20.350 --> 05:37:20.360 align:start position:0%
require parental consent and then the
 
05:37:23.670 --> 05:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
free care policy which allows schools to
 
05:37:26.708 --> 05:37:26.718 align:start position:0%
Bill outside of the IEP it's called a
 
05:37:30.470 --> 05:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
care policy I believe
 
05:37:32.788 --> 05:37:32.798 align:start position:0%
and if do if you know who generally does
 
05:37:35.030 --> 05:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
the billing within the school district
 
05:37:37.548 --> 05:37:37.558 align:start position:0%
is it the individual provider like the
 
05:37:40.390 --> 05:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
speech therapist or a nurse or is there
 
05:37:42.628 --> 05:37:42.638 align:start position:0%
a billing office that does that well I
 
05:37:44.590 --> 05:37:44.600 align:start position:0%
can't claim to be an expert on school
 
05:37:46.470 --> 05:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid billing I have been sitting in
 
05:37:48.750 --> 05:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
on some of the training to try to grasp
 
05:37:50.510 --> 05:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
this but it will be different for I
 
05:37:52.110 --> 05:37:52.120 align:start position:0%
think every school they might have an
 
05:37:54.548 --> 05:37:54.558 align:start position:0%
admin or they might ask for a third
 
05:37:56.390 --> 05:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
party biller to handle their
 
05:37:58.708 --> 05:37:58.718 align:start position:0%
billing so it will depend I don't think
 
05:38:00.150 --> 05:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
some schools might not be doing it at
 
05:38:02.948 --> 05:38:02.958 align:start position:0%
all what I understand thank you are
 
05:38:05.470 --> 05:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
there questions yes represent Woodcock
 
05:38:07.948 --> 05:38:07.958 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman L good afternoon just
 
05:38:10.990 --> 05:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
to follow up uh on the free care piece
 
05:38:12.270 --> 05:38:12.280 align:start position:0%
that you talked about it's coming down
 
05:38:14.708 --> 05:38:14.718 align:start position:0%
the rules coming out if their parents
 
05:38:17.070 --> 05:38:17.080 align:start position:0%
are not required to sign off on that
 
05:38:18.990 --> 05:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
free care piece I think that's what you
 
05:38:23.190 --> 05:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
said then um why would the St do the
 
05:38:24.670 --> 05:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
state have the power to overrule that
 
05:38:24.680 --> 05:38:25.750 align:start position:0%
state have the power to overrule that
federal

05:38:25.750 --> 05:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
federal
 
05:38:27.430 --> 05:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
guideline I thought the federal
 
05:38:28.910 --> 05:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines always took precence over
 
05:38:28.920 --> 05:38:30.030 align:start position:0%
guidelines always took precence over
state

05:38:30.030 --> 05:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:38:32.070 --> 05:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
05:38:34.468 --> 05:38:34.478 align:start position:0%
know is that your is that your question
 
05:38:37.430 --> 05:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
oh wait that's okay you don't she be
 
05:38:39.628 --> 05:38:39.638 align:start position:0%
better suited to answer that thank you
 
05:38:41.910 --> 05:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
thank you chair oh thank you further
 
05:38:43.910 --> 05:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Cornell
 
05:38:45.110 --> 05:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
Thank you thank you for taking my
 
05:38:47.430 --> 05:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
questions are these new rules in effect
 
05:38:49.868 --> 05:38:49.878 align:start position:0%
those have been like passed through
 
05:38:51.868 --> 05:38:51.878 align:start position:0%
whoever the government where and passed
 
05:38:54.150 --> 05:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
down to New Hampshire yeah so the safer
 
05:38:57.468 --> 05:38:57.478 align:start position:0%
communities act um that was 2014 so yes
 
05:38:59.708 --> 05:38:59.718 align:start position:0%
that one and the Federal Register is not
 
05:38:59.718 --> 05:39:00.948 align:start position:0%
that one and the Federal Register is not
um

05:39:00.948 --> 05:39:00.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:03.190 --> 05:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
accepted not in effect right yet
 
05:39:06.230 --> 05:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
followup yes so the free Care Act is
 
05:39:08.948 --> 05:39:08.958 align:start position:0%
already in effect in school or I if I
 
05:39:10.230 --> 05:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
didn't get the name right but school
 
05:39:12.590 --> 05:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
districts are all can already provide
 
05:39:15.230 --> 05:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
services without telling parents may I
 
05:39:18.190 --> 05:39:18.200 align:start position:0%
defer your question to to Moira who's
 
05:39:19.830 --> 05:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
much more knowledgeable on it than I am
 
05:39:22.868 --> 05:39:22.878 align:start position:0%
on the specifics okay thank you further
 
05:39:25.390 --> 05:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
05:39:25.400 --> 05:39:28.270 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much

Ford thank thank you for taking my
 
05:39:32.190 --> 05:39:32.200 align:start position:0%
questions I'm curious about the

authority to make that determination
 
05:39:39.150 --> 05:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
that you just spoke about where is it
 
05:39:41.548 --> 05:39:41.558 align:start position:0%
who who has that authority to make the
 
05:39:44.270 --> 05:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
decision the Federal Register I don't
 
05:39:47.270 --> 05:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
know I'm ignorant on this matter well
 
05:39:48.548 --> 05:39:48.558 align:start position:0%
that would be that would be the federal
 
05:39:51.548 --> 05:39:51.558 align:start position:0%
government and I and I can I printed out
 
05:39:53.910 --> 05:39:53.920 align:start position:0%

05:40:14.468 --> 05:40:14.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:17.430 --> 05:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
okay Moira Ryan
 
05:40:19.708 --> 05:40:19.718 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you chairman lad and thank
 
05:40:22.510 --> 05:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
you education committee members um my
 
05:40:24.310 --> 05:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
name is Mora Ryan and I'm a parent of a
 
05:40:27.510 --> 05:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
son who uh has autism and I would like
 
05:40:29.510 --> 05:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
to support this bill I'd like you to
 
05:40:32.548 --> 05:40:32.558 align:start position:0%
considerate um and I'd like to describe
 
05:40:34.270 --> 05:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
some of the situations that parents have
 
05:40:39.468 --> 05:40:39.478 align:start position:0%
with Medicaid schools um so one of the
 
05:40:41.750 --> 05:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
issues that has come up recently I met
 
05:40:44.830 --> 05:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
with um Roberto Cardona in Washington DC
 
05:40:46.948 --> 05:40:46.958 align:start position:0%
to discuss the Federal Register so the
 
05:40:50.910 --> 05:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
Federal Register is a rules oriented
 
05:40:54.270 --> 05:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
body so they're not really in touch with
 
05:40:56.788 --> 05:40:56.798 align:start position:0%
constituents or the public or parents
 
05:40:58.670 --> 05:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
and they make rules changes by publicly
 
05:40:59.750 --> 05:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
posting them
 
05:41:01.070 --> 05:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
and very few people know about the
 
05:41:04.070 --> 05:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
Federal Register and I pointed out to
 
05:41:06.270 --> 05:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
him that that might not be the best idea
 
05:41:08.708 --> 05:41:08.718 align:start position:0%
but um they do rules changes that way
 
05:41:09.910 --> 05:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
and they did post something where they
 
05:41:12.070 --> 05:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
were going to in an effort to
 
05:41:15.350 --> 05:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
streamline um processes eliminate parent
 
05:41:18.390 --> 05:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
consent for services um that is
 
05:41:20.670 --> 05:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
problematic to me for the very reasons
 
05:41:23.750 --> 05:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
that um Miss archal had said you know I
 
05:41:26.230 --> 05:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
have entire volumes of coordinated care
 
05:41:28.708 --> 05:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
for my son because I have documentation
 
05:41:30.548 --> 05:41:30.558 align:start position:0%
of all surgeries I have documentation of
 
05:41:31.830 --> 05:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
all his speech language I have
 
05:41:34.910 --> 05:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
documentation of all his OT I am the one
 
05:41:36.708 --> 05:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
who is the primary care coordinator
 
05:41:38.708 --> 05:41:38.718 align:start position:0%
because I coordinate with the IEP team
 
05:41:41.270 --> 05:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
in the school but I also coordinate with
 
05:41:45.230 --> 05:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
the medical model or the neuroses the
 
05:41:47.390 --> 05:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
developmental pediatrician Etc and I'm
 
05:41:49.310 --> 05:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
the only common in between those two
 
05:41:50.868 --> 05:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
because the medical the medical model
 
05:41:52.590 --> 05:41:52.600 align:start position:0%
and the educational model are not in
 
05:41:55.670 --> 05:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
sync they were in sync when the um
 
05:41:57.830 --> 05:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
education for all handicap child Act was
 
05:42:00.350 --> 05:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
passed in 1975 but they've diverged in
 
05:42:04.150 --> 05:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
recent years so um they're operating
 
05:42:05.750 --> 05:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
under two separate systems with two
 
05:42:12.990 --> 05:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:15.590 --> 05:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
um so one of the issues that has come up
 
05:42:17.910 --> 05:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
with parents that's very critical is
 
05:42:19.548 --> 05:42:19.558 align:start position:0%
that if they go to their primary care
 
05:42:20.990 --> 05:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
physician and they say I'd like to take
 
05:42:23.670 --> 05:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
my child to do o outside speech and
 
05:42:26.708 --> 05:42:26.718 align:start position:0%
language and the physician writes a
 
05:42:29.830 --> 05:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
referral for two times a week
 
05:42:32.628 --> 05:42:32.638 align:start position:0%
speech and language and the school has
 
05:42:36.030 --> 05:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
said one time a week 15 minutes you now
 
05:42:39.230 --> 05:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
have two competing opinions on what the
 
05:42:42.350 --> 05:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
child needs because the insurance does
 
05:42:45.628 --> 05:42:45.638 align:start position:0%
not recognize educational versus
 
05:42:48.070 --> 05:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
medical so if I went to my private
 
05:42:49.788 --> 05:42:49.798 align:start position:0%
insurance and I said I'd like for my son
 
05:42:52.270 --> 05:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
to get these services in school they
 
05:42:53.830 --> 05:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
would say to me well the school is
 
05:42:55.350 --> 05:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
required to provide those so you have to
 
05:42:57.390 --> 05:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
go to the school but Medicaid doesn't
 
05:43:00.230 --> 05:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily do that because there's a a
 
05:43:01.750 --> 05:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
a blurring of the lines there because
 
05:43:03.510 --> 05:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
some kids are getting services in school
 
05:43:06.390 --> 05:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
and some are not so some of the parents
 
05:43:08.270 --> 05:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
have been complaining because now we
 
05:43:09.910 --> 05:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
have two competing opinions where the
 
05:43:11.270 --> 05:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
school person is saying this kid only
 
05:43:13.510 --> 05:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
needs 15 minutes once a week and the
 
05:43:18.310 --> 05:43:18.320 align:start position:0%
physician is saying two times 45 a week
 
05:43:20.548 --> 05:43:20.558 align:start position:0%
so it's been creating some turbulence
 
05:43:23.110 --> 05:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
because the parents are saying my my
 
05:43:24.868 --> 05:43:24.878 align:start position:0%
outside services are being pulled or
 
05:43:27.868 --> 05:43:27.878 align:start position:0%
limited or changed because I have two
 
05:43:30.468 --> 05:43:30.478 align:start position:0%
competing opinions or because they're
 
05:43:31.708 --> 05:43:31.718 align:start position:0%
getting this service and they want to
 
05:43:34.150 --> 05:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
cut it down on the outside or however
 
05:43:35.868 --> 05:43:35.878 align:start position:0%
it's happening for them they're finding
 
05:43:37.150 --> 05:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
that they're not getting the services
 
05:43:38.868 --> 05:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
that their kid needs because medical
 
05:43:40.590 --> 05:43:40.600 align:start position:0%
model and education model are completely
 
05:43:40.600 --> 05:43:41.948 align:start position:0%
model and education model are completely
different

05:43:41.948 --> 05:43:41.958 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:43:44.670 --> 05:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
entities so with those
 
05:43:47.350 --> 05:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
competing you know with that competing
 
05:43:48.670 --> 05:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
situation it's putting the parent in the
 
05:43:50.670 --> 05:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
middle which isn't fair either I mean if
 
05:43:52.430 --> 05:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
there was one thing I would like to see
 
05:43:55.430 --> 05:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
happen theoretically it's that an EOB be
 
05:43:56.948 --> 05:43:56.958 align:start position:0%
given to the parent for the Medicaid to
 
05:43:58.430 --> 05:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
school services so they can actually
 
05:44:00.030 --> 05:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
track the Serv their kid is receiving
 
05:44:01.990 --> 05:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
and make sure the kid is getting you
 
05:44:04.310 --> 05:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
know all the outside and all the inside
 
05:44:07.628 --> 05:44:07.638 align:start position:0%
for in the school um I'd also like to
 
05:44:09.030 --> 05:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
point out too that schools don't have
 
05:44:10.868 --> 05:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
the obligation to follow Hippa it's not
 
05:44:13.310 --> 05:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
the same as a medical um and what has
 
05:44:15.350 --> 05:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
been happening in schools is yes you're
 
05:44:17.788 --> 05:44:17.798 align:start position:0%
correct Representative cascaden no one
 
05:44:19.548 --> 05:44:19.558 align:start position:0%
knows who has Medicaid so what the
 
05:44:21.030 --> 05:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
schools have been doing is they've been
 
05:44:23.510 --> 05:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
handing out the form to everyone and if
 
05:44:25.070 --> 05:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
the parent signs it then they'll bill
 
05:44:26.390 --> 05:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
and if the parent doesn't sign it then
 
05:44:27.910 --> 05:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
they won't bill or they might try and
 
05:44:30.150 --> 05:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
Bill you know without the consent but
 
05:44:31.910 --> 05:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
they're not asking they're just giving
 
05:44:33.670 --> 05:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
everyone the form and if it comes back
 
05:44:38.628 --> 05:44:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:41.510 --> 05:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
um in the emergency situation that you
 
05:44:44.110 --> 05:44:44.120 align:start position:0%
had mentioned representative lakus there
 
05:44:46.030 --> 05:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
are separate laws that cover emergency
 
05:44:48.390 --> 05:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
situations because the the government
 
05:44:50.390 --> 05:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
recognizes that we don't have time if
 
05:44:51.868 --> 05:44:51.878 align:start position:0%
somebody needs a defibrillator or
 
05:44:53.190 --> 05:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
something like that and the school has
 
05:44:54.430 --> 05:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
the right to act and they're protected
 
05:44:56.990 --> 05:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
under like a Good Samaritan style law
 
05:44:58.990 --> 05:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
especially because of the emergency of
 
05:45:01.708 --> 05:45:01.718 align:start position:0%
the situation um one of the programs
 
05:45:04.110 --> 05:45:04.120 align:start position:0%
where uh it's outside of an IEP would be
 
05:45:06.948 --> 05:45:06.958 align:start position:0%
like the renew program which is a mental
 
05:45:09.830 --> 05:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
health coping program so basically um
 
05:45:12.270 --> 05:45:12.280 align:start position:0%
with renew that is covered by Medicaid
 
05:45:14.510 --> 05:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
so essentially when the programs were
 
05:45:17.350 --> 05:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
being rolled out in schools um
 
05:45:18.990 --> 05:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
administrators would say to teachers
 
05:45:20.390 --> 05:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
please tell me who you would recommend
 
05:45:21.830 --> 05:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
for this program who would be a good fit
 
05:45:23.110 --> 05:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
for this program to learn coping
 
05:45:24.670 --> 05:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
mechanisms because they are having
 
05:45:26.868 --> 05:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
trouble or difficulty and they got back
 
05:45:28.708 --> 05:45:28.718 align:start position:0%
tons and tons of kids and they didn't
 
05:45:30.070 --> 05:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
know know which ones had Medicaid so
 
05:45:31.948 --> 05:45:31.958 align:start position:0%
they just sent everybody and they saw
 
05:45:33.670 --> 05:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
how it washed out but renew would be a
 
05:45:35.548 --> 05:45:35.558 align:start position:0%
program which is a mental health program
 
05:45:37.788 --> 05:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
which is outside of an IEP where they
 
05:45:40.390 --> 05:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
could theoretically have someone be
 
05:45:42.750 --> 05:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
retaining services for counseling or
 
05:45:48.548 --> 05:45:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:50.948 --> 05:45:50.958 align:start position:0%
um I do think it is very important for
 
05:45:52.750 --> 05:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
the parent to be informed because there
 
05:45:54.708 --> 05:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
was one case where a child had an
 
05:45:56.070 --> 05:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
allergy and they didn't know they had
 
05:45:57.708 --> 05:45:57.718 align:start position:0%
the allergy I don't know if the parent
 
05:45:58.990 --> 05:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
had discussed it with them or what
 
05:46:01.150 --> 05:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
happened but they were given something
 
05:46:02.670 --> 05:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
they were allergic to and they had a Ser
 
05:46:04.510 --> 05:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
serious allergic reaction and the kid
 
05:46:06.230 --> 05:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
ended up being fine everything ended up
 
05:46:08.468 --> 05:46:08.478 align:start position:0%
being fine and there was no problem but
 
05:46:10.030 --> 05:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
the child wasn't aware they had the
 
05:46:12.750 --> 05:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
allergy and I know my own son he tells
 
05:46:13.990 --> 05:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
everybody he has no allergies he's
 
05:46:15.468 --> 05:46:15.478 align:start position:0%
allergic to wool and nickel and all
 
05:46:16.948 --> 05:46:16.958 align:start position:0%
kinds of stuff he's just not allergic to
 
05:46:18.510 --> 05:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
any prescription
 
05:46:18.520 --> 05:46:20.430 align:start position:0%
any prescription
drugs

05:46:20.430 --> 05:46:20.440 align:start position:0%
drugs
 
05:46:23.310 --> 05:46:23.320 align:start position:0%
um another key component of the parental
 
05:46:24.670 --> 05:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
consent if you've ever taken the
 
05:46:25.910 --> 05:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
volunteer Advocate training through the
 
05:46:28.230 --> 05:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
parent information center they do say to
 
05:46:29.910 --> 05:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
work with the School District to sign
 
05:46:32.788 --> 05:46:32.798 align:start position:0%
off with the billing but to make sure
 
05:46:34.430 --> 05:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
that the services are correct and
 
05:46:37.070 --> 05:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
accurate and they also advise you to um
 
05:46:39.190 --> 05:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
it's a way for the parent and the the
 
05:46:41.830 --> 05:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
IEP team to work together in tandem as
 
05:46:44.750 --> 05:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to sort
 
05:46:44.760 --> 05:46:46.270 align:start position:0%
opposed to sort
of

05:46:46.270 --> 05:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:46:46.280 --> 05:46:51.230 align:start position:0%
of
negatively

05:46:51.230 --> 05:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:53.750 --> 05:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
um I also just wanted to mention too
 
05:46:55.230 --> 05:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
that you had put in here for some
 
05:46:56.788 --> 05:46:56.798 align:start position:0%
reports and I think that's a good thing
 
05:47:00.670 --> 05:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
because um in my particular town the
 
05:47:02.110 --> 05:47:02.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to school's money goes to the
 
05:47:03.510 --> 05:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
town and then it gets transferred to the
 
05:47:04.708 --> 05:47:04.718 align:start position:0%
school and it's not addressed in the
 
05:47:06.110 --> 05:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
budget so I think it would be good for
 
05:47:08.190 --> 05:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
this committee and everyone else to know
 
05:47:09.628 --> 05:47:09.638 align:start position:0%
how much is being spent on Medicaid to
 
05:47:11.868 --> 05:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
schools how to improve it and how to
 
05:47:12.910 --> 05:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
make sure kids are getting their
 
05:47:15.110 --> 05:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
services so with that I would like to
 
05:47:18.350 --> 05:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
support this bill I'm happy to take any
 
05:47:21.750 --> 05:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
questions questions from the
 
05:47:24.030 --> 05:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
committee several years back oh
 
05:47:26.750 --> 05:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
represent B Bon thank you Mr chair and
 
05:47:28.310 --> 05:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'm
 
05:47:31.548 --> 05:47:31.558 align:start position:0%
still confused I apologize for this um
 
05:47:34.830 --> 05:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
it's not easy if your child is um
 
05:47:38.190 --> 05:47:38.200 align:start position:0%
recommended for services and you get the
 
05:47:40.350 --> 05:47:40.360 align:start position:0%
IP and you sign off and you know exactly
 
05:47:43.270 --> 05:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
what services your child is getting
 
05:47:46.590 --> 05:47:46.600 align:start position:0%
correct theoretically yes okay if
 
05:47:49.110 --> 05:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
anything changes with the services
 
05:47:51.510 --> 05:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
they're required to reconvene and you're
 
05:47:53.230 --> 05:47:53.240 align:start position:0%
require and they can't do anything
 
05:47:55.670 --> 05:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
unless you sign up
 
05:47:55.680 --> 05:47:57.628 align:start position:0%
unless you sign up
again

05:47:57.628 --> 05:47:57.638 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:47:59.868 --> 05:47:59.878 align:start position:0%
well theoretically that would be
 
05:48:01.670 --> 05:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
accurate but in practice that's not how
 
05:48:01.680 --> 05:48:02.390 align:start position:0%
accurate but in practice that's not how
it

05:48:02.390 --> 05:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:48:05.270 --> 05:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
works okay um and the second part of
 
05:48:08.670 --> 05:48:08.680 align:start position:0%
that would be the billing aspect it this
 
05:48:11.270 --> 05:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
this whole thing seems to imply that
 
05:48:13.110 --> 05:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
schools are
 
05:48:15.830 --> 05:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
abusing um Medicaid
 
05:48:18.468 --> 05:48:18.478 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and so my question would
 
05:48:21.910 --> 05:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
be if you're signing off that your child
 
05:48:24.830 --> 05:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
is getting that service um and then if
 
05:48:27.150 --> 05:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
you have Medicaid and we've talked about
 
05:48:29.430 --> 05:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
we the the the service providers don't
 
05:48:31.270 --> 05:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily know that and you're
 
05:48:34.708 --> 05:48:34.718 align:start position:0%
checking the Box um I guess I don't
 
05:48:35.948 --> 05:48:35.958 align:start position:0%
understand why why that would be a
 
05:48:38.310 --> 05:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
problem they just be um applying for
 
05:48:40.468 --> 05:48:40.478 align:start position:0%
Medicaid reimbursement for services that
 
05:48:44.270 --> 05:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
are um being
 
05:48:47.190 --> 05:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
received okay so you're asking me why I
 
05:48:48.708 --> 05:48:48.718 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know if Services were being
 
05:48:50.310 --> 05:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
built for I'm sorry I'm not sure what
 
05:48:52.030 --> 05:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
your question is I guess the question is
 
05:48:53.510 --> 05:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
we I don't understand where the
 
05:48:56.628 --> 05:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
disconnect is unless there seems to be
 
05:48:58.590 --> 05:48:58.600 align:start position:0%
an implication that the schools aren't
 
05:49:01.390 --> 05:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
following the policies I don't think
 
05:49:02.830 --> 05:49:02.840 align:start position:0%
that's the implication I actually think
 
05:49:03.948 --> 05:49:03.958 align:start position:0%
that they're not familiar with the
 
05:49:05.868 --> 05:49:05.878 align:start position:0%
medical model and I think that that's
 
05:49:08.590 --> 05:49:08.600 align:start position:0%
created some issues um I think it need I
 
05:49:10.070 --> 05:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
think they need some help I mean I don't
 
05:49:12.430 --> 05:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
know if uh I was here in 2019 giving
 
05:49:14.230 --> 05:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
testimony before this particular
 
05:49:16.590 --> 05:49:16.600 align:start position:0%
committee on
 
05:49:20.070 --> 05:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
um when Medicaid to schools required
 
05:49:21.788 --> 05:49:21.798 align:start position:0%
that people in schools have medical
 
05:49:24.510 --> 05:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
licenses so they issued medical licenses
 
05:49:27.788 --> 05:49:27.798 align:start position:0%
um and that sort of was a new component
 
05:49:29.708 --> 05:49:29.718 align:start position:0%
and you know that's something where now
 
05:49:31.030 --> 05:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
we're trying to function within the
 
05:49:32.750 --> 05:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
educational model and the medical model
 
05:49:35.230 --> 05:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
and they're really not the same thing so
 
05:49:36.948 --> 05:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
I do think that there's some differences
 
05:49:38.750 --> 05:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
that need to be worked out there I would
 
05:49:40.070 --> 05:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
agree with
 
05:49:42.030 --> 05:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
05:49:44.990 --> 05:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
you I was going to ask you um you have a
 
05:49:46.948 --> 05:49:46.958 align:start position:0%
youngster that's ages three to five not
 
05:49:48.788 --> 05:49:48.798 align:start position:0%
yet in school but also receiving
 
05:49:52.350 --> 05:49:52.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid support uh via working with
 
05:49:55.310 --> 05:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
HHS um and has certain services in the
 
05:49:57.190 --> 05:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
home maybe whe wheelchair or other
 
05:50:01.628 --> 05:50:01.638 align:start position:0%
equipment M um now the child is uh in
 
05:50:05.350 --> 05:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
kindergarten in the school system do the
 
05:50:07.110 --> 05:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
providers that are going to be providing
 
05:50:09.270 --> 05:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
that support maybe it's uh a physical
 
05:50:12.750 --> 05:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
therapist or or or such or a nurse do
 
05:50:15.910 --> 05:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
they have to uh re apply for these
 
05:50:18.350 --> 05:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
services or is the service that they got
 
05:50:20.708 --> 05:50:20.718 align:start position:0%
through Age 3 through five directly
 
05:50:20.718 --> 05:50:22.110 align:start position:0%
through Age 3 through five directly
through

05:50:22.110 --> 05:50:22.120 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:50:24.708 --> 05:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
HHS we have had this discussion before
 
05:50:26.510 --> 05:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
and even if the if the equipment would
 
05:50:28.190 --> 05:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
even be available if it's already you
 
05:50:28.200 --> 05:50:29.070 align:start position:0%
even be available if it's already you
know

05:50:29.070 --> 05:50:29.080 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:50:33.750 --> 05:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
247 to the parent uh then is there is
 
05:50:35.110 --> 05:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
the school eligible to get those
 
05:50:36.910 --> 05:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
services I don't even know where that is
 
05:50:40.230 --> 05:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
anymore uh so I guess I'm asking of the
 
05:50:42.708 --> 05:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
first question do they have to reapply
 
05:50:45.230 --> 05:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
to as a provider of that service that
 
05:50:49.468 --> 05:50:49.478 align:start position:0%
physical therapist uh or or nurse again
 
05:50:51.430 --> 05:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
if it's already been done in ages three
 
05:50:53.788 --> 05:50:53.798 align:start position:0%
through five directly with HHS right
 
05:50:55.030 --> 05:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
okay so the short answer to your
 
05:50:57.270 --> 05:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
question is yes and part of the reason
 
05:50:58.670 --> 05:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
is because it's coming from different
 
05:51:01.510 --> 05:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
pots of money so Services three and four
 
05:51:03.990 --> 05:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
come from early intervention and at five
 
05:51:06.708 --> 05:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
it transitions over to the programs that
 
05:51:08.830 --> 05:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
support leap kindergarten and K through
 
05:51:13.190 --> 05:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
12 thank you further questions thank you
 
05:51:15.390 --> 05:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
very much thank you I hope I answered
 
05:51:15.400 --> 05:51:17.910 align:start position:0%
very much thank you I hope I answered
your

05:51:17.910 --> 05:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:27.350 --> 05:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:27.360 --> 05:51:31.430 align:start position:0%
 
Kristen

05:51:31.430 --> 05:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:32.910 --> 05:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Kristen
 
05:51:35.628 --> 05:51:35.638 align:start position:0%
monani uh advocate for special education
 
05:51:37.750 --> 05:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
here in New
 
05:51:40.910 --> 05:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I want to address some
 
05:51:42.230 --> 05:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
questions that I think I've heard from
 
05:51:45.150 --> 05:51:45.160 align:start position:0%
everyone about whether there really is
 
05:51:47.230 --> 05:51:47.240 align:start position:0%
an issue of parental consent especially
 
05:51:48.830 --> 05:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
for those children on
 
05:51:53.750 --> 05:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
IEPs um and and by way of background one
 
05:51:55.590 --> 05:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
of the things I'm concerned about with
 
05:51:58.910 --> 05:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
my agency and as we um staff will
 
05:52:00.708 --> 05:52:00.718 align:start position:0%
definitely be looking into ways to get
 
05:52:04.510 --> 05:52:04.520 align:start position:0%
at this but there are a number of IEPs
 
05:52:07.310 --> 05:52:07.320 align:start position:0%
um that really are operating with sort
 
05:52:09.670 --> 05:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
of implied consent because there is a
 
05:52:12.150 --> 05:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
provision that if parents do not either
 
05:52:17.110 --> 05:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
explicitly consent or explicitly object
 
05:52:21.110 --> 05:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
and and refuse to give consent after 14
 
05:52:23.910 --> 05:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
days the IEP and the services go into
 
05:52:27.230 --> 05:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
place if the Lea has made reasonable
 
05:52:29.468 --> 05:52:29.478 align:start position:0%
attempts to obtain consent but that
 
05:52:32.030 --> 05:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable is not defined it's a matter
 
05:52:32.040 --> 05:52:32.708 align:start position:0%
reasonable is not defined it's a matter
of

05:52:32.708 --> 05:52:32.718 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:52:35.230 --> 05:52:35.240 align:start position:0%
discretion I would tell you it probably
 
05:52:37.990 --> 05:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
there are probably a startling number of
 
05:52:41.510 --> 05:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
implied consent IEPs in place right now
 
05:52:46.830 --> 05:52:46.840 align:start position:0%
um it's something again we have a have a
 
05:52:50.150 --> 05:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
information system that um may not give
 
05:52:52.230 --> 05:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
us all the information we need on
 
05:52:53.990 --> 05:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
special education and IEPs there are a
 
05:52:56.070 --> 05:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
lot of concerns about how it operates
 
05:52:58.830 --> 05:52:58.840 align:start position:0%
but one of my um big priorities for the
 
05:53:00.230 --> 05:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
office would be to get to that question
 
05:53:01.830 --> 05:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
of how many IEPs are out there with
 
05:53:04.310 --> 05:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
implied consent as opposed to an actual
 
05:53:06.350 --> 05:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
parental consent written so there are
 
05:53:09.230 --> 05:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
probably a large number of instances
 
05:53:10.990 --> 05:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
where you don't actually have signed
 
05:53:14.070 --> 05:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
parental consent um for the services in
 
05:53:17.030 --> 05:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
place this cannot happen the very first
 
05:53:18.990 --> 05:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
time a child is referred right so if a
 
05:53:22.190 --> 05:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
child is referred very young in order to
 
05:53:24.390 --> 05:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
begin an IEP and begin to give Services
 
05:53:26.230 --> 05:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
you you you don't have any provision for
 
05:53:27.830 --> 05:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
implied consent but for a lot of
 
05:53:30.628 --> 05:53:30.638 align:start position:0%
children these IEPs go on for years so
 
05:53:33.548 --> 05:53:33.558 align:start position:0%
after the first one being put in place
 
05:53:36.750 --> 05:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
yes there are in absolutely kind of
 
05:53:39.590 --> 05:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
implied consent Services being
 
05:53:42.750 --> 05:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
provided and I would worry in terms of
 
05:53:44.708 --> 05:53:44.718 align:start position:0%
whether parents really know exactly what
 
05:53:47.270 --> 05:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
those services are who those providers
 
05:53:50.030 --> 05:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
are whether those providers necessarily
 
05:53:51.670 --> 05:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
conflict with something else or some
 
05:53:53.750 --> 05:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
other advice they're getting from a
 
05:53:57.070 --> 05:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
pediatrician um if it's happening via
 
05:53:58.910 --> 05:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
implied consent I could see even the
 
05:54:00.948 --> 05:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
most well-meaning of school districts
 
05:54:04.548 --> 05:54:04.558 align:start position:0%
saying okay we have this disability
 
05:54:06.468 --> 05:54:06.478 align:start position:0%
determination or
 
05:54:10.270 --> 05:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
identification we have these goals for
 
05:54:10.280 --> 05:54:11.430 align:start position:0%
identification we have these goals for
this

05:54:11.430 --> 05:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:54:13.830 --> 05:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
child there are times when the district
 
05:54:15.990 --> 05:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
is modifying exactly how those goals are
 
05:54:18.030 --> 05:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
met and and some of those modifications
 
05:54:20.750 --> 05:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
are absolutely sometimes in who the
 
05:54:23.670 --> 05:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
service providers are who are delivered
 
05:54:25.270 --> 05:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
to that child is it an occupational
 
05:54:26.948 --> 05:54:26.958 align:start position:0%
therapist is it a speech therapist is it
 
05:54:30.190 --> 05:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
a um school counselor for psychological
 
05:54:33.190 --> 05:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
counseling is it the special education
 
05:54:36.590 --> 05:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
teacher and so there would be a whole
 
05:54:37.910 --> 05:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
range of situations where I could
 
05:54:40.350 --> 05:54:40.360 align:start position:0%
imagine that parents would not be aware
 
05:54:43.190 --> 05:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
of services determined to be Medical in
 
05:54:45.868 --> 05:54:45.878 align:start position:0%
nature and billable under Medicaid that
 
05:54:47.750 --> 05:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
were being delivered in the
 
05:54:51.070 --> 05:54:51.080 align:start position:0%
IEP so this is just another tool again
 
05:54:52.430 --> 05:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that partnership
 
05:54:55.590 --> 05:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
between district and parent is strong
 
05:54:57.150 --> 05:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
and that there are opportunities to
 
05:54:59.430 --> 05:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
discuss because it's another incentive
 
05:55:01.110 --> 05:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
for school districts to say look okay we
 
05:55:04.070 --> 05:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
didn't manage to get the consent we do
 
05:55:05.830 --> 05:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
want to Bill these services to Medicaid
 
05:55:07.910 --> 05:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
I'm all for the schools getting all of
 
05:55:09.350 --> 05:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement money they're entitled
 
05:55:11.990 --> 05:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
to for providing Services we need to
 
05:55:14.830 --> 05:55:14.840 align:start position:0%
make another effort to make sure to go
 
05:55:16.670 --> 05:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
back and say to the parent what is it
 
05:55:18.670 --> 05:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
about you know you did you neither
 
05:55:20.390 --> 05:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
refused nor
 
05:55:23.190 --> 05:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
consented we're going to try again
 
05:55:25.430 --> 05:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
because we have Services we would like
 
05:55:25.440 --> 05:55:26.270 align:start position:0%
because we have Services we would like
to

05:55:26.270 --> 05:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:55:28.670 --> 05:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
build let's figure out where the issue
 
05:55:30.430 --> 05:55:30.440 align:start position:0%
is um for a lot of the parents that I
 
05:55:33.548 --> 05:55:33.558 align:start position:0%
work with when they're not happy with
 
05:55:35.150 --> 05:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
the IEP and hold or they don't
 
05:55:37.030 --> 05:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
understand it they just don't act which
 
05:55:38.548 --> 05:55:38.558 align:start position:0%
is not the most irrational thing for a
 
05:55:40.750 --> 05:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
lot of us we assume if I don't sign
 
05:55:43.350 --> 05:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
something one way or another then it it
 
05:55:45.990 --> 05:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
can't go forward without it's just not
 
05:55:47.868 --> 05:55:47.878 align:start position:0%
necessarily true so they might be acting
 
05:55:52.230 --> 05:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
in a way that is rational thinking okay
 
05:55:53.788 --> 05:55:53.798 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to give
 
05:55:55.868 --> 05:55:55.878 align:start position:0%
consent but there is a default
 
05:55:57.670 --> 05:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
background operation where services to
 
05:55:59.430 --> 05:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
their going to be provided and could be
 
05:56:02.070 --> 05:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
changed and and service providers could
 
05:56:04.230 --> 05:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
be changed within the school so that
 
05:56:05.910 --> 05:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
would be a situation that this bill
 
05:56:05.920 --> 05:56:07.390 align:start position:0%
would be a situation that this bill
would

05:56:07.390 --> 05:56:07.400 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:56:09.628 --> 05:56:09.638 align:start position:0%
address thank you very much are there
 
05:56:11.548 --> 05:56:11.558 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
05:56:15.110 --> 05:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:18.390 --> 05:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
Damon could you please clarify for
 
05:56:22.628 --> 05:56:22.638 align:start position:0%
me from your remarks just now I don't
 
05:56:25.670 --> 05:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
understand how Occupational Therapy
 
05:56:28.510 --> 05:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
Services would be provided by
 
05:56:30.788 --> 05:56:30.798 align:start position:0%
some other professional who's not an
 
05:56:32.750 --> 05:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
occupational therapist or similar
 
05:56:35.548 --> 05:56:35.558 align:start position:0%
examples of what you just said that's
 
05:56:38.430 --> 05:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
against licensing standards and they're
 
05:56:41.350 --> 05:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
not trained to do
 
05:56:43.590 --> 05:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
that I would think it would
 
05:56:47.230 --> 05:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
be more often for example um a question
 
05:56:47.240 --> 05:56:48.030 align:start position:0%
be more often for example um a question
of

05:56:48.030 --> 05:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:56:51.510 --> 05:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
whether let's call it
 
05:56:54.390 --> 05:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
um communication you know social
 
05:56:57.070 --> 05:56:57.080 align:start position:0%
communication services for some sort of
 
05:57:00.150 --> 05:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
communication order were provided
 
05:57:04.430 --> 05:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
initially Maybe by um the school
 
05:57:07.468 --> 05:57:07.478 align:start position:0%
counselor in a group session and then
 
05:57:09.190 --> 05:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
transfer it over to a speech language
 
05:57:10.868 --> 05:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
pathologist you know that speech
 
05:57:13.628 --> 05:57:13.638 align:start position:0%
language pathologist might be a Medicaid
 
05:57:15.070 --> 05:57:15.080 align:start position:0%
billing situation maybe the school
 
05:57:16.868 --> 05:57:16.878 align:start position:0%
counselor is not with occupational
 
05:57:18.150 --> 05:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
therapy sometimes you're talking about
 
05:57:20.510 --> 05:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
fine motor skills and some of that might
 
05:57:22.390 --> 05:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
be addressed by a special ed teacher
 
05:57:25.270 --> 05:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
which then transferred over to say let's
 
05:57:28.670 --> 05:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
have an OT seeing this student um is
 
05:57:30.390 --> 05:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
that a good or a bad thing I mean you
 
05:57:32.670 --> 05:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
know often it would be a good thing to
 
05:57:35.030 --> 05:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
go to more specialized
 
05:57:37.868 --> 05:57:37.878 align:start position:0%
providers all that this is looking for
 
05:57:39.670 --> 05:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
as I read it is that we make sure
 
05:57:41.708 --> 05:57:41.718 align:start position:0%
parents really are informed of what's
 
05:57:43.948 --> 05:57:43.958 align:start position:0%
happening it it's a positive for parents
 
05:57:46.510 --> 05:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
even if they're then able to as Moira
 
05:57:49.110 --> 05:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
said provide that information to their
 
05:57:50.830 --> 05:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
child's physician because they
 
05:57:52.030 --> 05:57:52.040 align:start position:0%
understand they were asked for consent
 
05:57:53.910 --> 05:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
they know who the service providers are
 
05:57:56.708 --> 05:57:56.718 align:start position:0%
who are delivering services to their
 
05:57:56.718 --> 05:57:59.150 align:start position:0%
who are delivering services to their
child

05:57:59.150 --> 05:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
child
 
05:58:00.830 --> 05:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
further questions represent whitcock
 
05:58:04.270 --> 05:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman L very quick so in
 
05:58:07.468 --> 05:58:07.478 align:start position:0%
the in the the fail safe process uh
 
05:58:09.190 --> 05:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
which just explaining to uh
 
05:58:13.070 --> 05:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative uh Damon over here uh at
 
05:58:14.750 --> 05:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
the worst case would the the parents
 
05:58:17.270 --> 05:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
have already agreed that yes I want my
 
05:58:19.628 --> 05:58:19.638 align:start position:0%
child to have this service and they
 
05:58:20.990 --> 05:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
signed that off on the
 
05:58:23.590 --> 05:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
IP the US say provided say for someone
 
05:58:24.990 --> 05:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
in House at the council small setting
 
05:58:27.708 --> 05:58:27.718 align:start position:0%
for social social skills and then the
 
05:58:29.670 --> 05:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
School find someone who can do the same
 
05:58:31.670 --> 05:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
thing more qualified in Medicaid it's
 
05:58:34.190 --> 05:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
still the same service and they assign
 
05:58:38.350 --> 05:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
it to person x what it happens to be um
 
05:58:39.750 --> 05:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
so they haven't changed the service the
 
05:58:42.230 --> 05:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
parent still getting the service um as
 
05:58:44.750 --> 05:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
provided in the IP and minimally
 
05:58:46.110 --> 05:58:46.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they normally see that the
 
05:58:48.510 --> 05:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
annual review if there not going to be
 
05:58:49.990 --> 05:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
team meeting called because they really
 
05:58:52.110 --> 05:58:52.120 align:start position:0%
didn't change the service they they have
 
05:58:54.430 --> 05:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
circum just find a different provider
 
05:58:56.628 --> 05:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
but the at the anual wouldn't they see
 
05:58:58.468 --> 05:58:58.478 align:start position:0%
that that we elated the service we
 
05:59:00.030 --> 05:59:00.040 align:start position:0%
change the service or the service hasn't
 
05:59:02.190 --> 05:59:02.200 align:start position:0%
changed at
 
05:59:02.200 --> 05:59:04.430 align:start position:0%
changed at
all

05:59:04.430 --> 05:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
all
 
05:59:07.750 --> 05:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
so two things
 
05:59:10.030 --> 05:59:10.040 align:start position:0%
one the parent may or may not have
 
05:59:11.910 --> 05:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
agreed to the specific service right the
 
05:59:14.390 --> 05:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
parent may have said said somewhere at
 
05:59:15.868 --> 05:59:15.878 align:start position:0%
the outset of their child first getting
 
05:59:19.468 --> 05:59:19.478 align:start position:0%
an IEP yes you know I agree either with
 
05:59:21.670 --> 05:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
the school team's referral or I myself
 
05:59:23.590 --> 05:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
referred my child for a specific
 
05:59:23.600 --> 05:59:24.948 align:start position:0%
referred my child for a specific
disability

05:59:24.948 --> 05:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
disability
 
05:59:26.628 --> 05:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
identification and then a set of
 
05:59:28.590 --> 05:59:28.600 align:start position:0%
services maybe flowed from that the
 
05:59:28.600 --> 05:59:30.150 align:start position:0%
services maybe flowed from that the
first

05:59:30.150 --> 05:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
first
 
05:59:33.868 --> 05:59:33.878 align:start position:0%
time it is probably more common than not
 
05:59:36.468 --> 05:59:36.478 align:start position:0%
that over time the service delivery grid
 
05:59:37.510 --> 05:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
and the
 
05:59:40.708 --> 05:59:40.718 align:start position:0%
providers change as the child gets older
 
05:59:43.670 --> 05:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
as their behavior changes there is no
 
05:59:45.990 --> 05:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
requirement that a parent sign off if
 
05:59:48.070 --> 05:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
they had a disagreement going with the
 
05:59:49.430 --> 05:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
school team that we wouldn't really
 
05:59:51.670 --> 05:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily even know anything about it
 
05:59:53.190 --> 05:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
may or may not impact this kind of
 
05:59:56.548 --> 05:59:56.558 align:start position:0%
service provided if they simply did
 
05:59:56.558 --> 05:59:58.548 align:start position:0%
service provided if they simply did
nothing

05:59:58.548 --> 05:59:58.558 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
05:59:59.910 --> 05:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
the services that the Lea was
 
06:00:01.590 --> 06:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
recommending go into
 
06:00:04.310 --> 06:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
place so I think it's more than that
 
06:00:06.150 --> 06:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
type of situation where a parent could
 
06:00:08.628 --> 06:00:08.638 align:start position:0%
really not be aware now do they become
 
06:00:11.350 --> 06:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
aware at the annual
 
06:00:14.628 --> 06:00:14.638 align:start position:0%
meeting yes they should if they attend
 
06:00:18.150 --> 06:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
it and if the school team focuses the
 
06:00:20.310 --> 06:00:20.320 align:start position:0%
parent on the service delivery grid
 
06:00:22.270 --> 06:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
which is the only place that the
 
06:00:24.270 --> 06:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
provider is really specified anywhere in
 
06:00:26.990 --> 06:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
the IEP my experience is most IEP team
 
06:00:29.190 --> 06:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
meetings don't focus on that Service
 
06:00:30.910 --> 06:00:30.920 align:start position:0%
delivery grid they focus on much broader
 
06:00:32.310 --> 06:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
discussions about the goals for the
 
06:00:35.110 --> 06:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
child Etc so I think having an explicit
 
06:00:37.548 --> 06:00:37.558 align:start position:0%
consent requirement makes everyone more
 
06:00:39.310 --> 06:00:39.320 align:start position:0%
informed thank
 
06:00:41.548 --> 06:00:41.558 align:start position:0%
you just a question to you is it
 
06:00:44.708 --> 06:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
possible to get um some comment from doe
 
06:00:47.110 --> 06:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
special ed on there on this bill well I
 
06:00:48.990 --> 06:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
I absolutely think we need to uh I've
 
06:00:50.510 --> 06:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
got a
 
06:00:53.910 --> 06:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
question NH HHS for example if I have a
 
06:00:56.510 --> 06:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
speech therapist in the school and the
 
06:00:58.868 --> 06:00:58.878 align:start position:0%
IP says twice a week you will have these
 
06:01:00.270 --> 06:01:00.280 align:start position:0%
meetings with a
 
06:01:03.150 --> 06:01:03.160 align:start position:0%
youngster and so you're basically you're
 
06:01:05.230 --> 06:01:05.240 align:start position:0%
billing based upon billable hours and
 
06:01:08.310 --> 06:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
and you you you rack them up but the
 
06:01:10.708 --> 06:01:10.718 align:start position:0%
second time each week it's delivered
 
06:01:13.468 --> 06:01:13.478 align:start position:0%
through a par professional not the
 
06:01:16.990 --> 06:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
speech pathologist and this does occur
 
06:01:20.190 --> 06:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
is that service provided by the par
 
06:01:23.150 --> 06:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
professional under the supervision of
 
06:01:25.548 --> 06:01:25.558 align:start position:0%
the speech therapist who may not even be
 
06:01:28.150 --> 06:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
at the building at the time is that
 
06:01:30.708 --> 06:01:30.718 align:start position:0%
available hour to Medicaid so it's a
 
06:01:32.030 --> 06:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
question I don't know the answer to but
 
06:01:34.150 --> 06:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
it is a example of the type of thing I'm
 
06:01:35.670 --> 06:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
talking about that you may have Services
 
06:01:38.830 --> 06:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
provided by different professionals okay
 
06:01:40.230 --> 06:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
we've got an answer back there on that
 
06:01:40.240 --> 06:01:41.948 align:start position:0%
we've got an answer back there on that
one

06:01:41.948 --> 06:01:41.958 align:start position:0%
one
 
06:01:44.830 --> 06:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
maybe okay further
 
06:01:47.070 --> 06:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
discussion thank you very
 
06:01:50.548 --> 06:01:50.558 align:start position:0%
much I I I apologize sorry chairman lad
 
06:01:52.628 --> 06:01:52.638 align:start position:0%
could I address one other point sure um
 
06:01:55.030 --> 06:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
just to say I do support potentially
 
06:01:57.708 --> 06:01:57.718 align:start position:0%
looking again at at section N9 because
 
06:01:59.750 --> 06:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
the educator code of conduct is
 
06:02:01.430 --> 06:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
something that you know we're struggling
 
06:02:04.590 --> 06:02:04.600 align:start position:0%
to use in various specific situations it
 
06:02:06.948 --> 06:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't very well address as it's
 
06:02:09.750 --> 06:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
written this kind of behavior so
 
06:02:11.628 --> 06:02:11.638 align:start position:0%
Alternatives um are definitely something
 
06:02:14.070 --> 06:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
to look at in my
 
06:02:16.590 --> 06:02:16.600 align:start position:0%
opinion do you have any ideas for
 
06:02:19.070 --> 06:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
us not yet I can think about them think
 
06:02:21.830 --> 06:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
of them thanks please okay I'd like to
 
06:02:26.350 --> 06:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:26.360 --> 06:02:32.788 align:start position:0%
 
Wilson

06:02:32.788 --> 06:02:32.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:35.030 --> 06:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
welcome uh thank you chairman lad member
 
06:02:37.190 --> 06:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
of the committee um Becky Wilson
 
06:02:38.708 --> 06:02:38.718 align:start position:0%
director of governmental relations for
 
06:02:39.990 --> 06:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire school boards
 
06:02:41.910 --> 06:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
Association uh we're not taking a
 
06:02:44.110 --> 06:02:44.120 align:start position:0%
position on this bill I just wanted to
 
06:02:46.830 --> 06:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
clarify a few things and maybe put some
 
06:02:49.310 --> 06:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
questions out myself based on what I've
 
06:02:50.390 --> 06:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
heard from other people who have
 
06:02:53.788 --> 06:02:53.798 align:start position:0%
testified on this bill um I just it's
 
06:02:56.708 --> 06:02:56.718 align:start position:0%
important to recognize at least for my
 
06:02:58.590 --> 06:02:58.600 align:start position:0%
perception of listening to the testimony
 
06:03:00.310 --> 06:03:00.320 align:start position:0%
there's two different conversations
 
06:03:03.468 --> 06:03:03.478 align:start position:0%
happening one seems like a conversation
 
06:03:04.868 --> 06:03:04.878 align:start position:0%
that this bill is trying to address
 
06:03:07.948 --> 06:03:07.958 align:start position:0%
about billing for Medicaid to schools
 
06:03:10.990 --> 06:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
the second seems to be about teams
 
06:03:12.708 --> 06:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
disagreeing when they get to the service
 
06:03:15.150 --> 06:03:15.160 align:start position:0%
delivery page of the IEP on Services a
 
06:03:16.990 --> 06:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
child might need that are educationally
 
06:03:19.350 --> 06:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
required or based versus medically
 
06:03:22.230 --> 06:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
required those are in my opinion two
 
06:03:22.240 --> 06:03:23.390 align:start position:0%
required those are in my opinion two
totally

06:03:23.390 --> 06:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
totally
 
06:03:23.400 --> 06:03:25.190 align:start position:0%
totally
separate

06:03:25.190 --> 06:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
separate
 
06:03:27.830 --> 06:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
conversations Medicaid to school schols
 
06:03:29.548 --> 06:03:29.558 align:start position:0%
the consent that parents sign for
 
06:03:32.430 --> 06:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to schools only allows the
 
06:03:34.468 --> 06:03:34.478 align:start position:0%
district to release personally
 
06:03:36.750 --> 06:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
identifying information to a billing
 
06:03:39.150 --> 06:03:39.160 align:start position:0%
company to bill for services that might
 
06:03:41.788 --> 06:03:41.798 align:start position:0%
be medically necessary in
 
06:03:44.868 --> 06:03:44.878 align:start position:0%
school there's no one on the IEP team
 
06:03:46.948 --> 06:03:46.958 align:start position:0%
specifically typically is doing that
 
06:03:49.830 --> 06:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
billing directly it goes to a whoever
 
06:03:51.510 --> 06:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
the district is Contracting with to do
 
06:03:53.830 --> 06:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
their Medicaid to school's billing so
 
06:03:55.788 --> 06:03:55.798 align:start position:0%
that they can release the fact that that
 
06:03:58.150 --> 06:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
child is getting services and the third
 
06:04:01.430 --> 06:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
party can decide and look and see if the
 
06:04:03.548 --> 06:04:03.558 align:start position:0%
child is eligible for Medicaid and if
 
06:04:05.390 --> 06:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
the parent has provided consent for all
 
06:04:07.310 --> 06:04:07.320 align:start position:0%
of those things to happen the school
 
06:04:09.788 --> 06:04:09.798 align:start position:0%
district can put in for some services
 
06:04:11.590 --> 06:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
and recoup a small amount of those
 
06:04:13.628 --> 06:04:13.638 align:start position:0%
Services back to the school district
 
06:04:15.310 --> 06:04:15.320 align:start position:0%
that money comes in at the end of the
 
06:04:17.030 --> 06:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
school year it's retroactive
 
06:04:19.310 --> 06:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
reimbursement it's not provided upfront
 
06:04:20.910 --> 06:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
so it has nothing to do with whether or
 
06:04:22.230 --> 06:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
not kids are actually getting the
 
06:04:25.150 --> 06:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
services on their IEP page it's Revenue
 
06:04:26.590 --> 06:04:26.600 align:start position:0%
that comes back to the school district
 
06:04:30.030 --> 06:04:30.040 align:start position:0%
in a check that then towns and districts
 
06:04:31.868 --> 06:04:31.878 align:start position:0%
can decide how they use their revenues
 
06:04:33.510 --> 06:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
whether they put it in unexpended fund
 
06:04:35.468 --> 06:04:35.478 align:start position:0%
balance or carry it over or whether it
 
06:04:38.350 --> 06:04:38.360 align:start position:0%
goes to offset the tax rate that is the
 
06:04:41.468 --> 06:04:41.478 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to schools piece of it in order
 
06:04:43.788 --> 06:04:43.798 align:start position:0%
to bill for Medicaid to schools you need
 
06:04:48.270 --> 06:04:48.280 align:start position:0%
to have a medical order a medical order
 
06:04:50.910 --> 06:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
can only come from certain practitioners
 
06:04:52.948 --> 06:04:52.958 align:start position:0%
an educator does not count as a person
 
06:04:54.750 --> 06:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
who can put in a medical order that
 
06:04:56.070 --> 06:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
comes from people like speech
 
06:04:59.390 --> 06:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
pathologists OTS potentially
 
06:04:59.400 --> 06:05:00.830 align:start position:0%
pathologists OTS potentially
developmental

06:05:00.830 --> 06:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
developmental
 
06:05:04.110 --> 06:05:04.120 align:start position:0%
pediatricians other medically based PT
 
06:05:07.350 --> 06:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
ex I go Audiology all of those
 
06:05:10.350 --> 06:05:10.360 align:start position:0%
pieces that person that is looking at
 
06:05:13.110 --> 06:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
the service page of the IEP is deciding
 
06:05:15.468 --> 06:05:15.478 align:start position:0%
to quote unquote order those Services
 
06:05:17.468 --> 06:05:17.478 align:start position:0%
because they are saying that those
 
06:05:20.750 --> 06:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
medically Based Services are required
 
06:05:22.468 --> 06:05:22.478 align:start position:0%
for the child to be able to access their
 
06:05:22.478 --> 06:05:23.788 align:start position:0%
for the child to be able to access their
educational

06:05:23.788 --> 06:05:23.798 align:start position:0%
educational
 
06:05:25.788 --> 06:05:25.798 align:start position:0%
environment that's why you can bill for
 
06:05:28.350 --> 06:05:28.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to schools it has nothing to do
 
06:05:29.788 --> 06:05:29.798 align:start position:0%
with the child's personal Medicaid
 
06:05:31.670 --> 06:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
benefit or anything like that and the
 
06:05:33.468 --> 06:05:33.478 align:start position:0%
consent that the parent is signing they
 
06:05:35.990 --> 06:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
sign they can sign it every single year
 
06:05:38.110 --> 06:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
it can be withdrawn at any time it's
 
06:05:40.708 --> 06:05:40.718 align:start position:0%
just to release information to allow
 
06:05:42.270 --> 06:05:42.280 align:start position:0%
somebody else because I think it was
 
06:05:44.628 --> 06:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
said earlier District staff can't know
 
06:05:47.390 --> 06:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
who's Medicaid or not Medicaid to allow
 
06:05:48.910 --> 06:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
them to release the information so that
 
06:05:50.708 --> 06:05:50.718 align:start position:0%
the billing can decide if they qualify
 
06:05:52.030 --> 06:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid to schools and the school
 
06:05:55.230 --> 06:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
district can recoup some money the other
 
06:05:57.190 --> 06:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
situation that it seems like is being t
 
06:05:58.590 --> 06:05:58.600 align:start position:0%
about a lot and I certainly don't want
 
06:06:02.150 --> 06:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
to minimize it is a disagreement when a
 
06:06:04.270 --> 06:06:04.280 align:start position:0%
team gets to the service delivery page
 
06:06:07.030 --> 06:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
of an IEP and is trying to decide what
 
06:06:08.948 --> 06:06:08.958 align:start position:0%
services are required for the child to
 
06:06:11.830 --> 06:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
make progress on their IEP goals there
 
06:06:14.190 --> 06:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
is sometimes a difference between
 
06:06:14.200 --> 06:06:15.868 align:start position:0%
is sometimes a difference between
educationally

06:06:15.868 --> 06:06:15.878 align:start position:0%
educationally
 
06:06:19.110 --> 06:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
necessary services that are allow that
 
06:06:20.628 --> 06:06:20.638 align:start position:0%
are required for the child to make
 
06:06:23.190 --> 06:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
reasonable progress on their IEP goals
 
06:06:25.110 --> 06:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
and access the gened environment versus
 
06:06:27.670 --> 06:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
what a child might need medically from a
 
06:06:30.948 --> 06:06:30.958 align:start position:0%
medical standpoint so there are times
 
06:06:34.390 --> 06:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
where teams don't agree on that um but
 
06:06:36.310 --> 06:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
that that is this in my opinion a
 
06:06:38.750 --> 06:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
separate issue from Medicaid to schools
 
06:06:40.510 --> 06:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
um as far as the implied consent I just
 
06:06:42.390 --> 06:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
want to clarify that is one of the
 
06:06:43.830 --> 06:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
standards we've talked about before that
 
06:06:45.910 --> 06:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a higher level of
 
06:06:47.548 --> 06:06:47.558 align:start position:0%
implied consent requirement than the
 
06:06:51.150 --> 06:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
federal idea so you can't just do
 
06:06:52.910 --> 06:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
something after 14 days if the parent
 
06:06:55.390 --> 06:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't respond you have to have
 
06:06:57.708 --> 06:06:57.718 align:start position:0%
documentation of t phone calls to the
 
06:07:00.110 --> 06:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
parents other attempts made you have to
 
06:07:03.150 --> 06:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
send information requesting consent or
 
06:07:05.670 --> 06:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
response from a parent regular mail and

certified mail before you can ever do
 
06:07:10.390 --> 06:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
something with implied consent and even
 
06:07:12.708 --> 06:07:12.718 align:start position:0%
then there is a small list of things
 
06:07:14.830 --> 06:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
that even if you don't get any response
 
06:07:17.910 --> 06:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
from the parent you can't do that's the

New Hampshire special ed statute for
 
06:07:22.990 --> 06:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
that so there while I'm not trying to
 
06:07:24.830 --> 06:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
Discount any experiences I think that
 
06:07:26.390 --> 06:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
probably these things are happening in
 
06:07:28.788 --> 06:07:28.798 align:start position:0%
some places and that is why you put into
 
06:07:30.110 --> 06:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
place the office of the specialed
 
06:07:31.830 --> 06:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
advocate so that they could help to
 
06:07:33.590 --> 06:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
manage some of those things but the
 
06:07:35.830 --> 06:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
implied consent is not just the nobody
 
06:07:37.510 --> 06:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
talks to the parents and then they get
 
06:07:38.868 --> 06:07:38.878 align:start position:0%
nothing back and everything moves
 
06:07:41.390 --> 06:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
forward I'm happy to try to answer any
 
06:07:44.468 --> 06:07:44.478 align:start position:0%
other questions questions rep Miler
 
06:07:46.628 --> 06:07:46.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd like to make a
 
06:07:49.070 --> 06:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
little point of order
 
06:07:52.150 --> 06:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
here this is like the fourth
 
06:07:55.628 --> 06:07:55.638 align:start position:0%
time M Wilson has been here to talk
 
06:07:58.070 --> 06:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
about special education
 
06:08:00.430 --> 06:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
she has a vast background in special
 
06:08:04.070 --> 06:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
education but that is not her role
 
06:08:06.948 --> 06:08:06.958 align:start position:0%
here her role is to represent the school
 
06:08:06.958 --> 06:08:08.510 align:start position:0%
here her role is to represent the school
boards

06:08:08.510 --> 06:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
boards
 
06:08:11.910 --> 06:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
Association Mr chair I'm concerned that
 
06:08:14.708 --> 06:08:14.718 align:start position:0%
there's a lack of attentiveness on the
 
06:08:16.350 --> 06:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
part of the Department of Education
 
06:08:19.270 --> 06:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
special education department they should
 
06:08:21.830 --> 06:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
be here answering these questions not
 
06:08:21.840 --> 06:08:22.830 align:start position:0%
be here answering these questions not

Miss
 
06:08:26.150 --> 06:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
Wilson and I I would I would ask the
 
06:08:26.160 --> 06:08:27.468 align:start position:0%
Wilson and I I would I would ask the
chair

06:08:27.468 --> 06:08:27.478 align:start position:0%
chair
 
06:08:29.510 --> 06:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
to talk with whomever you have to over
 
06:08:31.628 --> 06:08:31.638 align:start position:0%
in the department that when we're
 
06:08:33.270 --> 06:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
talking about special
 
06:08:35.788 --> 06:08:35.798 align:start position:0%
education that representative should be
 
06:08:39.230 --> 06:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
here not Mrs Wilson because that is not
 
06:08:42.110 --> 06:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
her role even though her clarifications
 
06:08:42.120 --> 06:08:44.270 align:start position:0%
her role even though her clarifications
are

06:08:44.270 --> 06:08:44.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:08:47.948 --> 06:08:47.958 align:start position:0%
perfect I have already talked to Becky
 
06:08:49.750 --> 06:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
Wilson's regarding this she's coming
 
06:08:51.590 --> 06:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
here as a school board member we've
 
06:08:54.628 --> 06:08:54.638 align:start position:0%
talked about that in fact just within
 
06:08:57.750 --> 06:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
the last several days and and she has
 
06:09:00.230 --> 06:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
that background in special ed a real
 
06:09:03.110 --> 06:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
good background in special ed as well
 
06:09:05.708 --> 06:09:05.718 align:start position:0%
when we introduce these bills I agree
 
06:09:07.430 --> 06:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see somebody here from
 
06:09:10.270 --> 06:09:10.280 align:start position:0%
special education doe however when we
 
06:09:11.750 --> 06:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
get to a point where we are right now
 
06:09:13.468 --> 06:09:13.478 align:start position:0%
there's no question this has to be put
 
06:09:15.070 --> 06:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
to a subcommittee and we need to be
 
06:09:17.830 --> 06:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
doing some work I'm still I still got
 
06:09:20.150 --> 06:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
Mega questions myself regarding this we
 
06:09:24.230 --> 06:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
went through this even prior to the prep
 
06:09:26.708 --> 06:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
uh president management Administration
 
06:09:26.718 --> 06:09:28.030 align:start position:0%
uh president management Administration
At

06:09:28.030 --> 06:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
At
 
06:09:30.350 --> 06:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
Doe and I don't know if we've ever
 
06:09:32.990 --> 06:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
gotten resolution on some of the
 
06:09:35.070 --> 06:09:35.080 align:start position:0%
questions and issues which exist out
 
06:09:36.830 --> 06:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
there between putting an order in and
 
06:09:39.070 --> 06:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
who does the billing I can remember that
 
06:09:40.750 --> 06:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
you know for example speech therapist
 
06:09:42.910 --> 06:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
that I talked to just the other day a
 
06:09:47.030 --> 06:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
case load of 7075 kids and does the
 
06:09:49.788 --> 06:09:49.798 align:start position:0%
billing now that's one heck of a
 
06:09:52.868 --> 06:09:52.878 align:start position:0%
job so there's a lot of issues which we
 
06:09:54.468 --> 06:09:54.478 align:start position:0%
got to look at especially when we're
 
06:09:56.190 --> 06:09:56.200 align:start position:0%
talking about Medicaid schools and other
 
06:09:59.670 --> 06:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
components special education so um we
 
06:10:02.708 --> 06:10:02.718 align:start position:0%
will take care of this and this probably
 
06:10:05.190 --> 06:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
most likely will go to a subcommittee
 
06:10:06.788 --> 06:10:06.798 align:start position:0%
it's not an early bill or anything it's
 
06:10:08.708 --> 06:10:08.718 align:start position:0%
not an early bill that's right we got
 
06:10:10.390 --> 06:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
lots of time on this we got another
 
06:10:13.270 --> 06:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
month so and we can also in room study
 
06:10:17.110 --> 06:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
it you know so but okay um thank you
 
06:10:19.190 --> 06:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
very much are there any more questions
 
06:10:25.628 --> 06:10:25.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:25.638 --> 06:10:35.990 align:start position:0%
 
Trumble

06:10:35.990 --> 06:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:37.390 --> 06:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and committee
 
06:10:39.030 --> 06:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
members I'm David Trumble from the town
 
06:10:41.990 --> 06:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
ofwar I have some concerns about the
 
06:10:44.110 --> 06:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
bill but I just want to back up and go
 
06:10:46.788 --> 06:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
over the special aspects of it I think
 
06:10:49.750 --> 06:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
that the code of conduct punishment
 
06:10:51.990 --> 06:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
model is totally inappropriate for this
 
06:10:54.190 --> 06:10:54.200 align:start position:0%
sort of situation you've heard that the
 
06:10:56.990 --> 06:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
billing system is extremely complex and
 
06:10:59.948 --> 06:10:59.958 align:start position:0%
despite extensive questioning it's not
 
06:11:01.708 --> 06:11:01.718 align:start position:0%
clear you've heard that sometimes
 
06:11:03.350 --> 06:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
parents won't show up to certain
 
06:11:05.670 --> 06:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
meetings and so that leaves people in
 
06:11:07.430 --> 06:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
limbo there's obviously the question of
 
06:11:09.070 --> 06:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
can you find service providers in
 
06:11:11.110 --> 06:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
certain locations instead of a
 
06:11:12.788 --> 06:11:12.798 align:start position:0%
punishment model I would suggest a
 
06:11:15.070 --> 06:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
training model that you would say if a
 
06:11:17.230 --> 06:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
school is out of compliance with this
 
06:11:18.830 --> 06:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
that you will find people who know how
 
06:11:21.310 --> 06:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
this system works and make it available
 
06:11:23.230 --> 06:11:23.240 align:start position:0%
to them there's no reason to punish
 
06:11:24.628 --> 06:11:24.638 align:start position:0%
teachers and it was indicated that
 
06:11:26.070 --> 06:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
teachers really have nothing to do with
 
06:11:27.670 --> 06:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
the billing
 
06:11:29.590 --> 06:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
the second thing is that what's step
 
06:11:31.708 --> 06:11:31.718 align:start position:0%
away from the special ed cases it's not
 
06:11:34.310 --> 06:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
clear that this bill only applies to
 
06:11:36.948 --> 06:11:36.958 align:start position:0%
special ed cases I looked up the the
 
06:11:39.830 --> 06:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
code and there are other things besides
 
06:11:43.230 --> 06:11:43.240 align:start position:0%
special ed that applies to the um the
 
06:11:46.788 --> 06:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
ICD codes for instance social
 
06:11:49.110 --> 06:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
determinance of Health which which
 
06:11:51.030 --> 06:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
according to the AMA are responsible for
 
06:11:53.910 --> 06:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
50 to 70% of an individual's health so
 
06:11:56.628 --> 06:11:56.638 align:start position:0%
these are social risk factors associated
 
06:11:58.910 --> 06:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
with poor health such as food insecurity
 
06:12:03.230 --> 06:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
housing instability and there are icd1
 
06:12:05.390 --> 06:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
codes for homelessness inadequate
 
06:12:08.390 --> 06:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
housing and food insecurity we know that
 
06:12:11.230 --> 06:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
60% of school teachers regularly give
 
06:12:14.230 --> 06:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
food to their children under this bill
 
06:12:16.468 --> 06:12:16.478 align:start position:0%
that would be I I think if if the
 
06:12:18.468 --> 06:12:18.478 align:start position:0%
language of the bill says to render or
 
06:12:21.150 --> 06:12:21.160 align:start position:0%
provide services if this teacher gives
 
06:12:23.390 --> 06:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
food on a Friday afternoon and Tucks
 
06:12:25.628 --> 06:12:25.638 align:start position:0%
food into their child's backpack that's
 
06:12:28.590 --> 06:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
rendering a Serv Serv for an icd10 code
 
06:12:30.150 --> 06:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's the intent of the
 
06:12:32.510 --> 06:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
bill but I think it should be looked
 
06:12:34.548 --> 06:12:34.558 align:start position:0%
into more so that it's clear that this
 
06:12:36.390 --> 06:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
if this is just a special ed Bill and
 
06:12:38.750 --> 06:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
only special ed then it should be stated
 
06:12:40.830 --> 06:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
as such in the bill so there's no
 
06:12:43.548 --> 06:12:43.558 align:start position:0%
confusion whatsoever the other question
 
06:12:46.070 --> 06:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
I have is well what about transgender
 
06:12:49.628 --> 06:12:49.638 align:start position:0%
students because trans also is an icd10
 
06:12:52.868 --> 06:12:52.878 align:start position:0%
code so it's very vague here what is
 
06:12:55.430 --> 06:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
rendering or providing a service if a
 
06:12:58.150 --> 06:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
child is a student is using their
 
06:13:00.670 --> 06:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
pronoun rendering a service is having
 
06:13:03.350 --> 06:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
books available for them if a child is
 
06:13:05.590 --> 06:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
on puberty blockers and the parent comes
 
06:13:07.430 --> 06:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
and tells the teacher that this is
 
06:13:08.990 --> 06:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
happening and the teacher tries to make
 
06:13:10.910 --> 06:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
some accommodations is that somehow
 
06:13:13.468 --> 06:13:13.478 align:start position:0%
providing a service what is a referral
 
06:13:15.150 --> 06:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
what if a parent confronts a teacher
 
06:13:16.830 --> 06:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
about their trans child and the teacher
 
06:13:19.110 --> 06:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
refers them to a family counselor is
 
06:13:21.548 --> 06:13:21.558 align:start position:0%
that a referral and and even in that
 
06:13:23.030 --> 06:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
case how would the teacher even know if
 
06:13:24.868 --> 06:13:24.878 align:start position:0%
the student was a Medicaid student or
 
06:13:26.990 --> 06:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
not and as it was clearly pointed out
 
06:13:28.750 --> 06:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
teachers aren't supposed to know that so
 
06:13:30.628 --> 06:13:30.638 align:start position:0%
there's just I would like it to be very
 
06:13:33.350 --> 06:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
specifically stated that this bill is
 
06:13:35.948 --> 06:13:35.958 align:start position:0%
only dealing with special education if
 
06:13:38.868 --> 06:13:38.878 align:start position:0%
teachers provide food or make a referral
 
06:13:41.190 --> 06:13:41.200 align:start position:0%
to a housing for a family who's become
 
06:13:42.628 --> 06:13:42.638 align:start position:0%
homeless they're not going to be
 
06:13:44.868 --> 06:13:44.878 align:start position:0%
punished under the code of conduct if
 
06:13:46.350 --> 06:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
and that has nothing to do with
 
06:13:48.310 --> 06:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
transgender students it shouldn't have

anything if it's a special ed bill it
 
06:13:52.708 --> 06:13:52.718 align:start position:0%
should be clearly stated as such that's
 
06:13:54.310 --> 06:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
all I just think it's a little bit
 
06:13:55.868 --> 06:13:55.878 align:start position:0%
unclear and as you said if you go to
 
06:13:57.510 --> 06:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
study committee perhaps you can
 
06:13:59.390 --> 06:13:59.400 align:start position:0%

06:14:14.718 --> 06:14:15.628 align:start position:0%
1616 and that closes down the hearings
