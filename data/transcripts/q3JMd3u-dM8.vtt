you

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
we did have four
 
00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.190 align:start position:0%
we did have four
cooperative

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
cooperative
 
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
school district bills yesterday of which
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
three were
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
interim studied
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
and one we held back this is the bill
 
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
which we held back which you see the
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
amendment on
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
we've noticed that there's some
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
concer there's at least maybe perhaps
 
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
several concerns with it still
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
and it's one we wanted to use as um
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
to move forward
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
so let's open that up the discussion
 
00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:50.799 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:30:50.799 --> 00:30:51.909 align:start position:0%
right now
um

00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
questions on the amending language
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
remember this was one where
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
it's attempting to give in a cooperative
 
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
school district if you have three
 
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
districts that are part of a cooperative
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
district a b and c a is a large district
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
maybe it has
 
00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.230 align:start position:0%
maybe it has
three

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
people on that board
 
00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
and b and c are both small ones maybe
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
one and one
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
and what this is attempting to do is try
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
to get those people that are
 
00:31:20.549 --> 00:31:20.559 align:start position:0%
representing that specific district
 
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
within the cooperative district
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
the right to vote for their own
 
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
representation rather than being a vote
 
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
of the entire
 
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
three a b and c
 
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
so if you were
 
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
running for that one position in c
 
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
you would be elected to the board based
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
upon your own voters in your own
 
00:31:39.919 --> 00:31:41.830 align:start position:0%
upon your own voters in your own
community

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
that's in your own district that's the
 
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
concept of that is what this is trying
 
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
so let's look at it and see if it's
 
00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919 align:start position:0%
doing what we intended to do represent
 
00:31:53.919 --> 00:31:55.669 align:start position:0%
doing what we intended to do represent
mullin

00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
mullin
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um is there
 
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
did this amendment remove the
 
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
number of
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
represent of school board
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
people that were elected from each
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
community i remember the original bill
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
uh had one per community i i
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
you know and i think we're very much
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
concerned about that that that's not
 
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
going to gel well with a lot of the
 
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
agreements it should be the way it's
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
established if you have three reps in a
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
one two three that you're voting for so
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
it doesn't remove it's not one one and
 
00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:35.430 align:start position:0%
it doesn't remove it's not one one and
one

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
for instance if
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
if you're in exeter you're going to have
 
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
more school board members than if you're
 
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
in brentwood it would be based upon the
 
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
agreement that exeter has in that
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
cooperative school district got it okay
 
00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
thank you no change no change
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
yes represent tanner
 
00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.269 align:start position:0%
yes represent tanner
so

00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it's just early morning
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
but i've gone through the amendment
 
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
and and have it side by side with the
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
original bill and i was wondering if you
 
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
could point out what the difference is
 
00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.230 align:start position:0%
could point out what the difference is
because

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:08.559 align:start position:0%
i can only find once well one small
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
difference and that's in line 16 where
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
you've crossed out at least other than
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
that it seems to match up perfectly and
 
00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering if what's the
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
intent of the of the uh
 
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:26.870 align:start position:0%
intent of the of the uh
amendment

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.029 align:start position:0%
 
melissa

00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
melissa
 
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:59.110 --> 00:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
no but
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
you're right
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
i i wish we i wish we
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
wish we talked yesterday so
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure who is right about what
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
so i i
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
okay this is what i'm thinking but
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
someone that's maybe thinking more
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
clearly this morning correct me if i'm
 
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
wrong so
 
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
when i originally
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
brought this bill forward it was exactly
 
00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:31.430 align:start position:0%
brought this bill forward it was exactly
so

00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
whatever district you were in you would
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
vote for the candidate from your
 
00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:37.599 align:start position:0%
district you're right and then when i
 
00:34:37.599 --> 00:34:39.030 align:start position:0%
district you're right and then when i
did

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
the testimony during the hearing
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
it evolved into
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
let's have equal representation from
 
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
each community and i have to be honest
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
with you i think maybe i was thinking
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
all along that that was part of the
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
original bill so when i did the
 
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
amendment i had them
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
remove the word
 
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
at least
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
but i think you're right i'm wondering
 
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
wait a minute
 
00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.310 align:start position:0%
wait a minute
no

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
all right go ahead dave yeah
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
so thanks rick so i think the the bill
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
is introduced
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
the bill is introduced crossed out the
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
words at least at line 16 which means
 
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
that if you had um
 
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
a district composed of warner sutton and
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
new london
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
that that each one of those would have
 
00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:35.990 align:start position:0%
that that each one of those would have
one

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative to the board
 
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:38.950 align:start position:0%
representative to the board
and

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
with with the words at least in there
 
00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
you could have proportional
 
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
representation on the board so i think
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
the amendment is is an improvement at
 
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
least in terms of
 
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
proportionality and but it would be up
 
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
to the the co-op agreement to define
 
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
what the what that proportionality is
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
and that's something that that gets done
 
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
at the establishment of a co-op
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
or or is maintained during a uh during a
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
co-ops uh existence
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
so uh in the amendment that we have here
 
00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
zero seven eight one h
 
00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
the change i see we have to do is
 
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
then to
 
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
yeah that's exactly right yes
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
all right so let me ask you this though
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
the original bill had an effective date
 
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
of 60 days after passage
 
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
and then the amendment doesn't mention
 
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
an effective date because the
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
amendment's only replacing section 1
 
00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
i know it's november but you could still
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
have it at the start of the school year
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
well you'd have it yeah tie it
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
july 1st
 
00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
2023 or something like that yeah yeah
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
no it won't be fy 22. it would have to
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
be fy 23
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
that would be past the july
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
uh elections except you passed the 2023
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
elections so i don't see any problem
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
leaving it 60 days because it will be
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
i would suggest when the elections are
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
march january one is too close
 
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
you need months to prepare for that and
 
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
recruit candidates and for them to
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
understand the change
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know i would say give them six
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
months the latest i would say is
 
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
september 1st to give districts enough
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
time to really understand this and that
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
the cooperative board may have to change
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
membership based on residency
 
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
i i i don't see any problem leaving it
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
60 days because it's um you know
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
affecting the next election whenever
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
so you know it's going to be after 60
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
days it's going to be the next march but
 
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
you know they would know that
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
this is coming
 
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
i'm fine with 60 days but people didn't
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
seem to be so i was trying to go further
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
but i think 60 day i agree with you
 
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli i think 60 days
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
this doesn't impact the composition of
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
the board at all
 
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.710 align:start position:0%
 
correct

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
and that's why we wanted all these
 
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
studies going on with disillusionment
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
with this whole process it's very
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
convoluted and has a lot of different
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
agreements from town town
 
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.670 align:start position:0%
agreements from town town
um

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
this has been an issue we've had for
 
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
every year i've been here on this in
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
this house and i don't know if we ever
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
get resolve on it
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
it's a local
 
00:39:47.599 --> 00:39:49.510 align:start position:0%
it's a local
study

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
well i i
 
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
you know i think it gets to what was
 
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
stead in our hearing one man one vote
 
00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
right now the larger district
 
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
can determine what the makeup is
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
if they can capture a few votes in the
 
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
other town
 
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
now it where it would hurt if you had
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
the three and the one and the one two
 
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
and three is
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
on the same page but there may be some
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
people in the minority in a
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
which could swing over and be with a
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
smaller towns and you may get a
 
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
different outcome as board makeup
 
00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.630 align:start position:0%
different outcome as board makeup
yeah

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
in my local co-op
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
i'm in tuftonboro but i would elect the
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
school board
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
representative to the co-op from ossipee
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
i have no idea who that guy is or who
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
that lady is
 
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
um you know but i would know who the
 
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
tuftenborough candidates would be so i
 
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment is
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
right in line with
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:05.839 align:start position:0%
no it's not ready
 
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
what you want is you want
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
to take out the at large
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh election possibility you want you
 
00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.270 align:start position:0%
uh election possibility you want you
want

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to figure out what what the
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
whole thing is like in in the co-op that
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
um is local to my uh district um
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
each town
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
within has a representative right but i
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
vote for the ossipee representative and
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
the brookfield representative that's
 
00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
that large
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
no they're not at large
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
they're there there's a uh there's an
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
ossipee representative there's a
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
brookfield representative by everybody
 
00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
but when you vote
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
i vote for those representatives also in
 
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
addition there are three at-large
 
00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
representatives um that are specified as
 
00:41:59.109 --> 00:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
at-large representatives so you know it
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
would be fine to have everyone vote for
 
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
the at-large representative but the
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
brookfield representative i think should
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
be elected by brookfield
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
right and that uh and well in kearsarge
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
that's what they do but they have it's
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
proportional because warner and new
 
00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
london are bigger towns right so they
 
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
get two two representatives right and
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
then each of the other
 
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh five towns have one representative
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
but you only vote for the representative
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
in your town exactly right well
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
okay that's what it does yes that's what
 
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
so are we
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
good to go with this by just taking that
 
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
ore out and we get them to make the
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
change if we don't make the change then
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a problem on the
 
00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.430 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a problem on the
floor

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
floor
 
00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
and you're going to have to have a floor
 
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
amendment or then you're going to have
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
to hold off and
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
get it fixed in the senate and that
 
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't always bode well either
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
do we know if any co-op districts
 
00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:06.150 align:start position:0%
do we know if any co-op districts
um

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
have their elections coming up within
 
00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:09.990 align:start position:0%
have their elections coming up within
this

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so no my co-op wouldn't my co-op is
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
a co-op of one yeah
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
and what's very unusual the others have
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
pulled out
 
00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.430 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:47.109 align:start position:0%
so
okay

00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
so i guess we can go on with the regular
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
business right now
 
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman for something as minor as
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
the or i would suggest we could vote on
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
it right now if you want and then i had
 
00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
this discussion with another minor
 
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
change we detected
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
the other day and when i
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
this it wasn't with anthony it wasn't
 
00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:07.839 align:start position:0%
with jeff one of the others over there
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
and they did some discussion with their
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
boss and the only way it can get changed
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
now is the ways i just mentioned it
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
floor amendment
 
00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.109 align:start position:0%
floor amendment
and

00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
i don't think we should send something
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
out especially if we have days in which
 
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
we can get this done
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
i agree i agree yeah
 
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%

here for the
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
public hearing on this so if i might

on this bill
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is the result of
 
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
several calls
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
from a parent in
 
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
southampton to
 
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
various legislators and the commissioner
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
of education
 
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
contacted me about
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
this parent is in southampton
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
their high school students
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
under a tuition agreement go to a high
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
school in amesbury massachusetts
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
it's a five-year agreement
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
this parent
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
does not think much of the amesbury high
 
00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:57.829 align:start position:0%
does not think much of the amesbury high
school

00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:46:59.829 --> 00:46:59.839 align:start position:0%
he would like his
 
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
children to be educated in new hampshire
 
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
he said he pays new hampshire taxes
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
the school is better he would like his
 
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
child to be educated in new hampshire
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
and was just looking for the ability
 
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
somehow to go
 
00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:17.839 align:start position:0%
to the school board and asked
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
out of this tuition agreement to
 
00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.430 align:start position:0%
out of this tuition agreement to
amesbury

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
amesbury
 
00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:23.190 align:start position:0%
amesbury
massachusetts

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.390 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
so

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
in discussions with the commissioner we
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
thought that
 
00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
maybe using the best interest of the
 
00:47:29.599 --> 00:47:30.950 align:start position:0%
maybe using the best interest of the
student

00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
would be a way to do it
 
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
so that's what i attempted in this um
 
00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
legislation and you can see on line four
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
all we added was
 
00:47:43.599 --> 00:47:44.390 align:start position:0%
all we added was
the

00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
consideration of parental concerns
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
in uh talking to the superintendent
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
school board about the best interest of
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
the child and then in light 13
 
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
adding to the
 
00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:59.670 align:start position:0%
adding to the
criteria

00:47:59.670 --> 00:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
00:48:02.549 --> 00:48:02.559 align:start position:0%
to be considered we added the transfer
 
00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
to a public school or public academy in
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
to help out
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
this family and possibly other families
 
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
in the district
 
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
i'll also mention that there was a
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
companion bill
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
from this individual's
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
state senator
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
um but that bill in the senate got uh
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
referred for interim study
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
so this bill is now the only
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.710 align:start position:0%
 
family

00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
family
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
take their case to the school board and
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
ask for
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the second
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
um i echo everything that glenn said and
 
00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
actually um i have been familiar with
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
this uh case for a few years now so
 
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
they have not found resolution and i
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
would um support this measure
 
00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
okay i i do have a question and then
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
representative luno
 
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
this legislation comes underneath
 
00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:12.559 align:start position:0%
manifest education hardship that's is
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:14.950 align:start position:0%
that correct
correct

00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:15.750 align:start position:0%
correct
um

00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
then what what is the criteria for a
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
superintendent to make a decision to
 
00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.470 align:start position:0%
superintendent to make a decision to
transfer

00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
what is a manifest education hardship or
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
what is in the best interest of the
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
student is i just want to go to another
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
school that is partially part of the
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
problem on the original case we had
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
up in lisbon years ago in the court case
 
00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
um which brought about uh the best
 
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
interest of the student the parent did
 
00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
not like what was happening in the
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
smaller in lisbon and want to go
 
00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:48.470 align:start position:0%
smaller in lisbon and want to go
elsewhere

00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
i think it was in easton
 
00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
and and so um
 
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
is this
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
i don't like what's going on in amesbury
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh enough of a criteria to say we will
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
the parent just wants the ability to go
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
to the school board
 
00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:12.559 align:start position:0%
and ask um
 
00:50:14.309 --> 00:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
basically for out of this tuition
 
00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:16.559 align:start position:0%
agreement so that his child can go to a
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire school uh high school um
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
and that was the reason for the two um
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative hall
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
so he can't
 
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.549 align:start position:0%
so he can't
ask

00:50:34.549 --> 00:50:34.559 align:start position:0%
ask
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
like you're saying he can go to the
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
school board and ask for the transfer he
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
can't do that right now
 
00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.349 align:start position:0%
can't do that right now
um

00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
i i don't think that
 
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
in statute there's any provision for the
 
00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
superintendent of the school board to um
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
let him out of that tuitioning agreement
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
that is in place for another five years
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
so he could ask but he would be told no
 
00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
i think that he has tried and he was
 
00:51:05.119 --> 00:51:06.309 align:start position:0%
i think that he has tried and he was
told

00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
told
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
that their hands are tied basically by
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
the tuitioning agreement short of any
 
00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
so so um
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
this is this has been going on for a few
 
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
years now what i'm hearing is this has
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
been going on for a while
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
and sort of following the the steps
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh laid out in 193 colon three
 
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
the parents
 
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
the family has asked
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
the superintendent for a best interest
 
00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:49.190 align:start position:0%
the superintendent for a best interest
determination

00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
determination
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
okay and then and then the
 
00:51:51.359 --> 00:51:53.109 align:start position:0%
okay and then and then the
superintendent

00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
roman 1 i
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
so if the superintendent does not find
 
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
that it is in the best interest student
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
change the parent or guardian may
 
00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
request a hearing with the school board
 
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
of residence
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
to determine if the student is
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
experiencing a manifest educational
 
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
hardship under paragraph two so did the
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
i i am not positive of um
 
00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
all the steps that were followed um the
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
only uh uh correspondence that i have um
 
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
dates back to um uh september i'm not
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
sure what other correspondence there was
 
00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
and what other uh
 
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
chain of events there might have
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
the reason i'm poking on this is is that
 
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
i don't really see how the the change at
 
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
line four
 
00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:53.750 align:start position:0%
line four
um

00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
is necessarily going to change the
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
outcome in in roman one i the
 
00:53:01.589 --> 00:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
superintendent's determination
 
00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
but the the existing statute does have a
 
00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:06.559 align:start position:0%
process that moves from best interest to
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
manifest hardship
 
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
and uh and manifest hardship is a is a
 
00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
different um
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
you know has a different standard
 
00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:15.510 align:start position:0%
you know has a different standard
associated

00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
associated
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh with that and i think
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
culminates with a roman three
 
00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
um the state board so it can be
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
after you've then appealed to your local
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
school board
 
00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:32.559 align:start position:0%
for a manifest hardship hearing and then
 
00:53:32.559 --> 00:53:33.670 align:start position:0%
for a manifest hardship hearing and then
the

00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
school board does not find
 
00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:37.430 align:start position:0%
school board does not find
in

00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
in favor of manifest hardship then you
 
00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
then bring it to the state board of
 
00:53:41.119 --> 00:53:43.270 align:start position:0%
then bring it to the state board of
education

00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
and this is in roman 3
 
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
may permit the child to withdraw from
 
00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:47.720 align:start position:0%
the school
 
00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:49.510 align:start position:0%
the school
[Music]

00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
for such time as the state board deems
 
00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:54.549 align:start position:0%
for such time as the state board deems
necessary

00:53:54.549 --> 00:53:54.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
and then 3a
 
00:53:59.430 --> 00:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
student reassigned under this section
 
00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:00.630 align:start position:0%
student reassigned under this section
um

00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
so now we're talking about reassigned to
 
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
a school in the in the in the state
 
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
because it talks about adm and stuff
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm not sure how this this does
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
anything right
 
00:54:13.359 --> 00:54:14.309 align:start position:0%
anything right
um

00:54:14.309 --> 00:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
if i could yes go ahead um
 
00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.230 align:start position:0%
if i could yes go ahead um
uh

00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:20.559 align:start position:0%
as you'll see in line six and seven
 
00:54:20.559 --> 00:54:21.430 align:start position:0%
as you'll see in line six and seven
um

00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
there were
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
options given to the superintendent
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
if they find that it's in the best
 
00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
interest of the child
 
00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:29.990 align:start position:0%
interest of the child
to

00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
there was three options previously
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
including um sign within a the
 
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
assignment within an assigned school
 
00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
transfer to another public school
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh transfer to a public school or a
 
00:54:49.829 --> 00:54:49.839 align:start position:0%
private school
 
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
for this situation where there was a
 
00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
tuition and agreement and they're in
 
00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
a school in massachusetts and
 
00:55:05.829 --> 00:55:05.839 align:start position:0%
would prefer to go into a school in new
 
00:55:05.839 --> 00:55:07.349 align:start position:0%
would prefer to go into a school in new
hampshire

00:55:07.349 --> 00:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
and that's also why we added
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
in four
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
for parental concerns would be a
 
00:55:17.109 --> 00:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
consideration that would be taken into
 
00:55:20.309 --> 00:55:20.319 align:start position:0%
account by the superintendent to uh
 
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
determine if it was in the best interest
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
of the child
 
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
sure i i
 
00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:28.309 align:start position:0%
sure i i
um

00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:30.559 align:start position:0%
yeah and i'm sure that
 
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
it'd be hard to believe that the that
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
the parents have not made their concerns
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
known to the to the superintendent if
 
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
this has been going on
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
two years so so uh the superintendent
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
keeps coming to the same conclusion
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
you know doesn't apply
 
00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:52.309 align:start position:0%
you know doesn't apply
here

00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:55:52.319 --> 00:55:53.750 align:start position:0%
here
and

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
i don't see how the change in four
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
is going to affect
 
00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
it's going to change how the students um
 
00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh what the outcome is and and then on
 
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
lines 13 or 14 i don't see how those are
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
any different than what's on lines 11
 
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
and 12
 
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
because um
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh public school public academy are
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
already defined in statute
 
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
as being schools approved by the
 
00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:19.030 align:start position:0%
as being schools approved by the
department

00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
and schools that are approved by the
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
department are located in the state of
 
00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh let me let me get in this a little
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
bit because you know
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
i'm conflicted with this um i just want
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure we're doing it i want to
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
take the situation of ainsbury and this
 
00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:36.799 align:start position:0%
student out of the picture
 
00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh and let's say there's another student
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
down there that does have you know and
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
when i look at the best interest of a
 
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
student it says within a
 
00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:47.030 align:start position:0%
student it says within a
statute

00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
the superintendent shall consider the
 
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
students academic physical personal or
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
social needs
 
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
if in fact the superintendent says no i
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
can't see any need for the transfer you
 
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
not you haven't demonstrated to me et
 
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
cetera et cetera so then the parent says
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
well okay then i'm going to request a
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
manifest education hardship
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
and if that's unsatisfactory of course
 
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
you can go to appeal the state board but
 
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
the manifest education hardship has to
 
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
do this
 
00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
such hardship must be so severe
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
pervasive or persistent that it
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
interferes with or limits the ability of
 
00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
the student to receive an education
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
we had discussed this many times when we
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
made the changes and tweaked this not
 
00:57:30.549 --> 00:57:30.559 align:start position:0%
tweaked it rewrote it
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
and it took us must have been four years
 
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
to get the thing completed and we worked
 
00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:36.559 align:start position:0%
with the school boards association and
 
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:39.839 align:start position:0%
they helped us write this
 
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
if a parent comes up and says well i
 
00:57:44.789 --> 00:57:44.799 align:start position:0%
want to move because of this particular
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
reason that one
 
00:57:48.789 --> 00:57:48.799 align:start position:0%
i would say no
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
now what happens if the kid does have
 
00:57:54.069 --> 00:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
these severe issues which demonstrate
 
00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
the need for another bullying or
 
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
something's going on
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
the child needs to be in another
 
00:57:59.119 --> 00:58:00.230 align:start position:0%
the child needs to be in another
situation

00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
now the district only has one tuition
 
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
agreement and that's with amesbury
 
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
then does the superintendent have the
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
right to establish another tuition
 
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.750 align:start position:0%
right to establish another tuition
agreement

00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
to send the kid to a school in new
 
00:58:22.079 --> 00:58:23.510 align:start position:0%
to send the kid to a school in new
hampshire

00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:25.349 align:start position:0%
hampshire
absolutely

00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
superintendents do this all the time
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
well the tuition agreements are
 
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
generally made by your school board
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
because you're following the dollar the
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
dollar comes to the resident district
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
then it files to the tuition district to
 
00:58:38.789 --> 00:58:38.799 align:start position:0%
pay for the tuition cost sure sure but
 
00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
in the in the case of of of both best
 
00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
interest and manifest educational
 
00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
hardship the superintendents in both
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
districts can can agree on a zero
 
00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:49.839 align:start position:0%
tuition in fact it says in the statute
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
the tuition can be waived
 
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
um and and in most cases the tuition is
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
waived because you've got that that that
 
00:58:59.430 --> 00:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh superintendent what what is it called
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
professional courtesy
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
um where where i mean i think that's
 
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
what what what it's about that's the way
 
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
we used to operate but now we operate
 
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
based upon the three criteria that are
 
00:59:11.349 --> 00:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
in this building but but it's in it's
 
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
laid out in there yep yeah um
 
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
yeah the students transferred to a
 
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
public school public academy or approved
 
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
private school in another district
 
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so they could they could
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
the superintendent could have
 
00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
the superintendent could have an a um a
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
conversation with the superintendent in
 
00:59:37.829 --> 00:59:37.839 align:start position:0%
another district let's just pick on
 
00:59:40.069 --> 00:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
oyster river or win a cunning
 
00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
and um and and come to an agreement that
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
sure we'll uh
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
either with a tuition agreement that
 
00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
would have to be subject to approval of
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
the board and i think that's in there or
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
tuition waiver and uh and that's a good
 
00:59:59.349 --> 00:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
thing too because if if the
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
receiving district
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
ever had a similar issue they might be
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
able to go to um to hampton and say hey
 
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
can you help us follow the next line of
 
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
thinking here
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
item three in here is one of the places
 
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
you can transfer to to another district
 
01:00:18.069 --> 01:00:18.079 align:start position:0%
it's already in law
 
01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
yeah could i ask where you were reading
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
the uh manifest education hardship um
 
01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh definition
 
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
in the first column at the bottom okay
 
01:00:47.349 --> 01:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
and can i also add that
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
specifically in southampton they only
 
01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
have one school that goes up to eighth
 
01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:54.559 align:start position:0%
grade so it's my understanding that
 
01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:56.079 align:start position:0%
students high school students can
 
01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
tuition into winnicunit
 
01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
or amesbury and i was not privy to the
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
conversations that uh the commissioner
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
brought up with glenn so i don't know
 
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
what the situation is right now with
 
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
that student
 
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
and i had not heard
 
01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
since the last piece of legislation went
 
01:01:12.799 --> 01:01:13.589 align:start position:0%
since the last piece of legislation went
through

01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
i think it was last term
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
where it where it went i didn't even
 
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
know that the bill was
 
01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
put into interim study so i i don't have
 
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
anything to add on this and i'm sorry
 
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
no no
 
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
go ahead yeah the the um
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
the the changes that were made and i
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
forgot when it was a year or two ago to
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
manifest educational hardship were um
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
were were developed over i think several
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
i think there were several swings at the
 
01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
back to oh we had too many together
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
and it was a very comprehensive uh
 
01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
change that that
 
01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.030 align:start position:0%
change that that
put

01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
put
 
01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
sort of logic and process to um to the
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
best it added best interest i think
 
01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
didn't it it added this well best
 
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
interest is prior to manifesting right
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
but it is segregated
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
came first and then right it wasn't all
 
01:02:06.549 --> 01:02:06.559 align:start position:0%
jumbled together
 
01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
and so so the process is much more clear
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
now and and um
 
01:02:13.829 --> 01:02:13.839 align:start position:0%
i hope the family understands the
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
process because i think the existing
 
01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.190 align:start position:0%
process because i think the existing
process

01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
could could give them
 
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
a lead to the resolution that they're
 
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
looking for okay representative mullen
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%

is no question
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%

thank you chairman i was i was going to
 
01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
concur as you start to read the the
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
specification for the manifest that's
 
01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:11.839 align:start position:0%
what i had highlighted in the book the
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
exact same thing it just seems to me
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
the options for the student are already
 
01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
there without four
 
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
that the this is just repetitive um i
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
understand grilling's pine important
 
01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
parental concern that's that's an option
 
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
you think they already be there but
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
that's fine but the the number four
 
01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
makes it doesn't make a whole lot of
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
sense because they already can send it
 
01:03:33.029 --> 01:03:33.039 align:start position:0%
to another school district if they
 
01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
choose to and and they have the option
 
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
of how it's gonna be paid it doesn't
 
01:03:39.109 --> 01:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
have to be a handshake or a professional
 
01:03:39.119 --> 01:03:40.069 align:start position:0%
have to be a handshake or a professional
agreement

01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:03:42.069 --> 01:03:42.079 align:start position:0%
so i think it just sounds like that the
 
01:03:42.079 --> 01:03:43.109 align:start position:0%
so i think it just sounds like that the
parent

01:03:43.109 --> 01:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
parent
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
a single parent of the whole state of
 
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire this particular place does not
 
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
satisfy the agreement of the
 
01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:49.839 align:start position:0%
superintendent that's what it sounds
 
01:03:49.839 --> 01:03:50.549 align:start position:0%
superintendent that's what it sounds
like

01:03:50.549 --> 01:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
but he does the superintendent does have
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
the option to send him to a different
 
01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:57.190 align:start position:0%
the option to send him to a different
school

01:03:57.190 --> 01:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
yes represent nelson
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman what about
 
01:04:03.029 --> 01:04:03.039 align:start position:0%
transportation if that student were to
 
01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
to come out of massachusetts would the
 
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
district have a responsibility to
 
01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
transport the student to the new school
 
01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:11.039 align:start position:0%
no we don't have transportation
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
requirements for high school kids
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
by law
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
you can do it in case of emergency
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
or the the
 
01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
that exception is in law now that was
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
done by finance
 
01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh by i think karen umberger made that
 
01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:30.799 align:start position:0%
change back around 17 18.
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:39.750 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
they do but it's optional but it's
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
optional it's offline by law right
 
01:04:45.270 --> 01:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
they're not required
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
adequacy does not provide you money for
 
01:04:47.039 --> 01:04:48.150 align:start position:0%
adequacy does not provide you money for
that

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:57.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:57.359 --> 01:04:58.470 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
if i if i could maybe if i could um
 
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
contact uh the department and try and
 
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
get additional information from them um
 
01:05:07.829 --> 01:05:07.839 align:start position:0%
before we have
 
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
an actual vote on it
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
i have i have no problem with that but
 
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
you might convey to them that my reading
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
is that we don't need it
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
that uh line through that the third item
 
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
takes care of it
 
01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:22.470 align:start position:0%
takes care of it
and

01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
the the superintendent has that
 
01:05:24.079 --> 01:05:27.670 align:start position:0%
the the superintendent has that
authority

01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.910 align:start position:0%
 
already

01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
but it's got to be a manifest education
 
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
hardship and in the particular case that
 
01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
you're talking about i don't think if i
 
01:05:36.789 --> 01:05:36.799 align:start position:0%
were an administrator i wouldn't approve
 
01:05:38.789 --> 01:05:38.799 align:start position:0%
it unless there was something really
 
01:05:41.109 --> 01:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
going on here we start doing this in one
 
01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
district we're going to get it
 
01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
particularly on tuition agreements
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
yes yes exactly
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
mr chair if i may also say i apologize i
 
01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
was out that week as well so there was
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
no information
 
01:05:59.109 --> 01:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
to be had to this committee so i
 
01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
apologize we'll get more information
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
from the department and we will address
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
this one
 
01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:12.390 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
we're intake we're taking no action uh
 
01:06:17.829 --> 01:06:17.839 align:start position:0%
so you wouldn't have to you can put down
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
some discussion that we had
 
01:06:19.839 --> 01:06:20.630 align:start position:0%
some discussion that we had
but

01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
we will come back and we will
 
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
take this up where we're executing it
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
the next one on the daca today is hb
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
1114 relative to education service
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
providers under the education freedom
 
01:06:50.309 --> 01:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
account program
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
i recognize rep representative cordelli
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:07.670 align:start position:0%
made the motion of itl do you have any
discussion

01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman um
 
01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
yes i uh
 
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
i believe that
 
01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:15.829 align:start position:0%
i believe that
um

01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:15.839 --> 01:07:17.589 align:start position:0%
um
this

01:07:17.589 --> 01:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
legislation is designed
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
education service provider
 
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
who would be
 
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
that does not fit with all the students
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
in the program as there are a variety of
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
services that
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
can be chosen to meet the child's
 
01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:39.829 align:start position:0%
can be chosen to meet the child's
education

01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
needs um it could be a therapist
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
it could be the purchase of a computer
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
from amazon or whoever
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
a whole variety of different
 
01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
different options
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
these criteria to be made available in a
 
01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:59.670 align:start position:0%
these criteria to be made available in a
list

01:07:59.670 --> 01:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
list
 
01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
would not apply
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
um and would apply only to a school and
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
i i think in some instances for a school
 
01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:11.430 align:start position:0%
i i think in some instances for a school
even

01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
even
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
some of these might not necessarily
 
01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
be valid
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
pieces of information to be included on
 
01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:19.839 align:start position:0%
any list
 
01:08:21.669 --> 01:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
i also believe that
 
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
information on available service
 
01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:24.789 align:start position:0%
information on available service
providers

01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
providers
 
01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
is made available to parents
 
01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
in selecting education options
 
01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
trebson tanner
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
thank you um you know one of the things
 
01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
i think is that uh we need more uh
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
transparency um i i certainly as one
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
person would feel a lot better if we had
 
01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
more transparency in this um
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
with these types of things i think
 
01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
you know you have parents that are now
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
consumers and they're going to be
 
01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
uh trying to to navigate um
 
01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
an area where there are a lot of people
 
01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
clamoring on the outside for their
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
particular uh money
 
01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's hard to get consumer
 
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.110 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's hard to get consumer
information

01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.070 align:start position:0%
information
um

01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
you know i checked on uh
 
01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
kearsarge i keep throwing that out but
 
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm more familiar with
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
and checked on their website you know
 
01:09:25.349 --> 01:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
and and all these things are are listed
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
along with and and i would suggest that
 
01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
co-curriculars if there's any um
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
you know clubs or
 
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh you know do the students uh have an
 
01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
to uh participate in robotics or you
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
know is there is there some
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh other areas that that whatever
 
01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
educational vendor it is uh is able to
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
provide them and if if it isn't uh
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
something that they can provide if they
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
01:09:52.719 --> 01:09:53.749 align:start position:0%
don't have
um

01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
something uh which i can't imagine well
 
01:09:58.229 --> 01:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
for example transportation options they
 
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
certainly could just put non-applicable
 
01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know if it was a remote group so
 
01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's i don't think this is
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
a big ask of people um
 
01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
i think it's it's uh consumer
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
information you know i really do thank
 
01:10:13.679 --> 01:10:14.709 align:start position:0%
information you know i really do thank
you

01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
represent porter on then represent like
 
01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:22.550 align:start position:0%
represent porter on then represent like
us

01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
it seems to me i may be reading
 
01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
we get so many
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
emails but i seem to remember
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
a comment or an email that came
 
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
that was from
 
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
a parent
 
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
who was using the efa program
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
thanking us for this bill because it
 
01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
would help
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
them to
 
01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
find out what's available and help them
 
01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
make their decision so
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
if anybody has
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
talked to people who are getting efas to
 
01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:58.630 align:start position:0%
talked to people who are getting efas to
see

01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:10:58.640 --> 01:10:59.750 align:start position:0%
see
what

01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
information they would find helpful i
 
01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:03.030 align:start position:0%
information they would find helpful i
believe

01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative cornell you can correct
 
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
me on this but i believe the reason this
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
bill was written this way
 
01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
is that these were issues that parents
 
01:11:11.199 --> 01:11:12.470 align:start position:0%
is that these were issues that parents
receiving

01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
receiving
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
vouchers or efas had problems with
 
01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.030 align:start position:0%
vouchers or efas had problems with
nationally

01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
nationally
 
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
in a survey that was done and so it was
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
a recommendation
 
01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
that such a guide be available for
 
01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:24.070 align:start position:0%
that such a guide be available for
parents

01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
parents
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of money
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
people want to make the right decision
 
01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
and this would help them
 
01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives
 
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
yeah the program just started this is
 
01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
all in the works right at the moment
 
01:11:39.679 --> 01:11:40.870 align:start position:0%
all in the works right at the moment
the

01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization talks to every
 
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
single parent and answers all these
 
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
questions personally
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
and there is a list it's already out
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
there i actually have it of all the
 
01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:54.950 align:start position:0%
there i actually have it of all the
potential

01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
potential
 
01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:56.470 align:start position:0%
potential
providers

01:11:56.470 --> 01:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
providers
 
01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:57.270 align:start position:0%
providers
but

01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
they are working on this basically they
 
01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:04.390 align:start position:0%
said their comment on this bill was
 
01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:06.630 align:start position:0%
said their comment on this bill was
[Music]

01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:06.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
the program just launched let's let cfs
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
do the work and tell us what they need
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
and and let the parents tell them what
 
01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
they need they talk to them all the time
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
they're gathering this information this
 
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
is a work in progress
 
01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.790 align:start position:0%
is a work in progress
and

01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
they are working on this it is something
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
that they talked about doing all along
 
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
and right but right now
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
every parent they talk to individually
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
so the parents don't even need this
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
list to just go to because
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
they're they're one on one talking with
 
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
the organization who's giving them all
 
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
the information they need but the in the
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
organization i mean these
 
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
providers they're just now getting
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
information on them etc and as glenn
 
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
said an awful lot of these don't really
 
01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.350 align:start position:0%
said an awful lot of these don't really
pertain

01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
pertain
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
to a lot of the
 
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
providers that they have like amazon is
 
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
a provider
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
it by definition it's a service provider
 
01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:08.149 align:start position:0%
it by definition it's a service provider
but

01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
this doesn't does not pertain to them
 
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
when you have groups
 
01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
that this doesn't you know this pertains
 
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
to like
 
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
schools that are accredited and stuff
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
but things this money gets used on all
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
kinds of things that aren't just schools
 
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
so the organization is in the process of
 
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
doing this and finding out what the
 
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
parents want we don't know what the
 
01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
parents want they know what the parents
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
want because they're talking to the
 
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
parents on a regular basis and i have
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
talked to
 
01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
people who are getting this and anytime
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
they have a question they just call
 
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
and they get their questions answered
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's
 
01:13:50.229 --> 01:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
and yes there will be something like
 
01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
this but they're finding out from the
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
parents what they want not us telling
 
01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
them oh we want this no this isn't
 
01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily what they want
 
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
the parents are telling them what they
 
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
want let's let the parents do that
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
representative cornell
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
i think if the scholarship organization
 
01:14:10.229 --> 01:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
is doing it anyway i don't think it will
 
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
hurt to put it in statute that they
 
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
should be doing it and i most states or
 
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
that are already doing this do have a
 
01:14:21.669 --> 01:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
directory of what's available and
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes parents don't know what they
 
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
want until they see it written down and
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
they can say oh
 
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
look at this list i think i want that
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
they may not think of it unless they can
 
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
see it and and i think it's important
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
that they know that if they're choosing
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
something doesn't include what they are
 
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
looking for they may not think to ask
 
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
that before they sign up
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
for a service provider so i don't think
 
01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
it's harmful to put in statute that the
 
01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
service or the
 
01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization will do this
 
01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:56.790 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization will do this
anyway

01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:14:59.590 --> 01:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
but and strange as it is i did get
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
thanked on twitter for providing
 
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
services for
 
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
ef for
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
server for um
 
01:15:09.189 --> 01:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
educational freedom accounts which was
 
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
very strange
 
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
but they thanked me for thinking of them
 
01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:13.189 align:start position:0%
but they thanked me for thinking of them
so

01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
okay uh represent hobson and then
 
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
represent porter
 
01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i was hoping that
 
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
representative lycus could send us that
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
a link to that list because i have not
 
01:15:29.189 --> 01:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
seen it
 
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
send it to the whole committee and the
 
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
other thing that i wanted to mention is
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
that at an education conference recently
 
01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
the children's scholarship fund if if
 
01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
i'm remembering correctly
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
was a model for education freedom
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
accounts throughout the country
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
apparently other states don't have
 
01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
framework like this set up yet so i just
 
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to put that out there
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
01:15:57.189 --> 01:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:15:58.709 --> 01:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
if the goal
 
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
as has been stated
 
01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
many times in this committee is to have
 
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
many families taking advantage of
 
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
education freedom accounts
 
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering how
 
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
as far as i know in new hampshire there
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
are two people
 
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
working with the scholarship
 
01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:16.310 align:start position:0%
working with the scholarship
organization

01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
how will those two people be able to
 
01:16:18.719 --> 01:16:20.390 align:start position:0%
how will those two people be able to
handle

01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
handle
 
01:16:22.709 --> 01:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
inquiries from
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
hundreds maybe thousands of more people
 
01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
in the next couple of years who are
 
01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of this um that's why i
 
01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
think it would be helpful to have it in
 
01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
a website was people could go through so
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
they don't get stuck on the
 
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
phone line waiting to le till their call
 
01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
is answered in the future represent
 
01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:43.830 align:start position:0%
is answered in the future represent
woodcock

01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
woodcock
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
i was
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
thinking the same lines as
 
01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
representative cornell uh whenever the
 
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
lakers indicated that the scholarship
 
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
organization already talks to all the
 
01:16:56.229 --> 01:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
individuals and and
 
01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
all the people individually and gives
 
01:16:58.390 --> 01:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
them all the information that they
 
01:16:59.430 --> 01:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
already have it
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
then if it's already there then it'd be
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
easy to put in in print
 
01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:04.550 align:start position:0%
easy to put in in print
and

01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
be available to all parents who are
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
looking to decide where they want to go
 
01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:09.350 align:start position:0%
looking to decide where they want to go
um

01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
and convenient you know 10 o'clock at
 
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
night or sitting there on there and do
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
it when you're working and have a chance
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
the second part tonight and she's
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct there are some things
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
that are not applicable uh like the
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
amazon you put not applicable that's
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
simple so you know so the parent knows
 
01:17:26.470 --> 01:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
this this doesn't have that i i also
 
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
think things like the school discipline
 
01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
problem uh policy are important because
 
01:17:32.229 --> 01:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to roll my youngster with a
 
01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
provider i'd like to know what the
 
01:17:34.709 --> 01:17:34.719 align:start position:0%
discipline policy is and not find out
 
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
after we get there something's wrong if
 
01:17:38.709 --> 01:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
if it's what she says it is it's
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
available already they talk to them they
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
tell them individually put it on the net
 
01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
so everybody can see it they have an
 
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
option to use it
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:17:49.189 --> 01:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you uh i would just
 
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
point out that the legislation also uh
 
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
provides for a parent and service
 
01:17:57.189 --> 01:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
provider advisory commission um i think
 
01:18:00.149 --> 01:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
that's uh the place where um
 
01:18:04.630 --> 01:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
what criteria um to be listed in uh any
 
01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
directory of service providers um they
 
01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
would be that would be the place for the
 
01:18:10.719 --> 01:18:11.830 align:start position:0%
would be that would be the place for the
uh

01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
or the uh
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
pieces of information to be listed
 
01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
would be determined i think that's the
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
best place for it and in addition there
 
01:18:22.229 --> 01:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
is an education
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee to the
 
01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
program and they will be meeting um in
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
the middle of march i cannot remember
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
the exact date um
 
01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
but um as last i heard there was uh to
 
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
be a presentation of the class wallet
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
system which will
 
01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:42.709 align:start position:0%
system which will
which

01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
is where all service providers are
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
registered and
 
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
basis for electronic payments to those
 
01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
service providers from the accounts
 
01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
so i think that there are things uh
 
01:18:57.189 --> 01:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
going on and um
 
01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
i don't think that it always requires uh
 
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
do what's uh intended in this
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
legislation i think that
 
01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:12.630 align:start position:0%
legislation i think that
um

01:19:12.630 --> 01:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
parents advisory commission and other
 
01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
options are available and they certainly
 
01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:18.790 align:start position:0%
options are available and they certainly
can

01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
come up with what is needed
 
01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
for information for
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
parents joining the efa program
 
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps santa luna
 
01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair so um we're
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
at the top here of a string of
 
01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
efa and voucher bills
 
01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh coming coming up and um and you know
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's certainly
 
01:19:48.870 --> 01:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
obvious to everybody that um that that
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
this is a very partisan issue
 
01:19:52.709 --> 01:19:52.719 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
the um we
 
01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:54.709 align:start position:0%
the um we
[Music]

01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
we absolutely were in opposition to um
 
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
to house bill 20 when it when it came
 
01:20:03.669 --> 01:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
through last year and uh and in fact
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 20 i think resulted in being
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
being um
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
retained uh in committee and then and um
 
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
or and was it was it even put on the
 
01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
table no i think it was retained in
 
01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:16.390 align:start position:0%
table no i think it was retained in
commit

01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
commit
 
01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
i i think it was retained in committee
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
um because we didn't have the votes to
 
01:20:22.709 --> 01:20:22.719 align:start position:0%
pass it and um
 
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
and and public
 
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
outcry was so strong i think even on
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
that bill it was like 6 000 something
 
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
opposed to it to
 
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
a thousand something um uh in favor
 
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
of it and um and obviously ultimately it
 
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
made its way you know into the into a a
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
budget that you know a 12 billion dollar
 
01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
budget that had 129 000
 
01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:49.990 align:start position:0%
budget that had 129 000
um

01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh set aside for um uh for for vouchers
 
01:20:57.189 --> 01:20:57.199 align:start position:0%
so what what we're doing here
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
with beginning with house bill 1114 but
 
01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
also with with other bills that i think
 
01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:03.669 align:start position:0%
also with with other bills that i think
we've

01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
we've
 
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
already exact like uh like 1684 which
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
which would have held
 
01:21:12.149 --> 01:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
um the program to budgeted amounts and
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
and with an amendment would have
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
protected students who were already
 
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
involved with the program
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah but it's not to tear apart the
 
01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
program but it's to make it responsible
 
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
um to taxpayers and make it responsible
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
to parents and students too and that's
 
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
what 1114 is trying to do i agree
 
01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
that that the language here is a little
 
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
clunky because education service
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
providers yes applies to amazon it's
 
01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:40.639 align:start position:0%
right in the uh right in the definition
 
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
in 194 f
 
01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:43.189 align:start position:0%
in 194 f
um

01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:44.719 align:start position:0%
i think what representative woodcock
 
01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
suggested that it's not applicable to
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
somebody buying a notebook from amazon
 
01:21:52.149 --> 01:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
um but it's certainly applicable to
 
01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
education service providers in maybe
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
more of the classical sense whether
 
01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:58.639 align:start position:0%
they're a private school or a private
 
01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
academy or
 
01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
or or you know tutoring services or
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
something like that and we heard
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
directly from from matt southerton uh
 
01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
with regards to the the i think he used
 
01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
the term rigorous vetting process that's
 
01:22:17.189 --> 01:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
in place now
 
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
so yes we're at the beginning of the
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
program representative lucas but they're
 
01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:22.639 align:start position:0%
doing a rigorous vetting process right
 
01:22:22.639 --> 01:22:23.430 align:start position:0%
doing a rigorous vetting process right
now

01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
and um and so so they have the data to
 
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
collect that
 
01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
furthermore um uh
 
01:22:31.199 --> 01:22:32.070 align:start position:0%
furthermore um uh
this

01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:22:34.629 --> 01:22:34.639 align:start position:0%
not so much this bill but other bills as
 
01:22:34.639 --> 01:22:35.590 align:start position:0%
not so much this bill but other bills as
well

01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
are in response to uh to comments that
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
have come back from the jail car uh
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
attorneys critical of the rules that
 
01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
have been presented right now and and
 
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
one example of that and and i think this
 
01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
is also part of
 
01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.310 align:start position:0%
is also part of
1114.

01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
1114.
 
01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
um is um is you know what's what's the
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
you know how
 
01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:59.669 align:start position:0%
you know how
how

01:22:59.669 --> 01:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:02.629 --> 01:23:02.639 align:start position:0%
how safe is my student going to be
 
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
with this education service provider and
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
in fact the current rules
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
proposed by the department specifically
 
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
say the scholarship organization shall
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
not conduct criminal background checks
 
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
on education service providers so i'm
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
sort of wondering how actually rigorous
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
this this vetting process is but at
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
least as far as as it concerns schools
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
who are education service providers the
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
name of the administrator the
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
performance data the written discipline
 
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
policy the years in operation
 
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's all transparency that's all for
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
the public for for families who may be
 
01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:42.629 align:start position:0%
the public for for families who may be
considering

01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:42.639 align:start position:0%
considering
 
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
um sending their child under the under
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
194 f
 
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
to um uh to a program outside of their
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
their school district
 
01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
um and and and have it laid out there so
 
01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
that they can take a look so i'm glad
 
01:23:56.629 --> 01:23:56.639 align:start position:0%
representative lucas has that list i'm
 
01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
glad representative hobson has asked for
 
01:23:59.669 --> 01:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
that list
 
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
um because if that list is available it
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
should be put up for um uh for everybody
 
01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
to to look at and um and and and of
 
01:24:08.159 --> 01:24:09.030 align:start position:0%
to to look at and um and and and of
course

01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
course
 
01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
um these schools must have performance
 
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
data too because that's part of the um
 
01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
the the accountability standards that
 
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
that all schools um have
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
as we go through
 
01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
1114 but also the others today
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
um i hope people aren't going to look at
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
this as being death by a thousand cuts
 
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
because that's not the intention of how
 
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
we're bringing this forward
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
we know this is a program that's in
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
place we know this is a program that's
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
highly unpopular
 
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
with granite staters
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
recent polls granite state polling has
 
01:24:46.709 --> 01:24:46.719 align:start position:0%
indicated that uh as well and that we're
 
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
just trying to tighten up on this a
 
01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
little bit for to be responsible for
 
01:24:53.110 --> 01:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and be responsible for
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
students and i'll say it again um we
 
01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
heard we heard the department say it
 
01:25:01.110 --> 01:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
yesterday that that that that um student
 
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
safety is job one well damn it it should
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
be job one and the fact that it's not in
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
the rules um
 
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
in fact that it's that it's
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
that that that the rules state the
 
01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
scholarships shall not conduct criminal
 
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
background checks is just outrageous
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay let's let's uh get back on this
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
particular topic right here
 
01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:25.030 align:start position:0%
particular topic right here
i

01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
i think that everybody here is anxious
 
01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:29.189 align:start position:0%
i think that everybody here is anxious
to

01:25:29.189 --> 01:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
look at bills constructively and see is
 
01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
there a way to improve a program now
 
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
i think everybody ought to be looking at
 
01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
things from that vein
 
01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
i would approve this bill
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
if in fact it didn't have a laundry list
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
of items done oftentimes when we put
 
01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
laundry lists on things something's left
 
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
off i know it says those magic words but
 
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
not limited to
 
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:25:58.149 --> 01:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
we do that often and what we're doing by
 
01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
writing these laundry lists
 
01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
we are getting down into the micro
 
01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:04.149 align:start position:0%
we are getting down into the micro
management

01:26:04.149 --> 01:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:26:06.310 --> 01:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
of where we belong in terms of whether
 
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
we're doing it with the the college
 
01:26:09.669 --> 01:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
system the university system we're
 
01:26:11.110 --> 01:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
dealing with high schools we're dealing
 
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
with elementary schools
 
01:26:15.430 --> 01:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
where does the responsibility of
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
internal administration
 
01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
and authority come into play
 
01:26:22.390 --> 01:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
i i concur the scholarship organization
 
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
shall compile a directory of public
 
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
profiles for each education service
 
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
provider listed period
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
and let the oversight committee let
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
those that are involved say okay here's
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
some important elements that the public
 
01:26:39.750 --> 01:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
should know to make a decision
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
however that's not the way this reads
 
01:26:43.189 --> 01:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
right now it goes down and reads all
 
01:26:45.189 --> 01:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
kinds of things which there there's
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
going to be some things which are
 
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
checked off not applicable
 
01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
high school doesn't provide
 
01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:51.030 align:start position:0%
high school doesn't provide
transportation

01:26:51.030 --> 01:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
01:26:52.629 --> 01:26:52.639 align:start position:0%
our elementary schools are not
 
01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
accredited all of them some are
 
01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
accredited through the elementary
 
01:26:57.430 --> 01:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
association but they're not all
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
accredited we have several high schools
 
01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
which are not accredited
 
01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:03.350 align:start position:0%
which are not accredited
so

01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
then you can look at other aspects of
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
that as well so it's there's going to be
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
n a's on on certain responses i think
 
01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
that every profile should list
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
those you know for example amazon
 
01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be there's going to
 
01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
be a lot of n a's here
 
01:27:20.709 --> 01:27:20.719 align:start position:0%
uh down the list but it'd be nice to
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
have a profile what amazon can offer in
 
01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
terms of uh
 
01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
offerings so i i would be supportive of
 
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
this bill if we put a period after
 
01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
listed and let those are responsible to
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
do it so rick
 
01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons i think we um
 
01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
you organize the exact sessions in
 
01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
groups of like we're doing all the efa
 
01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
bills right now is so that we could we
 
01:27:45.910 --> 01:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
could have discussions like this and
 
01:27:48.629 --> 01:27:48.639 align:start position:0%
possibly even consider amendments that
 
01:27:52.149 --> 01:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
you know uh to this bill or other bills
 
01:27:56.629 --> 01:27:56.639 align:start position:0%
after after conversation but but um uh
 
01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
possibly taking
 
01:28:01.030 --> 01:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
you know lines one through six
 
01:28:03.669 --> 01:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
and and knocking out um
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
essentially knocking out the rest of the
 
01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
thing so ends at public profiles
 
01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
and and and relevant data we could just
 
01:28:12.629 --> 01:28:12.639 align:start position:0%
put relevant data and leave that up to
 
01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
the the oversight committee leave that
 
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
up to the scholarship organization but
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
at least it provides at least it starts
 
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
us in the in the direction of
 
01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:26.639 align:start position:0%
transparency but i i i and if we really
 
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
try to address this so we are
 
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
communicating to our public
 
01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
now i understand that there's some out
 
01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:34.719 align:start position:0%
there that don't like efas we we got
 
01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
that message left but we also know
 
01:28:38.229 --> 01:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
there's 1800 people that do like it they
 
01:28:40.390 --> 01:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
have kids 1800 kids in the program it's
 
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
there for a reason it may be the best
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
fit for that particular child or that
 
01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
family um i'm not objecting to the
 
01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
alternative forms of education in the
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
state i support it strongly i would like
 
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
to see something here where we're no
 
01:28:56.550 --> 01:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
provider is that the individual parent
 
01:28:58.709 --> 01:28:58.719 align:start position:0%
we've had that discussion before
 
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
or is it is it a parent that has other
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
kids in the neighborhood coming in and
 
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
sitting in that home and they're
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
providing this small pod
 
01:29:09.990 --> 01:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
with scholarships funding uh and
 
01:29:12.950 --> 01:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
education uh a provider obviously is
 
01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
maybe part of that but you know the
 
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
parent it's like a home school and we
 
01:29:18.629 --> 01:29:18.639 align:start position:0%
don't you know you can homeschool and
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
and you don't have to go through these
 
01:29:20.239 --> 01:29:21.110 align:start position:0%
and you don't have to go through these
hoops

01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
hoops
 
01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
and we don't put the hurdle so high so i
 
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
think there's room for working on this
 
01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:26.149 align:start position:0%
think there's room for working on this
thing

01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
um if we if we put down what we're
 
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
and do it in a way that is going to make
 
01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
it informative to the parent
 
01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:36.830 align:start position:0%
it informative to the parent
and

01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh leaving some of what we put in it up
 
01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
to uh you know the folks which are
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with the issue
 
01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:44.390 align:start position:0%
dealing with the issue
um

01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
at this point in time i could go with
 
01:29:47.189 --> 01:29:47.199 align:start position:0%
this bill if you put a period after
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
listed or you know if you had some other
 
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
language to to explain what the purpose
 
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
of these profiles is
 
01:29:56.950 --> 01:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
to communicate to the public here's an
 
01:29:59.110 --> 01:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity for you to have you know and
 
01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
here's what this provider does provide
 
01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
okay if you're willing to do that then
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
we will jump over this and we'll come
 
01:30:18.149 --> 01:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
back to it is that all right so i want
 
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
the public to know though that that we
 
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
want to see
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
a program work we want to see every
 
01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:25.750 align:start position:0%
a program work we want to see every
child

01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
and as i've heard from your team over
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
there too many times represent luna
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
every child in this state counts
 
01:30:36.149 --> 01:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
our demographics shrinking we need every
 
01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
one of these kids get an education
 
01:30:40.629 --> 01:30:40.639 align:start position:0%
and i'm all for doing it in any way i
 
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
can do it
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
so let's let's move forward get bring
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
back that amendment we'll deal with this
 
01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
for the day
 
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
first off the you should have the email
 
01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
it is being emailed to you about the
 
01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
providers so you can look at it
 
01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:12.870 align:start position:0%
providers so you can look at it
um

01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:17.110 --> 01:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
second off the organization is coming up
 
01:31:19.110 --> 01:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
with saying you know they're designing a
 
01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
database they're doing all of that kind
 
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
of stuff they're using based on the
 
01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
questions they get et cetera et cetera
 
01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
it's happening that's what i was trying
 
01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
to say before it's happening already
 
01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:32.149 align:start position:0%
to say before it's happening already
but

01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
i the question is do you know that rules
 
01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
were passed on friday and do you have a
 
01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
list of those rules because so many
 
01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
things that are in these bills that
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
we'll be seeing are covered by the rules
 
01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
and some of them are in conflict with
 
01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
the rules that were passed and they just
 
01:31:54.629 --> 01:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
got passed so all the arguments all the
 
01:31:57.430 --> 01:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
whatever was done in jail car they fixed
 
01:32:00.229 --> 01:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
things they did all this stuff the idea
 
01:32:00.239 --> 01:32:01.110 align:start position:0%
things they did all this stuff the idea
that

01:32:01.110 --> 01:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
these bills went in based on gel car i
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
mean friday
 
01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
friday is when they passed the jail car
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
and i would ask that when you're trying
 
01:32:17.830 --> 01:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
to develop this talk to matt southerton
 
01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
he's the one that came in here and spoke
 
01:32:22.629 --> 01:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
on behalf of this
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
and and and and involved glenn as well i
 
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
i think we're all supportive of
 
01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:28.790 align:start position:0%
i think we're all supportive of
communicating

01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
communicating
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh with the public uh so that there's a
 
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
way it can be done let's get it done
 
01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:34.870 align:start position:0%
way it can be done let's get it done
correctly

01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
and you know and and try to come back
 
01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
with something that's palatable for all
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:50.790 --> 01:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
i i hope it does because you know mother
 
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
nature is going to pick up some steam on
 
01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:53.590 align:start position:0%
nature is going to pick up some steam on
friday

01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
friday
 
01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
and if we don't get our work done guess
 
01:32:57.510 --> 01:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
where we're going to be the following
 
01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:59.110 align:start position:0%
where we're going to be the following
week

01:32:59.110 --> 01:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
right back here
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
and remember guys i wanted everybody to
 
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
have the full week off some have got
 
01:33:06.149 --> 01:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
airplane tickets flying out of here so
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
there might be some subs that we'd have
 
01:33:10.229 --> 01:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
to use if we have to come back
 
01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
for a date
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
okay so let's do 115
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
next one on the docket here
 
01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
relative to the uh to record of
 
01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
educational attainment under the
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
educational freedom account program
 
01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:33:26.709 --> 01:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
representative hobson is
 
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what i got down here
 
01:33:36.229 --> 01:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
no she can steal all the fun she wants
 
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
i'm the lightning keep us on track
 
01:33:40.629 --> 01:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
and and i agree with everything you said
 
01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
about the last bill just wanted to say
 
01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:33:47.669 --> 01:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
i would like to make a motion itl hb1115
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
01:33:52.229 --> 01:33:52.239 align:start position:0%
i hope so
 
01:33:55.110 --> 01:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you uh
 
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
so we have a motion made by
 
01:33:58.229 --> 01:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
representative hopson second by
 
01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
representative moffatt uh make her the
 
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
motion do you care to have any
 
01:34:04.950 --> 01:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
discussion yes i will briefly say that
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
efa students often homeschool students
 
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
compile information throughout the year
 
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
into a portfolio this method has been
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
approved and for some is a better better
 
01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
method to measure progress these
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
portfolios need to be assessed by a
 
01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
credentialed teacher under current
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
legislation education freedom accounts
 
01:34:25.110 --> 01:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
are provided three options for
 
01:34:27.189 --> 01:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
assessment that are in line with the
 
01:34:29.669 --> 01:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
current requirements in statute this
 
01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
bill would take away two options forcing
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
parents into a single assessment option
 
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
that is inconsistent with our currently
 
01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
approved options this creates
 
01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
unnecessary burden on families that are
 
01:34:42.709 --> 01:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
trying to stay compliant with
 
01:34:42.719 --> 01:34:43.990 align:start position:0%
trying to stay compliant with
assessments

01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
assessments
 
01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
providing multiple ways of assessment
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
allows families to choose the best fit
 
01:34:48.870 --> 01:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
for them
 
01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
there is really no reason to test
 
01:34:52.709 --> 01:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
students participating in education
 
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
freedom accounts differently than public
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
school students
 
01:34:58.390 --> 01:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
sounds like you got the committee report
 
01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
already made huh
 
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay uh so
 
01:35:04.629 --> 01:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
so let's have some discussion now
 
01:35:06.229 --> 01:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
represent cornell well i don't
 
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
understand the last sentence that you
 
01:35:10.149 --> 01:35:10.159 align:start position:0%
said that there's no way there's no
 
01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:11.490 align:start position:0%
reason to
 
01:35:11.490 --> 01:35:12.629 align:start position:0%
reason to
[Music]

01:35:12.629 --> 01:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
test freedom account students
 
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
differently than public school students
 
01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
when all public schools students take
 
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
the state assessment exam
 
01:35:23.189 --> 01:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
so if you're not going to do everyone
 
01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
how do you
 
01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
tell if they're doing well in their
 
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
other school
 
01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
other program
 
01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
because i i think
 
01:35:34.709 --> 01:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
just said
 
01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
your last sentence was that they don't
 
01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
have to do what the public school and
 
01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
the public school does right well and
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
when you were giving testimony rep
 
01:35:45.669 --> 01:35:45.679 align:start position:0%
cornell i believe i asked you what if
 
01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
students are using different curriculum
 
01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
to achieve the same goals
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
it might not look the same the standards
 
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
might be arrived at through a different
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
method so the statewide assessment might
 
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
not work for that particular method that
 
01:36:04.709 --> 01:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
they're using
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
and i hope that makes sense because
 
01:36:09.189 --> 01:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
that's all i've got
 
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh maybe i can just interject uh one uh
 
01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
bit of information when we were looking
 
01:36:16.950 --> 01:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
at way back one with the common core
 
01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:18.229 align:start position:0%
at way back one with the common core
standards

01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
standards
 
01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
and there was concern from some
 
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
districts that they'd like to elevate
 
01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
above the common core other words to go
 
01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:24.390 align:start position:0%
above the common core other words to go
beyond

01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
01:36:26.310 --> 01:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards
 
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
and we also established at that time
 
01:36:29.669 --> 01:36:29.679 align:start position:0%
that there could be
 
01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
they could do that
 
01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
has to be approved but they can do it
 
01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
and they can assess with a norm
 
01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
reference test if they so desire
 
01:36:39.990 --> 01:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
everybody has to take the statewide
 
01:36:42.149 --> 01:36:42.159 align:start position:0%
assessment simply that we try to get at
 
01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%
least a 95 percent completion in these
 
01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
schools in order to sustain
 
01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
reduction in funds from the federal
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
government which they can do that if we
 
01:36:54.629 --> 01:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
don't get to a certain level of
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
participation on the statewide test
 
01:36:58.709 --> 01:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
that's a mandatory thing for receiving
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
the s monies
 
01:37:01.830 --> 01:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
and we have an application which we
 
01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:03.030 align:start position:0%
and we have an application which we
submit

01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
submit
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
that that gets that approved so there
 
01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
are multiple ways that we have for
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
assessing the competencies that we're
 
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
doing within the schools because all
 
01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
are teaching
 
01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh the curriculum and the instruction
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
in accordance with how it's been
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
approved for that particular school
 
01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:20.709 align:start position:0%
approved for that particular school
district

01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:37:23.189 --> 01:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
and there's no sense for anybody to give
 
01:37:26.629 --> 01:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
a test if the test is not aligned with
 
01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:28.719 align:start position:0%
what is being taught at the time it's
 
01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
being taught you teach us history maybe
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
one place and one grade level another
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
grade level x school and another grade
 
01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:35.590 align:start position:0%
grade level x school and another grade
level

01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
that occurs through elementary ed as
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
well so you want to make sure your
 
01:37:41.669 --> 01:37:41.679 align:start position:0%
instrument is aligned with your
 
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
instruction and your curriculum so and
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
there's also a movement in this country
 
01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
and it's been done quite thoroughly down
 
01:37:51.109 --> 01:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts where they have
 
01:37:51.119 --> 01:37:52.709 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts where they have
portfolios

01:37:52.709 --> 01:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
portfolios
 
01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
and capstone projects which com are
 
01:37:57.109 --> 01:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
following that and the portfolio is a
 
01:37:59.350 --> 01:37:59.360 align:start position:0%
record of achievement what the child has
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
done and that's getting away from this
 
01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
basically and which i'm not necessarily
 
01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
a real believer in a test saying the
 
01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
child knows how to apply the knowledge
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
and skills
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
that they've been taught
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
and the portfolio shows more application
 
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
of the knowledge and skills so i think
 
01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
we'd be an error in in subtracting from
 
01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
how we assess these other two valuable
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
instruments that are used to to assess
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
student growth
 
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.310 align:start position:0%
student growth
represented

01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
represented
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair for for
 
01:38:36.629 --> 01:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
laying that out and uh and that makes a
 
01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
lot of sense
 
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:38.790 align:start position:0%
lot of sense
um

01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
particularly because the um the 194f
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
voucher program does not um
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
specify i don't think it requires the
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
same set of um of
 
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
of you know core
 
01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:54.310 align:start position:0%
of you know core
um

01:38:54.310 --> 01:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
curriculum core adequacy or minimum
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
standards that public schools are held
 
01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:00.229 align:start position:0%
standards that public schools are held
to

01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:39:00.239 --> 01:39:01.350 align:start position:0%
to
so

01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:04.229 --> 01:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
so having public school students take a
 
01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
test that clearly documents their
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
performance against those those those
 
01:39:12.709 --> 01:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
minimum state standards is um uh is very
 
01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
relevant there but to the degree that
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
that um that
 
01:39:18.719 --> 01:39:19.430 align:start position:0%
that um that
that

01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
about your student
 
01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:21.750 align:start position:0%
about your student
is

01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:24.709 align:start position:0%
is
is

01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:29.109 --> 01:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
is is having their education paid for
 
01:39:32.790 --> 01:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
through through public taxpayer dollars
 
01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:35.679 align:start position:0%
and that and that these taxpayers
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
through their their their
 
01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:40.229 align:start position:0%
through their their their
legislators

01:39:40.229 --> 01:39:40.239 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
01:39:40.239 --> 01:39:41.109 align:start position:0%
legislators
have

01:39:41.109 --> 01:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
have endorsed the
 
01:39:45.189 --> 01:39:45.199 align:start position:0%
state minimum standards
 
01:39:46.709 --> 01:39:46.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't from an accountability
 
01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:50.159 align:start position:0%
standpoint they have a right to know how
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
an efa student is performing
 
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
on a test that's um that that does show
 
01:39:58.470 --> 01:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
their competencies
 
01:39:59.910 --> 01:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
against um you know curriculum that's
 
01:40:04.709 --> 01:40:04.719 align:start position:0%
that's that's in the that follows the
 
01:40:07.109 --> 01:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
the state minimum standards
 
01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
and if the student is
 
01:40:11.830 --> 01:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
you know is being taught some completely
 
01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
different curriculum and therefore does
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
not do well on this test is that really
 
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
a good use of taxpayer money
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
or if they're
 
01:40:22.629 --> 01:40:22.639 align:start position:0%
using a curriculum that goes way above
 
01:40:25.350 --> 01:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
the standards and they ace the the test
 
01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be a good indicator of a
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
good use of of taxpayer money
 
01:40:30.719 --> 01:40:31.910 align:start position:0%
good use of of taxpayer money
um

01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:34.639 align:start position:0%
so so you know so even though that even
 
01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
though the test you're right is directed
 
01:40:40.709 --> 01:40:40.719 align:start position:0%
to to to curriculum that public schools
 
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
are taught may not necessarily match up
 
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
or align with curriculum that's being
 
01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
taught to the efa students um
 
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
you know i think performance
 
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
to that is is a good indicator to
 
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers about how their investment in
 
01:40:57.270 --> 01:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
this program which is now over eight
 
01:41:00.629 --> 01:41:00.639 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year is um is is is
 
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
bearing out and i think that's the
 
01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
intention of of of of uh house bill
 
01:41:09.750 --> 01:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
1115. so then i'll res why take out a
 
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
for example a norm reference test which
 
01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
the state test is it's normed against an
 
01:41:18.310 --> 01:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
original norming test scores whether it
 
01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
be an nce score or
 
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
etcetera or growth scale score of some
 
01:41:25.109 --> 01:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
kind they're comparable between those
 
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
two instruments why then not allow a
 
01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
person to use the iowa test of basic
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
skills or the california achievement
 
01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:33.510 align:start position:0%
skills or the california achievement
test

01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
test
 
01:41:35.910 --> 01:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
or or that but that's been eliminated
 
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
here yeah yeah um
 
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
so so i could see maybe maybe bringing
 
01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
that back
 
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
back in
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh as long as as long as the norm rests
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
nationally standardized norm referenced
 
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
achievement tests
 
01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:52.149 align:start position:0%
achievement tests
um

01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
certainly as long as there were were
 
01:41:55.590 --> 01:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
enough students being measured against
 
01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
that test that it was statistically
 
01:41:57.119 --> 01:41:59.030 align:start position:0%
that test that it was statistically
relevant

01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
relevant
 
01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
nationally um
 
01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
you know i think maybe we've got some
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
common ground on on that well to a
 
01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
degree i'm not there all the way yet
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
because we have kids in this state that
 
01:42:11.669 --> 01:42:11.679 align:start position:0%
do not take the statewide assessment
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
test due to that they may be in a
 
01:42:16.709 --> 01:42:16.719 align:start position:0%
special service group which there's an
 
01:42:19.590 --> 01:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
alternative format of of based on their
 
01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:21.270 align:start position:0%
alternative format of of based on their
ieps

01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
ieps
 
01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
their handicapping condition
 
01:42:27.030 --> 01:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate growth
 
01:42:30.629 --> 01:42:30.639 align:start position:0%
and that's another another instrument
 
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
which we use and uh
 
01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
there's got to be another way of
 
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
measuring growth other than
 
01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
just this one way and i'm an advocate of
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
that i'd like to see this as an
 
01:42:44.229 --> 01:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity for all our regular ad kids
 
01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
as well yeah and and um and
 
01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
does that does that exception process
 
01:42:52.149 --> 01:42:52.159 align:start position:0%
also apply to i mean if it applies to
 
01:42:53.430 --> 01:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
public school students it should
 
01:42:54.870 --> 01:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
certainly apply to
 
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
to students
 
01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
it seems to be a discussion between
 
01:42:59.590 --> 01:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
yourself and i and i apologize but for
 
01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
one it's not a voucher program two that
 
01:43:03.669 --> 01:43:03.679 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to we have to do it in the
 
01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
state simply because in order for us to
 
01:43:08.229 --> 01:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
read receive those millions and millions
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
of dollars annually from the elementary
 
01:43:13.350 --> 01:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
secondary education act now essa we have
 
01:43:15.990 --> 01:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
to have that statewide test we have to
 
01:43:17.350 --> 01:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
have that
 
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
if you were to ask uh this education
 
01:43:22.149 --> 01:43:22.159 align:start position:0%
committee and who sets policy many times
 
01:43:24.629 --> 01:43:24.639 align:start position:0%
we really discussed that i know that
 
01:43:26.229 --> 01:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
representative guile and i were on the
 
01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
same page on this we did not necessarily
 
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
believe that this is the best instrument
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
to be deciding our kids are achieving
 
01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
that's why we put growth in there
 
01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
there's other instruments out there too
 
01:43:40.950 --> 01:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh whether it be the the nape or it be
 
01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
the pisa or whatever that our kids get
 
01:43:46.709 --> 01:43:46.719 align:start position:0%
involved with or the science tests uh so
 
01:43:46.719 --> 01:43:47.910 align:start position:0%
involved with or the science tests uh so
um

01:43:47.910 --> 01:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:49.830 --> 01:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
you know i i think that this whole area
 
01:43:53.189 --> 01:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
right here is that it gets into
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
achievement what's the reason for
 
01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
achievement how do we measure
 
01:43:57.040 --> 01:43:58.310 align:start position:0%
achievement how do we measure
achievement

01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
achievement
 
01:44:00.629 --> 01:44:00.639 align:start position:0%
and you know we know that some of the
 
01:44:02.229 --> 01:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
achievement tests out there are
 
01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
basically in my book
 
01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
worthless the instructor says so much
 
01:44:09.669 --> 01:44:09.679 align:start position:0%
time taken away from teaching in the
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
classroom that they're preparing for
 
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
this thing a month ahead of time
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
and and so i won't go into my tirade
 
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
anymore but uh you know how i feel on
 
01:44:21.669 --> 01:44:21.679 align:start position:0%
this representative porter
 
01:44:23.669 --> 01:44:23.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i apologize for
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
running in and out of the room okay so
 
01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
when the state set up its
 
01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
assessment program
 
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
it was decided that these were the
 
01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:38.709 align:start position:0%
it was decided that these were the
skills

01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:38.719 align:start position:0%
skills
 
01:44:42.390 --> 01:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
and the content area that we wanted
 
01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
our students in new hampshire
 
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
to show that they knew what they were
 
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
able to know and able to do they set up
 
01:44:52.229 --> 01:44:52.239 align:start position:0%
the test because this way because they
 
01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
felt that it was beneficial to new
 
01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire to have new hampshire students
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
show proficiency
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
in these areas
 
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying i agree with it but
 
01:45:05.910 --> 01:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's what it was set up
 
01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
we hear all the time about how lousy
 
01:45:12.149 --> 01:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
certain schools are because they are not
 
01:45:14.709 --> 01:45:14.719 align:start position:0%
meeting the proficiency standard
 
01:45:16.390 --> 01:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
set up by the state
 
01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:17.430 align:start position:0%
set up by the state
tests

01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
tests
 
01:45:19.750 --> 01:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
we hear that when we hear people want to
 
01:45:21.189 --> 01:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
pull their kids out and put them in a
 
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
private school we hear that when people
 
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
say they don't want to move to a
 
01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
community because of their lousy test
 
01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
scores the public schools are held
 
01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:30.470 align:start position:0%
scores the public schools are held
accountable

01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
for their performance on these tests
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:42.229 align:start position:0%
 
if

01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
our schools our public schools are held
 
01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:45.750 align:start position:0%
our schools our public schools are held
accountable

01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
01:45:48.629 --> 01:45:48.639 align:start position:0%
on the results of these tests
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
and we're not making other educational
 
01:45:55.590 --> 01:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity places also show that
 
01:45:57.590 --> 01:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
they're doing this job
 
01:45:59.830 --> 01:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
with the same measurement
 
01:46:01.350 --> 01:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
how are we going to know that the money
 
01:46:03.189 --> 01:46:03.199 align:start position:0%
that we're sending
 
01:46:03.199 --> 01:46:04.470 align:start position:0%
that we're sending
to

01:46:04.470 --> 01:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
private schools or charter schools or
 
01:46:10.390 --> 01:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
home schools or whatever
 
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
are educating the children of the state
 
01:46:15.109 --> 01:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
to the level that the state has
 
01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
determined is beneficial to itself
 
01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
and that's why i think keeping this test
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
in there as a source
 
01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
of evaluation for these programs is
 
01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
vital how else are we going to know are
 
01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
we going to be comparing these apples
 
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
and oranges we've got a school over here
 
01:46:35.430 --> 01:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
that's just using portfolios well that's
 
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
a different way of assessment we've got
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
a school over here that's using the
 
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
gates mcginnity that's a different way
 
01:46:42.629 --> 01:46:42.639 align:start position:0%
of assessment if we're going to be
 
01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
determining how excellent our schools
 
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
are how excellent our teaching is we
 
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
need to be using the same
 
01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:51.669 align:start position:0%
need to be using the same
skill

01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
skill
 
01:46:53.109 --> 01:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
and that's why
 
01:46:56.229 --> 01:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
i think this needs to be in there
 
01:46:57.910 --> 01:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
you know i'm really tired of hearing how
 
01:47:00.550 --> 01:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
lousy the schools are because only 30
 
01:47:03.109 --> 01:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
percent are proficient in math now after
 
01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
the after covert of two years of
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
disruptions well that's according to
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
this test
 
01:47:11.030 --> 01:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
if you don't think this test is valid or
 
01:47:13.189 --> 01:47:13.199 align:start position:0%
an accurate measurement of what a
 
01:47:15.590 --> 01:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
student knows and is able to do
 
01:47:17.590 --> 01:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
why are you bringing it up to make us
 
01:47:19.830 --> 01:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
feel bad about our public schools our
 
01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
are held to such high standards
 
01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
and i just think
 
01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:26.550 align:start position:0%
and i just think
all

01:47:26.550 --> 01:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:28.229 align:start position:0%
all
education

01:47:28.229 --> 01:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
getting public funding should be held to
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
the same high standards
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for now i got my rant in but
 
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
it really makes me angry
 
01:47:39.109 --> 01:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
further representative cordelli and then
 
01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:43.189 align:start position:0%
further representative cordelli and then
representative

01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:44.639 --> 01:47:45.669 align:start position:0%
thank you
getting

01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
back to accountability and
 
01:47:51.910 --> 01:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
if a school is not achieving as uh
 
01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative porter just was
 
01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:54.629 align:start position:0%
representative porter just was
indicating

01:47:54.629 --> 01:47:54.639 align:start position:0%
indicating
 
01:47:58.709 --> 01:47:58.719 align:start position:0%
um and the proficiency levels are not uh
 
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
where they should should be
 
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
then parent
 
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
might leave well they can't leave in
 
01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
most in many cases right unless they
 
01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
have the funds to do so
 
01:48:12.550 --> 01:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
right so people we're talking about in
 
01:48:15.189 --> 01:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
this program don't have that ability now
 
01:48:17.350 --> 01:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
if you want to talk about adding a
 
01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:18.470 align:start position:0%
if you want to talk about adding a
criteria

01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
that um if uh school proficiency levels
 
01:48:23.109 --> 01:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
are below
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
x they would automatically qualify
 
01:48:27.990 --> 01:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
regardless of income for an education
 
01:48:29.590 --> 01:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
freedom accounts then you know then we
 
01:48:30.790 --> 01:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
can talk
 
01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:32.070 align:start position:0%
can talk
but

01:48:32.070 --> 01:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:48:34.149 --> 01:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
the best form i think and we talked
 
01:48:37.109 --> 01:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
about it last week
 
01:48:38.149 --> 01:48:38.159 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
i think i have the floor at the moment
 
01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
if we want to talk about accountability
 
01:48:47.350 --> 01:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
we talked about it last week i think the
 
01:48:49.109 --> 01:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
best form of accountability is parental
 
01:48:49.119 --> 01:48:51.109 align:start position:0%
best form of accountability is parental
accountability

01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
right who knows the children best
 
01:48:56.470 --> 01:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
if and this program and others similar
 
01:48:57.669 --> 01:48:57.679 align:start position:0%
to it and even the tax credit
 
01:48:59.910 --> 01:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
scholarship program if they're not happy
 
01:49:02.229 --> 01:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
with the education option they can
 
01:49:04.629 --> 01:49:04.639 align:start position:0%
select a different odd
 
01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
different education option
 
01:49:07.990 --> 01:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
parental account affiliate
 
01:49:10.629 --> 01:49:10.639 align:start position:0%
accountability is the highest form of
 
01:49:10.639 --> 01:49:13.270 align:start position:0%
accountability is the highest form of
accountability

01:49:13.270 --> 01:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
01:49:15.510 --> 01:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh
 
01:49:16.390 --> 01:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
accountability for public schools is a
 
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
whole separate area that we don't need
 
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
to go on to uh related to this bill but
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
to eliminate
 
01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
a you're
 
01:49:31.589 --> 01:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
putting criteria
 
01:49:34.629 --> 01:49:34.639 align:start position:0%
in terms of assessment on many
 
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
non-public schools
 
01:49:39.510 --> 01:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
that might have efa students and
 
01:49:41.669 --> 01:49:41.679 align:start position:0%
eliminating c
 
01:49:45.189 --> 01:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
eliminates a whole class of
 
01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
people in the program as well
 
01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:49.109 align:start position:0%
people in the program as well
and

01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
i view it as
 
01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
setting the stage
 
01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:54.870 align:start position:0%
setting the stage
for

01:49:54.870 --> 01:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:00.149 --> 01:50:00.159 align:start position:0%
changing criteria in the home education
 
01:50:03.109 --> 01:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
sector as well uh so i am
 
01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
totally against um
 
01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
this bill and totally supportive of the
 
01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
itl motion
 
01:50:11.990 --> 01:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
see who is that represent like us then
 
01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock and
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
rolling around here
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
part of the reason we carefully worded
 
01:50:22.149 --> 01:50:22.159 align:start position:0%
the first one nationally standardized
 
01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:24.320 align:start position:0%
norm referenced achievement test number
 
01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
one is because they're very comparable
 
01:50:28.950 --> 01:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
but number two because that's what the
 
01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
private schools do that's what a number
 
01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
of the private schools do and we didn't
 
01:50:34.629 --> 01:50:34.639 align:start position:0%
want to make kids who are attending
 
01:50:36.310 --> 01:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
private schools take
 
01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0%
have to take multiple tests
 
01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
that way
 
01:50:41.830 --> 01:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
if they take the test at the private
 
01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
school it is comparable and it is
 
01:50:46.149 --> 01:50:46.159 align:start position:0%
compared to a large number of students
 
01:50:47.669 --> 01:50:47.679 align:start position:0%
because those tests that the private
 
01:50:50.550 --> 01:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
schools do are national
 
01:50:52.629 --> 01:50:52.639 align:start position:0%
and they do compare and you can look at
 
01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
how the kids do on this test they take
 
01:50:57.430 --> 01:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
at the private schools and see how
 
01:50:59.910 --> 01:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
they're doing you don't have to compare
 
01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:00.629 align:start position:0%
they're doing you don't have to compare
it

01:51:00.629 --> 01:51:00.639 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:51:03.189 --> 01:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
to the state ones
 
01:51:06.390 --> 01:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
but the other thing is
 
01:51:09.990 --> 01:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639 align:start position:0%
are special needs kids
 
01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
they're not coded their parents
 
01:51:18.790 --> 01:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
are private they believe in privacy they
 
01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
don't want their kid labeled and i've
 
01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
heard this from numerous parents they
 
01:51:26.709 --> 01:51:26.719 align:start position:0%
don't want their kid labeled with a
 
01:51:28.709 --> 01:51:28.719 align:start position:0%
label that's going to continue with them
 
01:51:30.629 --> 01:51:30.639 align:start position:0%
for the rest of their life
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
and if you
 
01:51:34.709 --> 01:51:34.719 align:start position:0%
and if they have to go to a school and
 
01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
prove in order to take the the other
 
01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:39.109 align:start position:0%
prove in order to take the the other
test

01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
test
 
01:51:39.119 --> 01:51:40.149 align:start position:0%
test
that

01:51:40.149 --> 01:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:42.470 --> 01:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
um their special needs and do all of
 
01:51:43.990 --> 01:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
that that's going to be in the record
 
01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's going to be passed down they're
 
01:51:47.910 --> 01:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
going to people are going to have access
 
01:51:50.229 --> 01:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
to it when they go to college people are
 
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
going to have access to it when they're
 
01:51:54.870 --> 01:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
employed sometimes they do not want
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
their kid labeled they do not want their
 
01:51:59.430 --> 01:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
kid coded they know what the issues are
 
01:52:01.109 --> 01:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
they're working with special needs
 
01:52:03.189 --> 01:52:03.199 align:start position:0%
people they're working whether it's
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
dyslexia or whatever
 
01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
those things can make it very difficult
 
01:52:10.470 --> 01:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
to take this statewide student
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
assessment for the same reason that kids
 
01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
who have ieps don't necessarily have to
 
01:52:18.550 --> 01:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
take this they are measured in other
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
ways and that's the point of the
 
01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:22.790 align:start position:0%
ways and that's the point of the
portfolio

01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
portfolio
 
01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
the parents anybody who's looking at it
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
can see that they're improving their
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
learning but they may be
 
01:52:32.629 --> 01:52:32.639 align:start position:0%
excelling in math and just because
 
01:52:35.910 --> 01:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
they're very dyslexic they can't spell
 
01:52:38.790 --> 01:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
they can't write they can read maybe or
 
01:52:40.629 --> 01:52:40.639 align:start position:0%
maybe not and so you're looking for
 
01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
improvement they're working with
 
01:52:44.470 --> 01:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
teachers who specialize in dyslexia
 
01:52:46.950 --> 01:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
for instance and they're improving and
 
01:52:49.510 --> 01:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
and great progress is being made with
 
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
their portfolio you can see that but
 
01:52:54.149 --> 01:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
they may still do horribly on a
 
01:52:57.030 --> 01:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
standardized test because
 
01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's the area they're having trouble
 
01:53:00.310 --> 01:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
with right
 
01:53:02.229 --> 01:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't show how they're
 
01:53:04.709 --> 01:53:04.719 align:start position:0%
excelling accelerating and doing well in
 
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
all these other things and there are
 
01:53:09.990 --> 01:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
colleges they would prefer a portfolio
 
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
to a standardized test there are
 
01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
colleges that would much prefer that
 
01:53:16.709 --> 01:53:16.719 align:start position:0%
because it's a better
 
01:53:19.990 --> 01:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
a better way of showing what a kid is
 
01:53:22.950 --> 01:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
doing what a kid is capable of that's
 
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
why there
 
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:27.910 align:start position:0%
there are
um

01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:30.229 --> 01:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
there are both private and public
 
01:53:32.310 --> 01:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
schools are going to who are going to
 
01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:35.750 align:start position:0%
schools are going to who are going to
portfolios

01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
okay so at any rate the options were
 
01:53:40.709 --> 01:53:40.719 align:start position:0%
there because we have a wide variety of
 
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
students in the program
 
01:53:44.229 --> 01:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
thank you and we want to keep them there
 
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative woodcock
 
01:53:49.750 --> 01:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you channel that um
 
01:53:51.589 --> 01:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
i do want to go back and and reference
 
01:53:51.599 --> 01:53:52.390 align:start position:0%
i do want to go back and and reference
your

01:53:52.390 --> 01:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:53:54.709 --> 01:53:54.719 align:start position:0%
opening uh dialogue when you're talking
 
01:53:56.709 --> 01:53:56.719 align:start position:0%
about the massachusetts
 
01:53:59.030 --> 01:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
capstone project and those in the
 
01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:00.229 align:start position:0%
capstone project and those in the
portfolios

01:54:00.229 --> 01:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
portfolios
 
01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
capstone projects in massachusetts
 
01:54:04.390 --> 01:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
typically accompany
 
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
and not are in lieu of other
 
01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
requirements for graduation there are
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
high school graduation requirement most
 
01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:10.709 align:start position:0%
high school graduation requirement most
schools

01:54:10.709 --> 01:54:10.719 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:54:13.990 --> 01:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
massachusetts has we all know the mcas
 
01:54:15.669 --> 01:54:15.679 align:start position:0%
test which is the standard for
 
01:54:15.679 --> 01:54:17.830 align:start position:0%
test which is the standard for
graduation

01:54:17.830 --> 01:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
graduation
 
01:54:19.830 --> 01:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
and they rang the bell is the standard
 
01:54:21.030 --> 01:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
for graduation so it's all out like
 
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
they're accepting themselves by having a
 
01:54:25.589 --> 01:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
portfolio that is part and parcel of and
 
01:54:27.910 --> 01:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
is separate from the mcas which is an
 
01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
assessment and i understand listening to
 
01:54:31.589 --> 01:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
representative leakers talking about
 
01:54:33.350 --> 01:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
measuring a different way but an
 
01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:34.470 align:start position:0%
measuring a different way but an
assessment

01:54:34.470 --> 01:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
in the cash in a portfolio is different
 
01:54:38.470 --> 01:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
an assessment is where you are at a
 
01:54:40.149 --> 01:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
point in time it's not how you're making
 
01:54:41.669 --> 01:54:41.679 align:start position:0%
progress they're not looking at how
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
you're making progress it's an
 
01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
assessment where are you now at that
 
01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
point in time as compared to everyone
 
01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:47.589 align:start position:0%
point in time as compared to everyone
else

01:54:47.589 --> 01:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:54:49.270 --> 01:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
and we heard the
 
01:54:51.030 --> 01:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner of education sitting here
 
01:54:52.070 --> 01:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
last week
 
01:54:53.430 --> 01:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
and tell us
 
01:54:55.669 --> 01:54:55.679 align:start position:0%
that the school curricula across new
 
01:54:58.070 --> 01:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire needs to be changed he said
 
01:55:00.709 --> 01:55:00.719 align:start position:0%
needs to we need these four key things
 
01:55:02.470 --> 01:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
and he was measuring that on testing
 
01:55:04.229 --> 01:55:04.239 align:start position:0%
measure that on the results of the four
 
01:55:05.830 --> 01:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
tests he named the three testing name
 
01:55:07.510 --> 01:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
that that's his measure
 
01:55:09.189 --> 01:55:09.199 align:start position:0%
i understand that statewide makes it
 
01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
look good we have these three tests and
 
01:55:12.229 --> 01:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
so we'll go back to the old way and take
 
01:55:13.990 --> 01:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
these four subjects of the key area but
 
01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
that's what he's telling us when he says
 
01:55:17.430 --> 01:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
fifty percent of the kids who grew up or
 
01:55:19.510 --> 01:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
knights undergraduated the high school
 
01:55:21.669 --> 01:55:21.679 align:start position:0%
graduates had fifty percent quartile uh
 
01:55:23.589 --> 01:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
that tells us something so he's using
 
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
the statistics he's using the numbers of
 
01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
where we are now you're not looking at
 
01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
progress and that's the same point of
 
01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
this that when you ask for a
 
01:55:32.950 --> 01:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
standardized test for everyone you want
 
01:55:35.589 --> 01:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
to know where they are and that besides
 
01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
transparency and taxpayer money the
 
01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
bottom line is you don't know where are
 
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
they and then you see if they're making
 
01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:41.510 align:start position:0%
they and then you see if they're making
progress

01:55:41.510 --> 01:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
progress
 
01:55:44.149 --> 01:55:44.159 align:start position:0%
the last part and i do uh understand
 
01:55:46.229 --> 01:55:46.239 align:start position:0%
your point uh rick on section a about
 
01:55:48.070 --> 01:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
the comparative testing with a private
 
01:55:51.109 --> 01:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
school but i do take reservation to the
 
01:55:54.310 --> 01:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
the part about the portfolio evaluation
 
01:55:56.070 --> 01:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh when you're telling me that a teacher
 
01:55:57.910 --> 01:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
who works in an arm or someone currently
 
01:55:59.910 --> 01:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
teaching in a non-public school when we
 
01:56:02.070 --> 01:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
know that 50 of the teachers in charter
 
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
school do not need to be certified they
 
01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
can be anyone
 
01:56:07.589 --> 01:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
and we call them a teacher
 
01:56:09.189 --> 01:56:09.199 align:start position:0%
and you take that same piece here if i'm
 
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
teaching in a non in a parochial school
 
01:56:12.870 --> 01:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
you say
 
01:56:14.070 --> 01:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
susan would you come over and help
 
01:56:15.990 --> 01:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
evaluate my my youngster's stuff because
 
01:56:17.589 --> 01:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
you teach in parochial school that
 
01:56:19.109 --> 01:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean she don't squat but she
 
01:56:20.950 --> 01:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
does a lot but it doesn't mean she knows
 
01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
anything so i mean there's not a way to
 
01:56:24.550 --> 01:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
evaluate that i think that's a huge
 
01:56:26.310 --> 01:56:26.320 align:start position:0%
error in this whole pro in this this
 
01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
bill when you go back to that one test
 
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
where are they now that's all they're
 
01:56:32.470 --> 01:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
asking do everyone in the state and we
 
01:56:34.070 --> 01:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
know special ed youngsters have a
 
01:56:35.189 --> 01:56:35.199 align:start position:0%
special exemption and we know that
 
01:56:36.470 --> 01:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
that's been there forever and it needs
 
01:56:37.510 --> 01:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
to be there
 
01:56:39.430 --> 01:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you to know where they
 
01:56:41.109 --> 01:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
are right now you use something like a
 
01:56:43.990 --> 01:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
star test star math star reading
 
01:56:45.589 --> 01:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
that will give you the information
 
01:56:47.589 --> 01:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
throughout the school year this
 
01:56:50.550 --> 01:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
statewide test you give it in the spring
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
you get the results back and if you were
 
01:56:53.990 --> 01:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
here when we heard testimony we'll get
 
01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:56.719 align:start position:0%
the scores back in october well that
 
01:56:58.390 --> 01:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't help the teacher
 
01:57:00.470 --> 01:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
you know the in fact that the the
 
01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
results i won't go there you know where
 
01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
i'm going
 
01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of ways of measuring where
 
01:57:09.350 --> 01:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
a child is
 
01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
and i think we got to be fluid and allow
 
01:57:14.229 --> 01:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
that to occur
 
01:57:16.709 --> 01:57:16.719 align:start position:0%
and we're only giving that that
 
01:57:18.790 --> 01:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
statewide test
 
01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
because the federal government
 
01:57:24.629 --> 01:57:24.639 align:start position:0%
and we did eliminate years going by
 
01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
about eight ten years ago
 
01:57:30.070 --> 01:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
we used to have a requirement where we
 
01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
will test for reading writing arithmetic
 
01:57:35.350 --> 01:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
language arts
 
01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:36.390 align:start position:0%
language arts
science

01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
science
 
01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
and social studies was in it
 
01:57:42.070 --> 01:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
we recognized that wasn't happening
 
01:57:43.990 --> 01:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
science yes that's happening you know
 
01:57:45.750 --> 01:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
out of several grades because of the
 
01:57:49.750 --> 01:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
feds but so now we're not even assessing
 
01:57:52.229 --> 01:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
by way of a test all those subjects
 
01:57:55.109 --> 01:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
which we equate to adequacy
 
01:57:57.510 --> 01:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
i understand but that's exactly what the
 
01:57:58.709 --> 01:57:58.719 align:start position:0%
commission were looking for the other
 
01:58:01.990 --> 01:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
day we went back to the four exactly
 
01:58:03.990 --> 01:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
and the testing so you could get the
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
statewide understanding and get federal
 
01:58:07.750 --> 01:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
dollars i understand what it is that's
 
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying but that's a measurement
 
01:58:10.229 --> 01:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
and there's other ways of getting that
 
01:58:14.070 --> 01:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
measurement data so i i
 
01:58:16.070 --> 01:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
represent a hall
 
01:58:18.229 --> 01:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
let me make it short and sweet
 
01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
everyone has to take the test everyone
 
01:58:23.189 --> 01:58:23.199 align:start position:0%
has to take the test whether whoever you
 
01:58:25.830 --> 01:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
are take the test and i heard we have a
 
01:58:27.910 --> 01:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
wide variety of students
 
01:58:29.589 --> 01:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
in the efas
 
01:58:31.830 --> 01:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
we have a wide variety of students in
 
01:58:33.270 --> 01:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
the public schools
 
01:58:36.310 --> 01:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:58:40.229 --> 01:58:40.239 align:start position:0%
represent cornell this is just i just
 
01:58:41.990 --> 01:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
want to find out some information i know
 
01:58:44.709 --> 01:58:44.719 align:start position:0%
when public schools take the test it's
 
01:58:47.669 --> 01:58:47.679 align:start position:0%
put in the paper it's announced whatever
 
01:58:48.629 --> 01:58:48.639 align:start position:0%
when the
 
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
when the private schools are or whatever
 
01:58:53.910 --> 01:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
take the nationally standardized
 
01:58:55.750 --> 01:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
norm referenced achievement test are
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
those results published like in the
 
01:58:59.990 --> 01:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
union leader or
 
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
anywhere else that is available for
 
01:59:04.149 --> 01:59:04.159 align:start position:0%
people to see how
 
01:59:04.159 --> 01:59:05.109 align:start position:0%
people to see how
their

01:59:05.109 --> 01:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:59:07.350 --> 01:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
children are doing if you if you put
 
01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
like if you talk about like kimball
 
01:59:11.189 --> 01:59:11.199 align:start position:0%
union or holderness or vermont academy
 
01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
or any of those schools they don't have
 
01:59:14.830 --> 01:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
to publish that they won't publish this
 
01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:19.669 --> 01:59:19.679 align:start position:0%
if but if they're getting taxpayer money
 
01:59:21.990 --> 01:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
for their students this is why a school
 
01:59:24.870 --> 01:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
like a vermont academy or a holderness
 
01:59:26.550 --> 01:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
will not take
 
01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
federal dollars they're not going to
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
have those the not rules but the
 
01:59:32.070 --> 01:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
regulations in the federal level govern
 
01:59:34.070 --> 01:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
how they're going to perform so the
 
01:59:36.550 --> 01:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
schools that take federal
 
01:59:38.709 --> 01:59:38.719 align:start position:0%
state tax money if you're going to get
 
01:59:40.149 --> 01:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
it the federal money you're going to
 
01:59:42.070 --> 01:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
give us some kind of uh you know
 
01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:44.639 align:start position:0%
assessment as a result of the elementary
 
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
secondary education act the original and
 
01:59:49.990 --> 01:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
subsequent which would be essa okay
 
01:59:51.510 --> 01:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:59:53.910 --> 01:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
and why do they do that
 
01:59:56.229 --> 01:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
yes federal dollars
 
01:59:56.239 --> 01:59:57.589 align:start position:0%
yes federal dollars
so

01:59:57.589 --> 01:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
it's accountability for use of federal
 
01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:01.990 align:start position:0%
it's accountability for use of federal
dollars

02:00:01.990 --> 02:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:03.510 --> 02:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
yeah we we like to say it's
 
02:00:05.910 --> 02:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
accountability i you know
 
02:00:07.910 --> 02:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
i i don't want to go on that
 
02:00:14.470 --> 02:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:16.709 --> 02:00:16.719 align:start position:0%
one last discussion
 
02:00:18.870 --> 02:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'm i'm old enough to
 
02:00:20.550 --> 02:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
remember before
 
02:00:22.709 --> 02:00:22.719 align:start position:0%
the federal government got involved in
 
02:00:25.589 --> 02:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
our state tests we were giving state
 
02:00:25.599 --> 02:00:26.629 align:start position:0%
our state tests we were giving state
tests

02:00:26.629 --> 02:00:26.639 align:start position:0%
tests
 
02:00:29.430 --> 02:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
back in the 90s before
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
before the no child left behind act
 
02:00:36.709 --> 02:00:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:38.950 --> 02:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
developing test questions in math for
 
02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
the state assessments this was well
 
02:00:43.270 --> 02:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
beyond before the federal government
 
02:00:45.189 --> 02:00:45.199 align:start position:0%
required it
 
02:00:46.390 --> 02:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
remember the found remember the
 
02:00:48.790 --> 02:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
frameworks remember all that that was
 
02:00:50.470 --> 02:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
all going on yeah we had the frameworks
 
02:00:52.709 --> 02:00:52.719 align:start position:0%
we had those guidelines and you can go
 
02:00:54.790 --> 02:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
back another 20 years prior to that and
 
02:00:55.990 --> 02:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
you were giving
 
02:00:58.229 --> 02:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
a norm referenced achievement test they
 
02:01:01.109 --> 02:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
were but they weren't required
 
02:01:03.750 --> 02:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
no and and the state started requiring
 
02:01:05.350 --> 02:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
many and i don't know how many districts
 
02:01:07.589 --> 02:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
were doing it but i know most were
 
02:01:09.030 --> 02:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
giving some kind of achievement to
 
02:01:11.270 --> 02:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
figure out you mentioned gates mcginney
 
02:01:12.629 --> 02:01:12.639 align:start position:0%
that's a test that measures
 
02:01:16.149 --> 02:01:16.159 align:start position:0%
comprehension and vocabulary so my first
 
02:01:18.390 --> 02:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
year teaching in new hampshire
 
02:01:20.310 --> 02:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
in the school i was in we gave a
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
standardized test that the teachers were
 
02:01:24.709 --> 02:01:24.719 align:start position:0%
supposed to correct
 
02:01:28.229 --> 02:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
it never went anywhere it wasn't done we
 
02:01:30.470 --> 02:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
in fact mine sat in the drawer because i
 
02:01:31.830 --> 02:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
was new and i didn't know what i was
 
02:01:33.510 --> 02:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to do with them until it was
 
02:01:35.589 --> 02:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
way past the time so
 
02:01:38.229 --> 02:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
i mean yeah
 
02:01:40.629 --> 02:01:40.639 align:start position:0%
okay let's uh mad clerk would you please
 
02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:46.400 align:start position:0%

02:01:59.510 --> 02:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
account program the motion on the table
 
02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
is itl
 
02:02:03.510 --> 02:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli yes
 
02:02:05.350 --> 02:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
representative litchfield is a yes

moffitt
 
02:02:14.229 --> 02:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
yes represent hobson yes representative
 
02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
ford yes representative soti yes
 
02:02:19.510 --> 02:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
represent nelson
 
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative luno no
 
02:02:24.070 --> 02:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
representative waltz no
 
02:02:26.310 --> 02:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
representative cornell no
 
02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
from tanner no
 
02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
02:02:34.629 --> 02:02:34.639 align:start position:0%
no oh did i say that wrong
 
02:02:37.910 --> 02:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:40.390 --> 02:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
represent mullen no
 
02:02:42.229 --> 02:02:42.239 align:start position:0%

was that porter no
 
02:02:47.910 --> 02:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
reserve hall no and chairman ladd yes
 
02:02:51.270 --> 02:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
so the motion of itl carries 10 to 9.
 
02:02:52.550 --> 02:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
so you're going to have a minority
 
02:02:58.070 --> 02:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:01.440 align:start position:0%

02:03:09.830 --> 02:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
okay being the elementary principal i
 
02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
want everybody to stand up and shrink

and ralph i want you to drink water over
 
02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:17.030 align:start position:0%
and ralph i want you to drink water over
there

02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:03:18.870 --> 02:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:20.470 align:start position:0%
and um
and

02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:03:22.709 --> 02:03:22.719 align:start position:0%
and let's take five minutes and walk the
 
02:03:22.719 --> 02:03:39.669 align:start position:0%
and let's take five minutes and walk the
hallway

02:03:39.669 --> 02:03:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:41.589 --> 02:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
we want to keep these discussions down a
 
02:03:42.709 --> 02:03:42.719 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
02:03:45.669 --> 02:03:45.679 align:start position:0%
because i'm i'm debating whether i have
 
02:03:47.350 --> 02:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
to let people know whether we're going
 
02:03:49.990 --> 02:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
to meet next year
 
02:04:22.870 --> 02:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:48.229 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:04:48.229 --> 02:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:48.239 --> 02:04:54.390 align:start position:0%
 
hcs

02:04:54.390 --> 02:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:25.190 --> 02:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:34.870 --> 02:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:37.030 --> 02:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
yes okay represent four seconds of
 
02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:38.150 align:start position:0%
yes okay represent four seconds of
motion

02:19:38.150 --> 02:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
motion
 
02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:39.589 align:start position:0%
motion
um

02:19:39.589 --> 02:19:39.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:43.110 --> 02:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
being the maker of the motion to itl on
 
02:19:44.950 --> 02:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
1120 uh
 
02:19:46.469 --> 02:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
represent cordelia would you like to
 
02:19:50.469 --> 02:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
speak to the motion uh thank you um
 
02:19:52.870 --> 02:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um
 
02:19:56.150 --> 02:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
i think that this legislation
 
02:19:56.160 --> 02:19:57.030 align:start position:0%
i think that this legislation
um

02:19:57.030 --> 02:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:58.950 --> 02:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
is intended to put
 
02:20:00.870 --> 02:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
restrictions or requirements on
 
02:20:04.870 --> 02:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:04.880 --> 02:20:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:20:08.790 --> 02:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:11.590 --> 02:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for some
 
02:20:15.030 --> 02:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of one year participation
 
02:20:15.040 --> 02:20:18.070 align:start position:0%
in terms of one year participation
um

02:20:18.070 --> 02:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:21.030 --> 02:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
history of academic success
 
02:20:22.550 --> 02:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
02:20:25.349 --> 02:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
for many types of education service
 
02:20:25.359 --> 02:20:26.630 align:start position:0%
for many types of education service
providers

02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
providers
 
02:20:27.670 --> 02:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:20:33.830 --> 02:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:33.840 --> 02:20:35.429 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:20:35.429 --> 02:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:20:37.750 --> 02:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
b also
 
02:20:39.910 --> 02:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of the administrative rules
 
02:20:39.920 --> 02:20:41.830 align:start position:0%
in terms of the administrative rules
requirements

02:20:41.830 --> 02:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:20:46.469 --> 02:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
i think that this goes too far
 
02:20:51.030 --> 02:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
micromanaging if if we want someone to
 
02:20:52.389 --> 02:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
look at
 
02:20:52.399 --> 02:20:54.710 align:start position:0%
look at
things

02:20:54.710 --> 02:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:20:57.429 --> 02:20:57.439 align:start position:0%
such as this in the future the program's
 
02:21:00.710 --> 02:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
only a few months old one two
 
02:21:01.830 --> 02:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
we have an
 
02:21:03.990 --> 02:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
efa oversight committee
 
02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:04.790 align:start position:0%
efa oversight committee
that

02:21:04.790 --> 02:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:21:08.870 --> 02:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
meets on a regular basis and
 
02:21:11.429 --> 02:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
anything in this area i think would be
 
02:21:12.870 --> 02:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
subject to
 
02:21:15.190 --> 02:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
that oversight committee and that would
 
02:21:18.070 --> 02:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
be the place where any adjustments could
 
02:21:20.230 --> 02:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
be made in the future
 
02:21:23.190 --> 02:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
and for those reasons i
 
02:21:30.790 --> 02:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:33.349 --> 02:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
so as the
 
02:21:38.389 --> 02:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of 1120 i just want to
 
02:21:40.630 --> 02:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
make a few statements about the intent
 
02:21:42.630 --> 02:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
of of the bill
 
02:21:42.640 --> 02:21:45.590 align:start position:0%
of of the bill
um

02:21:45.590 --> 02:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:48.469 --> 02:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
generally speaking i am a fairly logical
 
02:21:48.479 --> 02:21:50.150 align:start position:0%
generally speaking i am a fairly logical
person

02:21:50.150 --> 02:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:58.710 --> 02:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
house bill 1120
 
02:22:01.750 --> 02:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
while it is broad in its scope and that
 
02:22:05.670 --> 02:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
it touches upon four different things
 
02:22:08.710 --> 02:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
was born out of the concerns that we
 
02:22:11.429 --> 02:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
have had with a program that came to be
 
02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
so quickly
 
02:22:16.150 --> 02:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
and in a manner that didn't allow for us
 
02:22:18.389 --> 02:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
to individually look at each one of
 
02:22:18.399 --> 02:22:19.990 align:start position:0%
to individually look at each one of
these

02:22:19.990 --> 02:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:22:23.910 --> 02:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
concerns prior to it's being adopted
 
02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:25.190 align:start position:0%
concerns prior to it's being adopted
so

02:22:25.190 --> 02:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:22:28.550 --> 02:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
when house bill 1120 was in fact put
 
02:22:28.560 --> 02:22:29.590 align:start position:0%
when house bill 1120 was in fact put
together

02:22:29.590 --> 02:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
together
 
02:22:31.429 --> 02:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
by me
 
02:22:35.750 --> 02:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
and sent to ols we had some
 
02:22:37.590 --> 02:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
minimal discussion back and forth
 
02:22:40.150 --> 02:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
between myself and ols about the
 
02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:42.469 align:start position:0%
between myself and ols about the
language

02:22:42.469 --> 02:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:22:46.309 --> 02:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill is to primarily
 
02:22:49.990 --> 02:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
look at the safety of students
 
02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
we're talking about health and safety
 
02:22:54.389 --> 02:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
standards codes
 
02:22:54.399 --> 02:22:55.830 align:start position:0%
standards codes
that

02:22:55.830 --> 02:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:22:59.670 --> 02:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
all schools and programs that deal with
 
02:23:01.670 --> 02:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
students have to comply with in the
 
02:23:03.510 --> 02:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
02:23:06.070 --> 02:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking about something near and
 
02:23:09.110 --> 02:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
dear to me and that is background checks
 
02:23:12.630 --> 02:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
for education service providers
 
02:23:15.590 --> 02:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
to assure that our kids are not being
 
02:23:18.469 --> 02:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
put at risk when they are in the company
 
02:23:22.550 --> 02:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
of an unknown uh adult or an adult
 
02:23:25.750 --> 02:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
that is recently known
 
02:23:27.270 --> 02:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh as
 
02:23:30.469 --> 02:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
i understand what has been said by many
 
02:23:33.429 --> 02:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
speakers this morning about rules and
 
02:23:35.510 --> 02:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
laws and gel car
 
02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:39.270 align:start position:0%
laws and gel car
but

02:23:39.270 --> 02:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:42.469 --> 02:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
ols in january answered a jail car
 
02:23:44.389 --> 02:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
inquiry about
 
02:23:47.750 --> 02:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
the background check aspect of this bill
 
02:23:47.760 --> 02:23:48.950 align:start position:0%
the background check aspect of this bill
and

02:23:48.950 --> 02:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:23:52.070 --> 02:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
the inquiry revealed
 
02:23:54.469 --> 02:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
the ols interpretation
 
02:23:56.790 --> 02:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
that the scholarship organization is
 
02:24:00.309 --> 02:24:00.319 align:start position:0%
under no obligation
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
from rsa 193
 
02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:04.469 align:start position:0%
from rsa 193
to

02:24:04.469 --> 02:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:24:07.190 --> 02:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
put together any kind of background
 
02:24:09.190 --> 02:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
check in fact i'll read from you if
 
02:24:11.750 --> 02:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
you'll indulge me for a minute uh one
 
02:24:14.870 --> 02:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
excuse me 194 194f does not grant the
 
02:24:16.950 --> 02:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization the ability to
 
02:24:19.429 --> 02:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
require criminal background checks
 
02:24:21.670 --> 02:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
the rule doesn't actually require the
 
02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization to have the
 
02:24:26.150 --> 02:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
education service providers get criminal
 
02:24:28.950 --> 02:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
background checks rather the rule
 
02:24:31.670 --> 02:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
requires the organization
 
02:24:34.389 --> 02:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
to publish any procedures the service
 
02:24:36.710 --> 02:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
providers happen to use to ensure
 
02:24:39.030 --> 02:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
background checks take place for their
 
02:24:40.630 --> 02:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
providers who have
 
02:24:43.270 --> 02:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
direct access to children the department
 
02:24:45.190 --> 02:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
and its cover letter to the conditional
 
02:24:47.910 --> 02:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
approval request states that the intent
 
02:24:51.190 --> 02:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
of a language is merely to have the
 
02:24:53.750 --> 02:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
providers post their procedures for
 
02:24:57.510 --> 02:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
background checks if they have them
 
02:24:59.670 --> 02:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
to affirmatively require criminal
 
02:25:01.830 --> 02:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
background checks for any provider
 
02:25:04.230 --> 02:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
having contact with children
 
02:25:08.469 --> 02:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
will require further legislation
 
02:25:14.309 --> 02:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
that sentiment uh is again repeated
 
02:25:15.750 --> 02:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
02:25:18.790 --> 02:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
in february that
 
02:25:21.670 --> 02:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
if the the department agrees that if
 
02:25:23.830 --> 02:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks were to be
 
02:25:23.840 --> 02:25:25.110 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks were to be
required

02:25:25.110 --> 02:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
required
 
02:25:30.389 --> 02:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:32.150 --> 02:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
we can sit here and we can debate the
 
02:25:35.590 --> 02:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
merits or lack thereof of any point of
 
02:25:37.270 --> 02:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
the program but the fact of the matter
 
02:25:40.630 --> 02:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
is that efas are here
 
02:25:43.030 --> 02:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
student safety has to be
 
02:25:45.270 --> 02:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
has to be in the forefront and so i
 
02:25:46.870 --> 02:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
would ask you
 
02:25:49.349 --> 02:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
as you're considering this bill
 
02:25:52.790 --> 02:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
to uh think about the
 
02:25:55.190 --> 02:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
safety standards both both from an
 
02:25:57.670 --> 02:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
educational and a physical safety point
 
02:26:01.190 --> 02:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
of view and to consider whether or not
 
02:26:03.670 --> 02:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
this bill ought to in fact move forward
 
02:26:06.230 --> 02:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:07.110 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
further

02:26:07.110 --> 02:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
further
 
02:26:11.910 --> 02:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:15.110 --> 02:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
yes represent like us
 
02:26:17.590 --> 02:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
once upon a time it was apparent it was
 
02:26:19.110 --> 02:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
a parent's job
 
02:26:21.429 --> 02:26:21.439 align:start position:0%
to make sure their children were safe
 
02:26:22.950 --> 02:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
once upon a time we didn't have
 
02:26:24.630 --> 02:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
02:26:26.630 --> 02:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
numerous teachers who've done nasty
 
02:26:28.630 --> 02:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
things in schools passed background
 
02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:30.870 align:start position:0%
things in schools passed background
checks

02:26:30.870 --> 02:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
checks
 
02:26:33.429 --> 02:26:33.439 align:start position:0%
parents still need to be wise
 
02:26:36.870 --> 02:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization
 
02:26:39.910 --> 02:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
has and must have what the procedures
 
02:26:39.920 --> 02:26:40.710 align:start position:0%
has and must have what the procedures
are

02:26:40.710 --> 02:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:26:42.790 --> 02:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
if one of these services
 
02:26:45.030 --> 02:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
providers have any the parents have
 
02:26:47.030 --> 02:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
access to that the parents can then
 
02:26:49.510 --> 02:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
decide oh they don't do background
 
02:26:52.389 --> 02:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
checks i'm not going to choose them or
 
02:26:54.950 --> 02:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
they can decide i'm going to be present
 
02:26:59.110 --> 02:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
with my child anytime my child is there
 
02:27:01.590 --> 02:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
and so i say the people who care most
 
02:27:04.150 --> 02:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
about the protection of the children are
 
02:27:07.030 --> 02:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
the parents and it's not like at a
 
02:27:08.630 --> 02:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
public school where they don't have a
 
02:27:11.830 --> 02:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
choice where it's decided this is the
 
02:27:13.910 --> 02:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
organization you're using you're putting
 
02:27:15.510 --> 02:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
putting your kid on your bus and off
 
02:27:17.030 --> 02:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
they go
 
02:27:19.750 --> 02:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
they are choosing what organization to
 
02:27:24.309 --> 02:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
use how to supervise it all of that so i
 
02:27:26.710 --> 02:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
say let the parents take care of their
 
02:27:28.710 --> 02:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
kids thank you
 
02:27:32.150 --> 02:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:34.309 --> 02:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
represent tanner
 
02:27:36.550 --> 02:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
thank you i was just wondering you know
 
02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:37.510 align:start position:0%
thank you i was just wondering you know
like

02:27:37.510 --> 02:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:27:40.230 --> 02:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
when i go to buy um hamburger at the
 
02:27:40.240 --> 02:27:41.830 align:start position:0%
when i go to buy um hamburger at the
store

02:27:41.830 --> 02:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
store
 
02:27:41.840 --> 02:27:42.710 align:start position:0%
store
um

02:27:42.710 --> 02:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:45.990 --> 02:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
you know i i have a feeling that uh
 
02:27:47.830 --> 02:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
everything's been inspected and things
 
02:27:50.710 --> 02:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
are are okay for me to eat hamburgers
 
02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
kind of can can be pretty dangerous if
 
02:27:55.110 --> 02:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
it isn't uh
 
02:27:57.349 --> 02:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
done in a proper way
 
02:27:59.990 --> 02:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
and i just do that routinely
 
02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:00.950 align:start position:0%
and i just do that routinely
and

02:28:00.950 --> 02:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:28:04.230 --> 02:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering uh how many parents
 
02:28:04.240 --> 02:28:05.750 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering uh how many parents
are

02:28:05.750 --> 02:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing they're they know
 
02:28:10.070 --> 02:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
that when they've sent their kids to
 
02:28:11.349 --> 02:28:11.359 align:start position:0%
public school
 
02:28:13.190 --> 02:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
if they're taking the efa to take their
 
02:28:16.469 --> 02:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
kids out of public school they know
 
02:28:19.349 --> 02:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
reasonably well that the the school has
 
02:28:22.230 --> 02:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
you know has fire extinguishers does you
 
02:28:24.710 --> 02:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
know fire drills
 
02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:25.590 align:start position:0%
know fire drills
have

02:28:25.590 --> 02:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:28:27.670 --> 02:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
minimal safety standards even even our
 
02:28:29.830 --> 02:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
schools that we identify as schools for
 
02:28:31.750 --> 02:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
tuition purposes only
 
02:28:33.830 --> 02:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
have to meet the local health and safety
 
02:28:36.389 --> 02:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
standards and codes
 
02:28:36.399 --> 02:28:37.750 align:start position:0%
standards and codes
and

02:28:37.750 --> 02:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:28:39.910 --> 02:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
and as a parent just how many things can
 
02:28:41.670 --> 02:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
you check that
 
02:28:43.990 --> 02:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
i i think there's a certain thing about
 
02:28:48.389 --> 02:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
being yes a uh an informed consumer
 
02:28:49.830 --> 02:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
but you have to have the information to
 
02:28:51.429 --> 02:28:51.439 align:start position:0%
be an informed consumer and there's
 
02:28:53.110 --> 02:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
another thing about just being a
 
02:28:55.429 --> 02:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
consumer and expecting that
 
02:28:57.990 --> 02:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know life is gonna
 
02:29:00.950 --> 02:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
go on and and take it as it is and
 
02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:02.150 align:start position:0%
go on and and take it as it is and
so

02:29:02.150 --> 02:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:29:04.230 --> 02:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
i really the second part of this i think
 
02:29:06.070 --> 02:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
um you know complying with state and
 
02:29:07.750 --> 02:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
local health and safety standards and
 
02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:08.950 align:start position:0%
local health and safety standards and
codes

02:29:08.950 --> 02:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
codes
 
02:29:12.070 --> 02:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
and also the the background checks as uh
 
02:29:14.550 --> 02:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
representative mullen and i and
 
02:29:16.710 --> 02:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
and attorney fenton have been working on
 
02:29:20.150 --> 02:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
for a long time uh we're very concerned
 
02:29:23.270 --> 02:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
that you know predators now
 
02:29:24.550 --> 02:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
can see
 
02:29:26.950 --> 02:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh you know they they gravitate to
 
02:29:29.190 --> 02:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
programs that are going to be
 
02:29:29.200 --> 02:29:30.870 align:start position:0%
programs that are going to be
providing

02:29:30.870 --> 02:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
providing
 
02:29:33.030 --> 02:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
the kids that they want to
 
02:29:37.030 --> 02:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh prey on and so uh you know that
 
02:29:38.309 --> 02:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
i think it's important that we have
 
02:29:40.389 --> 02:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
these safeguards thank you
 
02:29:42.070 --> 02:29:42.080 align:start position:0%

02:31:51.270 --> 02:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
line five
 
02:31:53.990 --> 02:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
where you have less than or equal to 300
 
02:31:55.110 --> 02:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
percent of the federal poverty
 
02:31:55.120 --> 02:31:56.469 align:start position:0%
percent of the federal poverty
guidelines

02:31:56.469 --> 02:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
02:32:00.309 --> 02:32:00.319 align:start position:0%
as updated annually that's clear
 
02:32:03.830 --> 02:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
now eligibility for the differentiated
 
02:32:05.910 --> 02:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
aid which is
 
02:32:08.389 --> 02:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
you're receiving differentiated aid is
 
02:32:11.429 --> 02:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
not the same as this eligibility for
 
02:32:13.429 --> 02:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:32:15.429 --> 02:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
the 300 percent level
 
02:32:17.590 --> 02:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
if you you can receive differentiated
 
02:32:17.600 --> 02:32:18.790 align:start position:0%
if you you can receive differentiated
aid

02:32:18.790 --> 02:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
aid
 
02:32:20.870 --> 02:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
in various categories
 
02:32:24.150 --> 02:32:24.160 align:start position:0%
such as ell english language learner
 
02:32:26.150 --> 02:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
special education service you get that
 
02:32:28.710 --> 02:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
monies you get the monies if you're on
 
02:32:30.150 --> 02:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
not receiving in the other three
 
02:32:32.710 --> 02:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
categories for remedial reading
 
02:32:35.830 --> 02:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
and then you have free and reduced
 
02:32:37.830 --> 02:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
if you're free and reduced meets the
 
02:32:40.389 --> 02:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
guidelines in the of the application you
 
02:32:43.510 --> 02:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
qualify there if you have an iep you
 
02:32:45.830 --> 02:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
qualify without
 
02:32:48.150 --> 02:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
any income level at all
 
02:32:50.870 --> 02:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
especially it's not related to income
 
02:32:52.550 --> 02:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
and the same thing for english language
 
02:32:54.870 --> 02:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
learner and the same thing is for if you
 
02:32:56.790 --> 02:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
have the remedial reading
 
02:32:56.800 --> 02:32:58.150 align:start position:0%
have the remedial reading
so

02:32:58.150 --> 02:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:32:59.990 --> 02:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose of verifying eligibility to
 
02:33:03.429 --> 02:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:03.439 --> 02:33:04.790 align:start position:0%
 
it's

02:33:04.790 --> 02:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:33:07.190 --> 02:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
you don't have to verify that it's
 
02:33:08.790 --> 02:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
something that is done through
 
02:33:11.510 --> 02:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid and processes within
 
02:33:14.950 --> 02:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
the school which says yes you qualify
 
02:33:18.070 --> 02:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
for that category of differentiated aid
 
02:33:20.389 --> 02:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with eligibility to
 
02:33:23.510 --> 02:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:24.389 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:33:24.389 --> 02:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:33:25.670 --> 02:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
02:33:27.270 --> 02:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
representative ford do you have any
 
02:33:27.280 --> 02:33:30.389 align:start position:0%
representative ford do you have any
comments

02:33:30.389 --> 02:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:32.550 --> 02:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative luno
 
02:33:35.030 --> 02:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and um and
 
02:33:36.870 --> 02:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative ladd
 
02:33:39.349 --> 02:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
i think what you what you laid out there
 
02:33:41.750 --> 02:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
is um is is
 
02:33:41.760 --> 02:33:42.870 align:start position:0%
is um is is
generally

02:33:42.870 --> 02:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
generally
 
02:33:45.830 --> 02:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
is accurate but but i do have a couple
 
02:33:49.670 --> 02:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:52.870 --> 02:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
directed specifically to
 
02:33:55.190 --> 02:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
free and reduced price lunch
 
02:33:57.590 --> 02:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
and i guess the first is
 
02:33:59.190 --> 02:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
how do
 
02:34:04.150 --> 02:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:06.790 --> 02:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
know whether a student is eligible for a
 
02:34:08.790 --> 02:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
free and reduced price lunch on an
 
02:34:10.870 --> 02:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
annual basis and i guess the second part
 
02:34:13.030 --> 02:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
is how do they do that
 
02:34:15.190 --> 02:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
well of course differentiated files the
 
02:34:17.750 --> 02:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
year prior to is where the the monies
 
02:34:19.110 --> 02:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
are allocated through the state in other
 
02:34:21.670 --> 02:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
words it's not in the given year
 
02:34:23.910 --> 02:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
it's based upon monies available from
 
02:34:25.990 --> 02:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
the preceding year
 
02:34:30.309 --> 02:34:30.319 align:start position:0%
and yes um the the department does know
 
02:34:33.030 --> 02:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
students which are receiving services
 
02:34:35.270 --> 02:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
during any given year they have access
 
02:34:37.830 --> 02:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
to that information they can do that by
 
02:34:40.710 --> 02:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
the unique people identifier etc so so a
 
02:34:43.190 --> 02:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up on that so let's say let's say
 
02:34:44.710 --> 02:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
a student has been
 
02:34:46.389 --> 02:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
home schooled
 
02:34:48.070 --> 02:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
for the last
 
02:34:50.070 --> 02:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
picked the number of years
 
02:34:51.270 --> 02:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
six years
 
02:34:53.750 --> 02:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
and um and now the efa program comes
 
02:34:56.710 --> 02:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
into into place
 
02:34:58.630 --> 02:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
the the students just been having lunch
 
02:34:59.910 --> 02:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
at home
 
02:35:03.349 --> 02:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
um uh has no iep
 
02:35:05.510 --> 02:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
how does the scholar or scholarship
 
02:35:07.590 --> 02:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
organization determine or the department
 
02:35:10.630 --> 02:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
determine their their eligibility
 
02:35:10.640 --> 02:35:11.510 align:start position:0%
determine their their eligibility
for

02:35:11.510 --> 02:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:35:13.990 --> 02:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
free and reduce price lunch
 
02:35:16.389 --> 02:35:16.399 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid or frankly special
 
02:35:18.710 --> 02:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
education differentiated aid given the
 
02:35:20.550 --> 02:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
fact that the student as a homeschooler
 
02:35:23.349 --> 02:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
would probably not have an iep
 
02:35:23.359 --> 02:35:24.150 align:start position:0%
would probably not have an iep
and

02:35:24.150 --> 02:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:35:26.710 --> 02:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
and as an efa student would be
 
02:35:31.510 --> 02:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
ineligible uh under for faith under idea
 
02:35:34.469 --> 02:35:34.479 align:start position:0%
um if i could um the scholarship
 
02:35:37.349 --> 02:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
organization uh it's my understanding uh
 
02:35:40.870 --> 02:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
gets uh federal tax returns um annually
 
02:35:44.230 --> 02:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
from um families so that would be used
 
02:35:45.910 --> 02:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
to determine the free and reduced
 
02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:47.670 align:start position:0%
to determine the free and reduced
eligibility

02:35:47.670 --> 02:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
02:35:49.990 --> 02:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
um representative lakes did you have a
 
02:35:52.230 --> 02:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
question comment yeah i was just going
 
02:35:54.710 --> 02:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
to to say that that every year they get
 
02:35:56.550 --> 02:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
all of that and they check it and double
 
02:35:58.870 --> 02:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
check it and they actually have people
 
02:36:01.190 --> 02:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
who specialize in tracking that down and
 
02:36:03.429 --> 02:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
making sure that it's accurate
 
02:36:05.510 --> 02:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
because the organization is not just two
 
02:36:06.950 --> 02:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
people they're part of a national
 
02:36:08.469 --> 02:36:08.479 align:start position:0%
organization and they have lots of
 
02:36:10.790 --> 02:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
people who help with fraud and all kinds
 
02:36:13.190 --> 02:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
of stuff and the other part of it is as
 
02:36:16.230 --> 02:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
far as ieps go they don't get that money
 
02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:17.510 align:start position:0%
far as ieps go they don't get that money
unless

02:36:17.510 --> 02:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
unless
 
02:36:18.950 --> 02:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
you know they have
 
02:36:21.190 --> 02:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
as far as i know they they don't even
 
02:36:23.510 --> 02:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
get that money because they're not you
 
02:36:26.469 --> 02:36:26.479 align:start position:0%
know a public school student
 
02:36:28.309 --> 02:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
um so the
 
02:36:31.670 --> 02:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
the department's own fact sheet actually
 
02:36:34.389 --> 02:36:34.399 align:start position:0%
shows that i think nearly 50 percent
 
02:36:37.349 --> 02:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
of i don't have it in front of me um but
 
02:36:39.429 --> 02:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
that it actually carried the the number
 
02:36:41.990 --> 02:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
of students out of the 1635
 
02:36:44.389 --> 02:36:44.399 align:start position:0%
that were receiving um special education
 
02:36:46.070 --> 02:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid which i think is
 
02:36:48.469 --> 02:36:48.479 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 1800 over on top of
 
02:36:51.429 --> 02:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
base adequacy then those students must
 
02:36:53.190 --> 02:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
have done all of the stuff that they're
 
02:36:55.429 --> 02:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
required to do to do that
 
02:36:57.590 --> 02:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
because they check it all
 
02:37:01.750 --> 02:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
the uh the number as of november 9th was
 
02:37:05.990 --> 02:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
88 who received special education aid
 
02:37:08.150 --> 02:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
0.3 percent
 
02:37:16.230 --> 02:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:19.510 --> 02:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative um
 
02:37:21.590 --> 02:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cordelli
 
02:37:24.870 --> 02:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
um so i have a question um
 
02:37:27.429 --> 02:37:27.439 align:start position:0%
with regards to differentiated aid in
 
02:37:29.670 --> 02:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
general when you're a public school
 
02:37:33.349 --> 02:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
student and you have either ell services
 
02:37:37.110 --> 02:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
or remedial reading services or an iep
 
02:37:39.110 --> 02:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
there are certain criteria that have to
 
02:37:42.230 --> 02:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
be met in order for you to retain those
 
02:37:42.240 --> 02:37:43.750 align:start position:0%
be met in order for you to retain those
services

02:37:43.750 --> 02:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:45.030 align:start position:0%
services
so

02:37:45.030 --> 02:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:37:47.670 --> 02:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
for an iep kids are tested every three
 
02:37:51.750 --> 02:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
years for uh ell services and
 
02:37:57.190 --> 02:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:01.270 --> 02:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
what is what is the the procedure
 
02:38:03.510 --> 02:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
for determining whether or not these
 
02:38:06.630 --> 02:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
students who may have had ell services
 
02:38:08.630 --> 02:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
at the age of eight
 
02:38:12.070 --> 02:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
still need the ell services at the age
 
02:38:14.710 --> 02:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
of 12 or
 
02:38:16.710 --> 02:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
what if somebody you know at one of our
 
02:38:18.950 --> 02:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
proudest moments in a public school is
 
02:38:21.349 --> 02:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
when someone graduates out of special
 
02:38:21.359 --> 02:38:22.630 align:start position:0%
when someone graduates out of special
education

02:38:22.630 --> 02:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:24.389 align:start position:0%
education
so

02:38:24.389 --> 02:38:24.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:38:26.790 --> 02:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
how how do we determine whether or not
 
02:38:29.670 --> 02:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
these students are still in need of
 
02:38:31.670 --> 02:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
services and
 
02:38:34.070 --> 02:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not that makes them
 
02:38:40.389 --> 02:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:40.399 --> 02:38:41.270 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:38:41.270 --> 02:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:38:43.349 --> 02:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
to clarify one thing the
 
02:38:45.030 --> 02:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
the remedial reading is only done at
 
02:38:46.630 --> 02:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
third grade
 
02:38:48.630 --> 02:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
if in fact you don't receive other
 
02:38:50.630 --> 02:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid
 
02:38:53.670 --> 02:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
so is the differentiated aid for reading
 
02:38:56.389 --> 02:38:56.399 align:start position:0%
only given the when the student is in
 
02:38:58.710 --> 02:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
whatever fourth grade if they don't if
 
02:39:00.550 --> 02:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
they're not ell
 
02:39:02.870 --> 02:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
if they're not free and reduced
 
02:39:05.030 --> 02:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
and they don't have a special ed iep
 
02:39:06.870 --> 02:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
they're not special ed
 
02:39:09.190 --> 02:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
but they are remedial
 
02:39:11.510 --> 02:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
they will get this one-time dose of
 
02:39:13.590 --> 02:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
funds it's a little over 700 bucks
 
02:39:16.230 --> 02:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
they're about 700 800 bucks one time
 
02:39:18.550 --> 02:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
only as a third grader
 
02:39:20.309 --> 02:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
they will not get it again in the fourth
 
02:39:21.990 --> 02:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
grade all right thank you for that
 
02:39:24.790 --> 02:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
clarification so that clarifies that one
 
02:39:29.429 --> 02:39:29.439 align:start position:0%
now in order to receive a money in terms
 
02:39:31.349 --> 02:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
of special education you have to have an
 
02:39:31.359 --> 02:39:32.950 align:start position:0%
of special education you have to have an
active

02:39:32.950 --> 02:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
active
 
02:39:32.960 --> 02:39:34.870 align:start position:0%
active
iep

02:39:34.870 --> 02:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
iep
 
02:39:37.270 --> 02:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
ieps you know that every year they're
 
02:39:38.950 --> 02:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
looked at there's an annual but there's
 
02:39:41.510 --> 02:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
also a three-year review a huge review
 
02:39:43.110 --> 02:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
where you determine whether the
 
02:39:45.990 --> 02:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
handicapping condition is
 
02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:46.950 align:start position:0%
handicapping condition is
correct

02:39:46.950 --> 02:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:39:48.950 --> 02:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
needs change or whatever
 
02:39:51.270 --> 02:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
so that process would have to so you'd
 
02:39:54.710 --> 02:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
have to have a current active iep to
 
02:39:57.110 --> 02:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
receive that differentiate that's known
 
02:40:00.550 --> 02:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
through the department of education
 
02:40:02.309 --> 02:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
see the english language learner is very
 
02:40:02.319 --> 02:40:03.830 align:start position:0%
see the english language learner is very
similar

02:40:03.830 --> 02:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
similar
 
02:40:05.670 --> 02:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
they have that that is there's a
 
02:40:07.190 --> 02:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
director over there also that's in
 
02:40:08.630 --> 02:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
charge of that program which would have
 
02:40:10.550 --> 02:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
that information
 
02:40:13.750 --> 02:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
you're welcome uh representative porter
 
02:40:17.349 --> 02:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
so does that mean that um
 
02:40:18.950 --> 02:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
in this bill they're
 
02:40:21.110 --> 02:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
they're asking
 
02:40:23.349 --> 02:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
that those eligibility
 
02:40:23.359 --> 02:40:24.870 align:start position:0%
that those eligibility
um

02:40:24.870 --> 02:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:26.630 --> 02:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
the eligibility
 
02:40:29.910 --> 02:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
be reviewed every year
 
02:40:32.230 --> 02:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
and you don't like that in this bill
 
02:40:32.240 --> 02:40:33.670 align:start position:0%
and you don't like that in this bill
because

02:40:33.670 --> 02:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
the department already does that is that
 
02:40:38.230 --> 02:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
02:40:40.230 --> 02:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
eligibility for differentiated is done
 
02:40:42.630 --> 02:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
annually yes and that's not but but and
 
02:40:45.110 --> 02:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
and getting into the efa program has
 
02:40:47.269 --> 02:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with differentiated a
 
02:40:48.950 --> 02:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
yes but the amount of money that's
 
02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:50.710 align:start position:0%
yes but the amount of money that's
received

02:40:50.710 --> 02:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
received
 
02:40:53.590 --> 02:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:56.389 --> 02:40:56.399 align:start position:0%
scholarship does is determined by
 
02:40:58.230 --> 02:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
differentiation yes and you will get
 
02:41:01.269 --> 02:41:01.279 align:start position:0%
that base adequacy amount
 
02:41:03.510 --> 02:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
and when and this is why when the
 
02:41:05.750 --> 02:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization has this they
 
02:41:08.230 --> 02:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
notify doe it takes a while for them to
 
02:41:10.950 --> 02:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
go through and compute over there
 
02:41:12.630 --> 02:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
the eligibility status in these
 
02:41:14.710 --> 02:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid areas that is then
 
02:41:18.230 --> 02:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
tacked on to the yeah
 
02:41:19.750 --> 02:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
it comes out on average by the state
 
02:41:21.990 --> 02:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
around 4 600 for the whole nine yards
 
02:41:23.830 --> 02:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
02:41:25.590 --> 02:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't you do that every year
 
02:41:28.150 --> 02:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
which is what this bill is asking for
 
02:41:31.349 --> 02:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
i i they they do that what they what
 
02:41:33.190 --> 02:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
they what this bill is saying that
 
02:41:34.710 --> 02:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
there's been a confusion though with
 
02:41:36.950 --> 02:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
eligibility getting into the program
 
02:41:38.630 --> 02:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
that 300
 
02:41:38.640 --> 02:41:39.830 align:start position:0%
that 300
level

02:41:39.830 --> 02:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:41:42.630 --> 02:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
that that is done once yes
 
02:41:44.389 --> 02:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's a confusion there
 
02:41:46.630 --> 02:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying is i i understood this
 
02:41:48.790 --> 02:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
bill and the purpose of this bill was so
 
02:41:48.800 --> 02:41:50.150 align:start position:0%
bill and the purpose of this bill was so
that

02:41:50.150 --> 02:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:41:53.269 --> 02:41:53.279 align:start position:0%
that differentiated aid amount could be
 
02:41:56.309 --> 02:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
adjusted each year depending on the
 
02:41:59.590 --> 02:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
status of the student each year they're
 
02:42:01.269 --> 02:42:01.279 align:start position:0%
not talking about
 
02:42:03.349 --> 02:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
this this bill is not talking about
 
02:42:06.150 --> 02:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
reviewing the um
 
02:42:08.469 --> 02:42:08.479 align:start position:0%
income of the family every year they're
 
02:42:09.670 --> 02:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
talking about looking at the
 
02:42:11.670 --> 02:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid
 
02:42:14.550 --> 02:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
amount that the state is contributing to
 
02:42:18.389 --> 02:42:18.399 align:start position:0%
the scholarship every year so if
 
02:42:22.550 --> 02:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
you know the first year i i'm an esl
 
02:42:25.110 --> 02:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
ell language learner
 
02:42:27.190 --> 02:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
and by the third year i'm no longer
 
02:42:29.429 --> 02:42:29.439 align:start position:0%
getting that you know to have that if
 
02:42:32.630 --> 02:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
it's not checked every year how will
 
02:42:35.110 --> 02:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
the state know
 
02:42:37.190 --> 02:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
to reduce the payment
 
02:42:39.349 --> 02:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh if i might elsewhere in the
 
02:42:39.359 --> 02:42:40.710 align:start position:0%
uh if i might elsewhere in the
legislation

02:42:40.710 --> 02:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:42:43.830 --> 02:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
it requires determination
 
02:42:46.230 --> 02:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
between the scholarship organization and
 
02:42:49.750 --> 02:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
the department of any eligibility for
 
02:42:51.670 --> 02:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid
 
02:42:53.269 --> 02:42:53.279 align:start position:0%
say that again please representative i'm
 
02:42:55.510 --> 02:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
sorry if i i can read it to you the
 
02:42:57.349 --> 02:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization shall in
 
02:42:59.110 --> 02:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
cooperation with the department
 
02:43:01.429 --> 02:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
determine eligibility for differentiated
 
02:43:04.230 --> 02:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
aid subject to any applicable state and
 
02:43:07.269 --> 02:43:07.279 align:start position:0%
federal laws does it say every year
 
02:43:09.269 --> 02:43:09.279 align:start position:0%
well i think that's
 
02:43:11.910 --> 02:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
by definition how differentiated aid is
 
02:43:14.230 --> 02:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
determined for any student
 
02:43:16.309 --> 02:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
whether they're in the public school or
 
02:43:17.910 --> 02:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
in an efa
 
02:43:17.920 --> 02:43:21.030 align:start position:0%
in an efa
program

02:43:21.030 --> 02:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:22.950 --> 02:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
represent tanner
 
02:43:24.950 --> 02:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you just
 
02:43:27.510 --> 02:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
because i'm confused at this point
 
02:43:30.230 --> 02:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
if someone qualifies for
 
02:43:31.830 --> 02:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
an efa
 
02:43:34.469 --> 02:43:34.479 align:start position:0%
and they get an amount
 
02:43:37.510 --> 02:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
that includes differentiated aid
 
02:43:39.910 --> 02:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
are they guaranteed that amount
 
02:43:41.750 --> 02:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
throughout the rest of the time that
 
02:43:44.550 --> 02:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
they are on uh the educational freedom
 
02:43:44.560 --> 02:43:45.670 align:start position:0%
they are on uh the educational freedom
account

02:43:45.670 --> 02:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
account
 
02:43:48.150 --> 02:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
no no
 
02:43:51.429 --> 02:43:51.439 align:start position:0%
uh representative lagus
 
02:43:54.230 --> 02:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
yes the information i just got was that
 
02:43:57.830 --> 02:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
the doe has frl ell and third grade data
 
02:44:02.309 --> 02:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
internally attached to the kids sas id
 
02:44:04.790 --> 02:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization verifies
 
02:44:07.269 --> 02:44:07.279 align:start position:0%
ell on their end also
 
02:44:09.590 --> 02:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
parents give them an ell letter from
 
02:44:11.670 --> 02:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
public school determination
 
02:44:14.550 --> 02:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
public schools have an ell test
 
02:44:18.150 --> 02:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
doe knows who these kids are are ready
 
02:44:20.950 --> 02:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
and for the different as for the money
 
02:44:23.830 --> 02:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
aspect of it as i said they get
 
02:44:29.429 --> 02:44:29.439 align:start position:0%
every single year they get that year's
 
02:44:29.439 --> 02:44:30.389 align:start position:0%
every single year they get that year's
federal

02:44:30.389 --> 02:44:30.399 align:start position:0%
federal
 
02:44:30.399 --> 02:44:31.670 align:start position:0%
federal
tax

02:44:31.670 --> 02:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
tax
 
02:44:33.830 --> 02:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
return you know
 
02:44:36.710 --> 02:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
federal tax information and so every
 
02:44:36.720 --> 02:44:37.590 align:start position:0%
federal tax information and so every
year

02:44:37.590 --> 02:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:44:39.750 --> 02:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
what the child deserves as far as free
 
02:44:41.590 --> 02:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch that kind of stuff is
 
02:44:43.590 --> 02:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
done every year
 
02:44:47.269 --> 02:44:47.279 align:start position:0%
and then as as as glenn was saying if
 
02:44:50.389 --> 02:44:50.399 align:start position:0%
they have a iep and it's active that
 
02:44:52.150 --> 02:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
would be the only way that's why there
 
02:44:54.710 --> 02:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
are lots of parents in the program who
 
02:44:56.710 --> 02:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
have kids with special needs and don't
 
02:44:59.269 --> 02:44:59.279 align:start position:0%
get special needs money because they
 
02:45:01.670 --> 02:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
don't have an active iep like homeschool
 
02:45:03.830 --> 02:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
kids wouldn't somebody just coming from
 
02:45:06.070 --> 02:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
a public school would so all this stuff
 
02:45:08.630 --> 02:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
that's in here it's already done
 
02:45:10.710 --> 02:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
it's done now it's been being done the
 
02:45:12.630 --> 02:45:12.640 align:start position:0%

02:47:01.590 --> 02:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
i would second that so we have a motion
 
02:47:03.190 --> 02:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
made by representative cordelli seconded
 
02:47:05.670 --> 02:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
by representative moffett itl is the
 
02:47:07.590 --> 02:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
motion uh representative cordelli would
 
02:47:10.150 --> 02:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion
 
02:47:11.750 --> 02:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
02:47:11.760 --> 02:47:13.510 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
um

02:47:13.510 --> 02:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:15.750 --> 02:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
i would basically uh
 
02:47:18.550 --> 02:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
repeat i think what i said during the
 
02:47:19.670 --> 02:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
the green
 
02:47:21.429 --> 02:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
and that
 
02:47:25.590 --> 02:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
this language is uh comparable
 
02:47:27.429 --> 02:47:27.439 align:start position:0%
the language in statute now is
 
02:47:30.230 --> 02:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
comparable to every existing education
 
02:47:33.510 --> 02:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
savings account program in the nation
 
02:47:38.070 --> 02:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
um and uh to uh the best of my knowledge
 
02:47:42.070 --> 02:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
as of uh about a month ago um
 
02:47:44.550 --> 02:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
the and the checking that i did uh
 
02:47:48.389 --> 02:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
nobody has been taxed on this uh
 
02:47:49.670 --> 02:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
this funding
 
02:47:53.670 --> 02:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
so i do not believe there is any need to
 
02:47:56.630 --> 02:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
to change the language
 
02:47:58.630 --> 02:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative do you
 
02:48:00.070 --> 02:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
have any thaad
 
02:48:02.389 --> 02:48:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh what representative cordelli said
 
02:48:03.670 --> 02:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:48:05.990 --> 02:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
up to the represent luna
 
02:48:08.950 --> 02:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and um
 
02:48:11.349 --> 02:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
and representative cordelia i appreciate
 
02:48:12.950 --> 02:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
knowing that um
 
02:48:14.070 --> 02:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
that other
 
02:48:17.110 --> 02:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
other states with um with with with
 
02:48:19.030 --> 02:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
education savings account with these
 
02:48:20.870 --> 02:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
programs in place
 
02:48:22.950 --> 02:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
use this language but how many of those
 
02:48:25.750 --> 02:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
states have their own um state income
 
02:48:25.760 --> 02:48:28.870 align:start position:0%
states have their own um state income
tax

02:48:28.870 --> 02:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:31.590 --> 02:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh several uh right right so in that
 
02:48:35.429 --> 02:48:35.439 align:start position:0%
case state law could be exempting um uh
 
02:48:38.230 --> 02:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
efa payments from state income tax
 
02:48:40.630 --> 02:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
that's within the purview of the state
 
02:48:42.389 --> 02:48:42.399 align:start position:0%
but we're not in that situation here in
 
02:48:43.830 --> 02:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we don't have a state
 
02:48:47.030 --> 02:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
income tax and to say this here
 
02:48:49.510 --> 02:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
would lead one to believe
 
02:48:52.150 --> 02:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
that they have no federal tax liability
 
02:48:54.550 --> 02:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
incurred on a payment that was uh that
 
02:48:58.389 --> 02:48:58.399 align:start position:0%
was made at a parent's direction
 
02:48:59.830 --> 02:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
and you're it was made through a
 
02:49:02.230 --> 02:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization but directed
 
02:49:04.710 --> 02:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
based on a parent's decision not based
 
02:49:08.710 --> 02:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
on the state's decision to fund a um
 
02:49:10.790 --> 02:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
a school district with an adequacy
 
02:49:12.710 --> 02:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
payment so
 
02:49:16.550 --> 02:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
i do have um um uh opinions verbal
 
02:49:19.670 --> 02:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
opinions from uh from uh new hampshire
 
02:49:23.910 --> 02:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
tax experts uh as to that that leading
 
02:49:26.150 --> 02:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
people to believe this would be
 
02:49:28.550 --> 02:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
incorrect certainly unethical
 
02:49:31.670 --> 02:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
and and then and then of course from a
 
02:49:33.190 --> 02:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
from a federal now we're talking from
 
02:49:34.710 --> 02:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire standpoint
 
02:49:37.349 --> 02:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
federal tax liability you really have to
 
02:49:38.710 --> 02:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
wonder why
 
02:49:38.720 --> 02:49:41.510 align:start position:0%
wonder why
um

02:49:41.510 --> 02:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:44.710 --> 02:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
senator cruz has has introduced now
 
02:49:46.150 --> 02:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
three times
 
02:49:49.910 --> 02:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
in um in the us senate uh bills to uh to
 
02:49:49.920 --> 02:49:51.030 align:start position:0%
in um in the us senate uh bills to uh to
make

02:49:51.030 --> 02:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
make
 
02:49:53.190 --> 02:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
distributions under free it's called the
 
02:49:54.630 --> 02:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
education freedom scholarship and
 
02:49:56.070 --> 02:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity act
 
02:49:59.670 --> 02:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh distributions made under under such
 
02:50:02.309 --> 02:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
programs it states free from federal tax
 
02:50:05.030 --> 02:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
liabilities and this bill has failed
 
02:50:06.389 --> 02:50:06.399 align:start position:0%
every time
 
02:50:06.399 --> 02:50:07.349 align:start position:0%
every time
so

02:50:07.349 --> 02:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:50:09.269 --> 02:50:09.279 align:start position:0%
so i think there's something out there
 
02:50:12.309 --> 02:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
um um may not know it for sure i don't
 
02:50:14.870 --> 02:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
know why we lead people to believe that
 
02:50:18.230 --> 02:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh that they would not have a uh
 
02:50:21.670 --> 02:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
potential for a um for a tax liability
 
02:50:25.590 --> 02:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
the the language in in 194 f
 
02:50:28.230 --> 02:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they
 
02:50:29.910 --> 02:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
don't have a federal tax liability and
 
02:50:31.190 --> 02:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean that they do have a
 
02:50:32.950 --> 02:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
federal tax liability but it's certainly
 
02:50:35.750 --> 02:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
misleading and that's the only reason
 
02:50:39.269 --> 02:50:39.279 align:start position:0%
why 1283 exists is just to
 
02:50:41.110 --> 02:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're not misleading
 
02:50:42.950 --> 02:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
granite staters but i could certainly
 
02:50:45.349 --> 02:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
see you might want to have a a warning
 
02:50:48.070 --> 02:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
label on the the voucher program saying
 
02:50:50.150 --> 02:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
distribution warning distributions may
 
02:50:53.269 --> 02:50:53.279 align:start position:0%
be taxable so thanks
 
02:50:55.830 --> 02:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
okay i i've got a question
 
02:50:57.670 --> 02:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
where's the the pell grants on the
 
02:50:59.190 --> 02:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
federal level
 
02:51:02.070 --> 02:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
have certain qualified expenses which
 
02:51:05.190 --> 02:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
are tax-exempt i.e textbooks fees
 
02:51:08.550 --> 02:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
tuition computer technology etc computer
 
02:51:11.269 --> 02:51:11.279 align:start position:0%
technology is not actually deductible
 
02:51:11.279 --> 02:51:12.309 align:start position:0%
technology is not actually deductible
well

02:51:12.309 --> 02:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:51:14.230 --> 02:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
people might be deducting i think a lot
 
02:51:16.230 --> 02:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
of people are doing that now seeing
 
02:51:17.910 --> 02:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
that's treated the same way as a
 
02:51:20.790 --> 02:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
textbook for many people now so but
 
02:51:20.800 --> 02:51:21.510 align:start position:0%
textbook for many people now so but
but

02:51:21.510 --> 02:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:51:23.349 --> 02:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
subtract that out of it then there's
 
02:51:23.359 --> 02:51:24.230 align:start position:0%
subtract that out of it then there's
other

02:51:24.230 --> 02:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:51:26.950 --> 02:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
aspects to that which are are
 
02:51:29.830 --> 02:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
tax uh exempt uh
 
02:51:31.670 --> 02:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
in relation to the pell grants now if
 
02:51:33.590 --> 02:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
that happens for the
 
02:51:37.190 --> 02:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
higher education why then would it not
 
02:51:39.830 --> 02:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
occur for
 
02:51:44.230 --> 02:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
k-12 yeah so um so thanks very much for
 
02:51:47.910 --> 02:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
for the question and i'm trying to find
 
02:51:50.469 --> 02:51:50.479 align:start position:0%
the irs bolton but it's called irs
 
02:51:52.950 --> 02:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
bulletin 970.
 
02:51:56.710 --> 02:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:58.790 --> 02:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
and uh and it says tax benefits for
 
02:52:01.830 --> 02:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
education i've got the 2020 uh verge
 
02:52:04.630 --> 02:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
version right here publication 970 and
 
02:52:07.590 --> 02:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
it goes through each of the um the the
 
02:52:09.670 --> 02:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
things which are considered taxable or
 
02:52:14.870 --> 02:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
non-taxable under under uh irs
 
02:52:16.309 --> 02:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
by the irs
 
02:52:16.319 --> 02:52:17.830 align:start position:0%
by the irs
and

02:52:17.830 --> 02:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:52:19.750 --> 02:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
and it uh
 
02:52:21.990 --> 02:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
it does talk about uh
 
02:52:24.389 --> 02:52:24.399 align:start position:0%
education savings accounts so if we go
 
02:52:28.469 --> 02:52:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:28.479 --> 02:52:30.469 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:52:30.469 --> 02:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:52:33.429 --> 02:52:33.439 align:start position:0%
and it says esa's at a glance uh what
 
02:52:36.150 --> 02:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
are you are you talking to 529's no i'm
 
02:52:38.070 --> 02:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
i'm no i'm not talking 529 so i'm
 
02:52:41.269 --> 02:52:41.279 align:start position:0%
talking about education savings accounts
 
02:52:41.279 --> 02:52:42.710 align:start position:0%
talking about education savings accounts
and

02:52:42.710 --> 02:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:52:42.720 --> 02:52:43.750 align:start position:0%
and
and

02:52:43.750 --> 02:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:52:46.389 --> 02:52:46.399 align:start position:0%
let's see and it's it's interesting here
 
02:52:50.870 --> 02:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
because it does say that that certain um
 
02:52:53.750 --> 02:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
expenses like qualified education
 
02:52:56.150 --> 02:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
expenses generally these are expenses
 
02:52:58.070 --> 02:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
required for the enrollment
 
02:52:59.590 --> 02:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
or attendance
 
02:53:01.670 --> 02:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
of the designated beneficiary at an
 
02:53:04.550 --> 02:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
eligible educational institution so
 
02:53:07.190 --> 02:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
eligible education institution
 
02:53:08.790 --> 02:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
the expense
 
02:53:10.630 --> 02:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
can be either qualified higher education
 
02:53:12.710 --> 02:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
expenses or qualified elementary and
 
02:53:15.750 --> 02:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
secondary education expenses and then
 
02:53:17.429 --> 02:53:17.439 align:start position:0%
when you look at
 
02:53:20.230 --> 02:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
qualified eligible institutions an
 
02:53:22.630 --> 02:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
eligible institution an eligible
 
02:53:25.110 --> 02:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
educational institution can be either an
 
02:53:27.670 --> 02:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
eligible post-secondary school or an
 
02:53:30.710 --> 02:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
eligible elementary or secondary school
 
02:53:32.950 --> 02:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
so there's lots of things
 
02:53:37.510 --> 02:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:39.030 --> 02:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
the definition
 
02:53:42.790 --> 02:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
of of uh of elementary or secondary
 
02:53:42.800 --> 02:53:43.910 align:start position:0%
of of uh of elementary or secondary
schools

02:53:43.910 --> 02:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:53:45.910 --> 02:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
and um and at least according to
 
02:53:45.920 --> 02:53:47.510 align:start position:0%
and um and at least according to
publication

02:53:47.510 --> 02:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
publication
 
02:53:47.520 --> 02:53:49.269 align:start position:0%
publication
970

02:53:49.269 --> 02:53:49.279 align:start position:0%
970
 
02:53:51.269 --> 02:53:51.279 align:start position:0%
uh those would not be
 
02:53:51.279 --> 02:53:53.590 align:start position:0%
uh those would not be
um

02:53:53.590 --> 02:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:57.429 --> 02:53:57.439 align:start position:0%
tax deductible expenses and so so i
 
02:54:00.389 --> 02:54:00.399 align:start position:0%
think there's there's a clear murkiness
 
02:54:03.349 --> 02:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
to to what what can be deducted and what
 
02:54:05.510 --> 02:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
can't be deducted and i just wouldn't
 
02:54:09.510 --> 02:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
want um the program to be misleading um
 
02:54:12.150 --> 02:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
of efa students and their families
 
02:54:14.630 --> 02:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
that uh that these distributions are tax
 
02:54:17.830 --> 02:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
deductible uh they might you know if we
 
02:54:20.630 --> 02:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
had a state tax we could you could make
 
02:54:23.269 --> 02:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
a deductible from new hampshire taxes
 
02:54:24.389 --> 02:54:24.399 align:start position:0%
but we really don't have that
 
02:54:26.309 --> 02:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction when it comes to federal
 
02:54:28.309 --> 02:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
tax and this is just a transparency
 
02:54:28.319 --> 02:54:30.630 align:start position:0%
tax and this is just a transparency
thing

02:54:30.630 --> 02:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:32.150 --> 02:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
further further discussion
 
02:54:32.160 --> 02:54:33.990 align:start position:0%
further further discussion
representatives

02:54:33.990 --> 02:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
02:54:36.150 --> 02:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
can you read that first section again
 
02:54:38.630 --> 02:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
because my understanding of what you
 
02:54:43.429 --> 02:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
said was it is for the things necessary
 
02:54:43.439 --> 02:54:44.230 align:start position:0%
said was it is for the things necessary
for

02:54:44.230 --> 02:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:54:46.389 --> 02:54:46.399 align:start position:0%
taking part in those programs and then
 
02:54:48.790 --> 02:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
the second part was those programs and
 
02:54:50.710 --> 02:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the things necessary be all
 
02:54:53.190 --> 02:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
those things like computers and papers
 
02:54:55.030 --> 02:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
and pencils and books and all that kind
 
02:54:56.550 --> 02:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
of stuff
 
02:54:58.710 --> 02:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
so i didn't get into into that you can
 
02:55:01.190 --> 02:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
take a look at the pel section
 
02:55:03.590 --> 02:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
on here which excludes certain materials
 
02:55:04.950 --> 02:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
like computers
 
02:55:08.469 --> 02:55:08.479 align:start position:0%
um uh but the i mean the whole bulletin
 
02:55:08.479 --> 02:55:09.510 align:start position:0%
um uh but the i mean the whole bulletin
is

02:55:09.510 --> 02:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:55:11.510 --> 02:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
95 pages long
 
02:55:11.520 --> 02:55:12.469 align:start position:0%
95 pages long
so

02:55:12.469 --> 02:55:12.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:55:14.469 --> 02:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
you know i'm and i'm not an expert on
 
02:55:17.429 --> 02:55:17.439 align:start position:0%
the bulletin i just looked at the
 
02:55:19.990 --> 02:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
the part that that talked about uh
 
02:55:22.150 --> 02:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
education savings account and i think it
 
02:55:25.910 --> 02:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
raised enough questions in my mind to uh
 
02:55:29.349 --> 02:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
and and to to to a tax attorney's mind
 
02:55:29.359 --> 02:55:30.469 align:start position:0%
and and to to to a tax attorney's mind
um

02:55:30.469 --> 02:55:30.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:32.070 --> 02:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
that that said you know what you might
 
02:55:36.550 --> 02:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
want to revisit this line in 194 f
 
02:55:39.510 --> 02:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
and and just not mislead people i mean
 
02:55:41.830 --> 02:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
taking leaving leaving it in doesn't
 
02:55:44.389 --> 02:55:44.399 align:start position:0%
change anybody's so killing this bill
 
02:55:46.630 --> 02:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't change anybody's tax liability
 
02:55:48.389 --> 02:55:48.399 align:start position:0%
passing this bill doesn't change
 
02:55:51.670 --> 02:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
anybody's tax liability um it's just a
 
02:55:54.309 --> 02:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
transparency issue just try not to
 
02:55:57.429 --> 02:55:57.439 align:start position:0%
mislead people um but but you know and
 
02:55:59.269 --> 02:55:59.279 align:start position:0%
i'm not asking for everybody to weigh in
 
02:56:01.750 --> 02:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
on this people can do whatever they want
 
02:56:03.910 --> 02:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh on it and um
 
02:56:05.110 --> 02:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
but i think it's pretty straightforward
 
02:56:08.389 --> 02:56:08.399 align:start position:0%
thank you uh further discussion
 
02:56:09.990 --> 02:56:10.000 align:start position:0%

two a being a parental brag here but
 
02:56:15.990 --> 02:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
my daughter attended
 
02:56:18.790 --> 02:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
cornell on a national science foundation
 
02:56:18.800 --> 02:56:20.950 align:start position:0%
cornell on a national science foundation
grant

02:56:20.950 --> 02:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
grant
 
02:56:23.349 --> 02:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
in graduate school she got her doctorate
 
02:56:25.429 --> 02:56:25.439 align:start position:0%
in geochemistry just so that you know
 
02:56:25.439 --> 02:56:27.750 align:start position:0%
in geochemistry just so that you know
that

02:56:27.750 --> 02:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:56:30.950 --> 02:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
and she did have to pay taxes on
 
02:56:32.870 --> 02:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
that grant she had to figure out every
 
02:56:35.670 --> 02:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
year how much taxes and set it aside so
 
02:56:37.830 --> 02:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
when she did her federal taxes she had
 
02:56:38.950 --> 02:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
the money
 
02:56:40.790 --> 02:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
so just you know there's different rules
 
02:56:42.309 --> 02:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
for different areas
 
02:56:43.830 --> 02:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
02:56:45.349 --> 02:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
02:56:48.150 --> 02:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunate if someone thought that they
 
02:56:50.150 --> 02:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
didn't know any taxes and then got
 
02:56:53.429 --> 02:56:53.439 align:start position:0%
audited and find out they did afterwards
 
02:56:54.950 --> 02:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
is not a pleasant
 
02:56:57.990 --> 02:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
position to be in so
 
02:57:00.710 --> 02:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
but i'm so proud of her
 
02:57:03.030 --> 02:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
congratulations on cornell
 
02:57:05.830 --> 02:57:05.840 align:start position:0%

uh yes thank you um
 
04:19:56.710 --> 04:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
my concern on this um
 
04:19:58.710 --> 04:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
is that this uh
 
04:20:00.469 --> 04:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
undermines the
 
04:20:03.110 --> 04:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
efa rules that were uh just passed
 
04:20:06.469 --> 04:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
friday by uh joe carr
 
04:20:06.479 --> 04:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
friday by uh joe carr
the

04:20:07.960 --> 04:20:07.970 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:20:07.970 --> 04:20:10.550 align:start position:0%
the
[Music]

04:20:10.550 --> 04:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:20:13.510 --> 04:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
the rules went through a series of
 
04:20:15.830 --> 04:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
modifications and discussions with joe
 
04:20:15.840 --> 04:20:17.429 align:start position:0%
modifications and discussions with joe
carr

04:20:17.429 --> 04:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
carr
 
04:20:21.269 --> 04:20:21.279 align:start position:0%
and the final rules um include
 
04:20:23.990 --> 04:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
the terms intentional and substantial
 
04:20:27.269 --> 04:20:27.279 align:start position:0%
and have definitions for both
 
04:20:29.269 --> 04:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh definition for
 
04:20:31.590 --> 04:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
um intentional
 
04:20:34.790 --> 04:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
um is uh willful and
 
04:20:36.790 --> 04:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh knowledgeable
 
04:20:38.870 --> 04:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
um and the definition for substantial is
 
04:20:41.750 --> 04:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
250 dollars
 
04:20:43.349 --> 04:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
so passing this
 
04:20:43.359 --> 04:20:44.229 align:start position:0%
so passing this
would

04:20:44.229 --> 04:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:20:46.790 --> 04:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
just undermine
 
04:20:49.030 --> 04:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
all the work that was done and
 
04:20:52.389 --> 04:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
on the final rules and require
 
04:20:56.229 --> 04:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
new rules to be uh developed
 
04:20:59.510 --> 04:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
where was it hobson anything to add
 
04:21:05.750 --> 04:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:08.309 --> 04:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely um we do have an
 
04:21:10.469 --> 04:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
amendment 1355
 
04:21:10.479 --> 04:21:11.910 align:start position:0%
amendment 1355
that

04:21:11.910 --> 04:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:21:11.920 --> 04:21:15.269 align:start position:0%
that
that

04:21:15.269 --> 04:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:17.670 --> 04:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
i think is is
 
04:21:19.990 --> 04:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
is consistent with with what we what we
 
04:21:22.229 --> 04:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
talked about during the hearing on this
 
04:21:24.070 --> 04:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
bill it does take out the word
 
04:21:26.710 --> 04:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
intentional which doesn't
 
04:21:28.070 --> 04:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
mean the rules
 
04:21:29.590 --> 04:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
have to change they can still leave that
 
04:21:31.830 --> 04:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
definition in there but the law would
 
04:21:34.309 --> 04:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
only require substantial misuse of efa
 
04:21:34.319 --> 04:21:35.269 align:start position:0%
only require substantial misuse of efa
funds

04:21:35.269 --> 04:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
funds
 
04:21:37.269 --> 04:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
to be reported to the attorney general
 
04:21:40.309 --> 04:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
for investigation and um
 
04:21:41.429 --> 04:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:21:43.910 --> 04:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
i think i would i would support um
 
04:21:46.070 --> 04:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
introducing the amendment and uh moving
 
04:21:47.670 --> 04:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
forward with that well we can't
 
04:21:49.750 --> 04:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
introduce the amendment until we lest
 
04:21:51.830 --> 04:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
the itl fails
 
04:21:54.950 --> 04:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
and for another motion anybody else
 
04:21:54.960 --> 04:22:00.790 align:start position:0%
and for another motion anybody else
speak

04:22:00.790 --> 04:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:03.670 --> 04:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:05.269 --> 04:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
you know we'll probably wait for the
 
04:22:07.830 --> 04:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
chairman to return right yeah
 
04:22:09.830 --> 04:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
um i think we got to keep going right
 
04:22:11.030 --> 04:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
through it
 
04:22:12.229 --> 04:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
we're here
 
04:22:14.870 --> 04:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
we're all here no we're not at all no
 
04:22:38.870 --> 04:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:38.880 --> 04:22:43.189 align:start position:0%
 
right

04:22:43.189 --> 04:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:46.309 --> 04:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
the legislation currently
 
04:22:48.469 --> 04:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
calls for
 
04:22:50.469 --> 04:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
intentional and substantial misuse of
 
04:22:50.479 --> 04:22:51.910 align:start position:0%
intentional and substantial misuse of
funds

04:22:51.910 --> 04:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
funds
 
04:22:54.149 --> 04:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
to be reported to the attorney general's
 
04:22:56.950 --> 04:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
office for investigation
 
04:22:59.590 --> 04:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
the rules that were developed
 
04:23:01.030 --> 04:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
by the department
 
04:23:03.189 --> 04:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
with input from
 
04:23:05.910 --> 04:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
jail car and others
 
04:23:08.229 --> 04:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
left in those words
 
04:23:11.830 --> 04:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
and defined intentional as knowingly and
 
04:23:11.840 --> 04:23:13.510 align:start position:0%
and defined intentional as knowingly and
willfully

04:23:13.510 --> 04:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
willfully
 
04:23:20.469 --> 04:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:23.030 --> 04:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
so i think that passing this
 
04:23:25.269 --> 04:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
legislation would undermine the rules
 
04:23:27.670 --> 04:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
that were just
 
04:23:29.750 --> 04:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
remember that
 
04:23:31.510 --> 04:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh representative
 
04:23:33.510 --> 04:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
cordelli i'm not familiar with the
 
04:23:35.590 --> 04:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
complete rules can you tell me if the
 
04:23:38.710 --> 04:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
rule would require um
 
04:23:40.389 --> 04:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
these cases to be referred to the
 
04:23:44.790 --> 04:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:45.990 --> 04:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
i believe that's in the original
 
04:23:46.000 --> 04:23:53.030 align:start position:0%
i believe that's in the original
legislation

04:23:53.030 --> 04:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:54.710 --> 04:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
isn't the original legislation the bill
 
04:23:57.349 --> 04:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
was the the law that's before us
 
04:24:00.870 --> 04:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
that says may not shall oh
 
04:24:02.630 --> 04:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't require it and the
 
04:24:04.630 --> 04:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
original legislation it's only in this
 
04:24:06.070 --> 04:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that would or this bill that
 
04:24:08.870 --> 04:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
would require i i believe it's also in
 
04:24:11.269 --> 04:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
the contract between the department and
 
04:24:13.349 --> 04:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization is it in
 
04:24:15.510 --> 04:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
the contract is a may or a shell i
 
04:24:17.910 --> 04:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
believe it's a shell
 
04:24:19.590 --> 04:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
is there a way to confirm that instead
 
04:24:21.590 --> 04:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
of i believe
 
04:24:24.550 --> 04:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
um i i will attempt to endeavor to do
 
04:24:24.560 --> 04:24:25.750 align:start position:0%
um i i will attempt to endeavor to do
that

04:24:25.750 --> 04:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:24:25.760 --> 04:24:27.189 align:start position:0%
that
okay

04:24:27.189 --> 04:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:24:29.670 --> 04:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
well that is going on
 
04:24:31.750 --> 04:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
well you can do that and check on that
 
04:24:34.070 --> 04:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
online when i recess
 
04:24:35.750 --> 04:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
this for
 
04:24:35.760 --> 04:24:36.469 align:start position:0%
this for
and

04:24:36.469 --> 04:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:24:37.590 --> 04:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think you have to recess it
 
04:24:39.030 --> 04:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
because yeah
 
04:24:41.189 --> 04:24:41.199 align:start position:0%

an otp do you remember replace the
 
04:27:17.189 --> 04:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
builder in the hearing though that
 
04:27:18.630 --> 04:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter
 
04:27:22.309 --> 04:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:33.670 --> 04:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:37.990 --> 04:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment is is 0439h
 
04:27:39.670 --> 04:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
representative cornell handed it out
 
04:27:41.349 --> 04:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
during the hearing and spoke to it
 
04:27:42.630 --> 04:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
during the hearing
 
04:27:44.550 --> 04:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
and spoke to the amendment not to the
 
04:27:46.550 --> 04:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
original bill during the hearing the
 
04:27:49.349 --> 04:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
process still has to be uh to pass
 
04:27:51.030 --> 04:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
introduce the amendment uh to pass the
 
04:27:52.469 --> 04:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
amendment and then not to pass as
 
04:27:54.469 --> 04:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
amended right so not disputing the
 
04:27:56.710 --> 04:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
process right but i think in fairness
 
04:27:59.189 --> 04:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
here um i hope representatives are
 
04:28:00.950 --> 04:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
looking at the amendment because the
 
04:28:00.960 --> 04:28:02.630 align:start position:0%
looking at the amendment because the
amendment

04:28:02.630 --> 04:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:28:05.349 --> 04:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
specifically is a is a technical
 
04:28:07.110 --> 04:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
correction to make sure that it's
 
04:28:09.030 --> 04:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
specifying the proper
 
04:28:09.040 --> 04:28:10.389 align:start position:0%
specifying the proper
code

04:28:10.389 --> 04:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
code
 
04:28:12.229 --> 04:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
for idea
 
04:28:14.710 --> 04:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
and it's not about it's not about
 
04:28:15.910 --> 04:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not students with
 
04:28:19.269 --> 04:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
disabilities are going to facilities
 
04:28:21.590 --> 04:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's about the fact that the efa program
 
04:28:24.309 --> 04:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
is a parental placement under 20 usc
 
04:28:27.510 --> 04:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
which is the idea code so just being in
 
04:28:29.910 --> 04:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
an efa program is considered a parental
 
04:28:29.920 --> 04:28:30.950 align:start position:0%
an efa program is considered a parental
placement

04:28:30.950 --> 04:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
placement
 
04:28:33.030 --> 04:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
and and that is absolutely fact in fact
 
04:28:36.389 --> 04:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
that's in current law
 
04:28:36.399 --> 04:28:38.710 align:start position:0%
that's in current law
and

04:28:38.710 --> 04:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:41.910 --> 04:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
yeah that's in current law right
 
04:28:43.990 --> 04:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
the efa program is parental placement
 
04:28:45.590 --> 04:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
under 20 usc
 
04:28:47.510 --> 04:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
so it calls out the correct part of the
 
04:28:47.520 --> 04:28:48.469 align:start position:0%
so it calls out the correct part of the
code

04:28:48.469 --> 04:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
code
 
04:28:51.990 --> 04:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
and and and makes it very clear
 
04:28:54.309 --> 04:28:54.319 align:start position:0%
in the in both the bill actually in the
 
04:28:54.319 --> 04:28:55.670 align:start position:0%
in the in both the bill actually in the
amendment

04:28:55.670 --> 04:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:28:58.229 --> 04:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
about what um what what parents and
 
04:29:01.750 --> 04:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
students rights are under idea
 
04:29:03.349 --> 04:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
04:29:05.189 --> 04:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
04:29:09.830 --> 04:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:12.790 --> 04:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i am i am remembering now i
 
04:29:15.590 --> 04:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
think that um
 
04:29:19.030 --> 04:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
rep cornell am i am i right in that
 
04:29:21.830 --> 04:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
your intention with this amendment was
 
04:29:23.830 --> 04:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
that children or students who
 
04:29:23.840 --> 04:29:25.110 align:start position:0%
that children or students who
participate

04:29:25.110 --> 04:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
participate
 
04:29:27.030 --> 04:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
in education freedom accounts would
 
04:29:30.309 --> 04:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
waive their special education
 
04:29:30.319 --> 04:29:31.349 align:start position:0%
waive their special education
no

04:29:31.349 --> 04:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:29:32.870 --> 04:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
okay no
 
04:29:35.189 --> 04:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
the intention is that parentally placed
 
04:29:37.510 --> 04:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
students the parents will receive a
 
04:29:39.670 --> 04:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
notice that if they are parentally
 
04:29:42.149 --> 04:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
placing their students they waive their
 
04:29:42.159 --> 04:29:43.269 align:start position:0%
placing their students they waive their
right

04:29:43.269 --> 04:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:29:50.469 --> 04:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:53.030 --> 04:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair i'm wondering this has
 
04:29:54.550 --> 04:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
happened a couple of times and i'm
 
04:29:55.990 --> 04:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
wondering if
 
04:29:56.000 --> 04:29:56.870 align:start position:0%
wondering if
the

04:29:56.870 --> 04:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:29:59.590 --> 04:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
itl motion might be withdrawn
 
04:30:02.870 --> 04:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
so an otp motion can go forward so that
 
04:30:05.670 --> 04:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
we can vote on the amendment
 
04:30:07.910 --> 04:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
and if the amendment is voted down then
 
04:30:10.710 --> 04:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
go to itl but i think it's only fair
 
04:30:10.720 --> 04:30:11.590 align:start position:0%
go to itl but i think it's only fair
because

04:30:11.590 --> 04:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:30:13.510 --> 04:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative cornell did bring in the
 
04:30:13.520 --> 04:30:14.550 align:start position:0%
representative cornell did bring in the
amendment

04:30:14.550 --> 04:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:30:17.830 --> 04:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
it addressed some major issues
 
04:30:19.269 --> 04:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
and it's a really important thing for
 
04:30:21.910 --> 04:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
parents to know right i sort of agree
 
04:30:23.750 --> 04:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
but the point is was
 
04:30:25.000 --> 04:30:25.010 align:start position:0%
hey good
 
04:30:25.010 --> 04:30:27.189 align:start position:0%
hey good
[Laughter]

04:30:27.189 --> 04:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:30:31.110 --> 04:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
did somebody second the ito
 
04:30:31.120 --> 04:30:32.710 align:start position:0%
did somebody second the ito
yes

04:30:32.710 --> 04:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:30:32.720 --> 04:30:34.309 align:start position:0%
yes
okay

04:30:34.309 --> 04:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:30:36.469 --> 04:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
here are we okay we couldn't we were
 
04:30:39.990 --> 04:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
ready to take the vote on 1355 but
 
04:30:41.429 --> 04:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
we couldn't because you weren't here so
 
04:30:44.149 --> 04:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
i moved on to 1376 and we're issuing
 
04:30:45.750 --> 04:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
that now because
 
04:30:45.760 --> 04:30:46.710 align:start position:0%
that now because
um

04:30:46.710 --> 04:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:46.720 --> 04:30:47.910 align:start position:0%
um
representative

04:30:47.910 --> 04:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:30:47.920 --> 04:30:49.189 align:start position:0%
representative
cornell

04:30:49.189 --> 04:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
cornell
 
04:30:52.389 --> 04:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
put it spoke on the amendment
 
04:30:55.990 --> 04:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
on that and so we did an itl but should
 
04:30:58.070 --> 04:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
it be an otp with the amendment then if
 
04:31:00.870 --> 04:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
that fails we can idl so
 
04:31:03.910 --> 04:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
back and i see your notes here rick so i
 
04:31:05.910 --> 04:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
don't know what they meant so
 
04:31:08.710 --> 04:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
that's that good cursing so look
 
04:31:08.720 --> 04:31:18.870 align:start position:0%
that's that good cursing so look
so

04:31:18.870 --> 04:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:21.510 --> 04:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
and then it says exactly what
 
04:31:21.520 --> 04:31:22.630 align:start position:0%
and then it says exactly what
parents

04:31:22.630 --> 04:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
parents
 
04:31:24.469 --> 04:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
and students what their rights would be
 
04:31:26.149 --> 04:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
underlined yeah
 
04:31:26.159 --> 04:31:27.110 align:start position:0%
underlined yeah
uh

04:31:27.110 --> 04:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:31:27.990 --> 04:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
04:31:29.349 --> 04:31:29.359 align:start position:0%
this is this is more than housekeeping
 
04:31:31.189 --> 04:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change the policy
 
04:31:37.269 --> 04:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:40.229 --> 04:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
get lunch um the table here and and
 
04:31:42.469 --> 04:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
it is my fault i was not on the ball i
 
04:31:42.479 --> 04:31:45.030 align:start position:0%
it is my fault i was not on the ball i
apologize

04:31:45.030 --> 04:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
04:31:48.229 --> 04:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
um if i might mr chairman yes go ahead
 
04:31:49.670 --> 04:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
um i i
 
04:31:52.469 --> 04:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
also object to the word wave of their
 
04:31:52.479 --> 04:31:54.070 align:start position:0%
also object to the word wave of their
rights

04:31:54.070 --> 04:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
rights
 
04:31:56.389 --> 04:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
but they do
 
04:31:57.590 --> 04:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
if i could
 
04:32:00.790 --> 04:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:02.630 --> 04:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
waving means
 
04:32:04.790 --> 04:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
something different to me
 
04:32:08.870 --> 04:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
they are no longer covered in id
 
04:32:10.950 --> 04:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
under ie dea
 
04:32:13.429 --> 04:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
but at any point in time
 
04:32:15.910 --> 04:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
they can go back to their public school
 
04:32:19.269 --> 04:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
and be covered by idea
 
04:32:23.429 --> 04:32:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:25.590 --> 04:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
that's correct yeah right so that's
 
04:32:25.600 --> 04:32:26.950 align:start position:0%
that's correct yeah right so that's
right

04:32:26.950 --> 04:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:32:29.910 --> 04:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
right and so i i i do not think the term
 
04:32:33.189 --> 04:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
wave um is is proper in this case as to
 
04:32:40.309 --> 04:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:42.389 --> 04:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
they're not waving their rights they're
 
04:32:43.349 --> 04:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
just not
 
04:32:45.510 --> 04:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
no longer covered right because they can
 
04:32:47.349 --> 04:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
go back at any point
 
04:32:51.830 --> 04:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:54.550 --> 04:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
isn't that what wave means
 
04:32:57.830 --> 04:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
i'm i recognize that i'm not
 
04:32:59.830 --> 04:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
going to have these rights while i'm
 
04:33:01.590 --> 04:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
here at this school
 
04:33:03.590 --> 04:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
i'm waving them while i'm here at this
 
04:33:03.600 --> 04:33:04.869 align:start position:0%
i'm waving them while i'm here at this
school

04:33:04.869 --> 04:33:04.879 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:33:04.879 --> 04:33:06.390 align:start position:0%
school
um

04:33:06.390 --> 04:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:07.750 --> 04:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry it means something different
 
04:33:10.310 --> 04:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
we had this argument
 
04:33:15.590 --> 04:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
four or five years ago when we
 
04:33:17.349 --> 04:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
had a
 
04:33:17.359 --> 04:33:18.470 align:start position:0%
had a
efa

04:33:18.470 --> 04:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
efa
 
04:33:21.429 --> 04:33:21.439 align:start position:0%
bill for special needs children
 
04:33:24.470 --> 04:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
um and this was the subject of quite a
 
04:33:31.750 --> 04:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:33.910 --> 04:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
i have some additional information first
 
04:33:35.029 --> 04:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
on the
 
04:33:37.670 --> 04:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
last bill is that the contract says
 
04:33:40.310 --> 04:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
shall so that was a question does it say
 
04:33:42.789 --> 04:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
shall or may that's the last bill
 
04:33:44.390 --> 04:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
it says shall but
 
04:33:47.349 --> 04:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
as far as this efas are not always
 
04:33:50.390 --> 04:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
parental placements and that was that's
 
04:33:52.869 --> 04:33:52.879 align:start position:0%
the information i just got and that the
 
04:33:55.670 --> 04:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
rules themselves clarify that
 
04:33:57.349 --> 04:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
so the so
 
04:33:59.109 --> 04:33:59.119 align:start position:0%
we're assuming where this is stating
 
04:34:01.830 --> 04:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
that it is and apparently it's not
 
04:34:10.390 --> 04:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:13.510 --> 04:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
yes uh represent tanner so
 
04:34:16.551 --> 04:34:16.561 align:start position:0%
uh representative lucas when you when
 
04:34:19.670 --> 04:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
you said not all students are a
 
04:34:19.680 --> 04:34:21.269 align:start position:0%
you said not all students are a
placement

04:34:21.269 --> 04:34:21.279 align:start position:0%
placement
 
04:34:22.390 --> 04:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
do you mean
 
04:34:25.189 --> 04:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
whether they have a disability or not
 
04:34:27.670 --> 04:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
i mean who are all the students
 
04:34:30.310 --> 04:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about
 
04:34:32.150 --> 04:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization is
 
04:34:33.910 --> 04:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
listening to her are hearing and trying
 
04:34:35.510 --> 04:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
to answer questions for us when they
 
04:34:36.470 --> 04:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
come up
 
04:34:39.670 --> 04:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
and so her response is efa is not always
 
04:34:41.510 --> 04:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
a parental placement
 
04:34:43.429 --> 04:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
04:34:45.670 --> 04:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
all i have is the information i just got
 
04:34:45.680 --> 04:34:47.429 align:start position:0%
all i have is the information i just got
sent

04:34:47.429 --> 04:34:47.439 align:start position:0%
sent
 
04:34:49.029 --> 04:34:49.039 align:start position:0%
i don't get that
 
04:34:52.310 --> 04:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
and she said the rules clarify that
 
04:34:55.029 --> 04:34:55.039 align:start position:0%
so i mean if i could i have the rules in
 
04:34:56.629 --> 04:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
front of me
 
04:34:56.639 --> 04:34:58.949 align:start position:0%
front of me
um

04:34:58.949 --> 04:34:58.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:01.910 --> 04:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
participation in the efa program is a
 
04:35:05.750 --> 04:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
parental placement under 20 usc 1412
 
04:35:08.470 --> 04:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities education
 
04:35:10.470 --> 04:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
act if a child with a disability is
 
04:35:13.590 --> 04:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
enrolled in a non-public school
 
04:35:15.830 --> 04:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
a child with a disability participating
 
04:35:18.230 --> 04:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
in an efa program and enrolled in a
 
04:35:23.189 --> 04:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
public school is covered under 194 f2
 
04:35:23.199 --> 04:35:24.470 align:start position:0%
public school is covered under 194 f2
2d

04:35:24.470 --> 04:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
2d
 
04:35:28.629 --> 04:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:31.510 --> 04:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
and is entitled to fape
 
04:35:33.029 --> 04:35:33.039 align:start position:0%
parentally placed students with
 
04:35:36.070 --> 04:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
disabilities shall not be entitled to
 
04:35:37.269 --> 04:35:37.279 align:start position:0%
faith in connection with their
 
04:35:39.349 --> 04:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
enrollment by their parents in a private
 
04:35:39.359 --> 04:35:48.070 align:start position:0%
enrollment by their parents in a private
school

04:35:48.070 --> 04:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:49.109 --> 04:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
so i
 
04:35:50.629 --> 04:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
everybody in agreement with what you
 
04:35:52.629 --> 04:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
just said
 
04:35:54.949 --> 04:35:54.959 align:start position:0%
no because the law here the bill that
 
04:35:57.429 --> 04:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
we're looking at says in a public or
 
04:36:00.150 --> 04:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
private elementary a secondary school
 
04:36:01.029 --> 04:36:01.039 align:start position:0%
is a
 
04:36:04.390 --> 04:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
a parental placement except
 
04:36:05.750 --> 04:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
if they're in a public school they're
 
04:36:07.510 --> 04:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
not a parental placement
 
04:36:11.910 --> 04:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
yeah right i i believe that there was
 
04:36:13.429 --> 04:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
a mis
 
04:36:15.510 --> 04:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
statement mischaracterization in the
 
04:36:17.910 --> 04:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
original legislation
 
04:36:20.789 --> 04:36:20.799 align:start position:0%
that is repeated in this legislation but
 
04:36:35.750 --> 04:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:38.150 --> 04:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh starting from the top participation
 
04:36:39.750 --> 04:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
in the efa program is a parental
 
04:36:43.429 --> 04:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
placement under 20 usc 1412 idea
 
04:36:45.269 --> 04:36:45.279 align:start position:0%
if a child is with a disability is
 
04:36:47.670 --> 04:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
enrolled in a non-public school
 
04:36:49.750 --> 04:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
a child with a disability participating
 
04:36:51.750 --> 04:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
in an efa program and enrolled in a
 
04:36:53.429 --> 04:36:53.439 align:start position:0%
public school
 
04:36:55.349 --> 04:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
which is possible
 
04:36:58.949 --> 04:36:58.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:04.629 --> 04:37:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:08.310 --> 04:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
f colon 2 roman 2 d is not a parental

placement under idea
 
04:37:16.310 --> 04:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:17.990 --> 04:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
though parentally placed in a private
 
04:37:20.150 --> 04:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
school with disabilities shall not be
 
04:37:22.150 --> 04:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
entitled to faith in connection with
 
04:37:23.750 --> 04:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
their enrollment by their parents in a
 
04:37:26.470 --> 04:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
private school
 
04:37:30.150 --> 04:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
in accordance with 34 or fcr et cetera
 
04:37:32.070 --> 04:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
while participating in the state funded
 
04:37:33.590 --> 04:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
efa program
 
04:37:36.070 --> 04:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
the school district in which the child
 
04:37:38.789 --> 04:37:38.799 align:start position:0%
with a disability participating in in an
 
04:37:41.349 --> 04:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
efa program is enrolled in a public
 
04:37:45.830 --> 04:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
school under 194 is responsible for
 
04:37:47.830 --> 04:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
provision of faith
 
04:37:47.840 --> 04:37:48.551 align:start position:0%
provision of faith
so

04:37:48.551 --> 04:37:48.561 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:37:51.269 --> 04:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
it in this in the rules it's also
 
04:37:55.269 --> 04:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
covering um which is not covered here um
 
04:37:57.910 --> 04:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
the instance where a
 
04:38:00.390 --> 04:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
efa student could be placed
 
04:38:02.150 --> 04:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
in an out of district
 
04:38:03.830 --> 04:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
public school
 
04:38:05.670 --> 04:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
and it's making the distinction that
 
04:38:07.510 --> 04:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
they are still covered by fape under
 
04:38:10.551 --> 04:38:10.561 align:start position:0%
that under um and under idea
 
04:38:12.470 --> 04:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
whereas if they are placed in a private
 
04:38:14.470 --> 04:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
school a non-public school
 
04:38:17.990 --> 04:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
they are no longer covered by um
 
04:38:19.750 --> 04:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
by idea
 
04:38:23.510 --> 04:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
and i much prefer non-covered to wave
 
04:38:29.750 --> 04:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:32.949 --> 04:38:32.959 align:start position:0%
because wave means give up your rights
 
04:38:34.789 --> 04:38:34.799 align:start position:0%
and you're not you still retain the
 
04:38:37.109 --> 04:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
rights but you don't have them in this
 
04:38:40.470 --> 04:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
case it is too different
 
04:38:42.629 --> 04:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
wave means to defer by definition it
 
04:38:45.269 --> 04:38:45.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't say give up wave means defer
 
04:38:47.029 --> 04:38:47.039 align:start position:0%
it's not in that
 
04:38:49.029 --> 04:38:49.039 align:start position:0%
mr chair it's not i don't see the word
 
04:38:51.670 --> 04:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
wave in the amendment
 
04:38:57.590 --> 04:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:58.869 --> 04:38:58.879 align:start position:0%
was what
 
04:39:06.150 --> 04:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:08.470 --> 04:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
represent porter
 
04:39:12.230 --> 04:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so under the rules
 
04:39:13.510 --> 04:39:13.520 align:start position:0%

if they have an efa
 
04:39:33.349 --> 04:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
in the rules representative cordelli
 
04:39:34.629 --> 04:39:34.639 align:start position:0%
that you just read
 
04:39:36.629 --> 04:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
is there anything in the rules
 
04:39:38.628 --> 04:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
that requires
 
04:39:41.350 --> 04:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
notification to the parent that they may
 
04:39:41.360 --> 04:39:45.190 align:start position:0%
notification to the parent that they may
be

under a section called the application
 
04:39:59.270 --> 04:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
shall contain the following and what i
 
04:40:00.788 --> 04:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
read was
 
04:40:09.190 --> 04:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:11.110 --> 04:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
read it again
 
04:40:14.708 --> 04:40:14.718 align:start position:0%
participation in the efa program is
 
04:40:16.628 --> 04:40:16.638 align:start position:0%
in a is a parental placement under 20

disability is enrolled in a non-public
 
04:40:22.480 --> 04:40:23.430 align:start position:0%

04:40:23.430 --> 04:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:40:25.910 --> 04:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
a child with a disability participating
 
04:40:28.470 --> 04:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
in an efa program and enrolled in a
 
04:40:31.110 --> 04:40:31.120 align:start position:0%
public school under
 
04:40:33.190 --> 04:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
194 f2
 
04:40:35.990 --> 04:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
roman d2 is not a parental placement
 
04:40:37.830 --> 04:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
under idea
 
04:40:41.190 --> 04:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
and shall be entitled to fate
 
04:40:44.788 --> 04:40:44.798 align:start position:0%
and then it basically including the same
 
04:40:47.350 --> 04:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
where is that placed
 
04:40:49.670 --> 04:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
on the application to be part of an efa
 
04:40:49.680 --> 04:40:51.110 align:start position:0%
on the application to be part of an efa
program

04:40:51.110 --> 04:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:40:54.310 --> 04:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
um wait when a parent is obsessed
 
04:40:55.910 --> 04:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's under section
 
04:40:59.750 --> 04:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
805 of the rules application and
 
04:40:59.760 --> 04:41:01.270 align:start position:0%
805 of the rules application and
enrollment

04:41:01.270 --> 04:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
04:41:03.910 --> 04:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
and this is under 805
 
04:41:03.920 --> 04:41:06.470 align:start position:0%
and this is under 805
805.01

04:41:06.470 --> 04:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
805.01
 
04:41:08.390 --> 04:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
application development agreement and
 
04:41:11.590 --> 04:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
notification requirements
 
04:41:13.830 --> 04:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
so that's stated on the application that
 
04:41:15.750 --> 04:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
the parent is filling out
 
04:41:17.830 --> 04:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
to enroll their child in a program
 
04:41:17.840 --> 04:41:19.110 align:start position:0%
to enroll their child in a program
representative

04:41:19.110 --> 04:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:41:20.788 --> 04:41:20.798 align:start position:0%
let's let's go to representative cornell
 
04:41:23.590 --> 04:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
right now the the intent of this was was
 
04:41:27.270 --> 04:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
simply to make parents aware that they
 
04:41:29.110 --> 04:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
may be giving up their rights or that
 
04:41:31.430 --> 04:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
they are giving their our rights to a
 
04:41:34.628 --> 04:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
special education under idea if they
 
04:41:36.708 --> 04:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
parentally place a child in private
 
04:41:39.910 --> 04:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
education and we want parents to know
 
04:41:42.708 --> 04:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
what they are signing up for so that
 
04:41:45.270 --> 04:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
they can make the best decisions before
 
04:41:47.190 --> 04:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
they place their child
 
04:41:49.270 --> 04:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
in a placement and then find out that
 
04:41:51.750 --> 04:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
they're not going to i get that so is it
 
04:41:55.430 --> 04:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
possible that this wording that's in
 
04:41:57.910 --> 04:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
this zero four three nine h amendment
 
04:41:59.430 --> 04:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
could be reworked a little bit at the
 
04:42:00.788 --> 04:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
bottom to
 
04:42:03.350 --> 04:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
adjust to some of that what i don't mind
 
04:42:05.750 --> 04:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
the word wave because they are waving
 
04:42:08.070 --> 04:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
that right while they are in the
 
04:42:08.080 --> 04:42:09.670 align:start position:0%
that right while they are in the
placement

04:42:09.670 --> 04:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
placement
 
04:42:11.830 --> 04:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
yeah but we could do that
 
04:42:14.550 --> 04:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
i can i can do it yeah yeah there are
 
04:42:16.788 --> 04:42:16.798 align:start position:0%
some issues between public and privates
 
04:42:16.798 --> 04:42:18.150 align:start position:0%
some issues between public and privates
here

04:42:18.150 --> 04:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:42:19.670 --> 04:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
okay there's a little difference there
 
04:42:21.270 --> 04:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
and that's what we you might want to
 
04:42:23.190 --> 04:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
work on i think we can arrive at that
 
04:42:25.830 --> 04:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
common ground
 
04:42:27.350 --> 04:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
would you do that between the three of
 
04:42:30.070 --> 04:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
you please here
 
04:42:32.948 --> 04:42:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:35.910 --> 04:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
i also can i ask a question sure this is
 
04:42:39.270 --> 04:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
an exact session not a hearing and i i
 
04:42:41.670 --> 04:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
thought when we wanted the public to
 
04:42:43.830 --> 04:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
give us some information or someone we
 
04:42:45.350 --> 04:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
we asked for it
 
04:42:45.360 --> 04:42:46.788 align:start position:0%
we asked for it
and

04:42:46.788 --> 04:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:42:48.628 --> 04:42:48.638 align:start position:0%
rough laker seems to be getting
 
04:42:48.638 --> 04:42:50.708 align:start position:0%
rough laker seems to be getting
information

04:42:50.708 --> 04:42:50.718 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:42:50.718 --> 04:42:51.990 align:start position:0%
information
constantly

04:42:51.990 --> 04:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
constantly
 
04:42:53.910 --> 04:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
because i've asked for it
 
04:42:56.470 --> 04:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
because when people say i don't know the
 
04:42:58.070 --> 04:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
answer to that
 
04:43:00.788 --> 04:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
then i ask so that i can reply so that
 
04:43:04.230 --> 04:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
we can have the answer so if you say if
 
04:43:05.990 --> 04:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
somebody asks the question and the
 
04:43:07.670 --> 04:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
answer is i don't know the answer to
 
04:43:10.470 --> 04:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
that then i've been asking and you even
 
04:43:12.788 --> 04:43:12.798 align:start position:0%
asked specifically for the answer to one
 
04:43:15.270 --> 04:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
of those and i asked and got the answer
 
04:43:18.390 --> 04:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
i i've just never seen the the issue
 
04:43:20.390 --> 04:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
that you address it would be very
 
04:43:23.430 --> 04:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
relevant if we were conducting a hearing
 
04:43:25.430 --> 04:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
um i've been at hearings with uh
 
04:43:27.190 --> 04:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
northern pass
 
04:43:29.110 --> 04:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
and representative rappaport and i were
 
04:43:31.990 --> 04:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
sitting there and listening to and
 
04:43:32.000 --> 04:43:33.270 align:start position:0%
sitting there and listening to and
seeing

04:43:33.270 --> 04:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
04:43:36.390 --> 04:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
questions being delivered to the
 
04:43:38.390 --> 04:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
committee hearing the bill
 
04:43:41.590 --> 04:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
from the audience in rep hall
 
04:43:43.190 --> 04:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
which was
 
04:43:46.550 --> 04:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
not really the way it should work you if
 
04:43:47.990 --> 04:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
you in repsol if you're there at a
 
04:43:50.470 --> 04:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
hearing you should stand up and testify
 
04:43:51.990 --> 04:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
but then you shouldn't have the ability
 
04:43:53.750 --> 04:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
to act like a person sitting on that
 
04:43:55.830 --> 04:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
committee by delivering questions for a
 
04:43:58.470 --> 04:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
committee member to ask a person who's
 
04:44:00.868 --> 04:44:00.878 align:start position:0%
testifying that's not the way it works
 
04:44:02.788 --> 04:44:02.798 align:start position:0%
but in an executive session we have
 
04:44:04.230 --> 04:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
folks here now where we're using our
 
04:44:06.788 --> 04:44:06.798 align:start position:0%
computers we can go check any i i think
 
04:44:09.750 --> 04:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
i see a lot of us doing that and using
 
04:44:13.030 --> 04:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
the phone is you know pretty similar
 
04:44:15.430 --> 04:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
mr chair yeah so just getting back to
 
04:44:18.550 --> 04:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
business here on 439 h
 
04:44:21.590 --> 04:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
um if an amendment was to come forward
 
04:44:23.910 --> 04:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
that addressed line 13
 
04:44:25.590 --> 04:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
that took out the words that such
 
04:44:27.590 --> 04:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
students possess and wave
 
04:44:33.030 --> 04:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:34.708 --> 04:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
i i think it's already covered in the
 
04:44:36.948 --> 04:44:36.958 align:start position:0%
final rules so i would still be in favor
 
04:44:39.990 --> 04:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:42.550 --> 04:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
because it's on the application
 
04:44:44.708 --> 04:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
well let's just make sure that that i
 
04:44:46.390 --> 04:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
mean this is an important thing this is
 
04:44:48.070 --> 04:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
like a warning label
 
04:44:48.080 --> 04:44:48.948 align:start position:0%
like a warning label
um

04:44:48.948 --> 04:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:53.510 --> 04:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:57.190 --> 04:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
if we just if if the if the new language
 
04:44:58.948 --> 04:44:58.958 align:start position:0%
in the amendment read
 
04:45:00.628 --> 04:45:00.638 align:start position:0%
starting on line 11 the scholarship
 
04:45:02.230 --> 04:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
organization shall provide parents of
 
04:45:03.910 --> 04:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities who are not
 
04:45:03.920 --> 04:45:05.030 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities who are not
enrolled

04:45:05.030 --> 04:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
enrolled
 
04:45:07.510 --> 04:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
in a pri who are not enrolled in a
 
04:45:09.670 --> 04:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
private elementary or secondary school
 
04:45:13.430 --> 04:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
of an explanation of rights under idea
 
04:45:18.390 --> 04:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:20.470 --> 04:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
you took out wave
 
04:45:23.190 --> 04:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
what's that yeah took out that such
 
04:45:25.750 --> 04:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
possess and wave
 
04:45:29.110 --> 04:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
took out the first what about on line 10
 
04:45:31.110 --> 04:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
there's nothing changed online possess
 
04:45:32.150 --> 04:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
and wave
 
04:45:35.868 --> 04:45:35.878 align:start position:0%
that was that's oh possess n
 
04:45:39.590 --> 04:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
waves um because he doesn't like wave
 
04:45:39.600 --> 04:45:41.990 align:start position:0%
waves um because he doesn't like wave
suspend

04:45:41.990 --> 04:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
suspend
 
04:45:43.430 --> 04:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
you could work on it
 
04:45:46.150 --> 04:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:47.910 --> 04:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
because we can't act on anything right
 
04:45:47.920 --> 04:45:49.030 align:start position:0%
because we can't act on anything right
now

04:45:49.030 --> 04:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:45:51.350 --> 04:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
but i have been notified that yes it is
 
04:45:54.390 --> 04:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
on the application so yes the parents
 
04:45:56.628 --> 04:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
are getting that so your intent of the
 
04:46:02.868 --> 04:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:04.788 --> 04:46:04.798 align:start position:0%
thank you miss chair
 
04:46:07.830 --> 04:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure that it is our job as
 
04:46:10.470 --> 04:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
legislators to be making i'm hearing you
 
04:46:12.628 --> 04:46:12.638 align:start position:0%
know the intent of this this measure is
 
04:46:15.270 --> 04:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
to is to quote make parents aware or
 
04:46:17.910 --> 04:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
represent lino just said uh use the term
 
04:46:20.628 --> 04:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
warning label is it our job to put
 
04:46:24.150 --> 04:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
warning labels on statutes i think
 
04:46:25.590 --> 04:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
there's a need for
 
04:46:27.910 --> 04:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
personal responsibility on the part of
 
04:46:30.390 --> 04:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
parents and i i think there's some good
 
04:46:32.628 --> 04:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
points about parents need to know what
 
04:46:34.310 --> 04:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
they're getting into what they may be
 
04:46:34.320 --> 04:46:35.350 align:start position:0%
they're getting into what they may be
losing

04:46:35.350 --> 04:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
losing
 
04:46:37.030 --> 04:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
but i just i'm trying to get my head
 
04:46:40.788 --> 04:46:40.798 align:start position:0%
around us putting warning labels on
 
04:46:40.798 --> 04:46:43.990 align:start position:0%
around us putting warning labels on
legislation

04:46:43.990 --> 04:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:46.070 --> 04:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
sorry and she also said they already
 
04:46:48.150 --> 04:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
updated the second handbook to contain
 
04:46:50.788 --> 04:46:50.798 align:start position:0%
the required notice yesterday so it's
 
04:46:50.798 --> 04:46:52.070 align:start position:0%
the required notice yesterday so it's
representative

04:46:52.070 --> 04:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:46:54.628 --> 04:46:54.638 align:start position:0%
thank you um i just want to respond to
 
04:46:57.030 --> 04:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
the last comment and that is you know i
 
04:46:59.030 --> 04:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
started my career litigating cases
 
04:47:00.868 --> 04:47:00.878 align:start position:0%
special ed cases all over the country in
 
04:47:03.590 --> 04:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
all 50 states i can assure you and the
 
04:47:04.948 --> 04:47:04.958 align:start position:0%
laws have gotten done nothing but get
 
04:47:07.350 --> 04:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
more complicated since then i can assure
 
04:47:09.910 --> 04:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
you most parents of special ed kids are
 
04:47:12.550 --> 04:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
very confused by what's before them what
 
04:47:14.628 --> 04:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
their rights are what what they aren't
 
04:47:16.708 --> 04:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
which the best approach for their kids
 
04:47:20.390 --> 04:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's just overwhelming for them and i
 
04:47:22.628 --> 04:47:22.638 align:start position:0%
think anything we can do that helps
 
04:47:25.030 --> 04:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
clarify for them what they're doing what
 
04:47:26.550 --> 04:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
they're waving what they're getting you
 
04:47:28.390 --> 04:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
know both sides with what they're giving
 
04:47:29.670 --> 04:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
up and what they're getting for their
 
04:47:29.680 --> 04:47:30.390 align:start position:0%
up and what they're getting for their
child

04:47:30.390 --> 04:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
child
 
04:47:32.310 --> 04:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
is something that we should be doing it
 
04:47:34.310 --> 04:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
is our responsibility to make it clear
 
04:47:36.390 --> 04:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
to those parents and yes there should be
 
04:47:38.390 --> 04:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
some parental responsibility but i can
 
04:47:40.550 --> 04:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
assure you every parent of a special ed
 
04:47:43.190 --> 04:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
student i have ever seen is out there
 
04:47:45.270 --> 04:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
struggling to understand it struggling
 
04:47:47.110 --> 04:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
to find the best for their child and
 
04:47:49.350 --> 04:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
just trying to sort it out and it's
 
04:47:52.230 --> 04:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
really complicated it's really hard and
 
04:47:53.750 --> 04:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's why i would support something
 
04:47:55.750 --> 04:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
like this if we get the wording right
 
04:47:57.830 --> 04:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
because i think we owe that to the
 
04:47:57.840 --> 04:47:59.110 align:start position:0%
because i think we owe that to the
parents

04:47:59.110 --> 04:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
parents
 
04:48:01.430 --> 04:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
if if i may mr chair
 
04:48:05.030 --> 04:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you i i agree i i'm sure that
 
04:48:07.030 --> 04:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's daunting and it's very complicated
 
04:48:09.590 --> 04:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
and it gets emotional my point my
 
04:48:12.150 --> 04:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
question is with all the resources that
 
04:48:15.190 --> 04:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
are out there uh to provide guidance to
 
04:48:18.150 --> 04:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
parents in areas like this i'm just
 
04:48:20.470 --> 04:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
questioning is is it our job to put it
 
04:48:22.390 --> 04:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
into this big thick yellow book a new
 
04:48:22.400 --> 04:48:23.350 align:start position:0%
into this big thick yellow book a new
law

04:48:23.350 --> 04:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:48:25.190 --> 04:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh with a warning label to make parents
 
04:48:27.430 --> 04:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
or i agree and i and i i think they
 
04:48:29.350 --> 04:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
deserve counsel and help and i think
 
04:48:31.750 --> 04:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
it's out there in many places other than
 
04:48:34.868 --> 04:48:34.878 align:start position:0%
us making a law
 
04:48:36.150 --> 04:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
ma'am respond
 
04:48:38.230 --> 04:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead and then uh represent court
 
04:48:40.310 --> 04:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
cordelia and then refsemon
 
04:48:41.590 --> 04:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:48:44.230 --> 04:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
that's part of our role is to try and
 
04:48:46.230 --> 04:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
make this easier for them and i have no
 
04:48:48.150 --> 04:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
problem with putting them into the rsas
 
04:48:49.750 --> 04:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
i have no problem with putting them in
 
04:48:51.990 --> 04:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
statute that this is just one more thing
 
04:48:53.590 --> 04:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to help them because
 
04:48:55.590 --> 04:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
they are reading this stuff and they are
 
04:48:58.150 --> 04:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
not understanding it try as they might
 
04:49:00.070 --> 04:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
they're not lawyers they're not
 
04:49:03.350 --> 04:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
educators they are not understanding it
 
04:49:06.230 --> 04:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
and again anything we can do to make it
 
04:49:08.230 --> 04:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
easier for them so they understand the
 
04:49:10.390 --> 04:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
implications of what they're doing i do
 
04:49:12.628 --> 04:49:12.638 align:start position:0%
think that is our responsibility and i
 
04:49:14.230 --> 04:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
have no problem i mean we're talking

representative mullen thank you mr chair
 
04:50:37.030 --> 04:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
um i understand that this information
 
04:50:40.150 --> 04:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
may be on the application form and that
 
04:50:42.470 --> 04:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
parents who are
 
04:50:46.868 --> 04:50:46.878 align:start position:0%
very interested in the efa program are
 
04:50:48.868 --> 04:50:48.878 align:start position:0%
likely to be the people that are looking
 
04:50:50.788 --> 04:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
at that application because they want to
 
04:50:52.230 --> 04:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
get involved
 
04:50:54.948 --> 04:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
my concern is with parents that are
 
04:50:54.958 --> 04:50:56.550 align:start position:0%
my concern is with parents that are
exploring

04:50:56.550 --> 04:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
exploring
 
04:50:59.590 --> 04:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
the program sort of from uh
 
04:50:59.600 --> 04:51:00.868 align:start position:0%
the program sort of from uh
the

04:51:00.868 --> 04:51:00.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:51:03.270 --> 04:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
the bottom up if you will not knowing
 
04:51:05.990 --> 04:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
anything about the program because i can
 
04:51:07.350 --> 04:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
tell you
 
04:51:10.628 --> 04:51:10.638 align:start position:0%
the ed 800 rules do not appear on the
 
04:51:15.430 --> 04:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
doe website under ed 800. i have been
 
04:51:19.670 --> 04:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
searching for efa information on and off
 
04:51:22.150 --> 04:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
for the past year
 
04:51:26.788 --> 04:51:26.798 align:start position:0%
and have inquired many times about why
 
04:51:29.830 --> 04:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
the rules were in ed 300 and when they
 
04:51:31.110 --> 04:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
were and i was told they were going to
 
04:51:33.350 --> 04:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
be transferred to at 800 why they
 
04:51:36.230 --> 04:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
weren't in at 800 and they're not in
 
04:51:39.670 --> 04:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
eight eight ed 800 does not appear on
 
04:51:42.788 --> 04:51:42.798 align:start position:0%
the doe website today so the idea
 
04:51:44.550 --> 04:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
representative moffat to get back to
 
04:51:47.430 --> 04:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
your point that this information is so
 
04:51:50.948 --> 04:51:50.958 align:start position:0%
easily and readily available
 
04:51:54.470 --> 04:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
i haven't been able to find easy answers
 
04:51:57.830 --> 04:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
to the questions so again anything we
 
04:52:01.030 --> 04:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
can do to assist parents at
 
04:52:03.750 --> 04:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
knowing what the what the rules and rags
 
04:52:08.150 --> 04:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:11.990 --> 04:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:13.590 --> 04:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
um the rules couldn't have been up
 
04:52:15.590 --> 04:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
earlier because they just got passed on
 
04:52:15.600 --> 04:52:16.628 align:start position:0%
earlier because they just got passed on
friday

04:52:16.628 --> 04:52:16.638 align:start position:0%
friday
 
04:52:19.910 --> 04:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
and they just went up on monday so
 
04:52:21.590 --> 04:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
you might want to look again
 
04:52:24.470 --> 04:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
because because uh yeah the preliminary
 
04:52:26.788 --> 04:52:26.798 align:start position:0%
and temporary rules were
 
04:52:26.798 --> 04:52:27.510 align:start position:0%
and temporary rules were
yeah

04:52:27.510 --> 04:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:52:29.830 --> 04:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
but at any but at any rate
 
04:52:33.190 --> 04:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
it is now the information that's in this
 
04:52:36.230 --> 04:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
as as uh representative cordelli just
 
04:52:38.550 --> 04:52:38.560 align:start position:0%

04:52:42.390 --> 04:52:42.400 align:start position:0%

05:02:58.320 --> 05:02:59.670 align:start position:0%
representative moffat do you have a
motion

05:02:59.670 --> 05:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
motion
 
05:03:01.830 --> 05:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
i do miss chair i would move my tl on
 
05:03:01.840 --> 05:03:03.430 align:start position:0%
i do miss chair i would move my tl on
this

05:03:03.430 --> 05:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:03:05.990 --> 05:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
and represent lakers right second thank
 
05:03:07.270 --> 05:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
05:03:09.430 --> 05:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh represent moffitt would you like to
 
05:03:11.270 --> 05:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
05:03:14.390 --> 05:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh sure mr briefly uh this bill changes
 
05:03:18.708 --> 05:03:18.718 align:start position:0%
the administration of the efa program
 
05:03:21.030 --> 05:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
from the scholarship organizations to
 
05:03:23.350 --> 05:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
the to doe
 
05:03:26.230 --> 05:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
and it's to me it seems to presuppose
 
05:03:27.910 --> 05:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
that doe would be the better
 
05:03:27.920 --> 05:03:29.670 align:start position:0%
that doe would be the better
administrator

05:03:29.670 --> 05:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
05:03:32.390 --> 05:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh and again as the efa program is in
 
05:03:34.628 --> 05:03:34.638 align:start position:0%
its first year
 
05:03:36.550 --> 05:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
the first part of its first year i think
 
05:03:38.868 --> 05:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
it's too early to pass judgment
 
05:03:41.190 --> 05:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
on on the efficacy
 
05:03:43.270 --> 05:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
of the scholarship organization's
 
05:03:44.868 --> 05:03:44.878 align:start position:0%
program management
 
05:03:47.830 --> 05:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
and further the the bill's fiscal note
 
05:03:50.628 --> 05:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
uh cited and indeterminate
 
05:03:53.430 --> 05:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
expense for doe to assume such
 
05:03:56.550 --> 05:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
management of the efa program so
 
05:03:59.270 --> 05:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh the and doe presently does not have
 
05:04:02.150 --> 05:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
the staff to administer the efa program
 
05:04:04.628 --> 05:04:04.638 align:start position:0%
so a measure such as this would make
 
05:04:06.550 --> 05:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
more sense to consider
 
05:04:09.270 --> 05:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
later on after after at least a year
 
05:04:12.150 --> 05:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
of uh efa administration by the
 
05:04:14.070 --> 05:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization
 
05:04:16.070 --> 05:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh
 
05:04:16.080 --> 05:04:17.430 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh
the

05:04:17.430 --> 05:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:04:19.910 --> 05:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
maker of the second is there any uh
 
05:04:21.590 --> 05:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
discussion on this
 
05:04:24.708 --> 05:04:24.718 align:start position:0%
just that i have in my notes that
 
05:04:27.590 --> 05:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
while the maximum that can be spent
 
05:04:30.230 --> 05:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
um for administering it is 10
 
05:04:31.670 --> 05:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
by the
 
05:04:34.708 --> 05:04:34.718 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization
 
05:04:36.550 --> 05:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
i have greater than 12 and a half
 
05:04:36.560 --> 05:04:37.910 align:start position:0%
i have greater than 12 and a half
percent

05:04:37.910 --> 05:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
percent
 
05:04:37.920 --> 05:04:39.550 align:start position:0%
percent
for

05:04:39.550 --> 05:04:39.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:04:41.830 --> 05:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
administrators for public school
 
05:04:44.628 --> 05:04:44.638 align:start position:0%
districts just as a comparison so
 
05:04:47.030 --> 05:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative porter
 
05:04:48.948 --> 05:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
so i'm sure this is a question that
 
05:04:50.310 --> 05:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
there are going to be people happy to
 
05:04:52.150 --> 05:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
answer for me
 
05:04:54.470 --> 05:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
i'm seeming to remember way back when we
 
05:04:57.030 --> 05:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
first passed on the
 
05:05:00.230 --> 05:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
education tax credit program
 
05:05:03.830 --> 05:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
but i don't remember how the scholarship
 
05:05:07.430 --> 05:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
granting organization was chosen
 
05:05:09.110 --> 05:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
was there a bidding
 
05:05:09.120 --> 05:05:10.310 align:start position:0%
was there a bidding
where

05:05:10.310 --> 05:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:05:13.350 --> 05:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
did we send out bids and ask for
 
05:05:16.230 --> 05:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
applications and then choose one
 
05:05:18.628 --> 05:05:18.638 align:start position:0%
and is that the same organization i
 
05:05:20.708 --> 05:05:20.718 align:start position:0%
think is the same organization
 
05:05:23.430 --> 05:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
that's dealing with the efa accounts so
 
05:05:25.510 --> 05:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that representative cordelli is
 
05:05:26.948 --> 05:05:26.958 align:start position:0%
going to be very happy to answer that
 
05:05:29.510 --> 05:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
for me okay representative cordelia can
 
05:05:29.520 --> 05:05:30.470 align:start position:0%
for me okay representative cordelia can
you

05:05:30.470 --> 05:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:05:32.310 --> 05:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
answer the question whether or not i i
 
05:05:33.750 --> 05:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
would be delighted
 
05:05:33.760 --> 05:05:35.430 align:start position:0%
would be delighted
um

05:05:35.430 --> 05:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:36.948 --> 05:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
my uh
 
05:05:40.550 --> 05:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
recollection and understanding is that
 
05:05:43.190 --> 05:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
there is an application process
 
05:05:44.628 --> 05:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
through the department of revenue
 
05:05:47.830 --> 05:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
administration for any organization that
 
05:05:50.070 --> 05:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
wants to
 
05:05:53.990 --> 05:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:57.990 --> 05:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
and is the only applicant the one that's
 
05:05:58.000 --> 05:05:58.948 align:start position:0%
and is the only applicant the one that's
there

05:05:58.948 --> 05:05:58.958 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:06:00.550 --> 05:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
there is a second
 
05:06:00.560 --> 05:06:01.510 align:start position:0%
there is a second
um

05:06:01.510 --> 05:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:04.788 --> 05:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
but i believe that um that program is
 
05:06:10.070 --> 05:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
also managed by the csf for them
 
05:06:13.270 --> 05:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
and if i could um just in relation to
 
05:06:17.990 --> 05:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
the efa program um the rules clarify the
 
05:06:20.230 --> 05:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill and that there can be
 
05:06:23.990 --> 05:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
multiple scholarship organizations
 
05:06:28.070 --> 05:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:29.430 --> 05:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
and that
 
05:06:31.510 --> 05:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
to get the program up and running since
 
05:06:34.708 --> 05:06:34.718 align:start position:0%
this program excuse me this csf was in
 
05:06:37.990 --> 05:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
operation already with this with the tax
 
05:06:40.070 --> 05:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
credit scholarship program uh there was
 
05:06:42.550 --> 05:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
a sole source contract with them but the
 
05:06:46.948 --> 05:06:46.958 align:start position:0%
uh uh intent is to um uh provide for
 
05:06:51.030 --> 05:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:53.830 --> 05:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
so if i'm understanding you correctly
 
05:06:56.230 --> 05:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
it's possible that other
 
05:06:58.788 --> 05:06:58.798 align:start position:0%
scholarship granting organizations might
 
05:07:01.190 --> 05:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
step forward as wanting to administer or
 
05:07:03.350 --> 05:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
partially administer that program
 
05:07:06.230 --> 05:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
many of the suggestions that we've made
 
05:07:06.240 --> 05:07:09.830 align:start position:0%
many of the suggestions that we've made
concerning

05:07:09.830 --> 05:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:11.270 --> 05:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
putting into
 
05:07:13.590 --> 05:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
statute requirements like having
 
05:07:15.270 --> 05:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
background checks and
 
05:07:17.270 --> 05:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
and things that are on applications and
 
05:07:19.030 --> 05:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things we've gotten the
 
05:07:20.550 --> 05:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
answer that's all spelled out in the
 
05:07:20.560 --> 05:07:21.830 align:start position:0%
answer that's all spelled out in the
contract

05:07:21.830 --> 05:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
contract
 
05:07:24.550 --> 05:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
so if another organization was going to
 
05:07:26.948 --> 05:07:26.958 align:start position:0%
come forward would that contract that
 
05:07:29.350 --> 05:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
they have be the same kind of contract
 
05:07:32.550 --> 05:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
that we have i would expect
 
05:07:34.550 --> 05:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
but there's no guarantee i i don't know
 
05:07:35.990 --> 05:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
i haven't talked to the department about
 
05:07:37.830 --> 05:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
that but um
 
05:07:39.510 --> 05:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
maybe you have some ideas for future
 
05:07:39.520 --> 05:07:40.868 align:start position:0%
maybe you have some ideas for future
plans

05:07:40.868 --> 05:07:40.878 align:start position:0%
plans
 
05:07:42.470 --> 05:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
no thank you i just wanted to know to
 
05:07:44.470 --> 05:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that we that we opened it up
 
05:07:46.470 --> 05:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
to people other than just this one
 
05:07:48.390 --> 05:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
organization that seems
 
05:07:51.110 --> 05:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
now to be the one that we're
 
05:07:54.070 --> 05:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
contracted with in deferring to when
 
05:07:55.910 --> 05:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations
 
05:07:57.910 --> 05:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
are concerned
 
05:07:59.350 --> 05:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion from the
 
05:08:01.350 --> 05:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
committee representative tanner
 
05:08:02.708 --> 05:08:02.718 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
05:08:05.030 --> 05:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
i think this is an important bill i i
 
05:08:07.510 --> 05:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
think that the writing is kind of on the
 
05:08:08.628 --> 05:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
wall with
 
05:08:09.910 --> 05:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
the unique
 
05:08:12.628 --> 05:08:12.638 align:start position:0%
pupil identifier number
 
05:08:14.628 --> 05:08:14.638 align:start position:0%
the reason i put my bill in and
 
05:08:17.110 --> 05:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
obviously uh it came from representative
 
05:08:19.750 --> 05:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
cordelia almost at the same time was
 
05:08:21.350 --> 05:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
recognition that the department of
 
05:08:23.510 --> 05:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
education had to have some way to track
 
05:08:24.708 --> 05:08:24.718 align:start position:0%
these uh
 
05:08:26.948 --> 05:08:26.958 align:start position:0%
these kids to find out
 
05:08:29.830 --> 05:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
um you know where they're going
 
05:08:32.788 --> 05:08:32.798 align:start position:0%
what's happening when they when they
 
05:08:35.270 --> 05:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
leave the program when they age out of
 
05:08:37.830 --> 05:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
the program
 
05:08:40.310 --> 05:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
so and we talked about uh background
 
05:08:41.590 --> 05:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
checks and the background checks are
 
05:08:42.628 --> 05:08:42.638 align:start position:0%
going to have to go through the
 
05:08:45.590 --> 05:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
05:08:48.150 --> 05:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization as much as
 
05:08:49.990 --> 05:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
we're saying you know this is a new
 
05:08:52.868 --> 05:08:52.878 align:start position:0%
program this is a program that's that's
 
05:08:54.868 --> 05:08:54.878 align:start position:0%
developed in a bunch of other states in
 
05:08:56.788 --> 05:08:56.798 align:start position:0%
the in the united states it's not unique
 
05:08:58.868 --> 05:08:58.878 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire although there are
 
05:09:01.110 --> 05:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
parts of it that are unique to it and
 
05:09:04.070 --> 05:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization is not
 
05:09:07.190 --> 05:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
a new organization just a startup in new
 
05:09:09.750 --> 05:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire it's a national organization
 
05:09:13.030 --> 05:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
with headquarters in new york city so uh
 
05:09:15.110 --> 05:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
that and the scholarship organization
 
05:09:15.120 --> 05:09:16.230 align:start position:0%
that and the scholarship organization
runs

05:09:16.230 --> 05:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
runs
 
05:09:19.110 --> 05:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of programs in the other states as
 
05:09:19.120 --> 05:09:20.230 align:start position:0%
a lot of programs in the other states as
well

05:09:20.230 --> 05:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:09:21.750 --> 05:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
so and then we heard this morning
 
05:09:24.390 --> 05:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
actually that they had you know it isn't
 
05:09:26.070 --> 05:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
just the two people on the scholarship
 
05:09:28.310 --> 05:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
organization in new hampshire that the
 
05:09:31.110 --> 05:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
national scholarship organization has
 
05:09:33.990 --> 05:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
quite quite a deep resource of
 
05:09:35.350 --> 05:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
information and
 
05:09:38.310 --> 05:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
and ability to
 
05:09:40.788 --> 05:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
print you know to advertise to get
 
05:09:42.470 --> 05:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
materials whatever
 
05:09:45.350 --> 05:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
so um i think the
 
05:09:47.830 --> 05:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
the overriding thing is that
 
05:09:51.350 --> 05:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
we've got a department of education um
 
05:09:51.360 --> 05:09:52.150 align:start position:0%
we've got a department of education um
they

05:09:52.150 --> 05:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:09:54.150 --> 05:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
obviously every time we ask for things
 
05:09:57.190 --> 05:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
they don't have enough staff
 
05:09:59.990 --> 05:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
and we're a policy organizat committee
 
05:10:01.830 --> 05:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
not the finance committee if if they
 
05:10:04.868 --> 05:10:04.878 align:start position:0%
need more finances they need more people
 
05:10:06.708 --> 05:10:06.718 align:start position:0%
the department of education needs to go
 
05:10:08.868 --> 05:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
before finance that's not
 
05:10:11.510 --> 05:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be i think our issue our issue
 
05:10:11.520 --> 05:10:12.390 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be i think our issue our issue
is

05:10:12.390 --> 05:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:10:14.470 --> 05:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
there should be some
 
05:10:17.510 --> 05:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
centralized area and as i said this
 
05:10:19.750 --> 05:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
unique pupil identifier and the fact
 
05:10:21.670 --> 05:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at how to set up
 
05:10:23.590 --> 05:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
background checks and that sort of thing
 
05:10:24.948 --> 05:10:24.958 align:start position:0%
are all have to go through the
 
05:10:26.868 --> 05:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
05:10:29.830 --> 05:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
and so if they have to go through there
 
05:10:32.470 --> 05:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to me that
 
05:10:34.390 --> 05:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
some that the administration for this
 
05:10:36.310 --> 05:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
program that there should be a part in
 
05:10:38.948 --> 05:10:38.958 align:start position:0%
the doe that's administration of this
 
05:10:40.550 --> 05:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
program and that's why
 
05:10:42.150 --> 05:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
i would vote
 
05:10:44.550 --> 05:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
against the itl thanks
 
05:10:46.470 --> 05:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any for represent
 
05:10:46.480 --> 05:10:49.510 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any for represent
hobson

05:10:49.510 --> 05:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:51.030 --> 05:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i just would like to ask a
 
05:10:53.350 --> 05:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
clarifying question it seems to me that
 
05:10:55.270 --> 05:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
we've had plenty of bills go through
 
05:10:57.590 --> 05:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
looking for a position at the doe to
 
05:10:59.670 --> 05:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
help administer the efa
 
05:11:01.110 --> 05:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh program is
 
05:11:03.830 --> 05:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
did we in fact take that vote already i
 
05:11:05.750 --> 05:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
have not seen the rules
 
05:11:07.510 --> 05:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
that came out of jail car so i don't
 
05:11:11.750 --> 05:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:13.830 --> 05:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
that's still in process then
 
05:11:15.510 --> 05:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
it passed
 
05:11:23.190 --> 05:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:24.550 --> 05:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
05:11:26.788 --> 05:11:26.798 align:start position:0%
woodcock then representative lucas
 
05:11:28.310 --> 05:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
05:11:30.390 --> 05:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
i'm surprised this is
 
05:11:32.788 --> 05:11:32.798 align:start position:0%
a pretty bipartisan bill but i'm
 
05:11:36.310 --> 05:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
surprised that we would take a
 
05:11:38.948 --> 05:11:38.958 align:start position:0%
program that is
 
05:11:38.958 --> 05:11:39.830 align:start position:0%
program that is
uh

05:11:39.830 --> 05:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:11:41.910 --> 05:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
going to continue to increase i would
 
05:11:45.030 --> 05:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
say at least in the short term uh and we
 
05:11:46.390 --> 05:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
know we're
 
05:11:47.830 --> 05:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
paying a 10
 
05:11:47.840 --> 05:11:48.628 align:start position:0%
paying a 10
fee

05:11:48.628 --> 05:11:48.638 align:start position:0%
fee
 
05:11:51.190 --> 05:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
to a private organization as
 
05:11:54.390 --> 05:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
representative porter alluded uh
 
05:11:56.628 --> 05:11:56.638 align:start position:0%
on on marginal numbers that means right
 
05:11:59.990 --> 05:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
now it's 720 000 of paying them
 
05:12:02.150 --> 05:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
the paper
 
05:12:04.390 --> 05:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
and we have the opportunity for
 
05:12:05.910 --> 05:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
to bring this back in house for a lot
 
05:12:08.708 --> 05:12:08.718 align:start position:0%
less than 720 000
 
05:12:10.868 --> 05:12:10.878 align:start position:0%
and then continue to have oversight on
 
05:12:10.878 --> 05:12:11.990 align:start position:0%
and then continue to have oversight on
that

05:12:11.990 --> 05:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:12:14.550 --> 05:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
as we go on now i just think it makes a
 
05:12:16.390 --> 05:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
lot of taxpayer sense in this case the
 
05:12:16.400 --> 05:12:17.750 align:start position:0%
lot of taxpayer sense in this case the
transparency

05:12:17.750 --> 05:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
05:12:19.990 --> 05:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
and with doe going to have the
 
05:12:21.510 --> 05:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity multiple times and needs
 
05:12:23.910 --> 05:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
some data from them and vice versa
 
05:12:25.910 --> 05:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
well we're housing criminal background
 
05:12:27.590 --> 05:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
checks for how the other important
 
05:12:29.750 --> 05:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
aspects of education in youngstown new
 
05:12:31.830 --> 05:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire and which this is i mean yeah
 
05:12:33.510 --> 05:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
if you have 10 percent you have 1800
 
05:12:36.070 --> 05:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
kids in this program already climbing
 
05:12:39.030 --> 05:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
which is terrific for some respects but
 
05:12:40.948 --> 05:12:40.958 align:start position:0%
it should be handled inside by our
 
05:12:44.150 --> 05:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
people not by a small organization in
 
05:12:46.070 --> 05:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
new york city just making seven hundred
 
05:12:47.510 --> 05:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars a start you give
 
05:12:51.270 --> 05:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
it away annually giving it away
 
05:12:52.788 --> 05:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
05:12:54.788 --> 05:12:54.798 align:start position:0%

sorry just um pivoting on um rep
woodcock's

05:12:58.788 --> 05:12:58.798 align:start position:0%
woodcock's
 
05:13:02.390 --> 05:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
idea or comments uh wouldn't we pay
 
05:13:05.670 --> 05:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
don't other agencies use contractors and
 
05:13:09.190 --> 05:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
is ten percent uh common or
 
05:13:14.628 --> 05:13:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:16.628 --> 05:13:16.638 align:start position:0%
anyone who might have an answer i would
 
05:13:20.390 --> 05:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:22.070 --> 05:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the real positive note
 
05:13:24.230 --> 05:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
there the senior member i hope that
 
05:13:25.990 --> 05:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean more white hair or less i'm
 
05:13:28.230 --> 05:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
out of the republican side okay thank
 
05:13:28.240 --> 05:13:28.948 align:start position:0%
out of the republican side okay thank
you

05:13:28.948 --> 05:13:28.958 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:13:31.590 --> 05:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
um we do contract a number of services
 
05:13:33.110 --> 05:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
over there professional development by
 
05:13:35.510 --> 05:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
way of essa is contracted out
 
05:13:37.750 --> 05:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
and that's a very important aspect of
 
05:13:39.910 --> 05:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
education here getting our staff all
 
05:13:42.390 --> 05:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
trained in certain topics so yeah
 
05:13:45.270 --> 05:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
contracting services to third parties is
 
05:13:47.430 --> 05:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
very typical throughout all the states
 
05:13:50.550 --> 05:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:52.310 --> 05:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
follow up i would concur with you as a
 
05:13:53.910 --> 05:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
senior member i wouldn't wouldn't try to
 
05:13:56.150 --> 05:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
change that but that being said that
 
05:13:58.230 --> 05:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't negate the fact that this this
 
05:14:02.390 --> 05:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
contract of 72 7 what 707
 
05:14:05.990 --> 05:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
200 000 70 to 720 000
 
05:14:09.190 --> 05:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
or more rounded off 800 yeah yeah and a
 
05:14:11.510 --> 05:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
thousand and climbing um can be done
 
05:14:13.750 --> 05:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
in-house and when we have the control of
 
05:14:15.670 --> 05:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
it um the essa grants or the p
 
05:14:16.868 --> 05:14:16.878 align:start position:0%
professional development grants you're
 
05:14:18.788 --> 05:14:18.798 align:start position:0%
bringing in resource people this is
 
05:14:20.390 --> 05:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
something that's not this is not
 
05:14:22.310 --> 05:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh you know ultra
 
05:14:23.990 --> 05:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
difficult this this is a a
 
05:14:25.670 --> 05:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
organizational piece you have you have
 
05:14:27.270 --> 05:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
every expert you can possibly think of
 
05:14:29.750 --> 05:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
in doe right there on your resource this
 
05:14:31.430 --> 05:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
is just in 10 years there's seven
 
05:14:33.590 --> 05:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars of fees you paid for no
 
05:14:34.868 --> 05:14:34.878 align:start position:0%
reason they have it right there it's not
 
05:14:36.390 --> 05:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
going to cost and they have the control
 
05:14:38.230 --> 05:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
that's all i just unless you're just not
 
05:14:39.270 --> 05:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
going to cost money it's going to cost
 
05:14:40.868 --> 05:14:40.878 align:start position:0%
money how you do it i just think it's
 
05:14:42.070 --> 05:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
better to have it in-house so we can
 
05:14:43.350 --> 05:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
control it ourselves and have all the
 
05:14:44.788 --> 05:14:44.798 align:start position:0%
data we need
 
05:14:46.830 --> 05:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh representative

is a very expensive
 
05:15:07.350 --> 05:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
piece of software and is now being used
 
05:15:10.150 --> 05:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
by anyone who wants to develop

05:15:22.868 --> 05:15:22.878 align:start position:0%
off the bat for the pers first six years
 
05:15:23.830 --> 05:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
or so
 
05:15:25.510 --> 05:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
because they were trying to do a paper
 
05:15:27.430 --> 05:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
system not an automated system and it
 
05:15:31.350 --> 05:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
was a reimbursement system to the
 
05:15:33.030 --> 05:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
to the families
 
05:15:34.708 --> 05:15:34.718 align:start position:0%
and they did have some
 
05:15:36.550 --> 05:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
problems that were found
 
05:15:38.310 --> 05:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
in audits
 
05:15:40.948 --> 05:15:40.958 align:start position:0%
due to the fact and they are now moving
 
05:15:40.958 --> 05:15:41.750 align:start position:0%
due to the fact and they are now moving
to

05:15:41.750 --> 05:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:15:44.390 --> 05:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
implement the class wallet system so
 
05:15:44.400 --> 05:15:46.550 align:start position:0%
implement the class wallet system so
anyone

05:15:46.550 --> 05:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
05:15:49.030 --> 05:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
implementing such a program such as
 
05:15:50.628 --> 05:15:50.638 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund that has
 
05:15:52.230 --> 05:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
done this
 
05:15:55.350 --> 05:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
is now contracting with class wallet or
 
05:15:59.030 --> 05:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
a similar system because you need that
 
05:16:01.510 --> 05:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
electronic capability to track those
 
05:16:03.990 --> 05:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
expenses and make sure the
 
05:16:06.230 --> 05:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
expenses that are submitted
 
05:16:08.708 --> 05:16:08.718 align:start position:0%
are valid even though it then goes
 
05:16:10.948 --> 05:16:10.958 align:start position:0%
through a manual check in addition to
 
05:16:13.750 --> 05:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative moffitt
 
05:16:15.990 --> 05:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh represent woodcut
 
05:16:18.550 --> 05:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
really get my attention um
 
05:16:21.270 --> 05:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
extrapolating that's 800 000 out to 7
 
05:16:24.230 --> 05:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
million over time i think that's a very
 
05:16:26.708 --> 05:16:26.718 align:start position:0%
good point it gets my attention but i i
 
05:16:27.990 --> 05:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
do need to say
 
05:16:29.990 --> 05:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
that as i said my
 
05:16:33.590 --> 05:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
initial remarks the program is is in its
 
05:16:36.070 --> 05:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
infancy and i note that the effective
 
05:16:38.070 --> 05:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
date is july
 
05:16:40.628 --> 05:16:40.638 align:start position:0%
for us 2022 that's almost here i mean
 
05:16:42.788 --> 05:16:42.798 align:start position:0%
we're almost in the march and it's this
 
05:16:44.628 --> 05:16:44.638 align:start position:0%
bill's still in committee
 
05:16:45.750 --> 05:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
so i i
 
05:16:48.310 --> 05:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
i i think it would be good for us to
 
05:16:50.628 --> 05:16:50.638 align:start position:0%
especially if the cfa position ends up
 
05:16:52.070 --> 05:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
with doe i think that's something we
 
05:16:53.270 --> 05:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
should look at
 
05:16:55.910 --> 05:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
but this particular bill
 
05:16:57.590 --> 05:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
is just not going to work uh in the
 
05:16:59.510 --> 05:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
short term before uh
 
05:17:03.350 --> 05:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
july 1st 2022.
 
05:17:05.670 --> 05:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
yeah representative lucas
 
05:17:09.110 --> 05:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
and then representative woodcock
 
05:17:11.430 --> 05:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
since when has it been cheaper you guys
 
05:17:13.430 --> 05:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
were talking about money cheaper for a
 
05:17:15.430 --> 05:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
government to do something than a
 
05:17:17.830 --> 05:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
private organization
 
05:17:20.310 --> 05:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
and there are five staff people
 
05:17:22.230 --> 05:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
currently in new hampshire to deal with
 
05:17:25.990 --> 05:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
this plus the wallet plus other things
 
05:17:28.390 --> 05:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
it i mean they're doing well to keep the
 
05:17:30.070 --> 05:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
money down to what they're keeping it
 
05:17:31.350 --> 05:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
down to
 
05:17:31.360 --> 05:17:32.550 align:start position:0%
down to
and

05:17:32.550 --> 05:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:17:35.350 --> 05:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
if you wanted i mean the department of
 
05:17:37.270 --> 05:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
education would have to hire at least
 
05:17:39.110 --> 05:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
those five people
 
05:17:39.120 --> 05:17:40.070 align:start position:0%
those five people
plus

05:17:40.070 --> 05:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
plus
 
05:17:42.868 --> 05:17:42.878 align:start position:0%
and i'd my understanding is they don't
 
05:17:46.550 --> 05:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:48.070 --> 05:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
the d.o.e
 
05:17:49.910 --> 05:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative what represent woodcock
 
05:17:51.030 --> 05:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
well i'm sure there's a lot of things we
 
05:17:53.030 --> 05:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
passed and the idea we doesn't want
 
05:17:54.708 --> 05:17:54.718 align:start position:0%
this happens on a regular basis or
 
05:17:56.868 --> 05:17:56.878 align:start position:0%
things they do want um but that being
 
05:17:58.470 --> 05:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
said if i recall on representative
 
05:18:00.948 --> 05:18:00.958 align:start position:0%
cordelia's comment when when this
 
05:18:02.708 --> 05:18:02.718 align:start position:0%
program first came in
 
05:18:05.110 --> 05:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh they weren't talking wallet
 
05:18:06.390 --> 05:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
they were talking when we first started
 
05:18:09.350 --> 05:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
their type of paper i agree 100 uh
 
05:18:11.190 --> 05:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
glenn that that that wallet is the way
 
05:18:13.270 --> 05:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
to go or some some facts will be thereof
 
05:18:14.948 --> 05:18:14.958 align:start position:0%
um and it took arizona six years to
 
05:18:16.470 --> 05:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
figure out but when we started that they
 
05:18:18.390 --> 05:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
were still talking paper but that's but
 
05:18:20.550 --> 05:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
that did not negate the fact that no
 
05:18:22.550 --> 05:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
matter what
 
05:18:25.990 --> 05:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
i t system that dlt would use
 
05:18:27.830 --> 05:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
it'll be our system and i understand
 
05:18:29.430 --> 05:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
it's gonna be costly any other program
 
05:18:31.430 --> 05:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
is on the computer today but it's still
 
05:18:33.830 --> 05:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
our money i control our taxes and i i
 
05:18:36.070 --> 05:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
can't help but think the possible future
 
05:18:37.990 --> 05:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
of this program and the connections with
 
05:18:39.990 --> 05:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
doe right there all the stuff the data
 
05:18:41.430 --> 05:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
they can get it'll be perfect the
 
05:18:43.350 --> 05:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
transparency everything in the end is
 
05:18:44.868 --> 05:18:44.878 align:start position:0%
going to cost a whole lot less that's
 
05:18:46.310 --> 05:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
all it's not going to change the program
 
05:18:47.590 --> 05:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not trying to wipe out the program
 
05:18:49.510 --> 05:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
we're trying to say bring if you wanted
 
05:18:52.230 --> 05:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
an ef a program here let's run it our
 
05:18:52.240 --> 05:18:54.150 align:start position:0%
an ef a program here let's run it our
way

05:18:54.150 --> 05:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
way
 
05:18:56.550 --> 05:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you further discussion
 
05:18:59.110 --> 05:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:09.270 --> 05:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:13.510 --> 05:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:14.948 --> 05:19:14.958 align:start position:0%
well you can take it first to
 
05:19:17.190 --> 05:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight and then
 
05:19:18.868 --> 05:19:18.878 align:start position:0%
they can do it
 
05:19:18.878 --> 05:19:19.590 align:start position:0%
they can do it
yeah

05:19:19.590 --> 05:19:19.600 align:start position:0%

chair's concern on page two at line 14
 
05:22:31.910 --> 05:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
to change five business days to ten
 
05:22:33.510 --> 05:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
business days
 
05:22:34.948 --> 05:22:34.958 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
05:22:36.548 --> 05:22:36.558 align:start position:0%
the um the
 
05:22:37.670 --> 05:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
05:22:40.470 --> 05:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
do not believe the uh the rules
 
05:22:42.708 --> 05:22:42.718 align:start position:0%
go as far as um
 
05:22:44.868 --> 05:22:44.878 align:start position:0%
1670 uh
 
05:22:46.310 --> 05:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
05:22:48.628 --> 05:22:48.638 align:start position:0%
uh do in um
 
05:22:48.638 --> 05:22:49.590 align:start position:0%
uh do in um
in

05:22:49.590 --> 05:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:22:52.150 --> 05:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
managing the uh the requirements of the
 
05:22:54.868 --> 05:22:54.878 align:start position:0%
program following termination
 
05:22:56.230 --> 05:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:22:59.030 --> 05:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
and like i say the the
 
05:23:01.590 --> 05:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
it's very important at least
 
05:23:03.910 --> 05:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
at least with respect to uh the chair's
 
05:23:06.230 --> 05:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
suggestion to move um
 
05:23:08.628 --> 05:23:08.638 align:start position:0%
from as quickly as possible to within 10
 
05:23:12.150 --> 05:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
business days for notification of an uh
 
05:23:14.310 --> 05:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
of that an education service provider is
 
05:23:17.510 --> 05:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
no longer eligible to receive uh funds
 
05:23:19.350 --> 05:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
we feel is that uh that's pretty
 
05:23:22.470 --> 05:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
important and um and and as as is the
 
05:23:25.190 --> 05:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
entire bill so i would
 
05:23:26.788 --> 05:23:26.798 align:start position:0%
be happy to
 
05:23:29.670 --> 05:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
give the chair a copy of the amendment
 
05:23:30.788 --> 05:23:30.798 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:23:32.948 --> 05:23:32.958 align:start position:0%
should should the chair feel that the
 
05:23:35.510 --> 05:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
amendment is worth considering
 
05:23:36.708 --> 05:23:36.718 align:start position:0%
uh for the whole committee i've got
 
05:23:39.030 --> 05:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
copies for everybody but
 
05:23:41.270 --> 05:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
that's um i think i've seen do you have
 
05:23:45.510 --> 05:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
a copy for the clerk i do yeah
 
05:23:47.670 --> 05:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
we'll just pass it around
 
05:23:49.750 --> 05:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
so basically this changes that one from
 
05:23:57.190 --> 05:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:59.510 --> 05:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
so is there any further discussion on on
 
05:24:02.230 --> 05:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:05.030 --> 05:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
not seeing any um
 
05:24:07.670 --> 05:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
if i yes i would just point in in rules
 
05:24:07.680 --> 05:24:08.390 align:start position:0%
if i yes i would just point in in rules
it

05:24:08.390 --> 05:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:24:16.430 --> 05:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:21.990 --> 05:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:27.350 --> 05:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:43.030 --> 05:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:43.040 --> 05:24:49.990 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:24:49.990 --> 05:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:52.788 --> 05:24:52.798 align:start position:0%
because everybody have a copy of this
 
05:24:52.798 --> 05:24:53.910 align:start position:0%
because everybody have a copy of this
so

05:24:53.910 --> 05:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:24:55.830 --> 05:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on the
 
05:24:59.030 --> 05:24:59.040 align:start position:0%

i just found out some information and i
 
05:26:56.548 --> 05:26:56.558 align:start position:0%

know there is a withdrawal form
 
05:27:01.990 --> 05:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
that people fill out when they're going
 
05:27:04.230 --> 05:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
to exit the program i can forward a copy
 
05:27:07.270 --> 05:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
to anybody who wants it also
 
05:27:08.948 --> 05:27:08.958 align:start position:0%
if the account has been open for more
 
05:27:11.270 --> 05:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
than a year the family is welcome to
 
05:27:13.910 --> 05:27:13.920 align:start position:0%

05:27:15.510 --> 05:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
forfeit it and it'll go back to the
 
05:27:20.788 --> 05:27:20.798 align:start position:0%

05:28:31.110 --> 05:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh represent lucas would you uh like to
 
05:28:33.350 --> 05:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion i sure would thank
 
05:28:35.670 --> 05:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome this bill has a
 
05:28:38.868 --> 05:28:38.878 align:start position:0%
plethora of problems
 
05:28:42.150 --> 05:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
um i won't find everyone
 
05:28:44.150 --> 05:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
but let's see
 
05:28:46.708 --> 05:28:46.718 align:start position:0%
uh the termination of the efa and the
 
05:28:48.470 --> 05:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
transfer of any remaining funds back to
 
05:28:50.868 --> 05:28:50.878 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund
 
05:28:52.548 --> 05:28:52.558 align:start position:0%
that doesn't allow for current
 
05:28:55.990 --> 05:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
transactions as we spoke about before
 
05:28:57.990 --> 05:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
some of these things take a while to
 
05:28:58.000 --> 05:28:59.430 align:start position:0%
some of these things take a while to
order

05:28:59.430 --> 05:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
order
 
05:29:02.070 --> 05:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
and if the parent is already on the hook
 
05:29:03.110 --> 05:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
for it
 
05:29:06.548 --> 05:29:06.558 align:start position:0%
and it is coming but not arrived yet
 
05:29:08.868 --> 05:29:08.878 align:start position:0%
that money needs and and
 
05:29:11.190 --> 05:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
that money needs to be used to cover
 
05:29:11.200 --> 05:29:12.628 align:start position:0%
that money needs to be used to cover
that

05:29:12.628 --> 05:29:12.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:29:12.638 --> 05:29:13.990 align:start position:0%
that
um

05:29:13.990 --> 05:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:16.948 --> 05:29:16.958 align:start position:0%
the whole section four
 
05:29:20.788 --> 05:29:20.798 align:start position:0%
has already been covered by the rules
 
05:29:23.670 --> 05:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
and approved by joe carr
 
05:29:23.680 --> 05:29:28.470 align:start position:0%

[Music]

05:29:28.470 --> 05:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:31.830 --> 05:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
the on d a parent or efa student may
 
05:29:33.750 --> 05:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
appeal the scholarship organization's
 
05:29:36.150 --> 05:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
decision to deny eligibility for the a
 
05:29:38.628 --> 05:29:38.638 align:start position:0%
program to the an exchange to state
 
05:29:40.310 --> 05:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
board of education
 
05:29:41.910 --> 05:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know why it's going to the state
 
05:29:44.868 --> 05:29:44.878 align:start position:0%
board of education because the doe
 
05:29:44.878 --> 05:29:45.910 align:start position:0%
board of education because the doe
is

05:29:45.910 --> 05:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:29:48.150 --> 05:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
going to have hopefully a coordinator
 
05:29:50.948 --> 05:29:50.958 align:start position:0%
that would deal with that
 
05:29:54.628 --> 05:29:54.638 align:start position:0%
similarly down on line 15
 
05:29:55.750 --> 05:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
in b
 
05:29:58.390 --> 05:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
why not the doe coordinator
 
05:30:00.070 --> 05:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
why are we taking it away from the
 
05:30:01.670 --> 05:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
department and giving it to the state
 
05:30:04.948 --> 05:30:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:07.110 --> 05:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
and then taking out this whole section
 
05:30:09.110 --> 05:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
putting it on
 
05:30:11.030 --> 05:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
the doe
 
05:30:13.750 --> 05:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
so the department shall adopt rules
 
05:30:16.390 --> 05:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
which they have done
 
05:30:18.628 --> 05:30:18.638 align:start position:0%
but then all these other things with ha
 
05:30:20.230 --> 05:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
which have to do with the day-to-day
 
05:30:21.990 --> 05:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
running of the program
 
05:30:24.150 --> 05:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
should not the
 
05:30:25.910 --> 05:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
people who are doing the day-to-day
 
05:30:28.548 --> 05:30:28.558 align:start position:0%
running be the ones that work on that
 
05:30:30.948 --> 05:30:30.958 align:start position:0%
that's the policies and procedures for
 
05:30:33.190 --> 05:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
doing their job
 
05:30:34.948 --> 05:30:34.958 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:30:37.750 --> 05:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
ensuring an appropriate use and over
 
05:30:40.390 --> 05:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
rigorous oversight of all funds well the
 
05:30:42.470 --> 05:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization is already
 
05:30:44.070 --> 05:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
doing that but
 
05:30:45.670 --> 05:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
the whole thing
 
05:30:47.510 --> 05:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
has an oversight committee that's
 
05:30:47.520 --> 05:30:48.548 align:start position:0%
has an oversight committee that's
already

05:30:48.548 --> 05:30:48.558 align:start position:0%
already
 
05:30:50.628 --> 05:30:50.638 align:start position:0%
you know the efa oversight committee
 
05:30:52.470 --> 05:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
that's already doing that and that has
 
05:30:53.910 --> 05:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
an oversight committee because we're
 
05:30:56.470 --> 05:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
already oversighted and oversighted
 
05:30:59.670 --> 05:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
at any rate so that's just some of them
 
05:31:02.470 --> 05:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
but that'll do
 
05:31:04.150 --> 05:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there is there
 
05:31:07.510 --> 05:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:08.868 --> 05:31:08.878 align:start position:0%
represent luna
 
05:31:11.110 --> 05:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair um so what
 
05:31:14.470 --> 05:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
we uh what we just heard um um omits a
 
05:31:16.788 --> 05:31:16.798 align:start position:0%
whole lot of things and uh and
 
05:31:19.590 --> 05:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
particularly where it where um uh where
 
05:31:24.548 --> 05:31:24.558 align:start position:0%
we heard about the um uh use of the uh
 
05:31:26.310 --> 05:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
deferral to the state board of education
 
05:31:27.750 --> 05:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
for appeals that's what the state board
 
05:31:30.708 --> 05:31:30.718 align:start position:0%
of education does as a matter of fact so
 
05:31:33.990 --> 05:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
um so uh so i think i think
 
05:31:37.830 --> 05:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
when you take a look at 1672 and you
 
05:31:39.190 --> 05:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
take a look at
 
05:31:40.868 --> 05:31:40.878 align:start position:0%
the first
 
05:31:42.230 --> 05:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
three sections
 
05:31:44.310 --> 05:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
which improve the integrity of the
 
05:31:46.868 --> 05:31:46.878 align:start position:0%
program and you take a look at section
 
05:31:46.878 --> 05:31:47.750 align:start position:0%
program and you take a look at section
four

05:31:47.750 --> 05:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
four
 
05:31:50.150 --> 05:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
which improves the accountability pro of
 
05:31:53.110 --> 05:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
the of the program uh by specifically
 
05:31:55.030 --> 05:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
eliminating so this hasn't been covered
 
05:31:58.310 --> 05:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
in rules this eliminates the um the word
 
05:32:00.548 --> 05:32:00.558 align:start position:0%
intentional and does not put the
 
05:32:02.150 --> 05:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization in the
 
05:32:04.548 --> 05:32:04.558 align:start position:0%
untenable position of making some sort
 
05:32:07.430 --> 05:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
of determination about what is being
 
05:32:09.510 --> 05:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
being done willfully and
 
05:32:11.910 --> 05:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
um and knowingly to defraud the
 
05:32:14.628 --> 05:32:14.638 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of the state of new hampshire
 
05:32:16.628 --> 05:32:16.638 align:start position:0%
so by taking out the word intentional it
 
05:32:18.470 --> 05:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
take it puts takes the scholarship
 
05:32:20.548 --> 05:32:20.558 align:start position:0%
organization out of that impossible
 
05:32:20.558 --> 05:32:21.750 align:start position:0%
organization out of that impossible
position

05:32:21.750 --> 05:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
position
 
05:32:23.030 --> 05:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:32:27.110 --> 05:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
and then finally uh which um which the
 
05:32:29.350 --> 05:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
representative made the motion to kill
 
05:32:30.830 --> 05:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:32:34.150 --> 05:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
um talked about the importance of the
 
05:32:34.160 --> 05:32:34.868 align:start position:0%
um talked about the importance of the
or

05:32:34.868 --> 05:32:34.878 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:32:37.110 --> 05:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
or the lack of importance for the
 
05:32:40.548 --> 05:32:40.558 align:start position:0%
department to be involved in setting
 
05:32:42.390 --> 05:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
rules that ensure the appropriate use
 
05:32:44.470 --> 05:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
and rigorous oversight of all funds
 
05:32:47.030 --> 05:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
expended under the program so that's all
 
05:32:49.190 --> 05:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money expended out of the
 
05:32:51.270 --> 05:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
program including the 10 percent of
 
05:32:53.590 --> 05:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money that gets creamed right
 
05:32:55.670 --> 05:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
off the top and retained within the
 
05:32:57.990 --> 05:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization a cost that's
 
05:33:00.070 --> 05:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
now approaching a million dollars and
 
05:33:02.868 --> 05:33:02.878 align:start position:0%
it's probably on its way to 10 times
 
05:33:05.510 --> 05:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
that once um once all private and
 
05:33:07.830 --> 05:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
homeschool kids
 
05:33:09.110 --> 05:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
jump into
 
05:33:11.350 --> 05:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
this program so i think there's a lot
 
05:33:13.830 --> 05:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
more oversight that that needs to be
 
05:33:15.830 --> 05:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
done in order to protect
 
05:33:18.390 --> 05:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money and
 
05:33:18.400 --> 05:33:19.110 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money and
and

05:33:19.110 --> 05:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:33:21.110 --> 05:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
and really serve the integrity of this
 
05:33:22.708 --> 05:33:22.718 align:start position:0%
program otherwise i don't think this
 
05:33:25.350 --> 05:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
program is going to last very long thank
 
05:33:25.360 --> 05:33:26.150 align:start position:0%
program is going to last very long thank
you

uh
 
05:39:02.150 --> 05:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
i just can't see pulling the rug out
 
05:39:05.350 --> 05:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
from out from under the 1800 students
 
05:39:07.670 --> 05:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh especially uh for the price that
 
05:39:09.990 --> 05:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
we're getting at at 25 cents on the
 
05:39:10.000 --> 05:39:11.110 align:start position:0%
we're getting at at 25 cents on the
dollar

05:39:11.110 --> 05:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
05:39:13.270 --> 05:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
a great uh example of the free market at
 
05:39:15.590 --> 05:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
work i only wish we could
 
05:39:17.510 --> 05:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
do a little bit more of that
 
05:39:19.350 --> 05:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
thank you any further discussion from
 
05:39:20.788 --> 05:39:20.798 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
05:39:22.310 --> 05:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes
 
05:39:24.230 --> 05:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much um i really
 
05:39:26.070 --> 05:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
questioned 25 cents on the dollar
 
05:39:28.548 --> 05:39:28.558 align:start position:0%
because for the vast majority of the
 
05:39:31.270 --> 05:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
1800 students and we'll get we'll get a
 
05:39:34.390 --> 05:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
detailed breakdown i'm sure very soon
 
05:39:37.190 --> 05:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
from the um from the uh the contracting
 
05:39:39.830 --> 05:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh organization at least according to
 
05:39:41.430 --> 05:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
mr southington
 
05:39:43.910 --> 05:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
um that that that these are students
 
05:39:46.868 --> 05:39:46.878 align:start position:0%
that weren't costing the state anything
 
05:39:50.230 --> 05:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
so so it's it's 25 cents on the zero
 
05:39:52.310 --> 05:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
that that they were currently causing
 
05:39:55.030 --> 05:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
morally obligated
 
05:39:56.470 --> 05:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
don't go there right now
 
05:39:59.430 --> 05:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
respond later so so i think you know as
 
05:40:02.070 --> 05:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
as as information does come out
 
05:40:05.270 --> 05:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
about the adoption rate of the um of
 
05:40:07.190 --> 05:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
into the program participation into the
 
05:40:09.510 --> 05:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
program we'll get a real understanding
 
05:40:11.750 --> 05:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
of what the cost is to new hampshire
 
05:40:15.030 --> 05:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and what sort of opportunities
 
05:40:17.990 --> 05:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
this program is really um opening up for
 
05:40:19.830 --> 05:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
students who were already in private
 
05:40:22.390 --> 05:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
schools already being home schooled so
 
05:40:22.400 --> 05:40:23.110 align:start position:0%

the first one and possibly the biggest
 
05:40:49.600 --> 05:40:50.788 align:start position:0%
the first one and possibly the biggest
one

05:40:50.788 --> 05:40:50.798 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:40:52.708 --> 05:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
was was rejected on the floor of the
 
05:40:55.110 --> 05:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
house last week which would have held
 
05:40:56.948 --> 05:40:56.958 align:start position:0%
the program to be responsible to
 
05:40:58.470 --> 05:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
budgeted amounts
 
05:41:01.110 --> 05:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
and uh and this is this is frankly
 
05:41:03.350 --> 05:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
something that is is hemorrhaging state
 
05:41:05.590 --> 05:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
dollars where no state dollars were
 
05:41:08.070 --> 05:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
being spent uh in the past the budget
 
05:41:10.230 --> 05:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
was 129 000
 
05:41:13.030 --> 05:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
and now it's if it's 1800 students i'm
 
05:41:14.948 --> 05:41:14.958 align:start position:0%
sure we're probably over 9 million
 
05:41:14.958 --> 05:41:17.030 align:start position:0%
sure we're probably over 9 million
dollars

05:41:17.030 --> 05:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:41:19.830 --> 05:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
coming out of state funds for uh for
 
05:41:21.910 --> 05:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
students that were not costing
 
05:41:23.430 --> 05:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
the state anything
 
05:41:25.990 --> 05:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
and um and for students who were
 
05:41:29.670 --> 05:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
were not costing local taxpayers
 
05:41:31.750 --> 05:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
anything so it hasn't provided any
 
05:41:35.350 --> 05:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
savings at uh at either level um
 
05:41:37.110 --> 05:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
that bill was rejected on the floor of
 
05:41:39.910 --> 05:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
the house last week
 
05:41:41.990 --> 05:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
and uh and just today
 
05:41:43.990 --> 05:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
oh and i should say that
 
05:41:45.910 --> 05:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment to that bill that
 
05:41:47.750 --> 05:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
would have provided consideration for
 
05:41:50.230 --> 05:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
students already in the program so so
 
05:41:51.910 --> 05:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
that we're not so cold-hearted that
 
05:41:53.510 --> 05:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
we're throwing people out or making
 
05:41:56.548 --> 05:41:56.558 align:start position:0%
people repay money it would it would
 
05:41:59.190 --> 05:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
would hold the program to uh to the
 
05:42:02.070 --> 05:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
actual cost for the these first two
 
05:42:03.830 --> 05:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
years in the biennium and then to
 
05:42:06.230 --> 05:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
budgeted costs in future use and put the
 
05:42:07.670 --> 05:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
department in a position where it needs
 
05:42:10.628 --> 05:42:10.638 align:start position:0%
to justify their budget before the
 
05:42:11.990 --> 05:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
05:42:13.910 --> 05:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
so uh just today
 
05:42:16.070 --> 05:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
we rejected criminal background checks
 
05:42:16.080 --> 05:42:17.110 align:start position:0%
we rejected criminal background checks
okay

05:42:17.110 --> 05:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:42:19.350 --> 05:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
there's uh and we even heard we even
 
05:42:21.910 --> 05:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
heard a representative around this table
 
05:42:23.910 --> 05:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
saying student safety is a parent's
 
05:42:26.150 --> 05:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility no criminal background
 
05:42:27.910 --> 05:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
checks it's the responsibility of the
 
05:42:29.510 --> 05:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
parents to make sure
 
05:42:31.990 --> 05:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
that uh that that's uh that that's in
 
05:42:36.070 --> 05:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
place so um that was rejected today the
 
05:42:38.548 --> 05:42:38.558 align:start position:0%
notice of parents that that the rights
 
05:42:40.948 --> 05:42:40.958 align:start position:0%
for children with disabilities under
 
05:42:40.958 --> 05:42:42.390 align:start position:0%
for children with disabilities under
idea

05:42:42.390 --> 05:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
idea
 
05:42:43.590 --> 05:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
just know what you have and know what
 
05:42:45.590 --> 05:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
you don't have didn't actually change
 
05:42:47.350 --> 05:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
the policy at all other than a
 
05:42:49.510 --> 05:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
notification requirement other than a
 
05:42:50.948 --> 05:42:50.958 align:start position:0%
warning sticker
 
05:42:53.670 --> 05:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
and um and nope we're not going to do
 
05:42:56.628 --> 05:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
that so uh so you know you find out as
 
05:42:58.788 --> 05:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
you as you enter the program maybe you
 
05:43:01.670 --> 05:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
didn't know and uh and and we'll see
 
05:43:03.590 --> 05:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
what uh we'll see what happens good luck
 
05:43:05.910 --> 05:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
parents and also good luck on the tax
 
05:43:07.910 --> 05:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
liability so
 
05:43:10.470 --> 05:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
the law says and probably the rules say
 
05:43:13.190 --> 05:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
hey guess what these uh distributions
 
05:43:15.030 --> 05:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
from the state directed at the parents
 
05:43:17.270 --> 05:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh request are not subject to federal
 
05:43:19.670 --> 05:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
tax lab actually the law says not
 
05:43:22.230 --> 05:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
subject to tax liability but in new
 
05:43:24.628 --> 05:43:24.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire our tax liability our income
 
05:43:27.670 --> 05:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
tax liability is a federal uh income tax
 
05:43:31.990 --> 05:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
liability so um again no policy change
 
05:43:34.470 --> 05:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
other than just being truthful
 
05:43:35.750 --> 05:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
with people who are looking at the
 
05:43:35.760 --> 05:43:37.030 align:start position:0%
with people who are looking at the
program

05:43:37.030 --> 05:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:43:38.310 --> 05:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
and knowing what they're getting into
 
05:43:41.750 --> 05:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
but nope that's been been rejected um uh
 
05:43:44.548 --> 05:43:44.558 align:start position:0%
the fraud prevention and i agree that
 
05:43:46.708 --> 05:43:46.718 align:start position:0%
the rules improve upon where the
 
05:43:49.430 --> 05:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
temporary rules were and uh and improve
 
05:43:52.310 --> 05:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
upon where the where the the the law
 
05:43:55.910 --> 05:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
says as far as fraud must be reported to
 
05:43:58.788 --> 05:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
uh to either state or local officials
 
05:44:01.430 --> 05:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
for investigation but it holds the
 
05:44:03.830 --> 05:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization to such an
 
05:44:06.868 --> 05:44:06.878 align:start position:0%
incredible standard to determine
 
05:44:08.948 --> 05:44:08.958 align:start position:0%
what is what is what is willful and
 
05:44:08.958 --> 05:44:10.150 align:start position:0%
what is what is what is willful and
knowledgeable

05:44:10.150 --> 05:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable
 
05:44:11.590 --> 05:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
05:44:13.990 --> 05:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of intent to defraud the state
 
05:44:16.548 --> 05:44:16.558 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire i have no idea how a
 
05:44:18.708 --> 05:44:18.718 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization is going to be
 
05:44:21.110 --> 05:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
able to meet that high threshold that
 
05:44:23.910 --> 05:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
really is up to uh to law enforcement
 
05:44:25.430 --> 05:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
officials and the attorney general's
 
05:44:25.440 --> 05:44:26.390 align:start position:0%
officials and the attorney general's
office

05:44:26.390 --> 05:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
office
 
05:44:27.590 --> 05:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:44:30.070 --> 05:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
so and then and then just a couple more
 
05:44:33.030 --> 05:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
things we also rejected today a bill
 
05:44:34.788 --> 05:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
that would have put a little bit of
 
05:44:36.470 --> 05:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
accountability in terms of student
 
05:44:39.430 --> 05:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
outcomes let's make sure taxpayers know
 
05:44:41.190 --> 05:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
how well students that are taking
 
05:44:44.470 --> 05:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
vouchers are doing we're being told that
 
05:44:46.310 --> 05:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
that they just can't succeed in their
 
05:44:48.390 --> 05:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
their uh their public schools well how
 
05:44:50.310 --> 05:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
are they exceeding in in the in their
 
05:44:50.320 --> 05:44:51.190 align:start position:0%
are they exceeding in in the in their
new

05:44:51.190 --> 05:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
new
 
05:44:53.110 --> 05:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
in their new environments well i guess
 
05:44:55.510 --> 05:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
we'll never know because uh because the
 
05:44:57.110 --> 05:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
law um
 
05:44:59.830 --> 05:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow us to and the bill to uh
 
05:45:02.150 --> 05:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
to provide some transparency there was
 
05:45:04.628 --> 05:45:04.638 align:start position:0%
uh was defeated again like all of these
 
05:45:07.270 --> 05:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
things were on on straight party-line
 
05:45:07.280 --> 05:45:08.548 align:start position:0%
things were on on straight party-line
votes

05:45:08.548 --> 05:45:08.558 align:start position:0%
votes
 
05:45:11.190 --> 05:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
so taxpayers are never going to know
 
05:45:13.430 --> 05:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
how students are doing using their using
 
05:45:14.868 --> 05:45:14.878 align:start position:0%
their money we certainly know when it
 
05:45:16.070 --> 05:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
comes to public schools right
 
05:45:18.150 --> 05:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
representative porter public schools we
 
05:45:20.150 --> 05:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
know how our public schools our students
 
05:45:22.070 --> 05:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
in our public schools are doing and we
 
05:45:24.390 --> 05:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
know that that in in overall in new
 
05:45:26.230 --> 05:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire our students in public schools
 
05:45:27.910 --> 05:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
are among the best in the country we see
 
05:45:30.310 --> 05:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
that over and over in terms of student
 
05:45:32.868 --> 05:45:32.878 align:start position:0%
student outcome ratings it's just not
 
05:45:34.830 --> 05:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
happening everywhere it's happening in
 
05:45:37.030 --> 05:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
hopkinton i know it's half gonna happen
 
05:45:38.708 --> 05:45:38.718 align:start position:0%
we got great student outcomes but we
 
05:45:40.708 --> 05:45:40.718 align:start position:0%
don't have to go very far from hopkinton
 
05:45:42.548 --> 05:45:42.558 align:start position:0%
20 minutes up the road to newport you've
 
05:45:43.910 --> 05:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
got the lowest
 
05:45:45.910 --> 05:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
student average performance in the
 
05:45:47.990 --> 05:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
entire state um
 
05:45:49.750 --> 05:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
and right above that and it's just a
 
05:45:51.750 --> 05:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
scoach above that is the average student
 
05:45:54.150 --> 05:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
in manchester and that's a complete
 
05:45:56.868 --> 05:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
disservice for for the state and sort of
 
05:45:59.110 --> 05:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
viewing off where where we are but we
 
05:46:01.350 --> 05:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
know but in fact we know
 
05:46:03.670 --> 05:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
how our public schools are doing and
 
05:46:04.788 --> 05:46:04.798 align:start position:0%
based on
 
05:46:06.070 --> 05:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
the current law we're never going to
 
05:46:07.910 --> 05:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
know how students with vouchers are
 
05:46:07.920 --> 05:46:08.708 align:start position:0%
know how students with vouchers are
doing

05:46:08.708 --> 05:46:08.718 align:start position:0%
doing
 
05:46:10.548 --> 05:46:10.558 align:start position:0%
and then finally
 
05:46:10.558 --> 05:46:12.230 align:start position:0%
and then finally
um

05:46:12.230 --> 05:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:14.390 --> 05:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
and i've probably missed a few
 
05:46:17.110 --> 05:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're we're letting 10
 
05:46:20.070 --> 05:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
of our precious state dollars fly out
 
05:46:23.030 --> 05:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:25.590 --> 05:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
basically being being carved right off
 
05:46:26.548 --> 05:46:26.558 align:start position:0%
the top
 
05:46:28.548 --> 05:46:28.558 align:start position:0%
and retained within the scholarship
 
05:46:31.670 --> 05:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
organization to for their own purposes
 
05:46:34.070 --> 05:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
and it's got to be closing in a million
 
05:46:35.910 --> 05:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
bucks and it's going to be a lot higher
 
05:46:36.948 --> 05:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
than that
 
05:46:36.958 --> 05:46:37.750 align:start position:0%
than that
um

05:46:37.750 --> 05:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:40.548 --> 05:46:40.558 align:start position:0%
to uh to be retained by an organization
 
05:46:42.708 --> 05:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
that has a current the form of state rep
 
05:46:44.628 --> 05:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
on their board of directors
 
05:46:46.628 --> 05:46:46.638 align:start position:0%
so um so
 
05:46:49.510 --> 05:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
for for these reasons mr chair
 
05:46:51.270 --> 05:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
i honestly don't see how this this
 
05:46:53.830 --> 05:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
program succeeds in the long run even in
 
05:46:55.990 --> 05:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
the show i mean it it it's probably
 
05:46:56.000 --> 05:46:56.868 align:start position:0%
the show i mean it it it's probably
gonna

05:46:56.868 --> 05:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
05:46:58.470 --> 05:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
gonna keep going on
 
05:47:00.708 --> 05:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
um given the uh given the current
 
05:47:03.990 --> 05:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
composition of the um of the legislature
 
05:47:06.230 --> 05:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
but uh but i don't see how it extends
 
05:47:08.470 --> 05:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
beyond that unless we can really get
 
05:47:11.030 --> 05:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
serious about looking after taxpayer
 
05:47:14.548 --> 05:47:14.558 align:start position:0%
dollars and and looking after the the
 
05:47:17.190 --> 05:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
the safety the welfare and the
 
05:47:19.670 --> 05:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
performance outcomes of our students
 
05:47:21.750 --> 05:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
across the state thank you
 
05:47:24.788 --> 05:47:24.798 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative boom
 
05:47:28.070 --> 05:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh
 
05:47:30.548 --> 05:47:30.558 align:start position:0%
the accountability
 
05:47:30.558 --> 05:47:31.830 align:start position:0%
the accountability
issue

05:47:31.830 --> 05:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
issue
 
05:47:33.510 --> 05:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
same issue we had when we started
 
05:47:36.470 --> 05:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
charter schools the same argument
 
05:47:36.480 --> 05:47:37.910 align:start position:0%
charter schools the same argument
parents

05:47:37.910 --> 05:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
parents
 
05:47:41.030 --> 05:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
can take their kids out of the efa
 
05:47:42.868 --> 05:47:42.878 align:start position:0%
they can take their kids out of charter
 
05:47:45.030 --> 05:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
schools that's the accountability that
 
05:47:47.190 --> 05:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
public schools don't have because in a
 
05:47:49.750 --> 05:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
lot of cases parents can't take their
 
05:47:52.070 --> 05:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
kids out of public school unless they
 
05:47:53.750 --> 05:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
have someplace else to take them in a
 
05:47:55.750 --> 05:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
lot of places there isn't any place else
 
05:47:58.868 --> 05:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
to take them so the efa is a good point
 
05:48:00.548 --> 05:48:00.558 align:start position:0%
for the parents to get their
 
05:48:00.558 --> 05:48:02.150 align:start position:0%
for the parents to get their
accountability

05:48:02.150 --> 05:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
05:48:04.708 --> 05:48:04.718 align:start position:0%
it goes and yet public schools are doing
 
05:48:07.190 --> 05:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
good in some places not in all
 
05:48:07.200 --> 05:48:07.910 align:start position:0%
good in some places not in all
and

05:48:07.910 --> 05:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:48:07.920 --> 05:48:08.708 align:start position:0%
and
um

05:48:08.708 --> 05:48:08.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:11.030 --> 05:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
and that's compared to 10 years ago and
 
05:48:13.990 --> 05:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
not doing that good now so anyway so
 
05:48:15.190 --> 05:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
that's just one
 
05:48:17.430 --> 05:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
the best thing is with the efa the
 
05:48:19.670 --> 05:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
parents can determine what is best for
 
05:48:21.190 --> 05:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
the student if they don't like where
 
05:48:22.788 --> 05:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
they're sending the student they can
 
05:48:24.310 --> 05:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
move them they can send them back to the
 
05:48:27.030 --> 05:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
public school so that's
 
05:48:29.430 --> 05:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
where to get parental choice
 
05:48:30.868 --> 05:48:30.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:48:32.230 --> 05:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
i'm glad you're back
 
05:48:40.150 --> 05:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:43.110 --> 05:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
very often when we have bills when they
 
05:48:46.150 --> 05:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
are no longer needed we itl them
 
05:48:49.030 --> 05:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
many of these bills we itl today were
 
05:48:51.670 --> 05:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
done because the rules are already in
 
05:48:54.708 --> 05:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
place and they are unnecessary
 
05:48:57.270 --> 05:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
and in fact there was a bill that
 
05:49:00.548 --> 05:49:00.558 align:start position:0%
michael moff and i were both sponsors uh
 
05:49:03.670 --> 05:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors of because it was needed but
 
05:49:07.030 --> 05:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
it was cleared up in rules and we itl
 
05:49:10.070 --> 05:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
that as well because that's what you do
 
05:49:12.868 --> 05:49:12.878 align:start position:0%
you don't then pass a bill that's on
 
05:49:15.030 --> 05:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
something that's already been done it's
 
05:49:18.070 --> 05:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and so quite a few of those
 
05:49:21.830 --> 05:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
thousand cuts were not passed because
 
05:49:25.750 --> 05:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
they were unnecessary as far as the
 
05:49:25.760 --> 05:49:28.788 align:start position:0%
they were unnecessary as far as the
um

05:49:28.788 --> 05:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:30.788 --> 05:49:30.798 align:start position:0%
background checks goes
 
05:49:33.270 --> 05:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
we already had that discussion
 
05:49:36.788 --> 05:49:36.798 align:start position:0%
the the doe is not ready yet they said
 
05:49:39.830 --> 05:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
give them some time in the meantime yes
 
05:49:42.470 --> 05:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
parents should use their common sense
 
05:49:45.270 --> 05:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
and it says and it was stated
 
05:49:47.110 --> 05:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
what each thing was
 
05:49:50.230 --> 05:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
right the on the list what the rule what
 
05:49:52.548 --> 05:49:52.558 align:start position:0%
they did what what what background
 
05:49:54.310 --> 05:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
checks there were or not so parents
 
05:49:56.390 --> 05:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
could decide they're not doing back
 
05:49:58.628 --> 05:49:58.638 align:start position:0%
check background checks i'm not sending
 
05:50:01.830 --> 05:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
my kid there that's all clear open and
 
05:50:01.840 --> 05:50:03.830 align:start position:0%
my kid there that's all clear open and
transparent

05:50:03.830 --> 05:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
05:50:06.390 --> 05:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
and then the
 
05:50:09.110 --> 05:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
the whole thing with oh well we can't
 
05:50:09.120 --> 05:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
the whole thing with oh well we can't
know

05:50:10.200 --> 05:50:10.210 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:50:10.210 --> 05:50:15.590 align:start position:0%
know
[Music]

05:50:15.590 --> 05:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:18.868 --> 05:50:18.878 align:start position:0%
we can't know you know we we we just got
 
05:50:20.230 --> 05:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
rid of
 
05:50:22.390 --> 05:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
and don't let parents know what's going
 
05:50:25.190 --> 05:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
on i already said it is already
 
05:50:25.200 --> 05:50:26.470 align:start position:0%
on i already said it is already
published

05:50:26.470 --> 05:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
published
 
05:50:29.510 --> 05:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay they did it yesterday it's there
 
05:50:31.910 --> 05:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's easy it's in the parent document
 
05:50:34.390 --> 05:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
it's in the application program it's
 
05:50:36.708 --> 05:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
there why are we passing a law to do
 
05:50:39.510 --> 05:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
something that's there so many of these
 
05:50:41.430 --> 05:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
things they're already being done why
 
05:50:43.670 --> 05:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
are we passing laws to do something
 
05:50:45.990 --> 05:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's already done so no we're not
 
05:50:47.510 --> 05:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
cutting the
 
05:50:49.830 --> 05:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
thousand cutting the thing by not doing
 
05:50:52.628 --> 05:50:52.638 align:start position:0%
all these things they were already done
 
05:50:55.270 --> 05:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
these bills were premature
 
05:50:56.948 --> 05:50:56.958 align:start position:0%
when they were written they made a lot
 
05:50:58.868 --> 05:50:58.878 align:start position:0%
of sense because we didn't have the
 
05:51:01.670 --> 05:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
rules then we have the rules now we have
 
05:51:03.670 --> 05:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
the rules now so the bills are no longer
 
05:51:06.708 --> 05:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
necessary so we itl them just like we
 
05:51:09.510 --> 05:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
itld our own bill because it's no longer
 
05:51:09.520 --> 05:51:11.270 align:start position:0%
itld our own bill because it's no longer
necessary

05:51:11.270 --> 05:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
05:51:14.070 --> 05:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
but as far as money goes
 
05:51:16.628 --> 05:51:16.638 align:start position:0%
i hear all the time from members on this
 
05:51:19.110 --> 05:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
committee how much we need to help the
 
05:51:21.750 --> 05:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
poor kids how much we need to give more
 
05:51:24.548 --> 05:51:24.558 align:start position:0%
money to the poor kids i remember last
 
05:51:26.628 --> 05:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
year that one of the problems
 
05:51:29.110 --> 05:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
was that oh we're going to be taking all
 
05:51:30.948 --> 05:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
these kids out of the public schools and
 
05:51:33.030 --> 05:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
that was the problem well guess what we
 
05:51:35.750 --> 05:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
didn't take that many immediately this
 
05:51:37.430 --> 05:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
this immediate time out of the public
 
05:51:39.430 --> 05:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
schools they left most of them the year
 
05:51:41.510 --> 05:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
before but now the problem is we didn't
 
05:51:43.510 --> 05:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
take them out of the public schools i
 
05:51:45.670 --> 05:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
don't get you know well we did or we
 
05:51:48.390 --> 05:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
didn't either way it's a problem i guess
 
05:51:51.430 --> 05:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
it's just a way to argue and kill this
 
05:51:53.750 --> 05:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
thing that's helping lots of kids the
 
05:51:55.830 --> 05:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
other part of it is aren't we supposed
 
05:51:58.470 --> 05:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
to be helping kids in need what about
 
05:52:01.110 --> 05:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
the parent who was here multiple times
 
05:52:04.150 --> 05:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
whose kid was sent out of the public
 
05:52:05.590 --> 05:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
school because of his mental
 
05:52:08.310 --> 05:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
disabilities who tried to go to another
 
05:52:10.390 --> 05:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
public school and they wouldn't take him
 
05:52:12.708 --> 05:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
because of his mental disabilities who
 
05:52:15.270 --> 05:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
tried to go to a private school and
 
05:52:16.788 --> 05:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't take him because of his
 
05:52:18.948 --> 05:52:18.958 align:start position:0%
mental disabilities and the mom is now
 
05:52:21.670 --> 05:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
homeschooling should she not get some
 
05:52:24.230 --> 05:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
support for the state for that kid since
 
05:52:25.910 --> 05:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
they're letting her down in all the rest
 
05:52:27.270 --> 05:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
of the ways
 
05:52:29.590 --> 05:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
i mean this is money that was this is
 
05:52:31.590 --> 05:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
state money this is not
 
05:52:33.910 --> 05:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
local money and we keep hearing the
 
05:52:36.390 --> 05:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
signs out there from misinformation
 
05:52:38.708 --> 05:52:38.718 align:start position:0%
going around we're stealing money from
 
05:52:40.548 --> 05:52:40.558 align:start position:0%
the public schools we're killing the
 
05:52:42.948 --> 05:52:42.958 align:start position:0%
public schools well obviously we're not
 
05:52:45.750 --> 05:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
that not that many kids left this year
 
05:52:48.230 --> 05:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
and we're not taking any of the local
 
05:52:50.150 --> 05:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
money those parents are still paying
 
05:52:52.868 --> 05:52:52.878 align:start position:0%
their taxes they're paying local taxes
 
05:52:55.110 --> 05:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
to send other kids to school
 
05:52:57.110 --> 05:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
and having to educate their own kids and
 
05:52:58.948 --> 05:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
provide for their own kids because it's
 
05:53:00.628 --> 05:53:00.638 align:start position:0%
not working for them in the public
 
05:53:02.628 --> 05:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
schools and we can't even give them the
 
05:53:04.628 --> 05:53:04.638 align:start position:0%
state money that's supposed to provide
 
05:53:06.708 --> 05:53:06.718 align:start position:0%
an adequate education for all the
 
05:53:09.590 --> 05:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
students in the state i believe when you
 
05:53:12.230 --> 05:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
were when when the bill was being
 
05:53:12.240 --> 05:53:13.350 align:start position:0%
were when when the bill was being
presented

05:53:13.350 --> 05:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
presented
 
05:53:16.628 --> 05:53:16.638 align:start position:0%
about the new way of funding i forget
 
05:53:19.750 --> 05:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
which number that is what the foundation
 
05:53:22.390 --> 05:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
i heard multiple quotes every child in
 
05:53:25.030 --> 05:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
this state is one of our children these
 
05:53:26.868 --> 05:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
are all our children we need to make
 
05:53:28.390 --> 05:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
sure every single child in the state
 
05:53:31.190 --> 05:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
gets an adequate education and yet we're
 
05:53:33.590 --> 05:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
refusing we want to take away
 
05:53:36.548 --> 05:53:36.558 align:start position:0%
this money that's much less than than is
 
05:53:38.390 --> 05:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
being paid in the public schools we want
 
05:53:40.708 --> 05:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
to take this state money away from those
 
05:53:43.030 --> 05:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
kids who can't otherwise get an adequate
 
05:53:43.040 --> 05:53:45.350 align:start position:0%
kids who can't otherwise get an adequate
education

05:53:45.350 --> 05:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:53:47.270 --> 05:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
i don't understand
 
05:53:49.030 --> 05:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
i don't understand where anybody is
 
05:53:51.670 --> 05:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
coming from you heard all those kids you
 
05:53:53.830 --> 05:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
heard all those parents the problems
 
05:53:55.910 --> 05:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
they had the reason they couldn't get an
 
05:53:57.910 --> 05:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
education in the public school the
 
05:53:59.990 --> 05:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
advantages that they were having now how
 
05:54:01.910 --> 05:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
much better they're doing now and you
 
05:54:04.310 --> 05:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
just want to say oh sorry you got to go
 
05:54:06.150 --> 05:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
back to the public school
 
05:54:08.310 --> 05:54:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh yeah we know you can't afford to go
 
05:54:10.310 --> 05:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
to a
 
05:54:12.310 --> 05:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
private school so we're just not going
 
05:54:13.830 --> 05:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
to help you you got to go back to the
 
05:54:15.990 --> 05:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
public school which wasn't working for
 
05:54:17.990 --> 05:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
you i mean i thought this was about
 
05:54:19.590 --> 05:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
educating kids
 
05:54:22.948 --> 05:54:22.958 align:start position:0%
and it looks like it's not
 
05:54:24.310 --> 05:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:54:26.548 --> 05:54:26.558 align:start position:0%
is there is any more discussion from the
 
05:54:26.558 --> 05:54:28.310 align:start position:0%
is there is any more discussion from the
committee

05:54:28.310 --> 05:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:54:30.150 --> 05:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
lastly just to correct one thing which
 
05:54:31.670 --> 05:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
was mentioned
 
05:54:34.310 --> 05:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh we do want accountability
 
05:54:35.750 --> 05:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
and the
 
05:54:38.470 --> 05:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh bill which came forward to us
 
05:54:40.628 --> 05:54:40.638 align:start position:0%
there are three ways to identify
 
05:54:40.638 --> 05:54:42.788 align:start position:0%
there are three ways to identify
accountability

05:54:42.788 --> 05:54:42.798 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
05:54:44.788 --> 05:54:44.798 align:start position:0%
for a student in the efa program as
 
05:54:47.830 --> 05:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
there is in other programs here one to
 
05:54:50.788 --> 05:54:50.798 align:start position:0%
have the standardized norm referenced
 
05:54:52.628 --> 05:54:52.638 align:start position:0%
test administered
 
05:54:55.510 --> 05:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
that was eliminated in that amendment
 
05:54:57.590 --> 05:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
and we're anxious to see
 
05:55:00.548 --> 05:55:00.558 align:start position:0%
tools that are aligned with
 
05:55:02.708 --> 05:55:02.718 align:start position:0%
what the curriculum is all about so
 
05:55:05.350 --> 05:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
we're assessing the curriculum not
 
05:55:08.628 --> 05:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
necessarily some norm referenced test
 
05:55:11.030 --> 05:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
which is necessarily aligned around
 
05:55:13.670 --> 05:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
the state or the federal government
 
05:55:15.190 --> 05:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:55:17.830 --> 05:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
the test we use statewide here is also
 
05:55:19.590 --> 05:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
norm reference test so we just
 
05:55:21.030 --> 05:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
eliminated one of the
 
05:55:22.628 --> 05:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
the instruments
 
05:55:24.548 --> 05:55:24.558 align:start position:0%
and it's a shame that we
 
05:55:26.708 --> 05:55:26.718 align:start position:0%
measure progress we look at progress
 
05:55:28.628 --> 05:55:28.638 align:start position:0%
based on an instrument that's given once
 
05:55:30.868 --> 05:55:30.878 align:start position:0%
a year in the spring we don't see the
 
05:55:32.708 --> 05:55:32.718 align:start position:0%
results until the fall
 
05:55:34.948 --> 05:55:34.958 align:start position:0%
we eliminated or it was an attempt to
 
05:55:36.628 --> 05:55:36.638 align:start position:0%
eliminate the opportunity to use the
 
05:55:38.628 --> 05:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
norm reference test which afforded like
 
05:55:38.638 --> 05:55:39.430 align:start position:0%
norm reference test which afforded like
the

05:55:39.430 --> 05:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:55:41.110 --> 05:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
some of the tests which we are using
 
05:55:43.190 --> 05:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
within the school districts right now
 
05:55:45.110 --> 05:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
the star math star reading which can be
 
05:55:47.350 --> 05:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
given four times a year at various times
 
05:55:49.270 --> 05:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
and measure growth and see where the
 
05:55:50.390 --> 05:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
student is
 
05:55:54.310 --> 05:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
secondly the eliminating of a portfolio
 
05:55:56.628 --> 05:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
of work that's been achieved and
 
05:55:59.270 --> 05:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
completed by a student
 
05:56:01.430 --> 05:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
that is a wonderful way to determine
 
05:56:03.430 --> 05:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
that the student knows how to apply the
 
05:56:05.350 --> 05:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
skills and now it's the learning through
 
05:56:06.788 --> 05:56:06.798 align:start position:0%
their program
 
05:56:08.868 --> 05:56:08.878 align:start position:0%
and it's an excellent way to see whether
 
05:56:11.510 --> 05:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
we are hitting the mark
 
05:56:13.430 --> 05:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes these numbers we see on tests
 
05:56:15.030 --> 05:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
are not really reflective of what its
 
05:56:16.310 --> 05:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
students able to do because we have
 
05:56:17.670 --> 05:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
different styles of learning and
 
05:56:19.430 --> 05:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
different styles of teaching
 
05:56:21.750 --> 05:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
so i i think there was a lot done today
 
05:56:24.150 --> 05:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
we also looked at several of the bills
 
05:56:26.788 --> 05:56:26.798 align:start position:0%
uh including the bill
 
05:56:29.110 --> 05:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
that dealt with 1376 which dealt with
 
05:56:31.350 --> 05:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
disabilities and we've asked that some
 
05:56:33.190 --> 05:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
amending language come forward so that
 
05:56:35.830 --> 05:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
we can better address the issue which
 
05:56:38.230 --> 05:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
was presented in that particular bill
 
05:56:40.070 --> 05:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
we're also looking at
 
05:56:41.990 --> 05:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
yes we believe that parents should be
 
05:56:44.150 --> 05:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
informed what a
 
05:56:46.390 --> 05:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
particular provider in an efa program
 
05:56:48.150 --> 05:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
does provide and some of the background
 
05:56:52.150 --> 05:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
of them we like the idea of profile the
 
05:56:55.350 --> 05:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
the profiles uh directory and profiles
 
05:56:57.590 --> 05:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
of the providers that be placed there
 
05:57:00.628 --> 05:57:00.638 align:start position:0%
but a laundry list of uh issues or
 
05:57:02.310 --> 05:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
elements within that which don't
 
05:57:05.590 --> 05:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily apply to both online or or
 
05:57:08.470 --> 05:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
those uh ways of teaching one-to-one
 
05:57:11.030 --> 05:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
with a child or in a small group
 
05:57:12.628 --> 05:57:12.638 align:start position:0%
they're different
 
05:57:14.070 --> 05:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:57:16.230 --> 05:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
let's be honest with folks and try to
 
05:57:18.470 --> 05:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
develop something which really reflects
 
05:57:20.150 --> 05:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
what parents might be interested to help
 
05:57:22.628 --> 05:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
them in selecting an efa program
 
05:57:27.030 --> 05:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
so i think that there is a lot of
 
05:57:29.590 --> 05:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
a desire to work together to try to
 
05:57:31.910 --> 05:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
develop a program which best fits the
 
05:57:33.670 --> 05:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
child who's looking for it we cannot
 
05:57:36.628 --> 05:57:36.638 align:start position:0%
afford to lose any children in the state
 
05:57:38.868 --> 05:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
with 1800 students participating in that
 
05:57:41.590 --> 05:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
program right now that's 1800 adults
 
05:57:43.590 --> 05:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
that will later go on and become part of
 
05:57:47.990 --> 05:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:48.000 --> 05:57:48.788 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:57:48.788 --> 05:57:48.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:57:51.430 --> 05:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
not annually but they will go on
 
05:57:51.440 --> 05:57:52.628 align:start position:0%
not annually but they will go on
and

05:57:52.628 --> 05:57:52.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:57:55.270 --> 05:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
we need to have everybody prepared we
 
05:57:56.788 --> 05:57:56.798 align:start position:0%
can't afford in a state where our
 
05:57:59.270 --> 05:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
demographic is sliding down
 
05:58:01.190 --> 05:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
we've lost how many since
 
05:58:02.948 --> 05:58:02.958 align:start position:0%
20 30 years ago
 
05:58:05.190 --> 05:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
huge number of students
 
05:58:07.270 --> 05:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
we need them to to attract businesses to
 
05:58:08.628 --> 05:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
the state so
 
05:58:10.628 --> 05:58:10.638 align:start position:0%
the efa is just one of the options one
 
05:58:12.708 --> 05:58:12.718 align:start position:0%
of the alternative programs that we can
 
05:58:15.990 --> 05:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
offer students and keep kids in school
 
05:58:17.910 --> 05:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
and provide the best fit and the best
 
05:58:20.788 --> 05:58:20.798 align:start position:0%
form of instruction that they need so
 
05:58:22.948 --> 05:58:22.958 align:start position:0%
i'm proud of what we're doing i'm proud
 
05:58:24.868 --> 05:58:24.878 align:start position:0%
of the direction that we are going in
 
05:58:26.628 --> 05:58:26.638 align:start position:0%
and i hope that we can continue to work
 
05:58:29.110 --> 05:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
together as a committee to try to find
 
05:58:31.190 --> 05:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
resolution on some of these areas where
 
05:58:33.190 --> 05:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
we've asked that we come back and work
 
05:58:36.070 --> 05:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
together on amending language
 
05:58:36.080 --> 05:58:36.948 align:start position:0%
together on amending language
so

05:58:36.948 --> 05:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:58:38.708 --> 05:58:38.718 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion yes
 
05:58:41.110 --> 05:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
representative litchfield
 
05:58:42.230 --> 05:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
just on a
 
05:58:44.230 --> 05:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
sorry on a positive note and some food
 
05:58:47.430 --> 05:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
for thought i have children both in
 
05:58:49.750 --> 05:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
public and private schools and i think
 
05:58:51.830 --> 05:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
the majority vast majority of parents
 
05:58:53.350 --> 05:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
prefer their child to be the local
 
05:58:54.708 --> 05:58:54.718 align:start position:0%
public school because quite honestly
 
05:58:56.310 --> 05:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
that's how you become part of the
 
05:58:58.150 --> 05:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
community right
 
05:59:00.150 --> 05:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
that being said though i just want to
 
05:59:02.230 --> 05:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
share that when it comes to looking at
 
05:59:04.070 --> 05:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
how your child is doing in the private
 
05:59:06.470 --> 05:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
school or how that school is doing one
 
05:59:08.548 --> 05:59:08.558 align:start position:0%
of the things that i know i look at is
 
05:59:10.390 --> 05:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
what are the psat scores what are the
 
05:59:12.948 --> 05:59:12.958 align:start position:0%
sat scores at these schools right they
 
05:59:14.150 --> 05:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
offer that
 
05:59:15.990 --> 05:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
the other thing i look at is the college
 
05:59:18.390 --> 05:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
matriculation i do not look at the list
 
05:59:20.470 --> 05:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
of acceptances because each class you
 
05:59:22.548 --> 05:59:22.558 align:start position:0%
could have one or two children that may
 
05:59:24.548 --> 05:59:24.558 align:start position:0%
really excel and they could get into six
 
05:59:25.910 --> 05:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
excellent schools either i don't think
 
05:59:27.910 --> 05:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
that's a great barometer but that being
 
05:59:30.230 --> 05:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
said i look at the matriculation when it
 
05:59:32.230 --> 05:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
comes to middle schools we have certain
 
05:59:33.750 --> 05:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
middle schools in our area that are
 
05:59:37.190 --> 05:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
feeder schools for let's say a pea
 
05:59:39.750 --> 05:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
i look at my children and i see how you
 
05:59:41.510 --> 05:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
know they're doing two and a half hours
 
05:59:43.750 --> 05:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
of homework and i look at the in-depth
 
05:59:45.590 --> 05:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
projects that they're doing i look at
 
05:59:47.830 --> 05:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
how they're starting to teach me things
 
05:59:50.390 --> 05:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
now whereas their counterparts locally
 
05:59:52.070 --> 05:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
they laugh at my kids and they joke and
 
05:59:53.590 --> 05:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
they say huh we have one worksheet a
 
05:59:55.270 --> 05:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
week of homework and homework's not the
 
05:59:57.190 --> 05:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
end i'll be all i wish my kids had more
 
05:59:59.350 --> 05:59:59.360 align:start position:0%
of a childhood but i just want to say
 
06:00:01.510 --> 06:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
that there are other indicators out
 
06:00:01.520 --> 06:00:02.470 align:start position:0%
that there are other indicators out
there

06:00:02.470 --> 06:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:00:04.948 --> 06:00:04.958 align:start position:0%
that you can take a look at just to see
 
06:00:06.788 --> 06:00:06.798 align:start position:0%
you know how these other schools are
 
06:00:08.948 --> 06:00:08.958 align:start position:0%
working out
 
06:00:10.390 --> 06:00:10.400 align:start position:0%

go ahead representative mullen thank you
 
06:02:32.628 --> 06:02:32.638 align:start position:0%
mr chair okay so just to refresh your
 
06:02:36.390 --> 06:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
memories uh house bill 1594
 
06:02:39.750 --> 06:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
was the bill that uh
 
06:02:42.708 --> 06:02:42.718 align:start position:0%
seeks to have students who are either on
 
06:02:45.670 --> 06:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
a 504 or an iep
 
06:02:45.680 --> 06:02:47.190 align:start position:0%
a 504 or an iep
plan

06:02:47.190 --> 06:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
plan
 
06:02:50.070 --> 06:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
consider uh whether or not it's of their
 
06:02:51.670 --> 06:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
team consider whether or not it's
 
06:02:53.510 --> 06:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate to develop
 
06:02:56.470 --> 06:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
a transition plan that includes how to
 
06:02:59.270 --> 06:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
register to vote and what process
 
06:03:01.750 --> 06:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
one needs to go through to become a
 
06:03:05.830 --> 06:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
voting adult after the age of 18.
 
06:03:08.070 --> 06:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
there was an escape hatch
 
06:03:08.080 --> 06:03:08.708 align:start position:0%
there was an escape hatch
in

06:03:08.708 --> 06:03:08.718 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:03:10.230 --> 06:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
section 2
 
06:03:13.110 --> 06:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
which sort of allowed schools not to
 
06:03:15.510 --> 06:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
have to do that if they were already
 
06:03:19.270 --> 06:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
doing an alternative type of an activity
 
06:03:21.750 --> 06:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
to educate students about the process of
 
06:03:23.910 --> 06:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
registering and voting
 
06:03:26.150 --> 06:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
we agreed as a committee that that was
 
06:03:29.750 --> 06:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
probably not a great provision of the
 
06:03:29.760 --> 06:03:30.788 align:start position:0%
probably not a great provision of the
bill

06:03:30.788 --> 06:03:30.798 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:03:33.990 --> 06:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
because it would allow some kids with
 
06:03:37.830 --> 06:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
504s and ieps to slip through
 
06:03:41.110 --> 06:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
without having the determination made by
 
06:03:42.390 --> 06:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
their team
 
06:03:42.400 --> 06:03:43.990 align:start position:0%
their team
and

06:03:43.990 --> 06:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:03:45.030 --> 06:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
it didn't
 
06:03:49.190 --> 06:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't spell out the process so
 
06:03:51.590 --> 06:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
as a result the amendment that you have
 
06:03:54.708 --> 06:03:54.718 align:start position:0%
in front of you now which is amendment
 
06:03:54.718 --> 06:03:56.310 align:start position:0%
in front of you now which is amendment
2022

06:03:56.310 --> 06:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
2022
 
06:03:56.320 --> 06:03:57.990 align:start position:0%
2022
0814

06:03:57.990 --> 06:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
0814
 
06:03:58.000 --> 06:03:59.430 align:start position:0%
0814
h

06:03:59.430 --> 06:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
h
 
06:04:02.948 --> 06:04:02.958 align:start position:0%
simply eliminates section two
 
06:04:06.150 --> 06:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
so the bill is identical in section one
 
06:04:08.948 --> 06:04:08.958 align:start position:0%
to the bill that we considered yesterday
 
06:04:11.910 --> 06:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
and section two is gone okay and looking
 
06:04:13.190 --> 06:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
at this i'm trying to remember i don't
 
06:04:16.150 --> 06:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
think we had emotion on the table uh we
 
06:04:18.948 --> 06:04:18.958 align:start position:0%
did not so uh reversing mullen would you
 
06:04:21.510 --> 06:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
put forth a motion just ought to pass
 
06:04:23.510 --> 06:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
i'll second it and then we'll go with
 
06:04:25.430 --> 06:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
the amendment following that certainly
 
06:04:28.230 --> 06:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair i move that we
 
06:04:31.430 --> 06:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
ought to pass house bill 1594. i'll
 
06:04:34.628 --> 06:04:34.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:36.310 --> 06:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead
 
06:04:38.868 --> 06:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
so as i said uh the the amendment
 
06:04:41.990 --> 06:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
eliminates section two so i move that we
 
06:04:42.000 --> 06:04:42.830 align:start position:0%
eliminates section two so i move that we
uh

06:04:42.830 --> 06:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:04:45.110 --> 06:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
accept amendment
 
06:04:52.230 --> 06:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:54.390 --> 06:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
no further discussion i know i i'd like
 
06:04:55.910 --> 06:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
to talk about it because i think what
 
06:04:57.670 --> 06:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
you've got here is the amendment that
 
06:05:00.390 --> 06:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
really is strengthens the bill
 
06:05:00.400 --> 06:05:01.990 align:start position:0%
really is strengthens the bill
um

06:05:01.990 --> 06:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:03.670 --> 06:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the second part of it was
 
06:05:06.150 --> 06:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
an escape hatch exactly what it was
 
06:05:09.030 --> 06:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
escape hatch away from the iep right i
 
06:05:10.548 --> 06:05:10.558 align:start position:0%
don't believe the student that had the
 
06:05:12.708 --> 06:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
iep would get the help and assistance
 
06:05:14.548 --> 06:05:14.558 align:start position:0%
they would like to have
 
06:05:16.708 --> 06:05:16.718 align:start position:0%
as a transitional step
 
06:05:18.708 --> 06:05:18.718 align:start position:0%
uh leaving school and going into their
 
06:05:20.548 --> 06:05:20.558 align:start position:0%
adult career or
 
06:05:21.990 --> 06:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
adult lives
 
06:05:24.628 --> 06:05:24.638 align:start position:0%
and this would certainly be of
 
06:05:28.548 --> 06:05:28.558 align:start position:0%
assistance to them i also believe that
 
06:05:30.150 --> 06:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
if we're not doing we probably should be
 
06:05:32.390 --> 06:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
doing it in many of our social studies
 
06:05:34.548 --> 06:05:34.558 align:start position:0%
classes or other classes at the high
 
06:05:34.558 --> 06:05:35.750 align:start position:0%
classes or other classes at the high
schools

06:05:35.750 --> 06:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
schools
 
06:05:35.760 --> 06:05:37.350 align:start position:0%

a true
 
06:05:42.480 --> 06:05:43.510 align:start position:0%
a true
uh

06:05:43.510 --> 06:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:05:45.670 --> 06:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
resident and citizen of this country
 
06:05:47.830 --> 06:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
really means and that's the vote that
 
06:05:50.070 --> 06:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
you have the opportunity to vote in a
 
06:05:50.080 --> 06:05:51.430 align:start position:0%
you have the opportunity to vote in a
democracy

06:05:51.430 --> 06:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
06:05:54.548 --> 06:05:54.558 align:start position:0%
and and you're part of our our whole
 
06:05:56.788 --> 06:05:56.798 align:start position:0%
structure of government and if you
 
06:05:59.590 --> 06:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
negate to do that you're forfeiting many
 
06:06:00.868 --> 06:06:00.878 align:start position:0%
of those rights you have in the
 
06:06:00.878 --> 06:06:02.230 align:start position:0%

constitution

06:06:02.230 --> 06:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
constitution

and so
 
06:06:05.590 --> 06:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that we as as high
 
06:06:07.750 --> 06:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
school people and even in the grade
 
06:06:09.270 --> 06:06:09.280 align:start position:0%

06:06:11.510 --> 06:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
importance of you know
 
06:06:13.670 --> 06:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
doing what you need to do as a citizen
 
06:06:15.990 --> 06:06:16.000 align:start position:0%

06:06:19.030 --> 06:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
not just in your voting but also in the
 
06:06:20.868 --> 06:06:20.878 align:start position:0%

06:06:24.230 --> 06:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
local government at least in my
 
06:06:25.510 --> 06:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
particular community it's hard to get
 
06:06:28.230 --> 06:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
volunteers even for the zba or the
 
06:06:30.470 --> 06:06:30.480 align:start position:0%

06:17:44.868 --> 06:17:44.878 align:start position:0%
but we're going to have to have this
 
06:17:46.868 --> 06:17:46.878 align:start position:0%
scheduled the following week it'd be
 
06:17:48.470 --> 06:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
very difficult to do a schedule we have
 
06:17:50.070 --> 06:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
some people at doctors appointments we
 
06:17:51.750 --> 06:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
have some that are leaving town
 
06:17:53.670 --> 06:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
and others to have other you know
 
06:17:55.910 --> 06:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
arrangements already scheduled
 
06:17:59.110 --> 06:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
so that i don't think's in the cards
 
06:18:01.590 --> 06:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and
 
06:18:03.510 --> 06:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
hold the hearing we've been given
 
06:18:05.430 --> 06:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
permission to do so
 
06:18:08.310 --> 06:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
by the speaker and by the
 
06:18:09.590 --> 06:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
chief of staff
 
06:18:11.350 --> 06:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
and we'll have our services available
 
06:18:13.750 --> 06:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
streaming and all that will be here
 
06:18:16.470 --> 06:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
and we will hold it where we have
 
06:18:18.868 --> 06:18:18.878 align:start position:0%
indicated it and reps halt
 
06:18:21.110 --> 06:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
and if we have enough people following
 
06:18:23.110 --> 06:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
that on our committee there where we
 
06:18:25.990 --> 06:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
have the ratio of uh of republican
 
06:18:29.350 --> 06:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
sedans is as well as ten to nine
 
06:18:31.670 --> 06:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
if we have like a six to five a majority
 
06:18:33.670 --> 06:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
of people present we will go and forward
 
06:18:35.990 --> 06:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
and exact those bills
 
06:18:38.788 --> 06:18:38.798 align:start position:0%
um if we have the members present if we
 
06:18:40.708 --> 06:18:40.718 align:start position:0%
don't then we're gonna have to rush and
 
06:18:43.590 --> 06:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
get things done on the seventh
 
06:18:45.590 --> 06:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
and on the seventh we're going to have
 
06:18:47.830 --> 06:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
to clear up all the bills which we have
 
06:18:50.868 --> 06:18:50.878 align:start position:0%
an exact as of uh thursday when we go
 
06:18:50.878 --> 06:18:51.750 align:start position:0%
an exact as of uh thursday when we go
home

06:18:51.750 --> 06:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
home
 
06:18:53.510 --> 06:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
and we'll know the number it's going to
 
06:18:56.310 --> 06:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
be somewhere around 2025 bills
 
06:18:58.708 --> 06:18:58.718 align:start position:0%
that we will have to exact we got to
 
06:19:00.150 --> 06:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
have those done because we're going to
 
06:19:02.548 --> 06:19:02.558 align:start position:0%
have a session day on the 10th
 
06:19:04.150 --> 06:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
we have session and then there's a
 
06:19:08.310 --> 06:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
session day following that a week later
 
06:19:10.468 --> 06:19:10.478 align:start position:0%
and we
 
06:19:12.948 --> 06:19:12.958 align:start position:0%
well you know we can meet pla the place
 
06:19:14.468 --> 06:19:14.478 align:start position:0%
is open
 
06:19:17.990 --> 06:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
um and so that the ninth
 
06:19:20.868 --> 06:19:20.878 align:start position:0%
we can't be doing any business on these
 
06:19:23.270 --> 06:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
bills after noontime it's like any other
 
06:19:24.708 --> 06:19:24.718 align:start position:0%
time when that we're going getting ready
 
06:19:27.750 --> 06:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
to submit bills to go forward
 
06:19:30.230 --> 06:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
um so it was just like on the first
 
06:19:32.150 --> 06:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
round of bills we had to have out by the
 
06:19:33.670 --> 06:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh what was it the
 
06:19:36.310 --> 06:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
17th was it
 
06:19:39.110 --> 06:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
yeah 17th and so
 
06:19:40.948 --> 06:19:40.958 align:start position:0%
the date before we and they backed it
 
06:19:43.110 --> 06:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
off remember to the 10th
 
06:19:44.468 --> 06:19:44.478 align:start position:0%
and we had to have everything out of
 
06:19:46.390 --> 06:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
committee by noon on the ninth the same
 
06:19:48.070 --> 06:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
thing will exist because this go around
 
06:19:49.910 --> 06:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
too by noon on the ninth everything has
 
06:19:51.750 --> 06:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
to be out that means everything has to
 
06:19:53.590 --> 06:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
be written reports blurbs whatever you
 
06:19:56.548 --> 06:19:56.558 align:start position:0%
want to call them half be done
 
06:19:59.110 --> 06:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
so hopefully we can get down on the
 
06:19:59.120 --> 06:20:00.070 align:start position:0%
so hopefully we can get down on the
seventh

06:20:00.070 --> 06:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
seventh
 
06:20:01.430 --> 06:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
folks who have a little bit of time to
 
06:20:03.430 --> 06:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
write the blurbs up if they have to on
 
06:20:05.030 --> 06:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
the 8th
 
06:20:06.708 --> 06:20:06.718 align:start position:0%
or on the
 
06:20:08.628 --> 06:20:08.638 align:start position:0%
on the seventh which would be probably a
 
06:20:10.868 --> 06:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
better idea because we know lindsay has
 
06:20:13.110 --> 06:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
to type all that stuff or input them
 
06:20:15.430 --> 06:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
getting those as an attachment is making
 
06:20:18.230 --> 06:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
it much easier for her all she does is
 
06:20:19.910 --> 06:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
copy paste
 
06:20:23.030 --> 06:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
and much easier so uh if you have
 
06:20:25.830 --> 06:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
reports that are due right now since we
 
06:20:27.830 --> 06:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
last acted on these things
 
06:20:30.390 --> 06:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh at the last session that we've done
 
06:20:32.548 --> 06:20:32.558 align:start position:0%
since please be working on those right
 
06:20:35.910 --> 06:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
now and get them to me get them to dave
 
06:20:37.110 --> 06:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
or to mel
 
06:20:39.030 --> 06:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
and they need to come to me so i can
 
06:20:40.868 --> 06:20:40.878 align:start position:0%
look at them i send them all in one
 
06:20:43.350 --> 06:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
folder to lindsay
 
06:20:45.510 --> 06:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
and so both majority and minority
 
06:20:47.590 --> 06:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
reports and it's made a lot easier for
 
06:20:52.230 --> 06:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
her so try to get these reports done
 
06:20:54.230 --> 06:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
am i having to chase people down it's a
 
06:20:56.548 --> 06:20:56.558 align:start position:0%
pain in the bump
 
06:20:58.788 --> 06:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
so the rear end
 
06:21:02.868 --> 06:21:02.878 align:start position:0%
and uh i just can't continue to do that
 
06:21:05.110 --> 06:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
it's just just it's it's
 
06:21:07.190 --> 06:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
not what i'm going to do
 
06:21:07.200 --> 06:21:08.310 align:start position:0%
not what i'm going to do
so

06:21:08.310 --> 06:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:21:10.230 --> 06:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
please you know get it done i think we
 
06:21:12.230 --> 06:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
can do it all i think we can make this
 
06:21:15.830 --> 06:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:19.110 --> 06:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
no we have these bills on the morning
 
06:21:20.868 --> 06:21:20.878 align:start position:0%
friday friday
 
06:21:23.590 --> 06:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
and no let's see on thursday
 
06:21:27.350 --> 06:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
i i mean on that seventh
 
06:21:29.350 --> 06:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
see the bill you see on the seventh is a
 
06:21:32.390 --> 06:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
bill to exec and we put down one then
 
06:21:34.708 --> 06:21:34.718 align:start position:0%
everything that's not we can exec
 
06:21:37.110 --> 06:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
rather than having lindsay put every
 
06:21:39.030 --> 06:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
bill down every time we've been exacting
 
06:21:39.040 --> 06:21:40.868 align:start position:0%
bill down every time we've been exacting
that

06:21:40.868 --> 06:21:40.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:21:40.878 --> 06:21:42.548 align:start position:0%
that
perme

06:21:42.548 --> 06:21:42.558 align:start position:0%
perme
 
06:21:50.230 --> 06:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:51.750 --> 06:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
yeah some people are looking at our
 
06:21:53.030 --> 06:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
counter so you don't have a heavy load
 
06:21:55.750 --> 06:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
at all you only have one bill scheduled
 
06:21:57.510 --> 06:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
they don't know the truth
 
06:22:00.070 --> 06:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
yes so you know 103 bills which we've
 
06:22:01.910 --> 06:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
had is a lot of bills yeah
 
06:22:03.990 --> 06:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
so rick i think what you
 
06:22:06.390 --> 06:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
as far as hearings though it's the um
 
06:22:08.230 --> 06:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
it's the hearings right on friday and
 
06:22:09.830 --> 06:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's it we're done with hearings then
 
06:22:12.150 --> 06:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
we're done with hearings right so we're
 
06:22:14.948 --> 06:22:14.958 align:start position:0%
just about there and so just uh just a
 
06:22:17.350 --> 06:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
comment i guess on the the
 
06:22:19.190 --> 06:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
possibility of an exact session
 
06:22:21.110 --> 06:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
following those hearings
 
06:22:23.190 --> 06:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
um there's those you know yeah it's
 
06:22:25.670 --> 06:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
going to be a snow day that's going to
 
06:22:27.670 --> 06:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
you know may affect the number of people
 
06:22:30.070 --> 06:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
that come and how long those hearings
 
06:22:30.080 --> 06:22:31.030 align:start position:0%
that come and how long those hearings
last

06:22:31.030 --> 06:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
last
 
06:22:33.430 --> 06:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
um you know if it was anything like some
 
06:22:35.830 --> 06:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
similar bills that that we've heard
 
06:22:38.468 --> 06:22:38.478 align:start position:0%
those hearings could go very very long
 
06:22:40.310 --> 06:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
and um but who knows what's going to
 
06:22:42.708 --> 06:22:42.718 align:start position:0%
happen on a on a snow day we can do it
 
06:22:45.190 --> 06:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
on the 7th if we have some assurances
 
06:22:46.468 --> 06:22:46.478 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to take one of
 
06:22:49.030 --> 06:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
those they're masking bills and tax
 
06:22:49.040 --> 06:22:50.070 align:start position:0%
those they're masking bills and tax
bills

06:22:50.070 --> 06:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
bills
 
06:22:50.080 --> 06:22:51.830 align:start position:0%
bills
and

06:22:51.830 --> 06:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:22:51.840 --> 06:22:53.750 align:start position:0%
and
controversial

06:22:53.750 --> 06:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
controversial
 
06:22:56.310 --> 06:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
and if we can get the exact sessions
 
06:22:58.070 --> 06:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
done well everybody what doesn't want to
 
06:22:59.910 --> 06:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
have one or two or three times of going
 
06:23:01.910 --> 06:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
around debating this thing
 
06:23:04.390 --> 06:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
and that we can't afford to do it
 
06:23:06.150 --> 06:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
right right we are going to do it
 
06:23:08.708 --> 06:23:08.718 align:start position:0%
succinctly and get it done that's great
 
06:23:12.070 --> 06:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
i'm all for it so so i think and and i
 
06:23:15.030 --> 06:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
put it out there for consideration is um
 
06:23:17.430 --> 06:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
is if it makes more sense
 
06:23:20.230 --> 06:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
to uh to do an exec session where we're
 
06:23:22.230 --> 06:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
not you know thinking like well we're
 
06:23:25.430 --> 06:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
going to have you know six and five or
 
06:23:27.510 --> 06:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
seven and six or four and three or
 
06:23:29.190 --> 06:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
something like that yeah because you
 
06:23:31.590 --> 06:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
know the truth is it does require all of
 
06:23:31.600 --> 06:23:32.468 align:start position:0%
know the truth is it does require all of
us

06:23:32.468 --> 06:23:32.478 align:start position:0%
us
 
06:23:34.390 --> 06:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
it does and you have to have you should
 
06:23:35.750 --> 06:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
you have to have a majority there when
 
06:23:37.590 --> 06:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
you're expecting right especially with
 
06:23:39.270 --> 06:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
possibly controversial business yeah
 
06:23:41.190 --> 06:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm all for
 
06:23:43.350 --> 06:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
if we have you know one or two people
 
06:23:45.350 --> 06:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely we can get a sub yeah but if
 
06:23:46.788 --> 06:23:46.798 align:start position:0%
we have a lot more than that we're going
 
06:23:48.628 --> 06:23:48.638 align:start position:0%
to just put it off and do it on that
 
06:23:52.468 --> 06:23:52.478 align:start position:0%
monday we come back on the 7th
 
06:23:52.478 --> 06:23:53.350 align:start position:0%
monday we come back on the 7th
and

06:23:53.350 --> 06:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:23:55.510 --> 06:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
let's just do let's just do that for the
 
06:23:57.910 --> 06:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
execs because i don't i don't really
 
06:23:59.350 --> 06:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
think it's it's
 
06:24:01.030 --> 06:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
gonna be that fruitful particularly if
 
06:24:02.948 --> 06:24:02.958 align:start position:0%
there's if there may be a number of us
 
06:24:04.948 --> 06:24:04.958 align:start position:0%
that our number of people who aren't
 
06:24:06.708 --> 06:24:06.718 align:start position:0%
going to be able to make it on a snow
 
06:24:09.990 --> 06:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
day to get subs for everybody on that
 
06:24:11.830 --> 06:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
it's a little unreasonable to ask people
 
06:24:13.750 --> 06:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
to sub for somebody else i got it i
 
06:24:15.190 --> 06:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
understand it yeah
 
06:24:15.200 --> 06:24:16.628 align:start position:0%
understand it yeah
so

06:24:16.628 --> 06:24:16.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:24:19.990 --> 06:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
okay so snowmobilers yeah yeah ralph do
 
06:24:21.510 --> 06:24:21.520 align:start position:0%

06:24:24.390 --> 06:24:24.400 align:start position:0%

all right the eighth and the eighth i
 
06:24:57.590 --> 06:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
would get you got to get accepted
 
06:24:59.430 --> 06:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
because i have another demo if we have
 
06:25:04.468 --> 06:25:04.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:04.478 --> 06:25:05.590 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

06:25:05.590 --> 06:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:25:07.510 --> 06:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
i mean i scheduled it because it was a
 
06:25:10.708 --> 06:25:10.718 align:start position:0%
normal day we don't meet
 
06:25:13.910 --> 06:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
the best laid plans i know on a super
 
06:25:18.230 --> 06:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:20.070 --> 06:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking about looking into the
 
06:25:22.468 --> 06:25:22.478 align:start position:0%
area hotels and spending the night

06:25:42.310 --> 06:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
is very good down the road but if the if
 
06:25:44.708 --> 06:25:44.718 align:start position:0%
it's dangerous and you can't drive on
 
06:25:46.868 --> 06:25:46.878 align:start position:0%
friday stay home
 
06:25:49.990 --> 06:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
we do not have to have a
 
06:25:51.990 --> 06:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
a majority or anything like that on on
 
06:25:53.590 --> 06:25:53.600 align:start position:0%

06:25:57.110 --> 06:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
bills plural
 
06:25:58.628 --> 06:25:58.638 align:start position:0%
and we'll get those done i don't want to
 
06:26:02.070 --> 06:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
push it off any further we can't right
 
06:26:02.080 --> 06:26:18.070 align:start position:0%
push it off any further we can't right
so

06:26:18.070 --> 06:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:22.708 --> 06:26:22.718 align:start position:0%
okay must be some of that new york blood
 
06:26:26.948 --> 06:26:26.958 align:start position:0%
okay so um anything else for the
 
06:26:29.670 --> 06:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
common good here so rick just leftovers
 
06:26:33.750 --> 06:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
from today we've got 11 14 and 1376 that
 
06:26:36.070 --> 06:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
are both pending amendments
 
06:26:39.110 --> 06:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh 11 14
 
06:26:42.548 --> 06:26:42.558 align:start position:0%
and and 1376
 
06:26:48.788 --> 06:26:48.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:51.910 --> 06:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
i thought maybe 1373 what do we have a
 
06:26:54.788 --> 06:26:54.798 align:start position:0%
1373 we did not do we didn't do that
 
06:26:57.670 --> 06:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
there was three we didn't do today right
 
06:26:59.350 --> 06:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
so we got to take care of those three
 
06:26:59.360 --> 06:27:02.310 align:start position:0%
so we got to take care of those three
1373.

06:27:02.310 --> 06:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
1373.
 
06:27:05.190 --> 06:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
1376 is relative to the best interest of
 
06:27:09.990 --> 06:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:12.468 --> 06:27:12.478 align:start position:0%
and what were we waiting on not an
 
06:27:14.948 --> 06:27:14.958 align:start position:0%
amendment we needed information there
 
06:27:17.750 --> 06:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
right yes i was going to get information
 
06:27:20.150 --> 06:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
from the department i believe yeah i
 
06:27:22.548 --> 06:27:22.558 align:start position:0%
think that some clarification is it
 
06:27:24.548 --> 06:27:24.558 align:start position:0%
covered by item three
 
06:27:26.548 --> 06:27:26.558 align:start position:0%
or not right
 
06:27:28.628 --> 06:27:28.638 align:start position:0%
if it's not then you may need that but
 
06:27:30.548 --> 06:27:30.558 align:start position:0%
if it is we don't need the bill i
 
06:27:33.910 --> 06:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
haven't heard back yet all right okay
 
06:27:35.750 --> 06:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
and the other two yeah are amended in
 
06:27:37.030 --> 06:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
language yep
 
06:27:37.040 --> 06:27:37.830 align:start position:0%
language yep
okay

06:27:37.830 --> 06:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:27:37.840 --> 06:27:39.030 align:start position:0%
okay
so

06:27:39.030 --> 06:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:27:41.510 --> 06:27:41.520 align:start position:0%

06:27:55.670 --> 06:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:00.708 --> 06:28:00.718 align:start position:0%
