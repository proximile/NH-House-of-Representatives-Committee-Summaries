to help uh basically combine all the
 
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
information that you have based on your
 
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
discussions on where you think a general
 
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
and education trust fund Highway fund
 
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
and fiscal uh sorry fishing game Revenue
 
00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
will go and then to put that into a
 
00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:01.259 align:start position:0%
format to present to the house in a
 
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.020 align:start position:0%
resolution typically the house Ways and
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
Means Committee puts forth a house
 
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
resolution in usually in the February
 
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
March time frame based on
 
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:14.100 align:start position:0%
um you know how the committee is moving
 
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
forward that information is then
 
00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
presented as a non-binding resolution to
 
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
the house who then votes on it that
 
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:24.860 align:start position:0%
information is communicated with the
 
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
finance committee so the house finance
 
00:07:28.689 --> 00:07:28.699 align:start position:0%
committee behind me
 
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
they'll have a base Revenue estimate
 
00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:33.419 align:start position:0%
which they will then be able to do their
 
00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:36.419 align:start position:0%
work to create a budget for the next two
 
00:07:38.809 --> 00:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
fiscal years so right now we're in
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 we're about to enter into
 
00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:44.599 align:start position:0%
a budget process for the 24 and 25
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
biennial budget so our office really is
 
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
to you know communicate between the two
 
00:07:54.529 --> 00:07:54.539 align:start position:0%
committees as well any bills that go
 
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
before the house ways means or Senate
 
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means committees that may have
 
00:08:00.529 --> 00:08:00.539 align:start position:0%
an impact on the revenues in 24 and 25.
 
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
we ensure that we keep track of that in
 
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
a so-called Surplus statement which is
 
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
really just a catch-all of any bills or
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
legislation or changes that are
 
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
happening as the budget is being
 
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
developed and that is to ensure that
 
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
there's a balanced budget at the end of
 
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
the biennium
 
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
so that's basically a quick overview of
 
00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
what we do do feel free to reach out to
 
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
any member of my staff or myself during
 
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
the session I know we have a lot of
 
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
returning members we have a lot of new
 
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
members our office is over in the state
 
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
house in Room 101 and 102 so feel free
 
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
at any time
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
just to show you before
 
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
um before the budget starts
 
00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of uncertainty of kind of
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
how the current fiscal year is going to
 
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:47.220 align:start position:0%
end we're in fiscal year 23 we're six
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
months through that fiscal year a little
 
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
into our seventh month
 
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
you've heard in the paper that you know
 
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
the state had a
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
a record Surplus say over 400 million
 
00:09:00.889 --> 00:09:00.899 align:start position:0%
dollars over Revenue they had almost 361
 
00:09:02.449 --> 00:09:02.459 align:start position:0%
million dollars that they ended their
 
00:09:05.449 --> 00:09:05.459 align:start position:0%
fiscal year with for 22 which closed in
 
00:09:05.459 --> 00:09:06.710 align:start position:0%
fiscal year with for 22 which closed in
June

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
June
 
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
um what does that mean and how does that
 
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:10.860 align:start position:0%
impact the budget process and the
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates going forward
 
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
so what we usually provide is an uh a
 
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
snapshot so this is a point in time
 
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
snapshot of where we are today and I can
 
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
guarantee that these numbers on this
 
00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
page other than the top one which is a
 
00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:30.380 align:start position:0%
an audited final number of on row two of
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
361.3 million dollars of the balance
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
that we begin with in 23. all the
 
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
numbers will change
 
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:39.710 align:start position:0%
numbers will change
um

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:41.949 --> 00:09:41.959 align:start position:0%
so just kind of take where we are
 
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
361.3 million dollars to begin the year
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
for 23. during the budget negotiations
 
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
in 21 of the budget deliberations that
 
00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
estimate of the 22 balance coming
 
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
forward into for education and journal
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
fund was estimated at 67 million dollars
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
so almost 300 plus million dollar
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
variants of the beginning balance uh
 
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
majority of that most of that has to do
 
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
with uh performance of revenue revenue
 
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
for the last fiscal year which results
 
00:10:14.329 --> 00:10:14.339 align:start position:0%
in the circles is almost 400 plus
 
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:16.740 align:start position:0%
million dollars over what the
 
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
legislatures had assumed
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
um and you do I just wanted to remind
 
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
everyone when the budget Revenue
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
estimates were established we were just
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
coming out of uh covet pandemic shutdown
 
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:34.740 align:start position:0%
20 FY 20 actually had a negative balance
 
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
and so there was a lot of uncertainty on
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
how the next two years next three years
 
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
would really carry out
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
um and so although the revenue estimates
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
in hindsight uh were lower than what
 
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
actually occurred it's just to remember
 
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
kind of the pressures on the legislature
 
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
back in 21 when they were trying to
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
determine really an uncertain path
 
00:10:59.210 --> 00:10:59.220 align:start position:0%
forward for Revenue estimates which
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
sometimes is results in a change or a
 
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
variance in your revenues
 
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
estimated Revenue
 
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
um on row five in the budget 2.69
 
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
billion dollars and that's between both
 
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
the uh general fund and the education
 
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:19.740 align:start position:0%
trust fund General funds about 1.65
 
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
close to 1.7 million of that uh the
 
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
year-to-date variance So based on the
 
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:27.180 align:start position:0%
December monthly Revenue Focus which is
 
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
a report that administrative Services uh
 
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.210 align:start position:0%
a report that administrative Services uh
monitors

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:31.220 align:start position:0%
monitors
 
00:11:34.009 --> 00:11:34.019 align:start position:0%
Revenue with during the year based on
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
the December monthly Revenue Focus the
 
00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:39.079 align:start position:0%
state is already
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
207.1 million dollars up and you are
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
halfway through your fiscal year
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
so the total revenue for the year
 
00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:49.220 align:start position:0%
estimated at about
 
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
2.898.4 million if we assume that from
 
00:11:54.769 --> 00:11:54.779 align:start position:0%
this point forward we continue to hit
 
00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
plan but you're going to receive monthly
 
00:11:58.490 --> 00:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
Revenue focuses for every month you're
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
going to receive uh the next couple week
 
00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:03.899 align:start position:0%
months uh updates from Commissioners on
 
00:12:05.329 --> 00:12:05.339 align:start position:0%
where they think the revenues are going
 
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
to perform for the remainder of the
 
00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:08.519 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
00:12:11.569 --> 00:12:11.579 align:start position:0%
um so that 207 million dollars what we
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
know now but that number could go up
 
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
um or it could go down and the reason I
 
00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:18.899 align:start position:0%
say that is March and April are big
 
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
Revenue months for collections
 
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
especially business taxes June as well
 
00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
there are several changes made to the
 
00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
business taxes over the last few years
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
and I think commissioner stepp will talk
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
about it when dra is here
 
00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
um but March and April a really big
 
00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
Revenue months and or something that the
 
00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
house will not have necessarily when
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
you're providing your estimates so
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to have regular
 
00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
conversations with dra in some of the
 
00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:45.959 align:start position:0%
larger Revenue collections collecting
 
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
agencies to make your determination
 
00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
where you think first where is 23 going
 
00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:53.220 align:start position:0%
to end and then that's going to be kind
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
of your launching that's going to be
 
00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
your start for predicting 24 and 25
 
00:12:58.970 --> 00:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
going forward you have a lot of
 
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
economists coming in a lot of very smart
 
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:03.180 align:start position:0%
people coming in who have been here for
 
00:13:05.569 --> 00:13:05.579 align:start position:0%
several years who can kind of you know
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
help you to identify areas that you
 
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
should keep an eye on when you're trying
 
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
to predict two years out and there's
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
nowhere to no way to figure out what's
 
00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
going to happen so it's a best case
 
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:16.730 align:start position:0%
going to happen so it's a best case
scenario

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:16.740 align:start position:0%
scenario
 
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
but it is a budget process it is just
 
00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:21.180 align:start position:0%
based on estimates
 
00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:23.459 align:start position:0%
um and so Finance again once those
 
00:13:24.889 --> 00:13:24.899 align:start position:0%
estimates are done finance will create
 
00:13:26.449 --> 00:13:26.459 align:start position:0%
their budget
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
so for Appropriations the budget
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
Appropriations about 2.794 million
 
00:13:34.129 --> 00:13:34.139 align:start position:0%
dollars it's a little above the 2.7905
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh that was in the committee conference
 
00:13:38.509 --> 00:13:38.519 align:start position:0%
budget a lot of that has to do with uh
 
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
timing of when the Appropriations are
 
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
actually applied 22 versus 23.
 
00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
unbudgeted appropriations of 30.9
 
00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:48.660 align:start position:0%
million so separate from the budget
 
00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
process house the state also has
 
00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:53.220 align:start position:0%
statutory Appropriations or
 
00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:54.660 align:start position:0%
Appropriations approved through fiscal
 
00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
in certain instances that are a draw
 
00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:58.740 align:start position:0%
against the general or education trust
 
00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
fund a couple of those items are your
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
attorney general litigation funds which
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
are averaging about 8 million over the
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
last couple of years you have your
 
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
judicial Council engine defense uh
 
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
funding that comes through fiscal
 
00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:15.899 align:start position:0%
committee that I believe they may have
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
another request before the end of the
 
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
year but that usually averages between
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
two and three million dollars a year you
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
have your education Freedom accounts
 
00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
which uh you'll know that I think it was
 
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
estimated about 15 million dollars or
 
00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
twenty three is where that's going to
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
maybe end up and then row 12 it's not
 
00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:38.700 align:start position:0%
usually a line that you'll see a lot a
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
lot of times when we do a snapshot the
 
00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
state hasn't been in a situation where
 
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
our Revenue has been so high that the
 
00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.150 align:start position:0%
our Revenue has been so high that the
legislature

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
had had the ability to basically
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate funds for specific projects
 
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
so over the last of the 2022 session
 
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
there's probably
 
00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.689 align:start position:0%
there's probably
um

00:14:59.689 --> 00:14:59.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
close to 275 to 300 million dollars of
 
00:15:05.389 --> 00:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that went out and that
 
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
was based on the revenue Surplus so they
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
knew the governor and the legislature
 
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
knew that Revenue was exceeding plan
 
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
they knew that the expenditures were in
 
00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:15.959 align:start position:0%
line with where they were estimating and
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
so they had legislative specials or
 
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
specific bills 67 million dollars for
 
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:24.180 align:start position:0%
highways you have some adequate
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
education changes about 14 million
 
00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:29.660 align:start position:0%
dollars for one bill
 
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
that had passed through extraordinary
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
need grants is what they're called and
 
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
then some retirement one-time costs or
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
to help with the community some
 
00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
additional Aid that the legislature and
 
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
Governor really wanted to make one-time
 
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
Appropriations since they did have those
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
funds available
 
00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
so in total in 23 we know although we
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
carried forward about 361.3 million uh
 
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
there's almost 270 million of it between
 
00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
the unbudgeted Appropriations and the
 
00:15:59.750 --> 00:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
legislative specials that are already
 
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
accounted it's already been spent
 
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
basically uh but even then you do have
 
00:16:07.129 --> 00:16:07.139 align:start position:0%
your 200 million dollar Revenue Surplus
 
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
so far uh we have an estimated lapse
 
00:16:14.689 --> 00:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
which is basically uh unspent funds so
 
00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
the legislature will appropriate two
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
years ahead of time not all those funds
 
00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
are spent and when they build the budget
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
the finance committees will incorporate
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
a lapse and the lapse happens because of
 
00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:27.959 align:start position:0%
unfilled positions and we know the state
 
00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:30.779 align:start position:0%
has a high vacancy rate because of uh
 
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
projections that are vary from what was
 
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
initially estimated so you do estimated
 
00:16:38.449 --> 00:16:38.459 align:start position:0%
about a 90 million 89.5 million dollar
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
lapse which the state has been able to
 
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
meet the last several years they've
 
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
actually come in over 40 million for 22
 
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
over the laps if you go back to 20 21
 
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
there are almost 100 million over where
 
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
they thought the estimated lapse was for
 
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
various reasons so
 
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
and that will bring you to your
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
cumulative ending balance on Row 18
 
00:17:00.129 --> 00:17:00.139 align:start position:0%
which is about
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
282.8 million dollars
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's both General and education trust
 
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
fund the education trust fund Surplus
 
00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
just based on these numbers which will
 
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
change is approximately 99.4 million
 
00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
dollars the remainder being the second
 
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
year of the biennium the odd year the
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
remainder based on statute would go into
 
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund So based on what we
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
know now on row 21 just using the
 
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
calculations of the rainy day fund
 
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
183.4 million dollars would go into
 
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
their any day fund now you all know
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
people who have been here
 
00:17:39.169 --> 00:17:39.179 align:start position:0%
representatives and Senators who have
 
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:40.740 align:start position:0%
been know that that's going to be a big
 
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
discussion during the budget process not
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
only does the budget process
 
00:17:48.169 --> 00:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
appropriate funds for the next two
 
00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:50.039 align:start position:0%
fiscal years but they also look at is
 
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
there Surplus in the current fiscal year
 
00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:54.660 align:start position:0%
and then make a decision do we let it
 
00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
all go into the rainy day fund do we
 
00:17:59.690 --> 00:17:59.700 align:start position:0%
appropriate it for one-time needs do we
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
maybe help with our tax burden uh for
 
00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:06.380 align:start position:0%
you know and make some changes in taxes
 
00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
it really comes down to what is the
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
governor in the legislature comfortable
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
with for that rainy day fund balance and
 
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
over the last couple years that's been
 
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:17.700 align:start position:0%
about 150 million dollars the cap on the
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund is over 400 million
 
00:18:21.529 --> 00:18:21.539 align:start position:0%
dollars if and that's just a rough
 
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
estimate we knew we brought in about two
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
billion dollars of or a little under two
 
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:26.940 align:start position:0%
billion dollars last year in general
 
00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
funds the cap is two years of general
 
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
fund revenues for the current Pioneer
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
assuming we get the same two billion
 
00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
dollars that Cap's going to be around
 
00:18:39.169 --> 00:18:39.179 align:start position:0%
400 million comes out to about 380 but
 
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
you also have settlement money that goes
 
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
in there that adds to that cap so
 
00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:45.539 align:start position:0%
roughly about 400 million
 
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
um if the rainy day fund does hit that
 
00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
cap then any additional funds
 
00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
automatically carry over to the next
 
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
fiscal year so they'd stay into the
 
00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:54.059 align:start position:0%
journal fund
 
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
so that will be a definitely discussion
 
00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the governors right now is
 
00:19:00.169 --> 00:19:00.179 align:start position:0%
developing the budget uh his crack at
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
the budget with the agencies right now
 
00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:04.919 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure they're discussing what
 
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
they think uh the rainy day fund balance
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
should be you'll hear from many people
 
00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:10.919 align:start position:0%
whether States rainy day fund balance
 
00:19:12.529 --> 00:19:12.539 align:start position:0%
should be and what's the proper level
 
00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:14.820 align:start position:0%
but it's really up to the legislature
 
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
and Governor to come up that level that
 
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
you're comfortable with of surplus funds
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
you're holding on hand
 
00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.250 align:start position:0%
you're holding on hand
um

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
and so that's kind of uh where we are
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
now uh just to point out I should have
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
pointed out for it education trust fund
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
does not lapse so it's a non-lapsing
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
fund we've gone several years with uh
 
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
carrying balances forward in the
 
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
education trust fund there was uh you
 
00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
know since its Inception there were
 
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
general fund transfers into the fund
 
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
because by Statute any deficit in the
 
00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
education trust fund are filled with a
 
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
general fund but right now we're in a
 
00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
good position so there's almost 108
 
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
million dollars carried forward from 22
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
into 23 which is part of that 361 up top
 
00:19:59.870 --> 00:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
but based on the projected level of
 
00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:02.039 align:start position:0%
spending in the education trust one
 
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
the revenue just through December that
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
balance will stay right around 100
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
million dollars obviously that's going
 
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
to change based on Final adequacy counts
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
and final Revenue numbers
 
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
um but again that balance carries
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
forwards into 24 and 25 for education
 
00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
so I'll stop there
 
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
um don't want to overload you with too
 
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
much but usually what we'll see is our
 
00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
office as we receive the monthly Revenue
 
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
focuses as we receive
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
um you know the estimates from the waste
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
means Community House ways Means
 
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
Committee as bills start passing and
 
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
moving through the communities you'll
 
00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:40.919 align:start position:0%
start to see this snapshot morph into
 
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
something that will be more of a
 
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
snapshot for the finance chairs as they
 
00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
go forward to develop their budget
 
00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
what's out there what's changing where
 
00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:51.299 align:start position:0%
are we now and then when the governor
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
releases his Budget on February 15th is
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
the deadline or is the statutory
 
00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
required date of February 15th we'll
 
00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
have a first glimpse of what's the
 
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
um the first plan on 24 and 25 as 23 24
 
00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:08.820 align:start position:0%
and 25 and then we'll work with finance
 
00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
and uh Senate the House and Senate
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
Finance over the next several months
 
00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.210 align:start position:0%
Finance over the next several months
so

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:14.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
hope that helps I'll kind of stop there
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
if uh but I can answer any questions
 
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
that you have sure
 
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
representative Platt yes thank you this
 
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
is ignorance because I'm new to Ways and
 
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
Means who's how was the 400 million
 
00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
dollar rainy day fund cap set is that
 
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.270 align:start position:0%
dollar rainy day fund cap set is that
legislation

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:34.700 align:start position:0%
it is it's RSA
 
00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.370 align:start position:0%
it is it's RSA
913e

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:36.380 align:start position:0%
913e
 
00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:39.919 align:start position:0%
it's a calculated statutory cap
 
00:21:42.649 --> 00:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
and so that was actually just changed
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
two sessions Ago by the legislature it
 
00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
used to be one year general fund
 
00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.590 align:start position:0%
used to be one year general fund
revenues

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
um and it was changed this to uh the
 
00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
biennium ago to be two years of general
 
00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
fund Revenue so statute but subjects the
 
00:21:57.049 --> 00:21:57.059 align:start position:0%
legislative change
 
00:21:57.059 --> 00:21:58.970 align:start position:0%
legislative change
yep

00:21:58.970 --> 00:21:58.980 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:06.649 --> 00:22:06.659 align:start position:0%
again please thank you madam chair I'm
 
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
almost afraid to ask this question
 
00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
because maybe I'm missing something but
 
00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:12.780 align:start position:0%
when I look at the total revenue of 2.8
 
00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:14.210 align:start position:0%
when I look at the total revenue of 2.8
98

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:14.220 align:start position:0%
98
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
and subtract the appropriations of 2.97
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
I would get a negative cumulative ending
 
00:22:21.289 --> 00:22:21.299 align:start position:0%
balance so I know I'm missing something
 
00:22:24.289 --> 00:22:24.299 align:start position:0%
because you get 282. sure so the total
 
00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
year balance so the current year balance
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
is negative
 
00:22:30.409 --> 00:22:30.419 align:start position:0%
um if you add the preliminary balance up
 
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
on Row 2 to the um your total revenue of
 
00:22:36.409 --> 00:22:36.419 align:start position:0%
the 2898 that will bring you to the
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
three-point roughly 3.2 billion then
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
subtract your 297 six point that we did
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
have the cumulative ending balance of
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
282 which is still positive but if you
 
00:22:48.289 --> 00:22:48.299 align:start position:0%
look at just the current year it would
 
00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
be negative because the legislature had
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
planned for a big balance forward
 
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
is that all you have for today
 
00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:04.980 align:start position:0%

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:06.780 align:start position:0%

front of you it's also showing on the
screen

screen
 
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to walk through today
 
00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.149 align:start position:0%
I'm going to walk through today
um

00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
with you kind of What dra does the taxes
 
00:24:15.409 --> 00:24:15.419 align:start position:0%
that we collect and kind of the current
 
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:23.700 align:start position:0%
yeah so sorry just so everybody get
 
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
there that's the first page should look
 
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:35.210 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:24:39.049 --> 00:24:39.059 align:start position:0%
so first
 
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:40.740 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue Administration
 
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
we administer 14 taxes for the State of
 
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh representing about 2.6
 
00:24:48.409 --> 00:24:48.419 align:start position:0%
billion dollars which is just over 80
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
percent of the general and education
 
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
trust funds for fiscal year 22. so we
 
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
are the main Revenue collecting Agency
 
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
for the general fund and education trust
 
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:57.770 align:start position:0%
for the general fund and education trust
fund

00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
we do have important insights that we'll
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
share with you today about the
 
00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:03.059 align:start position:0%
performance of the state's most
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
significant Revenue sources but we lack
 
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
the capacity to form perform more
 
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
complex economic predictions but you
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
have a wonderful slate of people to hear
 
00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
from over the next day and a half so
 
00:25:15.649 --> 00:25:15.659 align:start position:0%
we'll kind of cue everything up for you
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
give you where we are year to date with
 
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
revenues factors that we see affecting
 
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
the various taxes and what we're seeing
 
00:25:24.649 --> 00:25:24.659 align:start position:0%
in terms of a trend versus plan and then
 
00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:25.799 align:start position:0%
when you hear from the rest of the
 
00:25:27.169 --> 00:25:27.179 align:start position:0%
economists and other experts over the
 
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
next couple days you'll have a nice
 
00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:31.310 align:start position:0%
next couple days you'll have a nice
Foundation

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:33.769 --> 00:25:33.779 align:start position:0%
so we're going to go tax by tax I'll
 
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
stop Madam chair at the end of each tax
 
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
if that's okay to answer any questions
 
00:25:39.769 --> 00:25:39.779 align:start position:0%
okay so first we have the meals and
 
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
rentals tax or m r as we refer to it m r
 
00:25:45.049 --> 00:25:45.059 align:start position:0%
is levied on consumers for the purchase
 
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
of taxable meals accommodation rentals
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
and motor vehicle rentals the tax rate
 
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
was nine percent through September 30th
 
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
of 2021 and then lowered to eight and a
 
00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
half percent on October 1st of 2021.
 
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
the taxes collected by the operator the
 
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
restaurant owner the hotel owner and
 
00:26:07.789 --> 00:26:07.799 align:start position:0%
then remitted to dra on a monthly basis
 
00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
School building a Debt Service is paid
 
00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:13.799 align:start position:0%
out of m r every month the transfer was
 
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
14.6 million in fiscal 2012 but has been
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
decreasing over more recent years to 8.1
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
million in 22 and currently 7 million in
 
00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.990 align:start position:0%
million in 22 and currently 7 million in
2023.

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
2023.
 
00:26:30.049 --> 00:26:30.059 align:start position:0%
looking at m r Revenue over the past few
 
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
years we have seen a rebound since uh
 
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
covid-19 when obviously a lot of
 
00:26:36.769 --> 00:26:36.779 align:start position:0%
restaurants and hotels were closed so we
 
00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
saw a hit to m r Revenue during that
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
time but since everything has been open
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
again we did see an almost 10 percent
 
00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
decrease in 2020 from 2019 due to the
 
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
shutdowns related to covid but when
 
00:26:51.169 --> 00:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
restaurants and hotels opened back up we
 
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
saw a 6.1 percent increase in 21 over 20
 
00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
and then we've seen a 21.7 increase in
 
00:27:01.549 --> 00:27:01.559 align:start position:0%
22 over 21 before taking into account
 
00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
the municipal Revenue fund transfer
 
00:27:07.549 --> 00:27:07.559 align:start position:0%
so in
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
um starting in fiscal 21 nope I'm sorry
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22. on a monthly basis we
 
00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
transfer Revenue into a municipal
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue fund
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
the purpose of that is to send
 
00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
approximately 30 of m r Revenue back to
 
00:27:27.649 --> 00:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns so we do that
 
00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
transfer on a monthly basis so when
 
00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:32.039 align:start position:0%
you're looking at net m r or m r that's
 
00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
in the general fund in 22 and comparing
 
00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
it it'll actually look like revenues
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
went down
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
they didn't gross revenues actually went
 
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:44.700 align:start position:0%
up from 21 to 22 but because of the
 
00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
municipal transfer into the restricted
 
00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:48.059 align:start position:0%
account it'll look like a decrease when
 
00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
you're looking at just the general fund
 
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.310 align:start position:0%
you're looking at just the general fund
portion

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
portion
 
00:27:54.769 --> 00:27:54.779 align:start position:0%
so for fiscal 23 our current fiscal year
 
00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:56.820 align:start position:0%
actual revenue for the first six months
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
is 30.4 percent ahead of plan and 6.7
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
percent ahead of 2022 Revenue before
 
00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
that Municipal fund transfer as Mr Kane
 
00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:09.110 align:start position:0%
that Municipal fund transfer as Mr Kane
mentioned

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
um the 30.4 percent ahead of plan large
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
number but just remember
 
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
or that plan was developed in 2021 at a
 
00:28:18.409 --> 00:28:18.419 align:start position:0%
time where there was a lot of
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
uncertainty as we were coming out of
 
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
covet so that's why we're so far ahead
 
00:28:24.049 --> 00:28:24.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:26.940 align:start position:0%
um so the 2022 Municipal fund transfer
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned did not exist in 21 in
 
00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 that transfer was just over
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
100 million dollars 100.1 million and
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
year to date for 23 we have transferred
 
00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
66.2 million
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
factors that affect m r Revenue low
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
unemployment rates so when people are
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
working they have the ability to go out
 
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
to eat maybe take a vacation stay in
 
00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:51.539 align:start position:0%
hotels So currently the U.S unemployment
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
rate is at 3.7 percent New Hampshire is
 
00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
at 2.6 percent for November compared to
 
00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:02.220 align:start position:0%
4.2 percent nationally last year and 3.3
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
percent for New Hampshire last year so
 
00:29:06.529 --> 00:29:06.539 align:start position:0%
we've seen even more declines in the
 
00:29:09.409 --> 00:29:09.419 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate which is good for m r
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
strong wages are also good for m r more
 
00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
disposable income more ability as I said
 
00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
to go out to eat take vacations
 
00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:17.810 align:start position:0%
to go out to eat take vacations
um weather

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:17.820 align:start position:0%
um weather
 
00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
we like Sunny Summers we want colorful
 
00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
foliage snow
 
00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
a little bit more that would be great
 
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
um that tends to drive our m r revenues
 
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
we have seen record-breaking tourism in
 
00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
the last few years both in the fall and
 
00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
in the Summers hopefully the weather
 
00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:37.799 align:start position:0%
will maybe take a change this winter so
 
00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:40.140 align:start position:0%
that tourism obviously helps our our m r
 
00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:41.690 align:start position:0%
that tourism obviously helps our our m r
revenues

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:41.700 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
and then consumer Behavior post pandemic
 
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:45.590 align:start position:0%
and then consumer Behavior post pandemic
um

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
there's more outdoor dining options
 
00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:50.460 align:start position:0%
expanded takeout options
 
00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
um consumers have kind of shifted from
 
00:29:54.529 --> 00:29:54.539 align:start position:0%
maybe more mainstream hotels to the
 
00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:56.940 align:start position:0%
ability to maybe rent a camp a cottage
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
or or a home or a condo for their
 
00:30:03.169 --> 00:30:03.179 align:start position:0%
vacations these are all positive changes
 
00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
to our m r tax base and I really think
 
00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:08.039 align:start position:0%
that we've kind of seen what is a new
 
00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
normal for m r
 
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
um maybe if nothing else covid taught us
 
00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
that we really like to eat out and when
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
we couldn't do that for a period of time
 
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
I think that may have driven
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
post-pandemic demand people now really
 
00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
enjoy the ability to eat out or at least
 
00:30:24.169 --> 00:30:24.179 align:start position:0%
get takeout and I don't think we all
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
knew how much we liked it until we
 
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
couldn't do it
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
um rental activity rental agents I'm
 
00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
just talking about a few different areas
 
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
of m r rental agents are up 20 over
 
00:30:36.649 --> 00:30:36.659 align:start position:0%
November of last year full service
 
00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
hotels are up 10 from November of last
 
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
year full service restaurants are up six
 
00:30:45.289 --> 00:30:45.299 align:start position:0%
percent fast food is up 12 and a half
 
00:30:48.409 --> 00:30:48.419 align:start position:0%
percent all from just last year so m r
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
continues to grow we see increased
 
00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.190 align:start position:0%
continues to grow we see increased
demand

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
demand
 
00:30:54.049 --> 00:30:54.059 align:start position:0%
um it I think
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
this is a bit of a new a new normal that
 
00:30:57.529 --> 00:30:57.539 align:start position:0%
we're seeing
 
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
so I will pause briefly for any
 
00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative almie
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
thank you uh could you tell us where we
 
00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
we will look at that in the next few
 
00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.950 align:start position:0%
we will look at that in the next few
slides

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.630 align:start position:0%
 
senator

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you commissioner
 
00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to be clear we're now
 
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:32.039 align:start position:0%
instead of dumping all the m r into the
 
00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
general fund now we're pulling out our
 
00:31:36.529 --> 00:31:36.539 align:start position:0%
Municipal share portion so it's not
 
00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:38.220 align:start position:0%
counted as general fund necessarily
 
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue anymore it's now has a special
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund that based on my math
 
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 11 and 12 million
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
dollars a month we take out of MNR
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
receipts and dump into this set aside
 
00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
fund that's correct so last year in
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
total was 100.1 million that went into
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
the municipal transfer fund
 
00:31:59.389 --> 00:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
um this year it'll probably be a little
 
00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
bit more than that the math is based on
 
00:32:03.289 --> 00:32:03.299 align:start position:0%
the prior year revenues when we get into
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
more detailed Revenue estimating we can
 
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
walk the Committees through the specific
 
00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
calculation but thank you yeah comparing
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
year to year we can at this point really
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
compare you can compare 23 to 22 because
 
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
both years had the transfer but again
 
00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:19.140 align:start position:0%
the transfer varies year to year so it's
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
probably helpful to just look at m r on
 
00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
a gross level and then net out the
 
00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
transfer thank you Senator Rosenwald
 
00:32:27.769 --> 00:32:27.779 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good morning good
 
00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:28.490 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good morning good
morning

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
um I've noticed that
 
00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
um generally the rooms portion is about
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
17 percent of the total m r revenues but
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
this year it's something like 24 25.
 
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
and you've
 
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
well the the restaurants are coming in
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
kind of just around plan
 
00:32:57.289 --> 00:32:57.299 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that change in rooms from
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
hotels to
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
rental agents and condos is the
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
department also looking at to what
 
00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
extent the emergency rental assistance
 
00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
federal funds that are going into hotels
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
is driving that portion of the revenues
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
or will you be able to tell us that
 
00:33:21.889 --> 00:33:21.899 align:start position:0%
potentially so the m r tax is going to
 
00:33:24.889 --> 00:33:24.899 align:start position:0%
tax a short-term rental so six months or
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
less so if any of those rentals are
 
00:33:30.169 --> 00:33:30.179 align:start position:0%
longer than six months or anticipated to
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
be longer than six months and they
 
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be taxable here but that's
 
00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
certainly something that we can we can
 
00:33:37.009 --> 00:33:37.019 align:start position:0%
look into in Greater detail for you
 
00:33:39.409 --> 00:33:39.419 align:start position:0%
representative ulery has a question
 
00:33:40.669 --> 00:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:40.679 --> 00:33:41.509 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:43.009 align:start position:0%
um
commissioner

00:33:43.009 --> 00:33:43.019 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:45.299 align:start position:0%
you were talking about the the following
 
00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:47.700 align:start position:0%
up on uh Senator I gotta get the senator
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
in there now Lang's uh comment regarding
 
00:33:54.769 --> 00:33:54.779 align:start position:0%
the the 30 that's going back into the
 
00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
the municipalities
 
00:34:00.049 --> 00:34:00.059 align:start position:0%
is there some way we could see
 
00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
with that taken out the comparison of
 
00:34:03.889 --> 00:34:03.899 align:start position:0%
the meals and rooms going into the
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
general fund now
 
00:34:09.169 --> 00:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
minus the 30 so we can see
 
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:11.940 align:start position:0%
whether or not we're losing there's as
 
00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
less Revenue going to this
 
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
general fund yes you understand why yes
 
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
we can when we get into the specific
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimating with the Committees
 
00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
we'll show it both ways so you'll see
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
the gross amount of total m r collected
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
then we can show you what's going into
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
the municipal revenue or Municipal
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
transfer fund then also show you the net
 
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
so you can see
 
00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:36.419 align:start position:0%
what it would look like if that transfer
 
00:34:38.329 --> 00:34:38.339 align:start position:0%
wasn't happening and then see what it is
 
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
with the transfer
 
00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:42.770 align:start position:0%
with the transfer
follow-up

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
can you give us a rough idea now is
 
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
there a increased decrease level
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
m r is growing so in general so
 
00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:53.690 align:start position:0%
m r is growing so in general so
um

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
yeah that's wonderful news yeah Senator
 
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:57.890 align:start position:0%
yeah that's wonderful news yeah Senator
Lane

00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
Lane
 
00:34:59.329 --> 00:34:59.339 align:start position:0%
just one more thing for committee
 
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
members if you get the notice I do I
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
started on the 15th every month you get
 
00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
the revenue notices that come out just
 
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
remember that 11 million dollars is
 
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
going to drop out of that total when
 
00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
you're reporting it to somebody so if it
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
says we have 207 million dollars
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
remember to subtract 11 million dollars
 
00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
because that's actually going to be the
 
00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
Surplus that's a great point so when we
 
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
report revenues during the month as
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang said starting on the 15th
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
you will see the revenue before the
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
transfer and so we will look very much
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
ahead of plan because that transfer
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
hasn't come out yet there is a footnote
 
00:35:32.569 --> 00:35:32.579 align:start position:0%
in the bottom that will tell you what
 
00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:34.380 align:start position:0%
the transfer it the specific amount for
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
that month but yes so it always looks
 
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
like on the 15th 16th 17th of the month
 
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
18th 19th we're looking great and we're
 
00:35:43.609 --> 00:35:43.619 align:start position:0%
still usually end up ahead of plan but
 
00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
we look grossly ahead of Plan before
 
00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
that transfer comes up that's a great
 
00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:50.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:53.329 --> 00:35:53.339 align:start position:0%
representative elberger
 
00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm finding myself a little bit
 
00:35:59.589 --> 00:35:59.599 align:start position:0%
confused about something on page three
 
00:36:02.569 --> 00:36:02.579 align:start position:0%
the second bullet point it says the
 
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
transfer was 14.6 million per year in FY
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
right so in in fiscal 2012 we
 
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
transferred 14.6 million to the school
 
00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
building a Debt Service in fiscal 22 we
 
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
the transfer was only 8.1 million
 
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
and then I assume and 7 million and 23.
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
I assume that 7 million is year to date
 
00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
that would be for the total year so The
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
Debt Service amounts were set back
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
um when the bonds were issued so that is
 
00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
7.1 7 million is the total amount that
 
00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
would be transferred in 23. thank you
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh quick follow-up
 
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
from Senator Lang and then uh
 
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
representative rochewart next
 
00:36:53.569 --> 00:36:53.579 align:start position:0%
so just just on that that building Aid
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
transfer if I did my math right from my
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
education committee side we have about
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
151 million dollars left in bonds that
 
00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
go out to 2041.
 
00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
um to to lay off that's broken down into
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
two pieces one's a municipal payment
 
00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:11.460 align:start position:0%
that is about a hundred and
 
00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
seven million dollars and that is a 43
 
00:37:17.569 --> 00:37:17.579 align:start position:0%
43 million dollar
 
00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
um back in 2010-11 we bonded operating
 
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
expenses we have about 43 million
 
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
dollars left of that bond to pay off as
 
00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:25.910 align:start position:0%
dollars left of that bond to pay off as
well

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.890 align:start position:0%
well
representative

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:37:29.329 --> 00:37:29.339 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
um looking at the factors that affect
 
00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
the future meals and room tax revenue
 
00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a two-part question so how
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
effective is the state in collecting
 
00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms from short-term rentals
 
00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
the airbnbs the vrbos those groups yep
 
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
the those um you can see a list of all m
 
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
r licensees on our website all m r
 
00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:54.599 align:start position:0%
operators the two that you mentioned are
 
00:37:58.130 --> 00:37:58.140 align:start position:0%
license operators and so they will
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
collect on behalf of the host and remit
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
to the state okay and then a follow-up
 
00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:05.460 align:start position:0%
to that or along the same questions I
 
00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of discussion at
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
least in my part of the state about
 
00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
restricting short-term rentals and um
 
00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:14.460 align:start position:0%
and and and putting more regulations on
 
00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
that does that factor into future meals
 
00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:21.900 align:start position:0%
and room tax revenue if there are less
 
00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:24.300 align:start position:0%
ability to rent out homes and second
 
00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
homes for for that sure so
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
if a consumer wants to rent out a second
 
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
home and that's not available because of
 
00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
short-term rental restrictions they
 
00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:36.660 align:start position:0%
would really have one or two options
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
right you can go to a hotel
 
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
um or you cannot come at all so if the
 
00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
result is that fewer people rent any
 
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
sort of taxable accommodation then we
 
00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:50.820 align:start position:0%
would see it an impact to m r If instead
 
00:38:52.849 --> 00:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
that is just a shift to a different type
 
00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:54.660 align:start position:0%
of taxable accommodation from a
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
short-term rental to a full-service
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
Hotel then the impact on Revenue would
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
be minimal thank you sure let's go ahead
 
00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
and move on one more behind you
 
00:39:11.089 --> 00:39:11.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
so that's a great question
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
um and I don't I'm gonna face this way
 
00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.730 align:start position:0%
um and I don't I'm gonna face this way
okay

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:16.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:20.569 --> 00:39:20.579 align:start position:0%
um so meals and rentals operators remit
 
00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:23.220 align:start position:0%
to the state on a monthly basis
 
00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
um they can remit on a Consolidated
 
00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
basis so if I am a restaurant owner and
 
00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
I have a restaurant in Plymouth Concord
 
00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
and Manchester I can file a Consolidated
 
00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
return and report all of my revenues on
 
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
one return and they're not required to
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
break out the revenue that's received by
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
each location so for that to answer that
 
00:39:53.089 --> 00:39:53.099 align:start position:0%
question it can be it's difficult almost
 
00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
impossible for us to know
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
um how much m r revenue is generated in
 
00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
each specific municipality
 
00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
also if we were able to do that if
 
00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
operators were required um it would be
 
00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
additional work and Reporting on the
 
00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:09.180 align:start position:0%
part of the operator but if they were
 
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
required to break down their m r by
 
00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
municipality in theory we could report
 
00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:17.940 align:start position:0%
um by municipality except when you have
 
00:40:19.849 --> 00:40:19.859 align:start position:0%
the potential for municipalities that
 
00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
have very few operators so if you have a
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
small town that has two restaurants the
 
00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
dra based on our internal policies would
 
00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
not be able to disclose that information
 
00:40:32.569 --> 00:40:32.579 align:start position:0%
because if I'm the owner of one
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
restaurant and I know there's only two
 
00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:37.380 align:start position:0%
in the town and dra told me there was a
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars of Revenue and I know
 
00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
that I was 25 then I know that my
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
competitor had 75 percent of that so we
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
get into a little bit of a disclosure
 
00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
issue but really the the first kind of
 
00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
Hiccup is the ability for operators to
 
00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
file Consolidated returns would you be
 
00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:55.140 align:start position:0%
okay with a quick follow-up question on
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
that yeah
 
00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
I could say I wasn't clear how do you
 
00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:01.140 align:start position:0%
know how much of a check to send to one
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
Town versus the next versus the next oh
 
00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
for the distribution so that
 
00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
distribution is done based on population
 
00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
thank you let's go ahead and move on
 
00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
again all of my ways and means members
 
00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:13.740 align:start position:0%
we're going to be seeing the
 
00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
commissioner again very soon and we're
 
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
going to drill down on this again thank
 
00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:18.829 align:start position:0%
going to drill down on this again thank
you

00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:21.660 align:start position:0%
okay so moving on to slide four we'll
 
00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
just talk a little bit more about m r
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
um factors additional factors that can
 
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:31.079 align:start position:0%
impact m r revenue is obviously consumer
 
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
Behavior as we've mentioned any sort of
 
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
supply chain constraints that may impact
 
00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
a restaurant's ability to offer
 
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
um either services in general or offer
 
00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:44.700 align:start position:0%
specific types of food if you know we
 
00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:46.260 align:start position:0%
saw some of that I think during covid
 
00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:48.839 align:start position:0%
most of that has resolved but if there's
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
any supply chain impacts obviously
 
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
inflation is something that we're
 
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
watching in terms of
 
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
m r tax revenue whether fuel prices and
 
00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
food costs will require restaurants to
 
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
raise their prices that could have a
 
00:42:05.089 --> 00:42:05.099 align:start position:0%
positive impact on m r Revenue because
 
00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:07.079 align:start position:0%
the m r is collected based on the amount
 
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
that the consumer pays so as prices go
 
00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:13.740 align:start position:0%
up m r Revenue could go up as well
 
00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:15.300 align:start position:0%
um economic uncertainty again if we get
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
to a point where folks feel uncertain
 
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
about their position in the economy and
 
00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
they choose to not go out to eat or not
 
00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
take those vacations we would see an
 
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
impact to m r
 
00:42:29.569 --> 00:42:29.579 align:start position:0%
um as I mentioned uh previously just the
 
00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:31.140 align:start position:0%
shift in consumer spending from
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic to current spending pattern
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
may continue into the long term as I
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned when we all realized how much
 
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
we like to eat out when we couldn't do
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
it for a period of time that seems to be
 
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a permanent change to
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
are you open to a question on that
 
00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:50.460 align:start position:0%
representative almi
 
00:42:53.089 --> 00:42:53.099 align:start position:0%
thank you you don't have Labor Force
 
00:42:53.099 --> 00:42:54.530 align:start position:0%
thank you you don't have Labor Force
sure

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
for restaurants and hotels including the
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
one I'm in at the moment uh it's pretty
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
drastic that is a great Point um I think
 
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
we've all seen restaurants that either
 
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
can't open for the full you know
 
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
offering lunch and dinner every day of
 
00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
the week
 
00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:13.140 align:start position:0%
those constraints as well that's a great
 
00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
Point representative thank you
 
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
on Slide Five this shows the 10-year
 
00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:19.609 align:start position:0%
on Slide Five this shows the 10-year
trend

00:43:19.609 --> 00:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
trend
 
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
in m r Revenue you see generally we had
 
00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:24.300 align:start position:0%
seen an increase year over year in
 
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
revenue from 2013 to 2019. you'll see
 
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
that dip in 2020 a recovery in 2021 and
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
then as we talked about it looks like
 
00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:38.220 align:start position:0%
there's a dip in fiscal year 22 but this
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
is reporting general fund Revenue so
 
00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:43.940 align:start position:0%
this is after the municipal
 
00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:49.640 align:start position:0%
fund transfer so fiscal 2021 revenues of
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
334.7 the transfer did not exist fiscal
 
00:43:58.130 --> 00:43:58.140 align:start position:0%
22 at 307.2 that is net of the 100.1
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
million dollar transfer so gross m r in
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 was 407.3 so we have seen an
 
00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:11.700 align:start position:0%
um again as we mentioned earlier you'll
 
00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
see we are significantly exceeding plan
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
but plan was developed during a lot of
 
00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:19.380 align:start position:0%
uncertainty during covid
 
00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang uh commissioner so if I
 
00:44:25.609 --> 00:44:25.619 align:start position:0%
look at 19 I'm sorry yeah 19 and 22 to
 
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
make them equalize I have to add about
 
00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
107 million dollars back in giving us a
 
00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
revenue of about uh 414 million and that
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
would be equal to what we look at in 19
 
00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:38.819 align:start position:0%
so we're ahead of we're about 50 million
 
00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
dollars in gross revenue ahead but after
 
00:44:45.069 --> 00:44:45.079 align:start position:0%
the adjustment correct thank you correct
 
00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:47.220 align:start position:0%
Senator Innis
 
00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:49.140 align:start position:0%
a real quick question
 
00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
um we've seen a lot of inflation in
 
00:44:52.849 --> 00:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
restaurant prices hotel rates have gone
 
00:44:54.589 --> 00:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
up significantly how much of this
 
00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
increase is due to inflation as opposed
 
00:44:58.730 --> 00:44:58.740 align:start position:0%
to a real increase in business and when
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
that of inflation subsides as we hope
 
00:45:05.329 --> 00:45:05.339 align:start position:0%
um what will be the impacts on on this
 
00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
Revenue what I'm trying to say is maybe
 
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:09.300 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't get quite so excited as we
 
00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:10.309 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't get quite so excited as we
are

00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:45:10.319 --> 00:45:11.510 align:start position:0%
are
so

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:14.660 align:start position:0%
I think the the inflation
 
00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
increasing revenues
 
00:45:20.569 --> 00:45:20.579 align:start position:0%
you also need to factor in if that
 
00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
inflation and increased prices has
 
00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
impacted consumer demand
 
00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
and so that's kind of the balance that
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
we maybe don't have the best insight
 
00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
into because we're just reporting the
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
revenue but if food prices are
 
00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
increasing so m r is increasing and the
 
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
demand is still there and consumers are
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
still spending but then we see those
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
prices go back down you could
 
00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
potentially see a hit so yeah it's it's
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
kind of the balance of the Demand versus
 
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
the prices
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
00:45:56.690 --> 00:45:56.700 align:start position:0%
representative Army
 
00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and we have a excellent on
 
00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
marketing program in economic Affairs on
 
00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:08.990 align:start position:0%
marketing program in economic Affairs on
which

00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
changes who it's going after depending
 
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
on whether there's a lot of money
 
00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:18.660 align:start position:0%
washing around in New England or or
 
00:46:25.309 --> 00:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
isn't at the time and would that be do
 
00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
you know well maybe we can find out from
 
00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
them on where they've been spending
 
00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
their money in the last year yes this
 
00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
program actually until we started
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
hitting major bumps was giving us five
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
percent more a year for years
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
I believe commissioner Caswell is coming
 
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
up right after me and I'm sure he'll be
 
00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:48.180 align:start position:0%
happy to talk about it he and I had a
 
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
brief conversation last week about some
 
00:46:53.329 --> 00:46:53.339 align:start position:0%
of the um targeted marketing that they
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
do when they do it why they do it and
 
00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
how quickly they can shift it if need be
 
00:46:59.390 --> 00:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
it was actually pretty fascinating so
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully he'll cover that with you as
 
00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.829 align:start position:0%
hopefully he'll cover that with you as
well

00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
on slide six
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
um this gets to what Senator Rosenwald
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
brought up earlier I don't have fiscal
 
00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
23 year to date on here
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
um but this will just show you kind of
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
the breakdown between meals rentals and
 
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles as the components of m r
 
00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
so meals is the largest portion of our m
 
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
r Revenue
 
00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
the breakdown is fairly consistent I
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
would just note fiscal 21 you saw a
 
00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:33.060 align:start position:0%
little bit of a shift towards the meals
 
00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:35.940 align:start position:0%
with meals being just 80 or going up to
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
82.1 percent where it had been hovering
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
around 80 almost consistently in Prior
 
00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
years and then in 22 was kind of a
 
00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:45.660 align:start position:0%
precursor to what Senator Rosenwald
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned where we've kind of now seen
 
00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:50.940 align:start position:0%
that shift into rooms rooms is up to 18
 
00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:54.660 align:start position:0%
percent in fiscal 22 where it had been
 
00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079 align:start position:0%
15 16 17 previously and I think when we
 
00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
look at 23 numbers as Senator Rosenwald
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned you'll see that shift even
 
00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
more so we just kind of look to see
 
00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
um the breakdown so that we can follow
 
00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
the trends of what's happening in the
 
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
representative Ellery
 
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner when we get into
 
00:48:21.069 --> 00:48:21.079 align:start position:0%
the drill down I've noticed that the uh
 
00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:25.380 align:start position:0%
81 to 79.7 uh
 
00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:28.380 align:start position:0%
percentra on the the meals can we have
 
00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:31.619 align:start position:0%
well will you be able to provide our
 
00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:33.660 align:start position:0%
relative uh meals and rooms tax
 
00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:37.740 align:start position:0%
comparison to the other states and
 
00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
some commentary as to why that's down at
 
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
79 instead of back up at 80 as I have a
 
00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:47.220 align:start position:0%
suspicion but I just would love to know
 
00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
sure we can look at the rates in other
 
00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
states we also can look at a breakdown a
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
more detailed breakdown as I mentioned
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
in previous slides about what makes up
 
00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
meals so whether it's fast food for
 
00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
instance right during covid we saw a
 
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
significant increase in fast food a
 
00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
decrease in full service restaurants
 
00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:06.180 align:start position:0%
right McDonald's was open but maybe
 
00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
Applebee's was closed so we can give you
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
a more detailed breakdown of the
 
00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:13.260 align:start position:0%
components within each of these as well
 
00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you thank you madam
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative
 
00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
Southworth thank you madam chair
 
00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
um yeah as a follow-up to Jordan's
 
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
question I'm interested in this data um
 
00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
about the pieces that are really kind of
 
00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
the large discrepancy in New Hampshire
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
where you have businesses closing new
 
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
businesses opening up some are just
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
barely getting by
 
00:49:35.809 --> 00:49:35.819 align:start position:0%
um you know all those things we kind of
 
00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
hear about the middle in all these
 
00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
presentations but as many people know
 
00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a huge range I mean
 
00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
I'm from the Seacoast business is
 
00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:45.900 align:start position:0%
booming but that's not true in other
 
00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
parts of the state
 
00:49:50.569 --> 00:49:50.579 align:start position:0%
we can we have a breakdown of m r
 
00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:53.460 align:start position:0%
Revenue also by County so we can show it
 
00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:55.740 align:start position:0%
to you by county and the changes over
 
00:49:58.370 --> 00:49:58.380 align:start position:0%
time we can also give you data on the
 
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:00.839 align:start position:0%
number of licenses that have closed as
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
opposed to new licenses that have opened
 
00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:04.980 align:start position:0%
again we can do that by County so we
 
00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
that's a great point we can get into
 
00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:10.970 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:10.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:13.980 align:start position:0%
next up the real estate transfer tax on
 
00:50:16.849 --> 00:50:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
the real estate transfer tax is imposed
 
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
on the sale transfer or granting of real
 
00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
property at a rate of a dollar fifty per
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars of the price or
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
consideration of the transfer half is
 
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
paid by the seller half is paid by the
 
00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:31.010 align:start position:0%
paid by the seller half is paid by the
buyer

00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:31.020 align:start position:0%
buyer
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
Rhett has increased in recent years we
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
saw 3.7 percent increase in 2020 over
 
00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:41.700 align:start position:0%
2019 a 32.4 percent increase in 21 over
 
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
20. a 10 10.9 percent increase in 22
 
00:50:47.089 --> 00:50:47.099 align:start position:0%
over 21.
 
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
for fiscal 23 actual revenue for the
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
first six months is 26.3 percent ahead
 
00:50:57.290 --> 00:50:57.300 align:start position:0%
of plan and 5.4 percent ahead of Prior
 
00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:59.030 align:start position:0%
of plan and 5.4 percent ahead of Prior
year

00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:01.980 align:start position:0%
this is I think what we've all seen in a
 
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
bit of a real estate boom here in New
 
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire maybe possibly driven by covid
 
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
and folks wanting to move to New
 
00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire move out of more urban areas
 
00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:14.030 align:start position:0%
Hampshire move out of more urban areas
um

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
things that we are watching at this
 
00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
point are the interest rates obviously
 
00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:21.660 align:start position:0%
as those go up that makes potential
 
00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
buyers more difficult for buyers to buy
 
00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
or might dissuade buyers from buying in
 
00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
the first place mortgage rates increased
 
00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
from just over three percent in October
 
00:51:37.549 --> 00:51:37.559 align:start position:0%
of 21 to 6.9 percent in October of 22.
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
so Rising interest rates are something
 
00:51:43.069 --> 00:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
that we're watching inflation as that
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
maybe pinches some household budgets
 
00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:48.900 align:start position:0%
that may impact whether or not folks are
 
00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
able to purchase or move to a new home
 
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
the slowing of demand obviously driven
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned by the interest rates by
 
00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:00.770 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned by the interest rates by
inflation

00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
00:52:03.049 --> 00:52:03.059 align:start position:0%
the other thing that that I think is
 
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:05.220 align:start position:0%
worth noting with respect to the real
 
00:52:07.849 --> 00:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
estate transfer tax is property values
 
00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
so uh property values were
 
00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:14.460 align:start position:0%
214.1 billion that's the total equalized
 
00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:16.460 align:start position:0%
value for all property in New Hampshire
 
00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
for April of 2022 versus 193.5 billion
 
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
in April of 21. so 22 saw a 10 increase
 
00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:30.180 align:start position:0%
in total equalized value in New
 
00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire over 21 the previous years we
 
00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
were looking at a five percent
 
00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
year-over-year increase so we have seen
 
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
significant increase in the value of
 
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.250 align:start position:0%
significant increase in the value of
property

00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:46.740 align:start position:0%
factors that can affect the future
 
00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
um red Revenue
 
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
the housing market Trend home prices may
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
have peaked we're not sure I don't know
 
00:52:59.390 --> 00:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
um if they have peaked
 
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
um that could impact Revenue decline in
 
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
the demand again from the interest rates
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
from the higher prices and just the low
 
00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
inventory that we've seen for a number
 
00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:11.460 align:start position:0%
of years now
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
with Rhett the thing to remember is that
 
00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:16.380 align:start position:0%
it's a balance between the number of
 
00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:20.220 align:start position:0%
sales the sales volume and the prices
 
00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
so sales can fall as we've seen at times
 
00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
but if prices go up that can sustain the
 
00:53:30.349 --> 00:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
rent Revenue
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
the opposite is also true if the number
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
of sales increases but the prices go
 
00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
down again the rent Revenue can be
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
sustained it's really when we start to
 
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
see the volume go down and the prices go
 
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
um we continue to watch the economy low
 
00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:55.740 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate strong wages generally
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
that is good for the housing market the
 
00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:01.140 align:start position:0%
inflation rate rise in prices Energy
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
prices Energy prices especially this
 
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
time of year that's something that a
 
00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:06.300 align:start position:0%
home buyer is likely to take into
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
account when deciding whether or not to
 
00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
purchase a home
 
00:54:12.049 --> 00:54:12.059 align:start position:0%
and then just general economic
 
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
uncertainty if buyers are uncertain
 
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
about the economic future that may
 
00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:18.780 align:start position:0%
dissuade them from purchasing
 
00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
future outlook changes in interest rates
 
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
will they continue to climb how long
 
00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:24.380 align:start position:0%
will they climb how high will they go
 
00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:27.660 align:start position:0%
and the tapering buyer demand so average
 
00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:30.839 align:start position:0%
days on the market increased 7.7 percent
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
in November of 22 as compared to
 
00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:36.420 align:start position:0%
November of 21 and pending sales
 
00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
decreased in 22 as compared to 21. so it
 
00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
the market is cooling it's not that same
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
as soon as it's listed it's sold for 10
 
00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
above asking it's starting to to come
 
00:54:51.130 --> 00:54:51.140 align:start position:0%
down a bit
 
00:54:54.829 --> 00:54:54.839 align:start position:0%
year-over-year change for November 22.
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
new property listings and pending sales
 
00:54:58.790 --> 00:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
decreased for single-family homes and
 
00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:00.049 align:start position:0%
decreased for single-family homes and
condos

00:55:00.049 --> 00:55:00.059 align:start position:0%
condos
 
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
for November 22 the sales price and
 
00:55:05.809 --> 00:55:05.819 align:start position:0%
monthly supply of inventory increased so
 
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
again we're seeing the volume decline
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
the the price increase
 
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
along with the inventory so the homes
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
are staying on the market a little bit
 
00:55:18.589 --> 00:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
longer but the prices are still
 
00:55:18.599 --> 00:55:21.670 align:start position:0%
longer but the prices are still
increasing

00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
November 22 single family home had a
 
00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
20-year low for the affordability index
 
00:55:30.650 --> 00:55:30.660 align:start position:0%
so the housing affordability index
 
00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
measures whether a typical family earns
 
00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:36.420 align:start position:0%
enough to qualify for a mortgage loan so
 
00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
an index of 120 would mean that median
 
00:55:42.049 --> 00:55:42.059 align:start position:0%
household income is a hundred and twenty
 
00:55:44.329 --> 00:55:44.339 align:start position:0%
percent of what they would need to
 
00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:45.900 align:start position:0%
qualify under the prevailing interest
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
rates so any any affordability index
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
over a hundred means that median income
 
00:55:54.829 --> 00:55:54.839 align:start position:0%
would qualify you for purchasing a home
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
November 22 is currently at 69 so median
 
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
family income is not enough
 
00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
to Quality about 30 short to qualify for
 
00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:08.940 align:start position:0%
um purchasing a home at the prevailing
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
interest rates
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
it means that homes are getting harder
 
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
to afford therefore the sales volume is
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
on page 10 this is the 10-year Revenue
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
you will note that the 22 plan is on the
 
00:56:38.109 --> 00:56:38.119 align:start position:0%
green line which was
 
00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
197.8 in fiscal 22 Revenue was 232.6 so
 
00:56:47.450 --> 00:56:47.460 align:start position:0%
we exceeded plan and the 23 plan is in
 
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
the red line which is
 
00:56:53.930 --> 00:56:53.940 align:start position:0%
181.9 which is less than the 22 plan so
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
we anticipated that the increase in ret
 
00:57:00.049 --> 00:57:00.059 align:start position:0%
that we had seen as a result of covet
 
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
and during covid was going to start to
 
00:57:06.049 --> 00:57:06.059 align:start position:0%
decline it hasn't happened yet so you'll
 
00:57:07.730 --> 00:57:07.740 align:start position:0%
see the revenues
 
00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
um our exceeding plan and still exceed
 
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
prior year but I think it's coming
 
00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
the the housing market signs are
 
00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:21.900 align:start position:0%
indicating that it is slowing so we
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
might start to see either ret level off
 
00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:26.220 align:start position:0%
or maybe start to see a bit of a decline
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
but we can talk about that in Greater
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
detail when we get into the actual
 
00:57:31.130 --> 00:57:31.140 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates and we will have some
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
some presentations from realtors in the
 
00:57:34.730 --> 00:57:34.740 align:start position:0%
both the residential and Commercial
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
world coming tomorrow so representative
 
00:57:39.049 --> 00:57:39.059 align:start position:0%
Petrie has a question and then Senator
 
00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
Murphy please
 
00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you have a
 
00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:46.980 align:start position:0%
breakdown of property values by county
 
00:57:48.770 --> 00:57:48.780 align:start position:0%
we do we would break down a property
 
00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
values by county and also by town and
 
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
that's available on our website but I
 
00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:55.140 align:start position:0%
can get a um a link to the chair to
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:01.130 --> 00:58:01.140 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair one quick question
 
00:58:03.170 --> 00:58:03.180 align:start position:0%
this housing affordability index is that
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire specific number that is
 
00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
Senator Lane so sticking with that
 
00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
question that line the the affordable
 
00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
index is really a price and interest
 
00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
rate as compared to wage is that is that
 
00:58:20.809 --> 00:58:20.819 align:start position:0%
the breakdown of that and as your price
 
00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
goes up and the interest goes up your if
 
00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
your wage doesn't go up in the same
 
00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:25.740 align:start position:0%
matter then you're more likely to not be
 
00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
able to get an affordable home correct
 
00:58:30.890 --> 00:58:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:38.089 --> 00:58:38.099 align:start position:0%
next we have the tobacco tax
 
00:58:41.329 --> 00:58:41.339 align:start position:0%
so the tobacco tax is
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
um on levied on each pack of cigarettes
 
00:58:48.370 --> 00:58:48.380 align:start position:0%
at a dollar 78 per pack of 20 and 2.23
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
cents per pack of 25 that
 
00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:55.140 align:start position:0%
um is indicated by a stamp that goes on
 
00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
the bottom of every pack of cigarettes
 
00:58:58.490 --> 00:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
that's sold
 
00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
the tobacco tax is also levied on all
 
00:59:03.109 --> 00:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
other tobacco products at a later rate
 
00:59:06.289 --> 00:59:06.299 align:start position:0%
of 65.03 percent of the wholesale sales
 
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
price so that would be your loose
 
00:59:11.329 --> 00:59:11.339 align:start position:0%
tobacco other products like that
 
00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:13.140 align:start position:0%
stamp sales
 
00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:14.870 align:start position:0%
stamp sales
um

00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:18.109 --> 00:59:18.119 align:start position:0%
and OTP make up the total tobacco tax so
 
00:59:20.809 --> 00:59:20.819 align:start position:0%
we tend to report in the revenue Focus
 
00:59:22.609 --> 00:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
Etc on the total tobacco tax but we'll
 
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
give you a bit of a breakdown here again
 
00:59:26.329 --> 00:59:26.339 align:start position:0%
so you can see the different components
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
I would note and I'll go into detail in
 
00:59:31.549 --> 00:59:31.559 align:start position:0%
a later slide that other tobacco
 
00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
products also includes the taxation of
 
00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:34.980 align:start position:0%
e-cigarettes and we'll talk about those
 
00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:36.180 align:start position:0%
are taxed a little bit differently and
 
00:59:38.809 --> 00:59:38.819 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about that in a couple slides
 
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
so tobacco tax revenue over the last
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
three years we saw a 5.7 percent
 
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
increase in 2020 over the prior year an
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
18.1 percent increase in 21 over 20
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
then we saw an 8.2 percent decrease in
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
22 from 21. year to date we are seven
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
percent below plan and 4.7 percent below
 
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
prior year
 
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
the share of OTP continues to grow so if
 
01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:08.460 align:start position:0%
you think of it like a pie chart the
 
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
largest portion of Revenue is stamp
 
01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:13.140 align:start position:0%
sales but the portion that is other
 
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
tobacco products is growing so it
 
01:00:18.349 --> 01:00:18.359 align:start position:0%
currently makes up 13.2 percent of the
 
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax compared to in fiscal 2012
 
01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
it was 3.4 percent so again we're seeing
 
01:00:27.049 --> 01:00:27.059 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a shift to other tobacco
 
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
products and away from the traditional
 
01:00:32.089 --> 01:00:32.099 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and stamp sales
 
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
factors that contribute to our tobacco
 
01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
tax revenue cross-border elasticity it
 
01:00:40.609 --> 01:00:40.619 align:start position:0%
is estimated that 52.4 percent of
 
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
cigarettes sold in New Hampshire are
 
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
consumed outside of New Hampshire
 
01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
so we have a very low tax rate compared
 
01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
to our surrounding states so we see a
 
01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
lot of our cigarettes
 
01:00:55.849 --> 01:00:55.859 align:start position:0%
go to other states
 
01:00:57.289 --> 01:00:57.299 align:start position:0%
it's important to note I think if you
 
01:00:59.089 --> 01:00:59.099 align:start position:0%
actually look at the number of of stamps
 
01:01:00.349 --> 01:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
that we sell and you look at our
 
01:01:00.359 --> 01:01:01.210 align:start position:0%
that we sell and you look at our
population

01:01:01.210 --> 01:01:01.220 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
it would probably be very jarring if if
 
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
we were to actually consume all of those
 
01:01:08.569 --> 01:01:08.579 align:start position:0%
cigarettes here we'd probably have some
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
severe Public Health crises
 
01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
um so it's just know that about half of
 
01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:14.220 align:start position:0%
our cigarettes that are sold are
 
01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
consumed outside of State
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
obviously public sentiment on Tobacco
 
01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.390 align:start position:0%
obviously public sentiment on Tobacco
consumption

01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
consumption
 
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
um we tend to see a little bit of a dip
 
01:01:24.829 --> 01:01:24.839 align:start position:0%
in in tobacco tax stamp sales in the
 
01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year maybe as there's
 
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
some New Year's resolutions to quit
 
01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.690 align:start position:0%
some New Year's resolutions to quit
smoking

01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:29.700 align:start position:0%
smoking
 
01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:31.740 align:start position:0%
um so you know January February tend to
 
01:01:34.849 --> 01:01:34.859 align:start position:0%
be lower months in revenue for us so as
 
01:01:37.849 --> 01:01:37.859 align:start position:0%
as public sentiment changes relative to
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
tobacco that can impact the tobacco tax
 
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
availity of Menthol and flavored tobacco
 
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
products that are banned in
 
01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:48.299 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so since June of 2020
 
01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
um Massachusetts has banned all flavored
 
01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
tobacco products including menthol
 
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
cigarettes that has driven a lot of
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
demand to New Hampshire especially at
 
01:01:59.690 --> 01:01:59.700 align:start position:0%
our border towns
 
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
the initial impact was estimated to be a
 
01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:05.819 align:start position:0%
22 percent increase in New Hampshire so
 
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:07.980 align:start position:0%
again we already had the lower tax rate
 
01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
we had that cross-border elasticity and
 
01:02:12.349 --> 01:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
then there were products that were no
 
01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
longer available in Massachusetts that
 
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
people came to New Hampshire to purchase
 
01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
there is also a potential Federal ban on
 
01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
Menthol flavored cigarettes and all
 
01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:25.980 align:start position:0%
flavors and cigars that would prohibit
 
01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as well from selling those
 
01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:29.210 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as well from selling those
products

01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:29.220 align:start position:0%
products
 
01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:30.839 align:start position:0%
the soonest that that would go into
 
01:02:32.690 --> 01:02:32.700 align:start position:0%
effect would be roughly a year from now
 
01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:35.510 align:start position:0%
effect would be roughly a year from now
1124

01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
1124
 
01:02:38.089 --> 01:02:38.099 align:start position:0%
the impact on our revenues would really
 
01:02:42.109 --> 01:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
depend on if consumers that are
 
01:02:44.329 --> 01:02:44.339 align:start position:0%
purchasing menthol cigarettes and
 
01:02:47.089 --> 01:02:47.099 align:start position:0%
flavored cigars whether they would shift
 
01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:48.839 align:start position:0%
to a different product a non-menthilated
 
01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
product or a non-flavored cigar or
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
whether they would stop consuming
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
altogether so it's really the consumer
 
01:02:56.809 --> 01:02:56.819 align:start position:0%
behavior that would ultimately Drive the
 
01:02:58.849 --> 01:02:58.859 align:start position:0%
impact on revenues this is something
 
01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
that we're watching
 
01:03:02.569 --> 01:03:02.579 align:start position:0%
um and we can you know talk to the
 
01:03:02.579 --> 01:03:03.950 align:start position:0%
um and we can you know talk to the
Committees

01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
Committees
 
01:03:06.289 --> 01:03:06.299 align:start position:0%
as you get into Revenue estimating about
 
01:03:07.849 --> 01:03:07.859 align:start position:0%
what we think in terms of the likelihood
 
01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
what would happen if this Federal ban
 
01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
went into effect
 
01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
commission representative question
 
01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
I thank you again commissioner I just
 
01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
saw that we're perfectly clear New
 
01:03:24.049 --> 01:03:24.059 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not uh discriminate
 
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
between uh flavored and non-flavored on
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
our tax rate so there's no way we would
 
01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
know what the impact would be
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
though the only way we would know would
 
01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
be to talk to our wholesalers
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
um they're the so the wholesalers
 
01:03:39.289 --> 01:03:39.299 align:start position:0%
purchase the tobacco tax stamps from us
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
they sell to the retailers and then the
 
01:03:43.609 --> 01:03:43.619 align:start position:0%
retailers sell to the consumers
 
01:03:44.809 --> 01:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
um we have a good working relationship
 
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
with the wholesalers so we can get some
 
01:03:50.089 --> 01:03:50.099 align:start position:0%
estimates on how much menthol cigarettes
 
01:03:53.809 --> 01:03:53.819 align:start position:0%
they sell compared to non-methylated
 
01:03:56.329 --> 01:03:56.339 align:start position:0%
um but again it would really it's an
 
01:03:58.370 --> 01:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
estimate in terms of what the impact
 
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
would be and that to your point thing we
 
01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
do here is a guest thank you and to your
 
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
point the tax rate is not different so
 
01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
there's not an easy way to do that thank
 
01:04:08.569 --> 01:04:08.579 align:start position:0%
you representative almi
 
01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and it's quite a difference
 
01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
between 20 and
 
01:04:15.609 --> 01:04:15.619 align:start position:0%
on 21
 
01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
21-22 and
 
01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
we've got just as I recall we have one
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
major distributor and a couple of
 
01:04:29.170 --> 01:04:29.180 align:start position:0%
somewhat smaller ones on and one of the
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
answers to that would be if they had
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
decided as they sometimes have done in
 
01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
order to send a signal to us or someone
 
01:04:41.569 --> 01:04:41.579 align:start position:0%
else that they were going to not get
 
01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
bonds for the months before the end of
 
01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:48.780 align:start position:0%
the year and get them after that on I
 
01:04:50.450 --> 01:04:50.460 align:start position:0%
don't know that's half of the question
 
01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:53.700 align:start position:0%
the other one is on
 
01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
can you find out
 
01:04:59.089 --> 01:04:59.099 align:start position:0%
what Massachusetts thinks is going on
 
01:05:02.410 --> 01:05:02.420 align:start position:0%
with their Menthol customers
 
01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
that is are they quitting because it's
 
01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
too much trouble to come up here and
 
01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
acquire their cigarettes or uh perhaps
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
going to eat vaping or something or
 
01:05:17.930 --> 01:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
what's going on sure so to answer your
 
01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
first question yes we track the amount
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
of bond receivable we have in any given
 
01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
month and we can go over that in Greater
 
01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:25.799 align:start position:0%
detail when we come before the committee
 
01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of what's happening in
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts there's actually a tax
 
01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:31.140 align:start position:0%
Foundation study that was done which is
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
where I got some of my numbers that
 
01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
showed um that New Hampshire had that
 
01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
roughly 20 to 22 percent increase in
 
01:05:41.530 --> 01:05:41.540 align:start position:0%
stamp sales and Rhode Island did as well
 
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
so there was a a move of consumers
 
01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
um when they couldn't buy their
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
mentholated products in Massachusetts
 
01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:49.799 align:start position:0%
anymore they kind of went to the two
 
01:05:53.329 --> 01:05:53.339 align:start position:0%
closest states to do so there's probably
 
01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:55.140 align:start position:0%
also a shift
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
um to e-cigarettes
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
um and and we're actually gonna I'm
 
01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
gonna talk about that in a greater
 
01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
detail in the next couple of slides so
 
01:06:05.089 --> 01:06:05.099 align:start position:0%
we can we can look at what's been going
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
on with respect to e-cigarettes
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you just remind the
 
01:06:13.490 --> 01:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
members we have there's what 30 pages 32
 
01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
pages in this slide presentation we have
 
01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
about 40 minutes left because you want
 
01:06:18.049 --> 01:06:18.059 align:start position:0%
to take a break after this presentation
 
01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
before the next one so the commission is
 
01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:22.140 align:start position:0%
going to be in front of both the Senate
 
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
and the house ways and convenience
 
01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
committee a lot you'll get her nowhere
 
01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
on a first name basis so there'd be
 
01:06:31.370 --> 01:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
page 12.
 
01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:35.700 align:start position:0%
I mentioned taxation of e-cigarettes so
 
01:06:38.089 --> 01:06:38.099 align:start position:0%
the e-cigarette tax went into effect on
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
January 1st of 2020 in New Hampshire it
 
01:06:43.849 --> 01:06:43.859 align:start position:0%
is levied on both closed systems which
 
01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
is when you purchase
 
01:06:47.690 --> 01:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
or so they tell me
 
01:06:50.690 --> 01:06:50.700 align:start position:0%
um a single piece an e-cigarette that's
 
01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
one piece
 
01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
um and also on open systems which is
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
where you have an interchangeable or
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
refillable liquid the closed systems and
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
open systems are taxed differently so
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
the closed system rate is 30 cents per
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
milliliter on the volume of the liquid
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
or other substance that's containing
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
nicotine in the cartridge and then on an
 
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
open system it's eight percent of the
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
wholesale sales price
 
01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
so this is different than the 65.03
 
01:07:23.329 --> 01:07:23.339 align:start position:0%
percent OTP tax rate E-cigarettes are
 
01:07:25.549 --> 01:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
taxed um differently from that
 
01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
the chart on this page really all it's
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
showing is from the Inception of the
 
01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:31.849 align:start position:0%
showing is from the Inception of the
taxation

01:07:31.849 --> 01:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
taxation
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
um just the increase that we've seen
 
01:07:37.549 --> 01:07:37.559 align:start position:0%
um so you'll see that in July of fiscal
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
21 we were
 
01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
collecting just over 300 000 in tobacco
 
01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:46.140 align:start position:0%
tax revenue from e-cigarettes on a
 
01:07:49.309 --> 01:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
monthly basis now coming into fiscal 23
 
01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
we had a high in July of 843 843
 
01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
000 and we're just
 
01:07:57.529 --> 01:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
um about 760
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
000 in December so we've seen a
 
01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
significant increase in Revenue due to
 
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:09.529 --> 01:08:09.539 align:start position:0%
this slide is just showing the 10-year
 
01:08:11.930 --> 01:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
trend on page 13 as we've seen from
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
other taxes
 
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
I just point out if you look from fiscal
 
01:08:18.650 --> 01:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
16 to fiscal 19 you'll see a consistent
 
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
downward Trend this is something that
 
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative Ami and I have talked
 
01:08:24.169 --> 01:08:24.179 align:start position:0%
about numerous times in ways and means
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
we were seeing a roughly three percent
 
01:08:28.849 --> 01:08:28.859 align:start position:0%
decrease in tobacco tax revenue year
 
01:08:30.650 --> 01:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
over year it felt like we knew what was
 
01:08:33.169 --> 01:08:33.179 align:start position:0%
happening we knew what was going on then
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
covid hit Massachusetts banned certain
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
products and from 19 to 21 we saw an
 
01:08:42.530 --> 01:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
increase in tobacco tax revenue
 
01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
21 to 22 you will see that decrease this
 
01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
might be more of the normalizing
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
um you know not only the Massachusetts
 
01:08:54.410 --> 01:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
ban of certain products but I think also
 
01:08:57.229 --> 01:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
covid it being a stressful time there
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
was a lot of uncertainty it was probably
 
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
not the time that a lot of folks
 
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
um decided to quit smoking
 
01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
um it the the other external factors at
 
01:09:10.849 --> 01:09:10.859 align:start position:0%
the time may have driven some demand so
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
we may be seeing some normalizing
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
year-to-date numbers compared to Prior
 
01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
year seem to indicate the same thing so
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
we may start looking at that more three
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
to four percent year-over-year decrease
 
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:25.849 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:09:25.849 --> 01:09:25.859 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
page 14 this is showing you just tobacco
 
01:09:31.970 --> 01:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
tax stamp Revenue so this is just the
 
01:09:34.329 --> 01:09:34.339 align:start position:0%
the tax on the packages of cigarettes
 
01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
you'll see again that downward Trends 16
 
01:09:42.110 --> 01:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
17 18 was relatively flat 19 decrease
 
01:09:46.729 --> 01:09:46.739 align:start position:0%
but then the increase in 21 20 and 21.
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
most likely due again to covid and the
 
01:09:51.169 --> 01:09:51.179 align:start position:0%
Menthol ban in Massachusetts
 
01:09:54.050 --> 01:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
and then on page 15 this is just showing
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
you other tobacco product stamp other
 
01:09:59.810 --> 01:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax revenue
 
01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
the blue is your traditional
 
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
OTP Revenue at 65.03 of the wholesale
 
01:10:08.570 --> 01:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
sales price the orange portion is when
 
01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
we added e-cigarettes so orange is just
 
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
showing you the portion of OTP Revenue
 
01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
related to e-cigarettes and again you
 
01:10:17.689 --> 01:10:17.699 align:start position:0%
can see that that has been growing
 
01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
next up we have the interest in
 
01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:27.900 align:start position:0%
dividends tax
 
01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
IND is assessed on interest and dividend
 
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
income of individuals Partnerships and
 
01:10:35.689 --> 01:10:35.699 align:start position:0%
fiduciaries the tax rate was five per
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
five percent for taxable periods ending
 
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
on or before December 31st of 2022 and
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
is in the process of being phased out
 
01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
so the rate will be four percent for
 
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
taxable periods ending on or after
 
01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
December 31st of 2023 the calendar year
 
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
that we are currently in we will go to
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
three percent then two percent then one
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
percent and then the tax will be fully
 
01:11:01.729 --> 01:11:01.739 align:start position:0%
repealed for periods beginning after
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.810 --> 01:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
IND Revenue over the past few years has
 
01:11:10.669 --> 01:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
fluctuated a little bit we've seen an
 
01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
increase of just under 10 percent from
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
19 to 20. we saw a four percent decrease
 
01:11:18.890 --> 01:11:18.900 align:start position:0%
from 20 to 21 but then saw a 30 percent
 
01:11:22.189 --> 01:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
increase from 21 to 22.
 
01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
actual revenue for the first six months
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
is 1.8 percent above plan we're actually
 
01:11:29.570 --> 01:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
pretty close to plan so
 
01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
um that's performing well and 5.4
 
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
percent above last year
 
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
factors that can impact IND economy and
 
01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
stock market performance obviously
 
01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
changing makeup of how
 
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
um IND is paid over time for example
 
01:11:48.050 --> 01:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
distributions we'll talk about this in a
 
01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
later slide you hear interest in
 
01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
dividends and so interest and dividends
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
are the first things that come to mind
 
01:11:55.490 --> 01:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
in terms of the tax base but we also tax
 
01:11:58.970 --> 01:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
distributions and so as those components
 
01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
the mix of those components changes over
 
01:12:04.010 --> 01:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
time that can impact the tax
 
01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
how much money you have in the bank and
 
01:12:08.330 --> 01:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
interest rates also impacting IND as
 
01:12:10.010 --> 01:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
interest rates go up that would indicate
 
01:12:11.630 --> 01:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
that we would receive additional IND
 
01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:14.810 align:start position:0%
that we would receive additional IND
Revenue

01:12:14.810 --> 01:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:17.460 align:start position:0%
tenure Trend
 
01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:19.010 align:start position:0%
tenure Trend
um

01:12:19.010 --> 01:12:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
fairly consistent increase in revenue
 
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
from 2016 to 2020 that slight dip in 21
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
and then increased Revenue again in 22.
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
you will see that the 22 and 23 plans
 
01:12:33.050 --> 01:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
are very close to one another we
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
expected that Revenue might kind of be
 
01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
um have limited growth from 22 to 23
 
01:12:44.330 --> 01:12:44.340 align:start position:0%
also included in that is the impact of
 
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
this shows you the breakdown of the
 
01:12:56.689 --> 01:12:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:58.850 --> 01:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
at the bottom is probably the easiest
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
way to see it in the chart you'll see
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
the percent of IND that is from
 
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
distributions from dividends from
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
federal tax exempt income and then from
 
01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:08.990 align:start position:0%
federal tax exempt income and then from
interest

01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
if you look at tax year 21 you'll see
 
01:13:15.169 --> 01:13:15.179 align:start position:0%
that distributions were 48.2 percent
 
01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
made up 48.2 percent of the IND Revenue
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
that we received that is a significant
 
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
increase from the 17.9 percent in 2012.
 
01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
so that's really a sign of of a strong
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
economy strong profits that are being
 
01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.890 align:start position:0%
economy strong profits that are being
distributed

01:13:30.890 --> 01:13:30.900 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
01:13:33.770 --> 01:13:33.780 align:start position:0%
um and then therefore taxed
 
01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
you will also notice the interest
 
01:13:40.610 --> 01:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
portion in 2012 was 35.9 percent in tax
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
year 21 it was 9 so again lower interest
 
01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.790 align:start position:0%
year 21 it was 9 so again lower interest
rates

01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
rates
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
um making up a smaller component of the
 
01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
IND tax as a whole we may see and I
 
01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
expect that we will see this interest
 
01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
portion increase as interest rates
 
01:13:55.320 --> 01:14:00.709 align:start position:0%
portion increase as interest rates
increase

01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
all right I guess we have a number of
 
01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
backed up questions here so we'll start
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
representative Platt and go to Senator
 
01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:07.189 align:start position:0%
representative Platt and go to Senator
uh

01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:14:10.729 --> 01:14:10.739 align:start position:0%
yes thank you that chart has no Legend
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
what color means what I noticed that as
 
01:14:14.770 --> 01:14:14.780 align:start position:0%
I was talking
 
01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
that's why I referred you to the chart
 
01:14:19.810 --> 01:14:19.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
we will add a legend to that I
 
01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:27.709 align:start position:0%
we will add a legend to that I
believe

01:14:27.709 --> 01:14:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
the distributions are blue
 
01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
the Dividends are orange
 
01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
the federal tax exempt interest is gray
 
01:14:41.330 --> 01:14:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:43.850 --> 01:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
Senator Roswell thank you madam chair
 
01:14:47.410 --> 01:14:47.420 align:start position:0%
to to what extent does that department
 
01:14:49.570 --> 01:14:49.580 align:start position:0%
have information
 
01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
on large family trusts where the IND
 
01:14:59.330 --> 01:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
liability is transferred to an
 
01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
individual's tax return versus just like
 
01:15:07.729 --> 01:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
a family who pays IND tax do we know
 
01:15:09.130 --> 01:15:09.140 align:start position:0%
anything about
 
01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
these trusts that we've enabled
 
01:15:15.709 --> 01:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
we can look into that I mean all that
 
01:15:17.330 --> 01:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
we're going to know is what's reported
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
to us so if it
 
01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
if it's not taxable it's not going to
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
show up on anything that we receive
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
so there has been you know changes in in
 
01:15:34.610 --> 01:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
recent years to the trust Statute in New
 
01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so we can we can try to do
 
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
a bit of analysis looking back over time
 
01:15:40.490 --> 01:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
but we're only going to have information
 
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
of what's reported to us on a tax return
 
01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
as a representative I'm poorovich how do
 
01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:58.970 --> 01:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
to be you know strength of the economy
 
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
and how much it's been to the Federal
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
you know policy of keeping interest
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
rates are deficient involved which
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
decreases the interest anybody can get
 
01:16:09.649 --> 01:16:09.659 align:start position:0%
there is no income to tax because there
 
01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
is no interest in received while you
 
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
know the same policy about a large
 
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
institution because the property came up
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
by the you know
 
01:16:21.169 --> 01:16:21.179 align:start position:0%
excessively low interest rate so correct
 
01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
that's a great point and something that
 
01:16:24.770 --> 01:16:24.780 align:start position:0%
we can do when we come before the
 
01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
Committees is not only give you the
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
percentages but give you the dollar
 
01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
amounts so you can see whether you know
 
01:16:34.729 --> 01:16:34.739 align:start position:0%
to your point
 
01:16:37.490 --> 01:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
um it may be fairly consistent interest
 
01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
amounts but it's looking like a smaller
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
proportion because of the total Pi so
 
01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
the percentages can be a little bit
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
potentially misleading so we can give
 
01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:48.900 align:start position:0%
actual dollar figures for the totals
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
which might be easier to um to see
 
01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
what's going on there
 
01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative almi
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you on I was asking this question
 
01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
yesterday actually but on we just
 
01:17:04.189 --> 01:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
started hearing about distributions a
 
01:17:06.530 --> 01:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago I guess I see why
 
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
now but can you explain the difference
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
between distributions that is in the tax
 
01:17:18.490 --> 01:17:18.500 align:start position:0%
law between distributions and uh
 
01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.830 align:start position:0%
law between distributions and uh
dividends

01:17:20.830 --> 01:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
dividends
 
01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
when we come before Ways and Means next
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to give you a more detailed
 
01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
primer on each of the taxes and how they
 
01:17:31.130 --> 01:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
operate so we can get into that detail
 
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
at that point and that'll hopefully
 
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
serve as a bit of a reference for you
 
01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
thank you could I just have a very short
 
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up on are the distributions
 
01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
something that only uh stockholders
 
01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:48.890 align:start position:0%
something that only uh stockholders
get

01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
not necessarily okay I don't believe so
 
01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:00.890 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:18:02.930 --> 01:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'm wondering if
 
01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
uh when I look at the distributions
 
01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
increasing so dramatically I'm wondering
 
01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
if there's a real estate sales component
 
01:18:12.649 --> 01:18:12.659 align:start position:0%
to that because if you've got companies
 
01:18:14.930 --> 01:18:14.940 align:start position:0%
that are handling real estate selling
 
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
real estate buying and and flipping
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
might that distribution
 
01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
potentially by that potentially and
 
01:18:24.649 --> 01:18:24.659 align:start position:0%
that's why too I think it would be
 
01:18:26.570 --> 01:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
helpful to see the actual numbers as
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
opposed to just the percentages and I
 
01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
wish I had thought of that before right
 
01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:30.890 align:start position:0%
wish I had thought of that before right
now

01:18:30.890 --> 01:18:30.900 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:18:33.490 --> 01:18:33.500 align:start position:0%
um so that you can see you know
 
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
distributions that has increased as a
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
percentage of total IND
 
01:18:41.630 --> 01:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
over time but it'd be helpful to see the
 
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
actual dollar increase as well because
 
01:18:45.890 --> 01:18:45.900 align:start position:0%
this might be a little bit inflated
 
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay please continue
 
01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
utility property tax so we have a couple
 
01:18:56.930 --> 01:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
smaller taxes that I'm going to cover
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
and I'll try to go through these quickly
 
01:18:59.870 --> 01:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
and then we'll talk about business taxes
 
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
you'll notice I saved that for the end
 
01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
um so the utility property tax is
 
01:19:07.370 --> 01:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
imposed on the value of utility property
 
01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
at a rate of 6.60 cents per one thousand
 
01:19:12.890 --> 01:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
dollars of value and the dra determines
 
01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
those values as of the April 1st of each
 
01:19:15.239 --> 01:19:16.250 align:start position:0%
those values as of the April 1st of each
year

01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:19:19.010 --> 01:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
audited upt Revenue over the past few
 
01:19:21.410 --> 01:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
years we saw 9.6 percent increase year
 
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
over year and 20 and 11.8 percent
 
01:19:26.330 --> 01:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
decrease in twenty one thirteen point
 
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
four percent increase in twenty two year
 
01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
to date we are 3.5 percent ahead of plan
 
01:19:34.729 --> 01:19:34.739 align:start position:0%
and nine point nine percent ahead of
 
01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
Prior year
 
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
tax year 22 assessments were 43.6
 
01:19:43.370 --> 01:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
million dollars that's based on a
 
01:19:45.970 --> 01:19:45.980 align:start position:0%
utility property value of 6.6 billion
 
01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
factors that it can impact upt obviously
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
the development of new uh renewable
 
01:19:53.630 --> 01:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
energy facilities that's more taxable
 
01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
property the valuation of the property
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
directly drives the taxes that we
 
01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
collect and then Energy prices supply
 
01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
and demand that can impact obviously the
 
01:20:06.050 --> 01:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
profits of the utilities and then the
 
01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
profits contribute to the value that we
 
01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
assess them at so these are are all
 
01:20:12.770 --> 01:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
things that kind of contribute to the
 
01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
utility property tax I did not include a
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
graph or any chart for this one it's
 
01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
roughly between 40 and 45 million
 
01:20:22.130 --> 01:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
dollars a year it's pretty
 
01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:25.010 align:start position:0%
dollars a year it's pretty
straightforward

01:20:25.010 --> 01:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:28.189 --> 01:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax
 
01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry while we're there
 
01:20:31.490 --> 01:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
representative allery please
 
01:20:33.290 --> 01:20:33.300 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner again sorry no worries uh
 
01:20:37.970 --> 01:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
the the question is
 
01:20:41.209 --> 01:20:41.219 align:start position:0%
this 6.6 per thousand
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
and we recently had the upgrades that
 
01:20:45.410 --> 01:20:45.420 align:start position:0%
took place throughout the southern part
 
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
of the state with you know screwed up
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
traffic and everything else uh
 
01:20:54.530 --> 01:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
what effect or is there a methods that
 
01:20:56.450 --> 01:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
you're often methodology by which your
 
01:20:59.090 --> 01:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
office could determine what effect that
 
01:21:02.169 --> 01:21:02.179 align:start position:0%
had on the overall cost if any
 
01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
of providing electricity to consumers in
 
01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
the state we wouldn't have any
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
information about the cost to the
 
01:21:13.850 --> 01:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
consumers we would just be looking at
 
01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
any impacts to the value of the utility
 
01:21:19.550 --> 01:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I just want I wonder how
 
01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
we can get that information would be
 
01:21:27.410 --> 01:21:27.420 align:start position:0%
very interesting to know
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
thank you sure you're welcome
 
01:21:33.649 --> 01:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax seven percent
 
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
on all two-way Communications
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
in 2012 an exclusion of charges for
 
01:21:42.169 --> 01:21:42.179 align:start position:0%
internet access decreased CST revenues
 
01:21:45.229 --> 01:21:45.239 align:start position:0%
significantly we cannot go back on that
 
01:21:48.350 --> 01:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
change there is a federal prohibition on
 
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
taxing internet access New Hampshire was
 
01:21:52.729 --> 01:21:52.739 align:start position:0%
grandfathered into that provision but
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
since it has been repealed we can no
 
01:21:58.430 --> 01:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
longer tax internet access
 
01:22:01.490 --> 01:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
and you can see you know cstu used to be
 
01:22:03.890 --> 01:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
between 76 and a half to 81 million
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
dollars following the removal of the
 
01:22:09.649 --> 01:22:09.659 align:start position:0%
taxation of internet access it's dropped
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
um to 47.1 to 59.3 million and then in
 
01:22:15.229 --> 01:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
the last three years we've considered
 
01:22:17.450 --> 01:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
continued to see other declines in CST
 
01:22:19.010 --> 01:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal 22 CST Revenue was just under
 
01:22:24.890 --> 01:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
30 million for the first six months of
 
01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:27.719 align:start position:0%
the year we are 23.8 percent below plan
 
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
and 6.4 percent below prior year
 
01:22:35.209 --> 01:22:35.219 align:start position:0%
things that have incred uh impacted the
 
01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
CST Revenue outside of the taxation of
 
01:22:40.250 --> 01:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
internet access just a decrease in land
 
01:22:42.530 --> 01:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
lines as you all know for a long time
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
people had a landline and a cell phone
 
01:22:48.290 --> 01:22:48.300 align:start position:0%
maybe a landline and two cell phones now
 
01:22:50.570 --> 01:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
there's just fewer and fewer landlines
 
01:22:54.229 --> 01:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
more cell phones so the decrease in
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
landlines affects CST
 
01:22:59.030 --> 01:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
modern pricing and purchasing trends for
 
01:23:01.370 --> 01:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
Wireless Communications
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
so if you look at your cell phone bill
 
01:23:06.410 --> 01:23:06.420 align:start position:0%
you will see typically that there is a
 
01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
portion of your bill that you pay that
 
01:23:11.930 --> 01:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
is related to your data usage and a
 
01:23:14.290 --> 01:23:14.300 align:start position:0%
portion that is related to your voice
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
that data is internet access and is not
 
01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:18.950 align:start position:0%
that data is internet access and is not
taxable

01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
taxable
 
01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
The Voice portion is taxable so as
 
01:23:24.590 --> 01:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
wireless communication companies have
 
01:23:27.229 --> 01:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
shifted the portion of your bill away
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
from voice to data that has a negative
 
01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:33.719 align:start position:0%
impact on CST Revenue
 
01:23:36.110 --> 01:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
VoIP and video conferencing that has a
 
01:23:38.810 --> 01:23:38.820 align:start position:0%
positive impact on CST Revenue
 
01:23:40.490 --> 01:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
um something that has
 
01:23:44.330 --> 01:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
um maybe uh uh increased a bit during
 
01:23:46.189 --> 01:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
covet as we all learned how to use zoom
 
01:23:47.570 --> 01:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
and other
 
01:23:50.450 --> 01:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
um video conferencing and VOIP options
 
01:23:52.010 --> 01:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
um so that is could have a positive
 
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
impact to CST Revenue
 
01:23:56.930 --> 01:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
CST Revenue as you'll see is just about
 
01:23:58.490 --> 01:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
30 million dollars a year it's a
 
01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
relatively small Revenue source
 
01:24:06.290 --> 01:24:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:08.450 --> 01:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has two business taxes we
 
01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
have the business Enterprise tax and the
 
01:24:13.310 --> 01:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
business profits tax the bet is assessed
 
01:24:15.229 --> 01:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
on the sum of all compensation paid or
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
accrued interest pay to recruit and
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
dividends paid by the business the BPT
 
01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
is assessed on income from the conduct
 
01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
of business activity within the state so
 
01:24:27.290 --> 01:24:27.300 align:start position:0%
BPT is your traditional business income
 
01:24:30.050 --> 01:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
tax bet is a tax regardless of whether
 
01:24:32.450 --> 01:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
your business is profitable
 
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
the BPT conforms to the Internal Revenue
 
01:24:38.229 --> 01:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
code in effect on December 31st of 2018
 
01:24:40.729 --> 01:24:40.739 align:start position:0%
for taxable periods beginning on or
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
after 2020 so we are currently conformed
 
01:24:46.610 --> 01:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
to the code of December 31st of 2018 in
 
01:24:49.490 --> 01:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
order to change that code there needs to
 
01:24:51.530 --> 01:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
be legislation we are not what is called
 
01:24:54.110 --> 01:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
a rolling Conformity state where we just
 
01:24:56.630 --> 01:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
update the code as it changes we are
 
01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
static Conformity so we conform to a
 
01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
specific date and then the legislature
 
01:25:03.470 --> 01:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
decides to update the date if they so
 
01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:05.270 align:start position:0%
decides to update the date if they so
choose

01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
choose
 
01:25:07.310 --> 01:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
factors that affect business taxes
 
01:25:09.169 --> 01:25:09.179 align:start position:0%
obviously the economy
 
01:25:11.689 --> 01:25:11.699 align:start position:0%
federal tax reform and stimulus programs
 
01:25:14.570 --> 01:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
mergers and Acquisitions various credits
 
01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
or exemptions and statutory changes
 
01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
on page 22 we'll talk about some of
 
01:25:22.729 --> 01:25:22.739 align:start position:0%
those statutory changes that have
 
01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
happened in recent years
 
01:25:28.610 --> 01:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
first market-based sourcing for taxable
 
01:25:30.770 --> 01:25:30.780 align:start position:0%
periods beginning on or after December
 
01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
31st of 21 this is Rel this impacts
 
01:25:38.810 --> 01:25:38.820 align:start position:0%
um a multi-states business apportionment
 
01:25:41.209 --> 01:25:41.219 align:start position:0%
how they apportion their income for
 
01:25:44.330 --> 01:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
services that they provide we were what
 
01:25:46.130 --> 01:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
was called the cost of performance state
 
01:25:47.689 --> 01:25:47.699 align:start position:0%
where you would look to where the
 
01:25:47.699 --> 01:25:48.910 align:start position:0%
where you would look to where the
service

01:25:48.910 --> 01:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
was performed a market-based sourcing
 
01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
state that we are now we look to where
 
01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
the customer is
 
01:26:00.169 --> 01:26:00.179 align:start position:0%
so if I'm an accountant and my customer
 
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
is in Massachusetts under a cost of
 
01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
performance State we would have said
 
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
that my activity was here in New
 
01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:07.550 align:start position:0%
that my activity was here in New
Hampshire

01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:26:10.129 --> 01:26:10.139 align:start position:0%
under a market-based sourcing State we
 
01:26:11.810 --> 01:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
say that my activity is in Massachusetts
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
because that's where my customer is
 
01:26:16.129 --> 01:26:16.139 align:start position:0%
so that change was effective for taxable
 
01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
periods ending on or after December 31st
 
01:26:21.410 --> 01:26:21.420 align:start position:0%
of 21 we have received and are analyzing
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
calendar year returns but have not yet
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
received all fiscal year filers so we'll
 
01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
have additional information on that when
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
we come before the Committees thank you
 
01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
another change cap on credit carryovers
 
01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:36.780 align:start position:0%
so a business
 
01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
um from year to year can have a credit
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
carryover they may make estimate
 
01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
payments during the year which are in
 
01:26:44.930 --> 01:26:44.940 align:start position:0%
excess of their liability they have the
 
01:26:46.729 --> 01:26:46.739 align:start position:0%
opportunity at the end of the year to
 
01:26:48.890 --> 01:26:48.900 align:start position:0%
either have the excess refunded to them
 
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
or to take it as a credit to carry over
 
01:26:53.209 --> 01:26:53.219 align:start position:0%
to Future periods
 
01:26:55.070 --> 01:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
for taxable periods ending on or after
 
01:26:58.970 --> 01:26:58.980 align:start position:0%
December 1st 31st of 22 they cannot
 
01:27:01.970 --> 01:27:01.980 align:start position:0%
carry forward more than 500 percent of
 
01:27:04.370 --> 01:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
their taxable liability
 
01:27:08.209 --> 01:27:08.219 align:start position:0%
that amount decreases to 250 percent for
 
01:27:10.669 --> 01:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
December 31st of 25 and a hundred
 
01:27:13.850 --> 01:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
percent for December 31st of 27. what
 
01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
this means is that we could see
 
01:27:16.970 --> 01:27:16.980 align:start position:0%
increased refunds
 
01:27:18.890 --> 01:27:18.900 align:start position:0%
um out of the business taxes and that
 
01:27:21.770 --> 01:27:21.780 align:start position:0%
would start to happen with that 500 cap
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
that would be for returns for calendar
 
01:27:25.729 --> 01:27:25.739 align:start position:0%
year filers that we start receiving in
 
01:27:27.890 --> 01:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
March and April so we have a taxpayer
 
01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
has more than 500 percent
 
01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
um in their liability in a CCO we will
 
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
need to refund whatever is in excess of
 
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
500 so that's something that we'll be
 
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
watching closely as returns start to
 
01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:45.890 --> 01:27:45.900 align:start position:0%
um another change single sales Factor
 
01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:47.820 align:start position:0%
apportionment that is a change for
 
01:27:49.729 --> 01:27:49.739 align:start position:0%
taxable periods on ending on or after
 
01:27:53.870 --> 01:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
December 31st of 22.
 
01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
prior to
 
01:27:58.250 --> 01:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
um taxable periods ending out or after
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
December 31st of 22 again this is an
 
01:28:04.669 --> 01:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
apportionment issue for taxpayers that
 
01:28:06.770 --> 01:28:06.780 align:start position:0%
operate in multiple States
 
01:28:08.570 --> 01:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
if you operate in multiple States
 
01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
historically we would apportion your
 
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
profits to New Hampshire based on
 
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
your payroll your property and your
 
01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:19.189 align:start position:0%
your payroll your property and your
sales

01:28:19.189 --> 01:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
sales
 
01:28:22.250 --> 01:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
for December 31st 22 forward we're only
 
01:28:24.050 --> 01:28:24.060 align:start position:0%
going to a portion based on your sales
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
so if again if you operate in New
 
01:28:28.189 --> 01:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in Massachusetts we're going
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
to look at how much of your sales are in
 
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire versus how much are in
 
01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and that's how we're going
 
01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
to apportion your income and only tax
 
01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:38.280 align:start position:0%
your sales into New Hampshire
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
those returns will start to be filed in
 
01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
March and April and again will be
 
01:28:44.689 --> 01:28:44.699 align:start position:0%
something that we will be watching
 
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
the next two bullets I won't read in
 
01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
detail these are just changes to the
 
01:28:51.890 --> 01:28:51.900 align:start position:0%
filing threshold for bet and BPT there
 
01:28:53.629 --> 01:28:53.639 align:start position:0%
we're increasing the filing threshold
 
01:28:55.850 --> 01:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
which means fewer returns will need to
 
01:28:58.370 --> 01:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
be filed so
 
01:29:01.310 --> 01:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
um for BPT the filing threshold for
 
01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
taxable periods beginning January 123
 
01:29:05.450 --> 01:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
you will not need to file a return
 
01:29:07.970 --> 01:29:07.980 align:start position:0%
unless your gross business income is in
 
01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
excess of a hundred and three thousand
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
dollars we will continue to adjust that
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
amount biennily going forward based on
 
01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
CPI and for bet the filing thresholds
 
01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
for taxable periods beginning January
 
01:29:24.290 --> 01:29:24.300 align:start position:0%
123 will be 281 000 in Gross business
 
01:29:27.169 --> 01:29:27.179 align:start position:0%
receipts or 281 000 of your Enterprise
 
01:29:30.350 --> 01:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
Value tax base so again the goal here is
 
01:29:32.990 --> 01:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
just to reduce the number of returns
 
01:29:34.610 --> 01:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
that need to be filed with us it's
 
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
better for small businesses reduces the
 
01:29:38.990 --> 01:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
amount of work that's necessary at the
 
01:29:40.610 --> 01:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
dra and again the thresholds will
 
01:29:42.290 --> 01:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
continue to adjust every other year
 
01:29:44.930 --> 01:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
two last statutory changes to cover
 
01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
first net operating loss calculation
 
01:29:54.050 --> 01:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
will be apportioned only in the year of
 
01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
the loss for taxable periods beginning
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
on or after December 31st 22
 
01:30:01.610 --> 01:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
historically the nol would be
 
01:30:03.890 --> 01:30:03.900 align:start position:0%
apportioned in the year of the loss and
 
01:30:06.169 --> 01:30:06.179 align:start position:0%
in the year that the nol was utilized so
 
01:30:08.810 --> 01:30:08.820 align:start position:0%
it was apportioned twice now with this
 
01:30:10.490 --> 01:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
single apportionment
 
01:30:12.050 --> 01:30:12.060 align:start position:0%
um they'll essentially will be more nol
 
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
available to businesses so we will see a
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
decrease in Revenue as a result of this
 
01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:16.550 align:start position:0%
decrease in Revenue as a result of this
change

01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:30:18.649 --> 01:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
and then BBT
 
01:30:22.490 --> 01:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
um rate reduces from 7.6 to 7.5 for
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
taxable periods ending on or after
 
01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
December 31st of 23. remember this is
 
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
only a BPT rate change there was no bet
 
01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
rate change for this tax period
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
okay while we're on legislative changes
 
01:30:38.709 --> 01:30:38.719 align:start position:0%
do we have any quick questions on those
 
01:30:40.729 --> 01:30:40.739 align:start position:0%
representative Almy
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
well a lot of these have a great deal of
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
detail and
 
01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
purpose behind them and I think we're
 
01:30:50.990 --> 01:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
going to have to get into them
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
agreed we can go over these in more
 
01:30:54.530 --> 01:30:54.540 align:start position:0%
detail in the Committees
 
01:30:55.669 --> 01:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
um especially the changes to
 
01:30:57.290 --> 01:30:57.300 align:start position:0%
apportionment apportionment is
 
01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:59.030 align:start position:0%
apportionment apportionment is
complicated

01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
um so we will be available to the
 
01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
committee as much as necessary to make
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
sure everyone
 
01:31:08.090 --> 01:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
feels like they at least have a minor
 
01:31:10.490 --> 01:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
understanding of of some of the
 
01:31:11.870 --> 01:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
technical changes that have been made
 
01:31:15.169 --> 01:31:15.179 align:start position:0%
recently we're happy to do that so I
 
01:31:18.290 --> 01:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
could just briefly uh in deference to a
 
01:31:21.770 --> 01:31:21.780 align:start position:0%
representative major who made this his
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years an obsession on the
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
cap on the credit carry forward is in
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
really important this committee did it
 
01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
but it is really important to maintain
 
01:31:41.390 --> 01:31:41.400 align:start position:0%
some version of it because we owed I
 
01:31:45.410 --> 01:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
think uh 400 million it got up over 300
 
01:31:49.250 --> 01:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
million above 300 million to uh
 
01:31:53.209 --> 01:31:53.219 align:start position:0%
companies for credit that they kept on
 
01:31:56.689 --> 01:31:56.699 align:start position:0%
our books and we have not accounted for
 
01:32:01.129 --> 01:32:01.139 align:start position:0%
that and if they show up and ask for it
 
01:32:04.129 --> 01:32:04.139 align:start position:0%
back uh we've got a problem so what
 
01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:06.719 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is reduce it as much
 
01:32:10.250 --> 01:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:12.590 --> 01:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative excuse me Senator Lang
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
sorry either one works
 
01:32:17.149 --> 01:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
um so just sticking with that topic of
 
01:32:19.370 --> 01:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
credit carryover I'm assuming as we go
 
01:32:20.930 --> 01:32:20.940 align:start position:0%
forward you'll give us some estimates of
 
01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:22.980 align:start position:0%
what those refunds might look like in
 
01:32:25.390 --> 01:32:25.400 align:start position:0%
December 31st of 25 and
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
27 so we have an idea of that for the
 
01:32:30.649 --> 01:32:30.659 align:start position:0%
future we um we did a fiscal note at the
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
time those were changes that I believe
 
01:32:35.090 --> 01:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
were in House Bill 2 but we can
 
01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
obviously update them we'll have actuals
 
01:32:39.649 --> 01:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
once we start receiving the returns so
 
01:32:41.450 --> 01:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
yes we'll we'll keep you updated on what
 
01:32:43.970 --> 01:32:43.980 align:start position:0%
we believe that impact to be and in all
 
01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:45.470 align:start position:0%
we believe that impact to be and in all
reality

01:32:45.470 --> 01:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
reality
 
01:32:47.450 --> 01:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
um the the impact can kind of happen in
 
01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
a couple ways if a business is aware of
 
01:32:52.850 --> 01:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
it they may choose to decrease their
 
01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
estimated payments and not necessarily
 
01:32:57.530 --> 01:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
be in a refund position so there's a
 
01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
combination of potential of foregone
 
01:33:02.270 --> 01:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
Revenue as opposed to having to issue a
 
01:33:05.629 --> 01:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
refund and there may be a greater chance
 
01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
of the decrease in estimated payments
 
01:33:09.770 --> 01:33:09.780 align:start position:0%
which would be foregone Revenue if we
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
start to see an economic downturn or
 
01:33:14.450 --> 01:33:14.460 align:start position:0%
slow down businesses may say hey I'll
 
01:33:16.370 --> 01:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
keep my money and I'll use what I have
 
01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
on account so we'll keep an eye on all
 
01:33:22.610 --> 01:33:22.620 align:start position:0%
that and we'll make sure we update you
 
01:33:24.770 --> 01:33:24.780 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald has a question thank
 
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
you madam chair this is not exactly
 
01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
related to the business taxes but will
 
01:33:34.030 --> 01:33:34.040 align:start position:0%
um dra be able to
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
update both the house and the Senate on
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
the cost of not taxing the PPP loans and
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
exactly what fiscal years those costs
 
01:33:49.070 --> 01:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:52.010 --> 01:33:52.020 align:start position:0%
the short answer is no oops
 
01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:53.450 align:start position:0%
the short answer is no oops
um

01:33:53.450 --> 01:33:53.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:56.570 align:start position:0%
um
because

01:33:56.570 --> 01:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
when we produced the fiscal note for
 
01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
those for um exempting PPP loans from
 
01:34:07.070 --> 01:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
gross income there was guidance from the
 
01:34:09.229 --> 01:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
IRS at the time that was instructing
 
01:34:12.050 --> 01:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
businesses to
 
01:34:14.090 --> 01:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
um assume that their loan would be
 
01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:15.470 align:start position:0%
um assume that their loan would be
forgiven

01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
forgiven
 
01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
we anticipated that businesses had paid
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
in assuming New Hampshire's perspective
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
and assuming that the loan would be
 
01:34:27.770 --> 01:34:27.780 align:start position:0%
forgiven what actually ended up
 
01:34:30.530 --> 01:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
happening is they didn't do that they
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
waited for the loan to actually be
 
01:34:33.709 --> 01:34:33.719 align:start position:0%
forgiven and by that point our
 
01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
legislation had passed
 
01:34:38.330 --> 01:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
so I think there were you're probably
 
01:34:39.770 --> 01:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
remembering there are pretty significant
 
01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue s impacts for Revenue that like
 
01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
estimated at the time that really I just
 
01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
don't think ever came to fruition ah
 
01:34:50.450 --> 01:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
okay so we're kind of for lack of a
 
01:34:52.669 --> 01:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
better term out of the woods on that one
 
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
okay those changes are behind us not
 
01:34:57.110 --> 01:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
something that we need to worry about
 
01:34:59.330 --> 01:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
and I guess fortunately the impact
 
01:35:01.610 --> 01:35:01.620 align:start position:0%
didn't happen to the extent that we
 
01:35:03.530 --> 01:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
anticipated thank you sure thank you
 
01:35:03.540 --> 01:35:05.629 align:start position:0%
anticipated thank you sure thank you
madam

01:35:05.629 --> 01:35:05.639 align:start position:0%
madam
 
01:35:05.639 --> 01:35:08.270 align:start position:0%
madam
okay

01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:11.209 --> 01:35:11.219 align:start position:0%
this is just a quick overview of
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
business tax revenues for fiscal 2013 to
 
01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:17.270 align:start position:0%
business tax revenues for fiscal 2013 to
2022

01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
2022
 
01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:17.990 align:start position:0%
2022
um

01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:19.250 --> 01:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
I would probably just bring your
 
01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
attention to the middle column the
 
01:35:24.410 --> 01:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
change in Revenue as a percent
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
you'll see the decrease of 11.9 percent
 
01:35:29.770 --> 01:35:29.780 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 20 and then an increase of
 
01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
41.3 and 22.22 percent
 
01:35:36.310 --> 01:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
um business taxes can be volatile
 
01:35:38.930 --> 01:35:38.940 align:start position:0%
they're probably our hardest tax to
 
01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:40.370 align:start position:0%
they're probably our hardest tax to
estimate

01:35:40.370 --> 01:35:40.380 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
01:35:42.530 --> 01:35:42.540 align:start position:0%
um recent volatility really was kind of
 
01:35:45.410 --> 01:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
magnified by by covid
 
01:35:47.930 --> 01:35:47.940 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:35:50.090 --> 01:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
the uncertainty of businesses but then
 
01:35:52.129 --> 01:35:52.139 align:start position:0%
the kind of the strong economy that
 
01:35:55.370 --> 01:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
seems to have come out of covid
 
01:35:57.770 --> 01:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
um fiscal year to date we are 28.7
 
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
percent ahead of plan and 2.7 percent
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
ahead of last year so we may be seeing a
 
01:36:08.450 --> 01:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
little bit of a slowing in the growth of
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
business taxes
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
um but we'll talk about the timing of
 
01:36:13.370 --> 01:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
business taxes in just a couple of
 
01:36:14.990 --> 01:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
slides so this was really just meant as
 
01:36:17.090 --> 01:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a history and to show
 
01:36:21.050 --> 01:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
you that business access can be volatile
 
01:36:23.209 --> 01:36:23.219 align:start position:0%
factors that contribute to business tax
 
01:36:23.219 --> 01:36:25.010 align:start position:0%
factors that contribute to business tax
revenue

01:36:25.010 --> 01:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
um overall businesses continue to show
 
01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:30.300 align:start position:0%
strong financial performance
 
01:36:32.930 --> 01:36:32.940 align:start position:0%
I think we all know in general some
 
01:36:35.149 --> 01:36:35.159 align:start position:0%
businesses or some industries did better
 
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
than others during covid I think we're
 
01:36:39.649 --> 01:36:39.659 align:start position:0%
fortunate here in New Hampshire that we
 
01:36:41.930 --> 01:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
have a fairly diverse tax base when it
 
01:36:43.729 --> 01:36:43.739 align:start position:0%
comes to the various industries that
 
01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
contribute to our business taxes
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
um certainly there are states that rely
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
very heavily on tourism or very heavily
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
on oil we have a diversity of businesses
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
within the state different Industries
 
01:36:57.649 --> 01:36:57.659 align:start position:0%
and so I think that kind of helped us
 
01:36:59.629 --> 01:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
weather the storm of covid a little bit
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
if if one industry like restaurants were
 
01:37:04.450 --> 01:37:04.460 align:start position:0%
struggling because they were closed
 
01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
another industry like retail sales were
 
01:37:09.410 --> 01:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
doing well we have all of those
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
Industries here and so we we came out of
 
01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
covet I think better than than some of
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
the other states
 
01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
factors that affect future business tax
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
revenue we talked about some statutory
 
01:37:23.090 --> 01:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
changes already we'll cover that in
 
01:37:24.530 --> 01:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
Greater detail when we're before the
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
Committees the economy supply chain
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
constraints obviously continue to be
 
01:37:33.350 --> 01:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
kind of out there as a looming issue
 
01:37:35.450 --> 01:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
um the inflation rate and that impact on
 
01:37:39.050 --> 01:37:39.060 align:start position:0%
consumer spending low unemployment rate
 
01:37:40.669 --> 01:37:40.679 align:start position:0%
um on one hand is good but as
 
01:37:42.290 --> 01:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
representative Ami alluded to earlier
 
01:37:43.850 --> 01:37:43.860 align:start position:0%
with restaurants
 
01:37:45.649 --> 01:37:45.659 align:start position:0%
um that can be bad if businesses can't
 
01:37:48.410 --> 01:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
find the staff to staff their businesses
 
01:37:51.709 --> 01:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
that can also drive up labor costs
 
01:37:54.169 --> 01:37:54.179 align:start position:0%
future outlook interest rate changes we
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
01:37:58.810 --> 01:37:58.820 align:start position:0%
um earlier continued global geopolitical
 
01:38:03.169 --> 01:38:03.179 align:start position:0%
stability economic uncertainty
 
01:38:06.350 --> 01:38:06.360 align:start position:0%
these are all things that we're watching
 
01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
um for what will come I will let the
 
01:38:11.149 --> 01:38:11.159 align:start position:0%
people that are going to talk after me
 
01:38:13.070 --> 01:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
talk about what they anticipate to
 
01:38:15.229 --> 01:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
happen with the economy
 
01:38:18.050 --> 01:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
um but you know we will watch for some
 
01:38:20.330 --> 01:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
slowing or halting of growth we will
 
01:38:23.570 --> 01:38:23.580 align:start position:0%
watch the unemployment rate and then
 
01:38:26.330 --> 01:38:26.340 align:start position:0%
we'll see what happens generally as the
 
01:38:29.149 --> 01:38:29.159 align:start position:0%
economy moves forward
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
this is just a slide of the 10-year
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
trend on business taxes which I kind of
 
01:38:38.090 --> 01:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:40.189 --> 01:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
this slide
 
01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
um just gives you a breakdown of our
 
01:38:45.410 --> 01:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
business tax revenue
 
01:38:48.290 --> 01:38:48.300 align:start position:0%
we receive Revenue in a variety of ways
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
we receive it on tax notices which is
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
the teal color we receive it on a return
 
01:38:56.570 --> 01:38:56.580 align:start position:0%
which is blue
 
01:38:59.570 --> 01:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
we receive Revenue with extensions which
 
01:39:01.490 --> 01:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
are green which is where you pay your
 
01:39:03.709 --> 01:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
tax liability and we give you an
 
01:39:05.570 --> 01:39:05.580 align:start position:0%
extension for you to give us your full
 
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
filled out return
 
01:39:09.709 --> 01:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
we receive revenue and estimates in red
 
01:39:13.070 --> 01:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
and then we send out Revenue in refunds
 
01:39:14.330 --> 01:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
in Orange
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
what I want to just note here is that
 
01:39:18.290 --> 01:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
estimates are our largest source of
 
01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:20.030 align:start position:0%
estimates are our largest source of
Revenue

01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
01:39:22.910 --> 01:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
estimates are a half page sheet
 
01:39:24.890 --> 01:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
it includes the taxpayer's name
 
01:39:26.930 --> 01:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
identification number and the amount of
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
money that they're paying
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
so we have very little information on
 
01:39:33.050 --> 01:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
the majority of the revenue that we
 
01:39:35.810 --> 01:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
receive which is why I point out at
 
01:39:37.490 --> 01:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
various times when we start receiving
 
01:39:40.729 --> 01:39:40.739 align:start position:0%
returns for certain statutory changes
 
01:39:42.709 --> 01:39:42.719 align:start position:0%
because we don't know the information
 
01:39:46.129 --> 01:39:46.139 align:start position:0%
until that return is filed if it is
 
01:39:48.830 --> 01:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
timely filed it is three or four months
 
01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
after the end of the taxpayers fiscal
 
01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:52.250 align:start position:0%
after the end of the taxpayers fiscal
year

01:39:52.250 --> 01:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:39:54.649 --> 01:39:54.659 align:start position:0%
if it is on extension you add seven
 
01:39:57.110 --> 01:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
months to that so we're close to a year
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes after the end of the taxpayers
 
01:40:01.610 --> 01:40:01.620 align:start position:0%
year before we get all the information
 
01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:03.540 align:start position:0%
that we need to tell you what's actually
 
01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
happening so we do our best but just
 
01:40:08.570 --> 01:40:08.580 align:start position:0%
know unless there's a nice little love
 
01:40:11.149 --> 01:40:11.159 align:start position:0%
note with the estimate that tells me why
 
01:40:12.890 --> 01:40:12.900 align:start position:0%
they're you know doubled it or why they
 
01:40:18.050 --> 01:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:20.209 --> 01:40:20.219 align:start position:0%
Senator link thank you so uh
 
01:40:22.129 --> 01:40:22.139 align:start position:0%
commissioner so understanding it's not
 
01:40:23.930 --> 01:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
again we have a lot of freshmen the
 
01:40:25.550 --> 01:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
estimates are based on the quarterly
 
01:40:27.169 --> 01:40:27.179 align:start position:0%
that they submit right so they
 
01:40:28.490 --> 01:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
anticipate the end of the year I guess
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna have to pay 100 bucks so I'm
 
01:40:32.270 --> 01:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
gonna pay out 25 every quarter until I
 
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
hit my hundred dollars correct but my
 
01:40:35.689 --> 01:40:35.699 align:start position:0%
liability might be more or less from
 
01:40:37.850 --> 01:40:37.860 align:start position:0%
that correct and so there's penalties if
 
01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
you make an underestimate you underpay
 
01:40:42.110 --> 01:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
your estimates but there's a safe harbor
 
01:40:45.050 --> 01:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
if you pay an amount that's equal to 90
 
01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
of your prior year so as long as you're
 
01:40:48.410 --> 01:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
making estimates based on your prior
 
01:40:50.689 --> 01:40:50.699 align:start position:0%
year liability your percent essentially
 
01:40:53.390 --> 01:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
protected from any penalties if your
 
01:40:55.370 --> 01:40:55.380 align:start position:0%
estimates are not sufficient to cover
 
01:40:58.250 --> 01:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
your year-end liability so which is why
 
01:41:00.530 --> 01:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
you will see that obviously we do get
 
01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:02.870 align:start position:0%
you will see that obviously we do get
Revenue

01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
01:41:05.330 --> 01:41:05.340 align:start position:0%
that come in on extensions and returns
 
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
because that's Revenue that was not
 
01:41:10.850 --> 01:41:10.860 align:start position:0%
covered through the estimated payments
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
um but yes in general they estimate
 
01:41:14.930 --> 01:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
their liability divided by four and send
 
01:41:18.050 --> 01:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
on page 28
 
01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
this just very quickly breaks down
 
01:41:26.750 --> 01:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimate Revenue being our
 
01:41:28.129 --> 01:41:28.139 align:start position:0%
largest source
 
01:41:30.169 --> 01:41:30.179 align:start position:0%
um based on the type of entity so
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
fiduciary's proprietorships Partnerships
 
01:41:34.129 --> 01:41:34.139 align:start position:0%
and corporations so you'll just see
 
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
corporations contribute to the majority
 
01:41:39.470 --> 01:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
of the revenue that we receive if anyone
 
01:41:41.689 --> 01:41:41.699 align:start position:0%
is familiar with the triangles that we
 
01:41:43.370 --> 01:41:43.380 align:start position:0%
kind of produce in our annual report
 
01:41:45.770 --> 01:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
this is not news to you but the majority
 
01:41:48.590 --> 01:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
of our Revenue comes from corporations
 
01:41:50.570 --> 01:41:50.580 align:start position:0%
in particular from your large
 
01:41:52.609 --> 01:41:52.619 align:start position:0%
multinational corporations that file
 
01:41:55.189 --> 01:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
what's called an 1120 we or Water's Edge
 
01:41:55.199 --> 01:41:59.390 align:start position:0%
what's called an 1120 we or Water's Edge
return

01:41:59.390 --> 01:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:02.990 --> 01:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
page 29 just is showing a breakdown
 
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
between BPT and bet everything that I've
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
covered up to this point has generally
 
01:42:10.609 --> 01:42:10.619 align:start position:0%
been the two taxes together
 
01:42:13.550 --> 01:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
I think this is helpful to see though
 
01:42:16.189 --> 01:42:16.199 align:start position:0%
um that historically Benton BPT have
 
01:42:19.490 --> 01:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
kind of tracked very similarly in recent
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
Years you'll see a pretty significant
 
01:42:23.810 --> 01:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
difference in the slope of the lines for
 
01:42:26.510 --> 01:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
bet and BPT so really this is just a
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
result of profits profits are just
 
01:42:31.370 --> 01:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
growing at a higher rate in recent years
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
I think as we all understand then the
 
01:42:40.189 --> 01:42:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
and then on page 30 just I think helpful
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
to kind of see all of the taxes together
 
01:42:50.270 --> 01:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
so you can see
 
01:42:51.649 --> 01:42:51.659 align:start position:0%
um how the taxes have generally
 
01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
performed during covid
 
01:42:56.450 --> 01:42:56.460 align:start position:0%
um our taxes were generally flat or
 
01:42:58.729 --> 01:42:58.739 align:start position:0%
positive for most of the taxes so as I
 
01:43:00.410 --> 01:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
said previously we fared covet pretty
 
01:43:02.810 --> 01:43:02.820 align:start position:0%
well but at the bottom it just kind of
 
01:43:04.129 --> 01:43:04.139 align:start position:0%
gives you an idea you know our business
 
01:43:07.070 --> 01:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
taxes are 1.2 billion and then going
 
01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
down to CST at 30 million so just to
 
01:43:11.330 --> 01:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
give you some kind of perspective on
 
01:43:13.370 --> 01:43:13.380 align:start position:0%
which taxes are the largest that we
 
01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:17.030 align:start position:0%
which taxes are the largest that we
collect

01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:21.050 --> 01:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
on page 31 Mr Kane alluded to this but
 
01:43:24.590 --> 01:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
what we've included here is
 
01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:25.250 align:start position:0%
what we've included here is
um

01:43:25.250 --> 01:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:28.850 --> 01:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
our fiscal 23 tax revenues so you can
 
01:43:31.370 --> 01:43:31.380 align:start position:0%
see what we collected in the first six
 
01:43:31.380 --> 01:43:32.570 align:start position:0%
see what we collected in the first six
months

01:43:32.570 --> 01:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
months
 
01:43:35.629 --> 01:43:35.639 align:start position:0%
versus what the first six months plan
 
01:43:37.729 --> 01:43:37.739 align:start position:0%
was so for business taxes you'll see
 
01:43:40.010 --> 01:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
we're 28.7 percent ahead
 
01:43:42.530 --> 01:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
I really want to draw your attention to
 
01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
the last six months
 
01:43:47.930 --> 01:43:47.940 align:start position:0%
plan as a percent of total plan so
 
01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
you'll see for business taxes utility
 
01:43:52.490 --> 01:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
property tax and Communication Service
 
01:43:55.669 --> 01:43:55.679 align:start position:0%
tax we've collected roughly half of the
 
01:43:56.810 --> 01:43:56.820 align:start position:0%
revenue it's
 
01:43:58.609 --> 01:43:58.619 align:start position:0%
pretty evenly spread throughout the year
 
01:44:00.830 --> 01:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
business taxes are shifted a little bit
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
more toward the second half of the year
 
01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
with March and April returns estimates
 
01:44:07.850 --> 01:44:07.860 align:start position:0%
and then June estimates
 
01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
you'll see for meals and rentals tobacco
 
01:44:11.629 --> 01:44:11.639 align:start position:0%
when the real estate transfer tax that
 
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
we've likely already collected a little
 
01:44:16.010 --> 01:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
more than half of the revenue and that's
 
01:44:17.870 --> 01:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
really due to some slowing in the winter
 
01:44:20.510 --> 01:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
months we talked about people maybe
 
01:44:22.609 --> 01:44:22.619 align:start position:0%
quitting smoking in the early part of
 
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
the calendar year
 
01:44:27.649 --> 01:44:27.659 align:start position:0%
um real estate transactions tend to be
 
01:44:31.189 --> 01:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
slower in winter months m r we can you
 
01:44:32.810 --> 01:44:32.820 align:start position:0%
know it's usually the summer and the
 
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
fall that produce a little bit more of
 
01:44:36.290 --> 01:44:36.300 align:start position:0%
the revenue
 
01:44:39.050 --> 01:44:39.060 align:start position:0%
the real Focus though for IND you'll see
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to receive over 75 percent
 
01:44:42.770 --> 01:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
of the revenue in the second half of the
 
01:44:46.010 --> 01:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
year that is through estimates that are
 
01:44:48.850 --> 01:44:48.860 align:start position:0%
due January 15th
 
01:44:51.530 --> 01:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
returns in April and then another round
 
01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
of estimates in June so there's a ways
 
01:44:56.330 --> 01:44:56.340 align:start position:0%
to go with IND Revenue so I just put
 
01:44:58.669 --> 01:44:58.679 align:start position:0%
that out there in terms of timing
 
01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
um it I wouldn't especially with IND I
 
01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't draw too many conclusions based
 
01:45:04.010 --> 01:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
on where we are for the first half of
 
01:45:05.149 --> 01:45:05.159 align:start position:0%
the year just because there's so much
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
revenue still to come in
 
01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
and then the very last slide just to be
 
01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:10.970 align:start position:0%
and then the very last slide just to be
thorough

01:45:10.970 --> 01:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
thorough
 
01:45:12.830 --> 01:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
there are some other taxes that dra
 
01:45:14.930 --> 01:45:14.940 align:start position:0%
administers that we didn't cover today
 
01:45:17.629 --> 01:45:17.639 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid enhancement tax the next
 
01:45:19.070 --> 01:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
thing to note about Medicaid enhancement
 
01:45:20.810 --> 01:45:20.820 align:start position:0%
tax is we have non-binding estimates
 
01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:22.860 align:start position:0%
that are due January 15th we'll report
 
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
to the Committees based on what we
 
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
receive of those non-binding estimates
 
01:45:28.850 --> 01:45:28.860 align:start position:0%
we also administer the nursing facility
 
01:45:31.490 --> 01:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
quality assessment the railroad tax and
 
01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
private car the excavation tax and
 
01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
Timber tax also known as sticks and
 
01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:37.490 align:start position:0%
Timber tax also known as sticks and
stones

01:45:37.490 --> 01:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
stones
 
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
and the Statewide education property tax
 
01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:42.719 align:start position:0%
so just to dot all of our eyes and cross
 
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
all of our T's I want it to be thorough
 
01:45:46.189 --> 01:45:46.199 align:start position:0%
and list them all out
 
01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
wonderful thank you very much that was a
 
01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
great overview we will learn more you
 
01:45:53.090 --> 01:45:53.100 align:start position:0%
will learn more do we have any final
 
01:45:55.070 --> 01:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
questions between before we take a short
 
01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:57.050 align:start position:0%
questions between before we take a short
break

01:45:57.050 --> 01:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
break
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
great thank you again thank you could
 
01:46:01.970 --> 01:46:01.980 align:start position:0%

pleasure to be here this morning with
 
02:04:43.970 --> 02:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
all of you there's a lot to talk about
 
02:04:46.550 --> 02:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
but I know we're going to focus on three
 
02:04:52.010 --> 02:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:54.830 --> 02:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
so I will start with
 
02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:55.550 align:start position:0%
so I will start with
um

02:04:55.550 --> 02:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:57.950 --> 02:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
I will start what we covered last year
 
02:05:00.350 --> 02:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
last year we were
 
02:05:03.169 --> 02:05:03.179 align:start position:0%
um we were talking about uh how we were
 
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
recovering from the economic crisis that
 
02:05:08.629 --> 02:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
occurred during the pandemic we had an
 
02:05:11.629 --> 02:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
extraordinary recovery revenues helped
 
02:05:11.639 --> 02:05:13.270 align:start position:0%
extraordinary recovery revenues helped
performed

02:05:13.270 --> 02:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
performed
 
02:05:16.550 --> 02:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
and we also were hearing about supply
 
02:05:19.010 --> 02:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
chain disruption the imbalance of
 
02:05:21.709 --> 02:05:21.719 align:start position:0%
Workforce so all of those things were
 
02:05:24.290 --> 02:05:24.300 align:start position:0%
happening last year when we when I was
 
02:05:28.129 --> 02:05:28.139 align:start position:0%
with you before and and so 2002 was
 
02:05:31.910 --> 02:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
another Rocky year right we we um it was
 
02:05:34.189 --> 02:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
the year of inflation it was
 
02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
um we continue to hear about Workforce
 
02:05:40.430 --> 02:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
and and and again inflation it was it is
 
02:05:42.649 --> 02:05:42.659 align:start position:0%
a global phenomenon so
 
02:05:46.129 --> 02:05:46.139 align:start position:0%
um what happened in 2002 is all the
 
02:05:48.830 --> 02:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
central banks around the world it
 
02:05:50.629 --> 02:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
started increasing rates so that really
 
02:05:54.950 --> 02:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
was what caused a lot of disruption in
 
02:05:59.330 --> 02:05:59.340 align:start position:0%
2020 to so we had a stock market that
 
02:06:01.189 --> 02:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
didn't like that who had the worst
 
02:06:04.609 --> 02:06:04.619 align:start position:0%
performance since 2008 since the Great
 
02:06:07.970 --> 02:06:07.980 align:start position:0%
Recession the bond market had the worst
 
02:06:12.050 --> 02:06:12.060 align:start position:0%
performance in history so they did not
 
02:06:15.890 --> 02:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
like to see that high inflation in
 
02:06:18.109 --> 02:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
seeing how the central banks were trying
 
02:06:19.930 --> 02:06:19.940 align:start position:0%
to combat
 
02:06:24.109 --> 02:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
that you know that new condition and
 
02:06:26.930 --> 02:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
economy so so with that I will start
 
02:06:29.270 --> 02:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
with just you know discussing what we
 
02:06:32.149 --> 02:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
will cover today and again we're going
 
02:06:33.770 --> 02:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
to talk about the state's Financial
 
02:06:33.780 --> 02:06:34.930 align:start position:0%
to talk about the state's Financial
condition

02:06:34.930 --> 02:06:34.940 align:start position:0%
condition
 
02:06:37.790 --> 02:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about our cash flows
 
02:06:41.570 --> 02:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
and reserves and our debt our bonds and
 
02:06:45.229 --> 02:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
our ratings so I wrote we can do
 
02:06:46.850 --> 02:06:46.860 align:start position:0%
questions and answers at the end but
 
02:06:53.510 --> 02:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:55.070 --> 02:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
um so all of you know what my office
 
02:06:57.589 --> 02:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
does so we are a non-partisan
 
02:06:59.390 --> 02:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional office
 
02:07:01.609 --> 02:07:01.619 align:start position:0%
um we are responsible for the cash
 
02:07:04.070 --> 02:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
Investments and
 
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
um the issuance of our general
 
02:07:07.729 --> 02:07:07.739 align:start position:0%
obligation bonds or revenue bonds and
 
02:07:09.589 --> 02:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
all the finance and activities that the
 
02:07:09.599 --> 02:07:10.790 align:start position:0%
all the finance and activities that the
state

02:07:10.790 --> 02:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:07:15.109 --> 02:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
um is you know engages in and as part of
 
02:07:16.370 --> 02:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
that we also have all the
 
02:07:19.010 --> 02:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
responsibilities we managed and claim
 
02:07:22.370 --> 02:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
property program we receive about I will
 
02:07:25.209 --> 02:07:25.219 align:start position:0%
say about 20 million dollars from
 
02:07:28.010 --> 02:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
holders from property holders each year
 
02:07:30.229 --> 02:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
and we return about
 
02:07:32.689 --> 02:07:32.699 align:start position:0%
um between six and seven million each
 
02:07:34.490 --> 02:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
year to the rifle owners of that
 
02:07:36.350 --> 02:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
property so last year we created about
 
02:07:38.510 --> 02:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
15 million to the general fund so that's
 
02:07:40.070 --> 02:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
about the amount that we credit each
 
02:07:43.010 --> 02:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
year we also responsible for the 539
 
02:07:45.890 --> 02:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
color savings program that continues to
 
02:07:47.629 --> 02:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
be a successful program in the state
 
02:07:50.209 --> 02:07:50.219 align:start position:0%
helping families stay for college right
 
02:07:52.729 --> 02:07:52.739 align:start position:0%
now we have about 21 billion in assets
 
02:07:55.129 --> 02:07:55.139 align:start position:0%
and the management again a very
 
02:07:57.709 --> 02:07:57.719 align:start position:0%
successful program and that is um we
 
02:07:59.089 --> 02:07:59.099 align:start position:0%
have that Administration with the
 
02:08:01.550 --> 02:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
college tuition Savings Plan advisor
 
02:08:01.560 --> 02:08:02.629 align:start position:0%
college tuition Savings Plan advisor
Commission

02:08:02.629 --> 02:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
02:08:04.850 --> 02:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
in a similar program that we have as a
 
02:08:07.310 --> 02:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
smaller and a smaller scale is the
 
02:08:10.729 --> 02:08:10.739 align:start position:0%
achieving a better life experience able
 
02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:12.719 align:start position:0%
Savings Program so it is a similar
 
02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
savings plan for individuals and
 
02:08:16.910 --> 02:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
families with disabilities so that
 
02:08:19.070 --> 02:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
program is growing I I have that
 
02:08:21.589 --> 02:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
co-administration with the governance
 
02:08:24.050 --> 02:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
Commission on disability and right now
 
02:08:26.030 --> 02:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
we have 6.4 million in assets under
 
02:08:29.330 --> 02:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
management about 800 accounts so that is
 
02:08:31.550 --> 02:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
again I think families are realizing
 
02:08:33.530 --> 02:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
what the benefits of the program are and
 
02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
they're taking advantage of that and as
 
02:08:38.990 --> 02:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
all of you know I serve on many multiple
 
02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
boards and commissions so we just
 
02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
essentially have our hands everywhere in
 
02:08:47.570 --> 02:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:51.530 --> 02:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
so um the good news is that in fiscal
 
02:08:55.010 --> 02:08:55.020 align:start position:0%
year 22 we had a another remarkable year
 
02:08:57.770 --> 02:08:57.780 align:start position:0%
in terms of of performance we we
 
02:08:59.030 --> 02:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
continue to
 
02:09:01.070 --> 02:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
um you know we continue that Trend as
 
02:09:03.830 --> 02:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
you heard from commissioner uh stepp uh
 
02:09:06.169 --> 02:09:06.179 align:start position:0%
Revenue so perform again and fiscal year
 
02:09:06.179 --> 02:09:07.910 align:start position:0%
Revenue so perform again and fiscal year
22

02:09:07.910 --> 02:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
22
 
02:09:10.490 --> 02:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
um again we just continues we just
 
02:09:13.609 --> 02:09:13.619 align:start position:0%
continue to see that uh the recovery
 
02:09:16.370 --> 02:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
from the pandemic you know caused by you
 
02:09:17.810 --> 02:09:17.820 align:start position:0%
know all of the various factors are
 
02:09:20.570 --> 02:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
really occurred as you know everyone was
 
02:09:21.649 --> 02:09:21.659 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
02:09:21.659 --> 02:09:23.290 align:start position:0%
trying to
um

02:09:23.290 --> 02:09:23.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:26.270 --> 02:09:26.280 align:start position:0%
improve the economy and 2021 between
 
02:09:29.629 --> 02:09:29.639 align:start position:0%
monetary policy fiscal policy all of
 
02:09:31.370 --> 02:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
that came together and all those States
 
02:09:34.430 --> 02:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
benefited from from that so we obviously
 
02:09:37.550 --> 02:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
the state did really well and so we had
 
02:09:40.790 --> 02:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
a restrictive revenue of about 3.2
 
02:09:44.290 --> 02:09:44.300 align:start position:0%
million billion dollars and that was
 
02:09:49.310 --> 02:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
435.5 Million above plans about 15.6
 
02:09:50.810 --> 02:09:50.820 align:start position:0%
percent so I know you heard from
 
02:09:52.669 --> 02:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner stepped all of the the
 
02:09:54.589 --> 02:09:54.599 align:start position:0%
performance of an individual taxes so
 
02:09:56.089 --> 02:09:56.099 align:start position:0%
right now I'm going to focus on under 60
 
02:09:56.099 --> 02:09:57.350 align:start position:0%
right now I'm going to focus on under 60
Revenue

02:09:57.350 --> 02:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
02:09:59.089 --> 02:09:59.099 align:start position:0%
um so we can see
 
02:09:59.099 --> 02:09:59.930 align:start position:0%
um so we can see
um

02:09:59.930 --> 02:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:01.970 --> 02:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
um you know how the state uh performed
 
02:10:03.530 --> 02:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
and and again all of these is
 
02:10:05.510 --> 02:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
information do you already know I'm I'm
 
02:10:08.390 --> 02:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
just simply recapping what was reported
 
02:10:10.189 --> 02:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
in the annual comprehensive financial
 
02:10:13.070 --> 02:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
report and that's um in the next three
 
02:10:13.080 --> 02:10:14.570 align:start position:0%
report and that's um in the next three
slides

02:10:14.570 --> 02:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
slides
 
02:10:14.580 --> 02:10:15.830 align:start position:0%
slides
um

02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:18.410 --> 02:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
so so with that additional Revenue that
 
02:10:20.030 --> 02:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
was above plan of course all you know
 
02:10:22.189 --> 02:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
that you took advantage of that and
 
02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
there were additional Appropriations
 
02:10:27.649 --> 02:10:27.659 align:start position:0%
um that were um above and beyond what
 
02:10:30.109 --> 02:10:30.119 align:start position:0%
was uh budgeted for fiscal year 22 and
 
02:10:33.709 --> 02:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
23 there was about 140 million uh
 
02:10:36.470 --> 02:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
designated for fiscal year 22 in about
 
02:10:39.530 --> 02:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
175 million for fiscal 23. I might have
 
02:10:42.050 --> 02:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
this 175 million
 
02:10:46.189 --> 02:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
um not 100 that's an exact or estimate
 
02:10:48.550 --> 02:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
but that's what I have from my records
 
02:10:51.609 --> 02:10:51.619 align:start position:0%
perhaps you heard from um
 
02:10:54.830 --> 02:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
LBA Mr Kane you know what that amount
 
02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:55.970 align:start position:0%
LBA Mr Kane you know what that amount
was

02:10:55.970 --> 02:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:10:57.470 --> 02:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
um but with that
 
02:10:59.330 --> 02:10:59.340 align:start position:0%
um you know we had um the general
 
02:11:01.490 --> 02:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
education trust fund had an undissimated
 
02:11:04.430 --> 02:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
balance so what we call surplus of uh
 
02:11:09.310 --> 02:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
361 million and from that it was uh
 
02:11:12.589 --> 02:11:12.599 align:start position:0%
253.3 million relative to general fund
 
02:11:14.990 --> 02:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
and 108 million relative to the
 
02:11:18.290 --> 02:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
02:11:21.470 --> 02:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
and so the um the revenue civilization
 
02:11:23.450 --> 02:11:23.460 align:start position:0%
account or rainy day fund finished the
 
02:11:27.770 --> 02:11:27.780 align:start position:0%
year with 159 point million and that
 
02:11:29.050 --> 02:11:29.060 align:start position:0%
compares to
 
02:11:32.149 --> 02:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
257.8 million that we had in fiskier 22.
 
02:11:35.270 --> 02:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
so we added 2.1 million of legal
 
02:11:38.149 --> 02:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
settlement funds and also 100 million
 
02:11:41.450 --> 02:11:41.460 align:start position:0%
was appropriated to the YDC settlement
 
02:11:43.310 --> 02:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
funds so again is this information that
 
02:11:45.649 --> 02:11:45.659 align:start position:0%
you already know and the next page is
 
02:11:49.129 --> 02:11:49.139 align:start position:0%
how is presented in the
 
02:11:52.790 --> 02:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
and the act for the fiscal year 22 I
 
02:11:54.770 --> 02:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
just I'm including the table how is
 
02:11:57.290 --> 02:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
presented and again it just shows
 
02:12:00.169 --> 02:12:00.179 align:start position:0%
um how the unrestricted right now for
 
02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22
 
02:12:06.229 --> 02:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
um how it includes the Appropriations it
 
02:12:10.790 --> 02:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
includes some lapses and fiskier 222 of
 
02:12:14.209 --> 02:12:14.219 align:start position:0%
about 104 million and
 
02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
um again then the Signet of fund balance
 
02:12:19.390 --> 02:12:19.400 align:start position:0%
all the way down is
 
02:12:22.729 --> 02:12:22.739 align:start position:0%
253 million for the general fund 108 for
 
02:12:26.450 --> 02:12:26.460 align:start position:0%
the education Fund in 360 1.3 million in
 
02:12:28.550 --> 02:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
total and it shows again the activity
 
02:12:30.890 --> 02:12:30.900 align:start position:0%
for the rainy day fund what I believe
 
02:12:32.689 --> 02:12:32.699 align:start position:0%
the Comptroller's office wanted to show
 
02:12:34.669 --> 02:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
in this case even though the 100 million
 
02:12:36.589 --> 02:12:36.599 align:start position:0%
that is designated for the YDC
 
02:12:39.410 --> 02:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
settlement fund that's applicable for
 
02:12:41.629 --> 02:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23.
 
02:12:43.310 --> 02:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
um I know the controller's office wanted
 
02:12:46.010 --> 02:12:46.020 align:start position:0%
to show that and and the ACT first so
 
02:12:48.830 --> 02:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
it's separated at 100 million separately
 
02:12:52.430 --> 02:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
from the rainy day fund so again we now
 
02:12:53.990 --> 02:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
see and we're going to talk about the
 
02:12:55.370 --> 02:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
renew the fund a little later in the
 
02:12:57.709 --> 02:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
presentation but that is
 
02:12:57.719 --> 02:12:58.850 align:start position:0%
presentation but that is
um

02:12:58.850 --> 02:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:02.270 --> 02:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
what is presented in the aquifer didn't
 
02:13:06.290 --> 02:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
the next page is also a piece this is a
 
02:13:08.149 --> 02:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
table that is also including the Akron
 
02:13:09.890 --> 02:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
this is how the controller's office was
 
02:13:11.689 --> 02:13:11.699 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
02:13:14.330 --> 02:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
um I guess percent the additional
 
02:13:16.609 --> 02:13:16.619 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that happened
 
02:13:19.330 --> 02:13:19.340 align:start position:0%
um that were in addition to the budget
 
02:13:22.850 --> 02:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
so this table shows what was approved in
 
02:13:25.370 --> 02:13:25.380 align:start position:0%
house bill one house bill two then again
 
02:13:28.310 --> 02:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
those Appropriations the signal for
 
02:13:30.890 --> 02:13:30.900 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 is 140 million for the
 
02:13:32.629 --> 02:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
02:13:36.830 --> 02:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
um and that is it also shows a few um I
 
02:13:38.330 --> 02:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
guess adjustments and something that
 
02:13:41.109 --> 02:13:41.119 align:start position:0%
caught my attention was some of those
 
02:13:44.810 --> 02:13:44.820 align:start position:0%
105 million was um there was designated
 
02:13:47.629 --> 02:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
for fiscuit 22 agencies are moving into
 
02:13:50.450 --> 02:13:50.460 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23
 
02:13:52.430 --> 02:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
um so that's that must be encumbrances
 
02:13:54.350 --> 02:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
in in all the transfers Appropriations
 
02:13:56.750 --> 02:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
but what I wanted to show you with my my
 
02:13:59.330 --> 02:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
uh my arrows hopefully I was successful
 
02:14:03.609 --> 02:14:03.619 align:start position:0%
with that this total of
 
02:14:06.169 --> 02:14:06.179 align:start position:0%
208 I'm not 200
 
02:14:08.629 --> 02:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
um 2.8 billion
 
02:14:11.750 --> 02:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
is what is the amount that is in the
 
02:14:14.689 --> 02:14:14.699 align:start position:0%
table above
 
02:14:14.699 --> 02:14:16.850 align:start position:0%
table above
that

02:14:16.850 --> 02:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:14:19.250 --> 02:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
blue arrow there it's just showing
 
02:14:20.450 --> 02:14:20.460 align:start position:0%
essentially all of the total
 
02:14:23.290 --> 02:14:23.300 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and between those
 
02:14:26.149 --> 02:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
Appropriations minus the lapses it gives
 
02:14:28.490 --> 02:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
you what is being presented as total net
 
02:14:30.050 --> 02:14:30.060 align:start position:0%
Appropriations hopefully I'm not
 
02:14:31.790 --> 02:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
confusing anybody but
 
02:14:34.490 --> 02:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
again an extraordinary year in fiscal
 
02:14:37.010 --> 02:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
year 22 and that's what is being shown
 
02:14:43.189 --> 02:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:45.649 --> 02:14:45.659 align:start position:0%
so this is just a trend of unrestrictive
 
02:14:49.189 --> 02:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
Revenue you can see how this span this
 
02:14:51.649 --> 02:14:51.659 align:start position:0%
is understood terrain has been
 
02:14:54.290 --> 02:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
um increasing increasing over time with
 
02:14:56.870 --> 02:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
a few exceptions obviously we can see
 
02:14:58.850 --> 02:14:58.860 align:start position:0%
um you know the performance in 2020
 
02:15:01.370 --> 02:15:01.380 align:start position:0%
there was a decline decline in
 
02:15:03.290 --> 02:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
performance but this I just wanted to
 
02:15:05.810 --> 02:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
show you the 10-year Trend and this and
 
02:15:10.850 --> 02:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:14.030 --> 02:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
this next graph I I like to look at this
 
02:15:15.470 --> 02:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
graph just because it shows the
 
02:15:17.750 --> 02:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
performance and the revenue growth and
 
02:15:20.689 --> 02:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
the city Revenue growth over time and I
 
02:15:23.209 --> 02:15:23.219 align:start position:0%
like to I've been compiling data now and
 
02:15:24.770 --> 02:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
and this shows
 
02:15:28.430 --> 02:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
um the the performance since 2007 and as
 
02:15:30.410 --> 02:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
you can see how um
 
02:15:33.589 --> 02:15:33.599 align:start position:0%
and the Peaks that um decline in Peaks
 
02:15:37.370 --> 02:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
it just shows how during those economic
 
02:15:40.089 --> 02:15:40.099 align:start position:0%
downturns we we had that
 
02:15:43.490 --> 02:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
significant declines in in 2009 we have
 
02:15:45.470 --> 02:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
negative seven percent
 
02:15:50.149 --> 02:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
um in 2020 we had negative six percent
 
02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
um the other one anomaly that is is
 
02:15:56.569 --> 02:15:56.579 align:start position:0%
presented here is really in 2004 when
 
02:15:58.729 --> 02:15:58.739 align:start position:0%
um the revenue that we as was being
 
02:16:00.890 --> 02:16:00.900 align:start position:0%
presented as unrestricted at that moment
 
02:16:02.649 --> 02:16:02.659 align:start position:0%
which is the Medicaid enhancement tax
 
02:16:05.569 --> 02:16:05.579 align:start position:0%
was changed and it was recharacterized
 
02:16:07.850 --> 02:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
as restrictive Revenue so since then
 
02:16:09.470 --> 02:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
it's been considered restrictive Revenue
 
02:16:11.629 --> 02:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
but again the performance it just shows
 
02:16:14.030 --> 02:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
how um how the state has performed over
 
02:16:17.450 --> 02:16:17.460 align:start position:0%
time so a compound annual growth rate of
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
2.1 percent since 2007.
 
02:16:23.810 --> 02:16:23.820 align:start position:0%
um again there's so much in this data it
 
02:16:26.350 --> 02:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
could be again we have a combination of
 
02:16:28.550 --> 02:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
economic downturns
 
02:16:31.690 --> 02:16:31.700 align:start position:0%
um tax change tax change inches at
 
02:16:34.490 --> 02:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
reductions in some taxes so it's really
 
02:16:36.410 --> 02:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
perhaps there's a lot to analyze here
 
02:16:39.290 --> 02:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
but it just shows how that performance
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
has occurred over time and of course we
 
02:16:46.509 --> 02:16:46.519 align:start position:0%
have that peak in 2021 that shows uh 21
 
02:16:49.310 --> 02:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
Revenue growth which is uh incredible
 
02:16:53.629 --> 02:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
and then again in 2015 year 22 we had an
 
02:16:55.490 --> 02:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
80 percent
 
02:16:55.500 --> 02:16:56.049 align:start position:0%
80 percent
um

02:16:56.049 --> 02:16:56.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:59.570 --> 02:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
growth over the prior year and then
 
02:17:03.009 --> 02:17:03.019 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 based on what the revenue
 
02:17:06.969 --> 02:17:06.979 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to date it looks like we are
 
02:17:10.870 --> 02:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
revenue is about plan about 22 percent
 
02:17:14.810 --> 02:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
and it's 3.5 percent uh over the prior
 
02:17:16.610 --> 02:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
year so again another
 
02:17:19.250 --> 02:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
um again fiscal year 22 was a strong
 
02:17:22.370 --> 02:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
year fiscal year 22 it looks like fiscal
 
02:17:25.490 --> 02:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
year 23 it looks like it's um
 
02:17:29.209 --> 02:17:29.219 align:start position:0%
we are in a strong position to perhaps
 
02:17:36.049 --> 02:17:36.059 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:38.270 --> 02:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
so this is not an economic update and I
 
02:17:40.429 --> 02:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to include a few uh a
 
02:17:42.650 --> 02:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
few economic indicators just to give you
 
02:17:44.450 --> 02:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
a background of where things have been
 
02:17:46.969 --> 02:17:46.979 align:start position:0%
and how you know the decisions that have
 
02:17:49.129 --> 02:17:49.139 align:start position:0%
been made by central banks
 
02:17:49.139 --> 02:17:49.730 align:start position:0%
been made by central banks
um

02:17:49.730 --> 02:17:49.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:52.009 --> 02:17:52.019 align:start position:0%
the the Federal Reserve has two mandates
 
02:17:54.770 --> 02:17:54.780 align:start position:0%
one is price stability the other one is
 
02:17:57.650 --> 02:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
of Full Employment so because of that
 
02:18:00.349 --> 02:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
they're looking at a variety of economic
 
02:18:02.570 --> 02:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
factors and
 
02:18:04.910 --> 02:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
um unemployment rate has been strong as
 
02:18:07.009 --> 02:18:07.019 align:start position:0%
as you all know and especially in New
 
02:18:09.110 --> 02:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have a 2.6 rate and I know
 
02:18:11.990 --> 02:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear from experts about
 
02:18:14.330 --> 02:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
um how the economy has been and where
 
02:18:16.790 --> 02:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's going but this is just to give you
 
02:18:19.429 --> 02:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
an indication that unemployment rate and
 
02:18:21.290 --> 02:18:21.300 align:start position:0%
and labor participation has been strong
 
02:18:23.110 --> 02:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
the further service
 
02:18:26.030 --> 02:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
they continue to watch that activity but
 
02:18:27.770 --> 02:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
they feel comfortable with that piece
 
02:18:29.389 --> 02:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
the Pisa obviously they're not
 
02:18:31.549 --> 02:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
comfortable with is the inflation and
 
02:18:35.570 --> 02:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
how inflation has changed since 2021 and
 
02:18:38.030 --> 02:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
we can see that in December of 22 we had
 
02:18:40.190 --> 02:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
an inflation of seven percent in the
 
02:18:42.169 --> 02:18:42.179 align:start position:0%
beginning of our service was discussing
 
02:18:44.870 --> 02:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
the fact that it was a it inflation was
 
02:18:47.389 --> 02:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
transitory well at the end of last year
 
02:18:50.150 --> 02:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
they started removing that that term and
 
02:18:52.009 --> 02:18:52.019 align:start position:0%
and really start worrying about
 
02:18:54.349 --> 02:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
inflation and sticky inflation
 
02:18:57.589 --> 02:18:57.599 align:start position:0%
and so we saw in 22 how inflation
 
02:19:00.830 --> 02:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
continued in the last um and so and
 
02:19:02.270 --> 02:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
that's when the photos have started
 
02:19:04.610 --> 02:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
increasing rates so in March of uh 22
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
the federal service started increasing
 
02:19:07.910 --> 02:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
rates for the first time and after that
 
02:19:10.849 --> 02:19:10.859 align:start position:0%
increased rates seven times and they've
 
02:19:13.629 --> 02:19:13.639 align:start position:0%
been very aggressive with that
 
02:19:16.009 --> 02:19:16.019 align:start position:0%
it appears that what they're doing
 
02:19:18.530 --> 02:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
they're also trying to remove the size
 
02:19:20.330 --> 02:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
of the balance sheet so all of the
 
02:19:23.330 --> 02:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
pieces the the monetary policy policy
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
appears to be working inflation is
 
02:19:29.270 --> 02:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
starting to come down and again we know
 
02:19:32.030 --> 02:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
how all of this is started obviously the
 
02:19:34.009 --> 02:19:34.019 align:start position:0%
the the fact that we have a war in
 
02:19:34.019 --> 02:19:35.270 align:start position:0%
the the fact that we have a war in
Ukraine

02:19:35.270 --> 02:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
Ukraine
 
02:19:38.530 --> 02:19:38.540 align:start position:0%
um impact Energy prices and it impacted
 
02:19:42.169 --> 02:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
of food prices so all of that is is
 
02:19:43.730 --> 02:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
starting to
 
02:19:43.740 --> 02:19:45.490 align:start position:0%
starting to
um

02:19:45.490 --> 02:19:45.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
balance a little better and again
 
02:19:50.330 --> 02:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
obviously this is is not clear whether
 
02:19:52.429 --> 02:19:52.439 align:start position:0%
it's inflation is going to
 
02:19:52.439 --> 02:19:53.150 align:start position:0%
it's inflation is going to
um

02:19:53.150 --> 02:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:54.889 --> 02:19:54.899 align:start position:0%
if it's going to continue to decline but
 
02:19:56.830 --> 02:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
again this is this is this is the
 
02:19:59.870 --> 02:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
factors that the everyone is is really
 
02:19:59.880 --> 02:20:01.190 align:start position:0%
factors that the everyone is is really
watching

02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
watching
 
02:20:03.170 --> 02:20:03.180 align:start position:0%
um so Madam Treasurer could we interrupt
 
02:20:04.429 --> 02:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
for just one moment for a quick question
 
02:20:06.170 --> 02:20:06.180 align:start position:0%
while we're on this slide absolutely
 
02:20:07.310 --> 02:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
thank you so much representative
 
02:20:07.320 --> 02:20:10.849 align:start position:0%
thank you so much representative
Schamberg

02:20:10.849 --> 02:20:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:13.910 --> 02:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you madam
 
02:20:16.250 --> 02:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
Treasurer uh how quickly are you
 
02:20:18.790 --> 02:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
informed when the Federal Reserve makes
 
02:20:21.910 --> 02:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
their decision to either raise or lower
 
02:20:24.950 --> 02:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
interest rate so you can do
 
02:20:28.730 --> 02:20:28.740 align:start position:0%
our policy here in this state
 
02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
um we're we're very aware of what what
 
02:20:32.090 --> 02:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
is happening
 
02:20:33.889 --> 02:20:33.899 align:start position:0%
um all the time I mean it it's just not
 
02:20:36.110 --> 02:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
and we'll talk about and about that in a
 
02:20:36.120 --> 02:20:37.190 align:start position:0%
and we'll talk about and about that in a
minute

02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
minute
 
02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:37.849 align:start position:0%
minute
um

02:20:37.849 --> 02:20:37.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:40.550 --> 02:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
do you prefer away okay okay sounds good
 
02:20:41.750 --> 02:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
and then hopefully if that doesn't
 
02:20:43.309 --> 02:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
answer your question I'll we can go back
 
02:20:46.010 --> 02:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
to that perfect
 
02:20:48.290 --> 02:20:48.300 align:start position:0%
so so that brings me to the next side
 
02:20:48.300 --> 02:20:49.309 align:start position:0%
so so that brings me to the next side
really

02:20:49.309 --> 02:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:20:49.319 --> 02:20:50.330 align:start position:0%
really
um

02:20:50.330 --> 02:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:50.340 --> 02:20:51.410 align:start position:0%
um
um

02:20:51.410 --> 02:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:56.090 --> 02:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
for anyone who's um not familiar with
 
02:20:59.750 --> 02:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
the with this um the U.S uh treasure
 
02:21:02.090 --> 02:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
yield curve perhaps
 
02:21:02.100 --> 02:21:02.929 align:start position:0%
yield curve perhaps
um

02:21:02.929 --> 02:21:02.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:05.270 --> 02:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
this is this is the the U.S treasury
 
02:21:09.710 --> 02:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
yield curve it just shows what um is is
 
02:21:11.210 --> 02:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
really the
 
02:21:13.309 --> 02:21:13.319 align:start position:0%
um a representation of how rates are
 
02:21:16.010 --> 02:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
short-term to long term and this is
 
02:21:18.170 --> 02:21:18.180 align:start position:0%
something uh the financial markets uh
 
02:21:20.210 --> 02:21:20.220 align:start position:0%
investors and everyone is is watching so
 
02:21:23.750 --> 02:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
this is how investors are feeling the
 
02:21:26.870 --> 02:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
the the the environment right now so uh
 
02:21:29.570 --> 02:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
with the with the changes in the with
 
02:21:31.490 --> 02:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
the changes that the Federal Reserve
 
02:21:33.349 --> 02:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
hasn't been making
 
02:21:33.359 --> 02:21:34.790 align:start position:0%
hasn't been making
um

02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
I guess a plus problem
 
02:21:38.690 --> 02:21:38.700 align:start position:0%
um I just wanna um I guess try to
 
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
explain the chart
 
02:21:44.870 --> 02:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
um if you look at the um the dotted line
 
02:21:47.929 --> 02:21:47.939 align:start position:0%
the blue data line
 
02:21:49.910 --> 02:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
um that represents the normal yield
 
02:21:52.010 --> 02:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
curve and what that shows is that it
 
02:21:52.020 --> 02:21:53.210 align:start position:0%
curve and what that shows is that it
shows

02:21:53.210 --> 02:21:53.220 align:start position:0%
shows
 
02:21:56.389 --> 02:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
um short-term rates are lower than the
 
02:22:00.410 --> 02:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
than the long-term rates obviously if
 
02:22:02.450 --> 02:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
you are invested in a short term you're
 
02:22:04.790 --> 02:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
expected to be if you're if you invest
 
02:22:06.110 --> 02:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
in long term you're expected to be
 
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
compensated at a higher yield when you
 
02:22:10.849 --> 02:22:10.859 align:start position:0%
invest for a longer period of time so
 
02:22:13.010 --> 02:22:13.020 align:start position:0%
this is what the normal yield Curve will
 
02:22:15.710 --> 02:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
show but what's been happening with the
 
02:22:20.030 --> 02:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
with the changes and and rates is as a
 
02:22:22.849 --> 02:22:22.859 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve as increasing rates the
 
02:22:25.250 --> 02:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
U the the yield curve is changing so
 
02:22:26.690 --> 02:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
it's putting all the pressure at the
 
02:22:28.849 --> 02:22:28.859 align:start position:0%
front end of the curve and as you can
 
02:22:32.690 --> 02:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
see the the blue the blue line that is
 
02:22:35.870 --> 02:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
the activity at December 31st of 2022
 
02:22:37.969 --> 02:22:37.979 align:start position:0%
you can see how the higher rates are the
 
02:22:40.969 --> 02:22:40.979 align:start position:0%
front end of the curve and they are um
 
02:22:44.510 --> 02:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
Chin Chin at the long term they're lower
 
02:22:44.520 --> 02:22:45.530 align:start position:0%
Chin Chin at the long term they're lower
um

02:22:45.530 --> 02:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:48.050 --> 02:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
so so so again what what the follower
 
02:22:49.790 --> 02:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
server has been doing uh reducing the
 
02:22:51.170 --> 02:22:51.180 align:start position:0%
size of their balance sheet and
 
02:22:53.510 --> 02:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
increasing rates it's just changing how
 
02:22:57.050 --> 02:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
this curve is is is being presented and
 
02:22:58.790 --> 02:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
one of the things that that is interest
 
02:23:01.969 --> 02:23:01.979 align:start position:0%
interest very interesting is how
 
02:23:04.309 --> 02:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
um how the front end
 
02:23:07.309 --> 02:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
and even when you see that the two-year
 
02:23:11.090 --> 02:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
re the two-year yield and the is higher
 
02:23:13.910 --> 02:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
than the 10-year yield that typical
 
02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:16.010 align:start position:0%
than the 10-year yield that typical
represents

02:23:16.010 --> 02:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
represents
 
02:23:17.889 --> 02:23:17.899 align:start position:0%
um what is an indication of a recession
 
02:23:20.750 --> 02:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
so the markets have been predicting this
 
02:23:23.270 --> 02:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
so and it's called the
 
02:23:26.030 --> 02:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
um is called the um
 
02:23:29.270 --> 02:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
that the the yield curve has inverted so
 
02:23:30.770 --> 02:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
the Yale curb inverter for the first
 
02:23:34.130 --> 02:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
time in April of 22 and then it diverted
 
02:23:37.070 --> 02:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
again and July of 22. so since then the
 
02:23:39.250 --> 02:23:39.260 align:start position:0%
markets have been predicting this
 
02:23:41.870 --> 02:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
potential recession and that typically
 
02:23:44.809 --> 02:23:44.819 align:start position:0%
happens between 6 and 12 months
 
02:23:46.670 --> 02:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
um but again that could change you know
 
02:23:50.090 --> 02:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
as as new economic data um
 
02:23:53.030 --> 02:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
um changes in in in
 
02:23:54.830 --> 02:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's available to investors in the
 
02:23:57.170 --> 02:23:57.180 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve obviously that that
 
02:23:59.210 --> 02:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
performance can change but this is just
 
02:24:00.830 --> 02:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
an indication of how things have changed
 
02:24:03.710 --> 02:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
since last year and what the yield curve
 
02:24:07.670 --> 02:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
looks like right now and that is um and
 
02:24:10.309 --> 02:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
so we're we're aware of so the markets
 
02:24:12.110 --> 02:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
can continuously talk about this they're
 
02:24:14.150 --> 02:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
constantly discussing well what is the
 
02:24:15.650 --> 02:24:15.660 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve going to do so right now
 
02:24:17.450 --> 02:24:17.460 align:start position:0%
there's expectation that the ferrissa
 
02:24:19.730 --> 02:24:19.740 align:start position:0%
will continue to raise rates
 
02:24:21.230 --> 02:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
um they've been very aggressive in the
 
02:24:22.790 --> 02:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
very beginning but now they're expecting
 
02:24:25.250 --> 02:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
to perhaps slow down for the rest of the
 
02:24:25.260 --> 02:24:26.630 align:start position:0%
to perhaps slow down for the rest of the
year

02:24:26.630 --> 02:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:24:26.640 --> 02:24:27.530 align:start position:0%
year
um

02:24:27.530 --> 02:24:27.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:30.590 --> 02:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
and um but but there's but they're
 
02:24:32.809 --> 02:24:32.819 align:start position:0%
expected to continue to raise the raids
 
02:24:35.750 --> 02:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
until they feel that they're tackled
 
02:24:37.969 --> 02:24:37.979 align:start position:0%
inflation because their target their
 
02:24:39.650 --> 02:24:39.660 align:start position:0%
their target is to bring inflation down
 
02:24:41.990 --> 02:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
to two percent
 
02:24:43.849 --> 02:24:43.859 align:start position:0%
um so this is this is what the market
 
02:24:45.950 --> 02:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
the bond market investors are seeing
 
02:24:48.410 --> 02:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
this is they they see that in the long
 
02:24:52.429 --> 02:24:52.439 align:start position:0%
term rates are going to be about 3.96 4
 
02:24:54.530 --> 02:24:54.540 align:start position:0%
range and this is what the market
 
02:24:56.270 --> 02:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
predicting the predicting a recession
 
02:24:58.250 --> 02:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
over the next
 
02:25:01.429 --> 02:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
six to 12 months again it's hard to know
 
02:25:05.210 --> 02:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
but that's the picture that we are all
 
02:25:05.220 --> 02:25:05.990 align:start position:0%
but that's the picture that we are all
um

02:25:05.990 --> 02:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:10.190 --> 02:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:12.650 --> 02:25:12.660 align:start position:0%
the next jar is what the fervous service
 
02:25:14.929 --> 02:25:14.939 align:start position:0%
thinking so every time they meet they
 
02:25:17.510 --> 02:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
make decisions and
 
02:25:19.130 --> 02:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
um every quarter they update their
 
02:25:19.140 --> 02:25:20.270 align:start position:0%
um every quarter they update their
economic

02:25:20.270 --> 02:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
economic
 
02:25:23.150 --> 02:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
um projections so this is a chart that
 
02:25:23.160 --> 02:25:24.830 align:start position:0%
um projections so this is a chart that
shows

02:25:24.830 --> 02:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
shows
 
02:25:27.950 --> 02:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
how they see rates over the next few
 
02:25:30.590 --> 02:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
years so based on their information the
 
02:25:33.170 --> 02:25:33.180 align:start position:0%
economic data that they captured
 
02:25:34.790 --> 02:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
um they believe the inflation is going
 
02:25:36.590 --> 02:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
to go down but they believe that they're
 
02:25:37.969 --> 02:25:37.979 align:start position:0%
going to continue to increase rates so
 
02:25:40.670 --> 02:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
the medium the the solar line here shows
 
02:25:43.130 --> 02:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
the medium and this is when the Forester
 
02:25:45.410 --> 02:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
meets they all discuss
 
02:25:47.210 --> 02:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
um where they think rates are going to
 
02:25:50.210 --> 02:25:50.220 align:start position:0%
be so in 23 they expect that the rate is
 
02:25:53.150 --> 02:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
going to have a terminal rate of 5.1
 
02:25:55.730 --> 02:25:55.740 align:start position:0%
percent and 23 they expect right now
 
02:25:59.030 --> 02:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
that in 24 they're going to be about 4.1
 
02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
percent uh and 25 they're going to be
 
02:26:04.550 --> 02:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
about 3.1 percent and then just slower
 
02:26:06.410 --> 02:26:06.420 align:start position:0%
over time and about
 
02:26:06.420 --> 02:26:07.030 align:start position:0%
over time and about
um

02:26:07.030 --> 02:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:09.349 --> 02:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
three and a half percent so there's a
 
02:26:10.550 --> 02:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
difference between what the FED is
 
02:26:12.590 --> 02:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
thinking and what the bond market or
 
02:26:14.150 --> 02:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
what the investors are thinking as you
 
02:26:16.010 --> 02:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
can see them the investors think well
 
02:26:17.690 --> 02:26:17.700 align:start position:0%
it's going to be long term it's going to
 
02:26:19.309 --> 02:26:19.319 align:start position:0%
be about four percent in the long run
 
02:26:21.830 --> 02:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
the Foreign Service thinking less there
 
02:26:23.570 --> 02:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
is uh obviously that debate that they
 
02:26:25.849 --> 02:26:25.859 align:start position:0%
will have to decide or just over time
 
02:26:28.370 --> 02:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
will know what really will happen but
 
02:26:30.410 --> 02:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
this is just an indication of what we
 
02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
are seeing and how we are
 
02:26:36.469 --> 02:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
um again based on this information how
 
02:26:40.130 --> 02:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
we're planning our our how we see the
 
02:26:43.130 --> 02:26:43.140 align:start position:0%
economy will go based on um interest
 
02:26:43.140 --> 02:26:47.210 align:start position:0%
economy will go based on um interest
rates

02:26:47.210 --> 02:26:47.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:49.070 --> 02:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
so with that in the background I'm going
 
02:26:50.510 --> 02:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
to talk about cash flows and our
 
02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:52.070 align:start position:0%
to talk about cash flows and our
reserves

02:26:52.070 --> 02:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
reserves
 
02:26:54.410 --> 02:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
um so the good news is our cash position
 
02:26:57.530 --> 02:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
and ourselves are very strong
 
02:27:00.170 --> 02:27:00.180 align:start position:0%
um as you all know our cash position
 
02:27:02.210 --> 02:27:02.220 align:start position:0%
changed dramatically over the last two
 
02:27:02.220 --> 02:27:03.010 align:start position:0%
changed dramatically over the last two
years

02:27:03.010 --> 02:27:03.020 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:27:06.490 --> 02:27:06.500 align:start position:0%
between revenue performance and then
 
02:27:08.870 --> 02:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
because of all the stimulus money that
 
02:27:13.450 --> 02:27:13.460 align:start position:0%
we received over the last two years
 
02:27:16.130 --> 02:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
we have a position right now about we
 
02:27:19.429 --> 02:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
went from between 200 and 800 million of
 
02:27:22.610 --> 02:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
daily administration of cash to about
 
02:27:25.370 --> 02:27:25.380 align:start position:0%
2.5 million in fiscal year 22 right now
 
02:27:27.349 --> 02:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
we're about two two bill I keep saying
 
02:27:28.790 --> 02:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
billion mixing the millions of billions
 
02:27:31.670 --> 02:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's about two five two point five
 
02:27:33.889 --> 02:27:33.899 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
 
02:27:37.429 --> 02:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
so at the end of fiscal year 22 all all
 
02:27:39.110 --> 02:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
funds combined we had about three
 
02:27:42.469 --> 02:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in in our banks so
 
02:27:45.469 --> 02:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
during fiscal year 22 we processed um
 
02:27:49.309 --> 02:27:49.319 align:start position:0%
about 9.3 billion in deposits and we
 
02:27:54.050 --> 02:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
dispersed about 8.4 billion in payments
 
02:27:56.630 --> 02:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
and so as all you know we we also have
 
02:27:59.389 --> 02:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
some trust in custodial accounts and
 
02:28:01.910 --> 02:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
that and the Aggregates about 58 million
 
02:28:03.889 --> 02:28:03.899 align:start position:0%
that was the balance at the end of
 
02:28:07.790 --> 02:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:09.889 --> 02:28:09.899 align:start position:0%
excuse us could we ask you a quick
 
02:28:11.809 --> 02:28:11.819 align:start position:0%
question while we're here and then I
 
02:28:14.770 --> 02:28:14.780 align:start position:0%
also need to manage the timeline
 
02:28:17.870 --> 02:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
so we only have about five minutes left
 
02:28:19.610 --> 02:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
because we never put another presenter
 
02:28:21.530 --> 02:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
behind you but of course we welcome you
 
02:28:24.889 --> 02:28:24.899 align:start position:0%
back to Ways and Means very soon to go
 
02:28:27.170 --> 02:28:27.180 align:start position:0%
over this in even more detail but
 
02:28:29.210 --> 02:28:29.220 align:start position:0%
representative Platt has a question yeah
 
02:28:31.490 --> 02:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
is there a typo it says of June 30th
 
02:28:34.130 --> 02:28:34.140 align:start position:0%
2023 cash is three billion dollars how
 
02:28:37.250 --> 02:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
do you know what is June 30th 2023 it's
 
02:28:40.790 --> 02:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:40.800 --> 02:28:44.530 align:start position:0%
 
greatness

02:28:44.530 --> 02:28:44.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:47.330 --> 02:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I I'm not I'm not sure where
 
02:28:53.929 --> 02:28:53.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:56.690 --> 02:28:56.700 align:start position:0%
cash flow and reserves uh the fourth
 
02:28:58.730 --> 02:28:58.740 align:start position:0%
bullet I'm sorry yeah you're right it
 
02:29:01.370 --> 02:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
should be 22.
 
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for not managing my time
 
02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:04.550 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for not managing my time
um

02:29:04.550 --> 02:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
I could um
 
02:29:10.490 --> 02:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
um what I'll do is um just mention
 
02:29:10.500 --> 02:29:12.830 align:start position:0%
um what I'll do is um just mention
um

02:29:12.830 --> 02:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:16.790 --> 02:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
the highlights um this um
 
02:29:18.710 --> 02:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
because of our cash position has been
 
02:29:19.750 --> 02:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
very strong
 
02:29:23.870 --> 02:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
we have we haven't been investing our
 
02:29:23.880 --> 02:29:25.190 align:start position:0%
we have we haven't been investing our
fans

02:29:25.190 --> 02:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
fans
 
02:29:29.690 --> 02:29:29.700 align:start position:0%
um in I guess I moved to um this slide
 
02:29:32.210 --> 02:29:32.220 align:start position:0%
um this is where our cash flows look
 
02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
like right now again we went from lower
 
02:29:37.010 --> 02:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
levels to right now it's about
 
02:29:45.110 --> 02:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:47.330 --> 02:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
I'll stick with the charts this chart is
 
02:29:50.330 --> 02:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
how um we've been um so again since we
 
02:29:52.670 --> 02:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
we our cash position changed
 
02:29:55.790 --> 02:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
dramatically over time we we redefine
 
02:29:58.550 --> 02:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
and we refine our our investment policy
 
02:30:01.010 --> 02:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
and so we are exploring
 
02:30:02.750 --> 02:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
um different Investments now that will
 
02:30:05.030 --> 02:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
allow us to maximize
 
02:30:05.040 --> 02:30:05.950 align:start position:0%
allow us to maximize
um

02:30:05.950 --> 02:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:09.290 --> 02:30:09.300 align:start position:0%
the amount of cash we have in others in
 
02:30:11.690 --> 02:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
in our x what we call access cash not
 
02:30:15.110 --> 02:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
not uh not a reserves so a reserves is
 
02:30:18.349 --> 02:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
what we will call it a rainy day fund so
 
02:30:21.230 --> 02:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
um in terms of what um
 
02:30:23.330 --> 02:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
in terms of the rainy day Farm we have
 
02:30:23.340 --> 02:30:24.190 align:start position:0%
in terms of the rainy day Farm we have
about

02:30:24.190 --> 02:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:30:24.200 --> 02:30:25.990 align:start position:0%
about
159.9

02:30:25.990 --> 02:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
159.9
 
02:30:29.150 --> 02:30:29.160 align:start position:0%
million in our reserves as you all know
 
02:30:31.490 --> 02:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
um that has been that has increased over
 
02:30:34.790 --> 02:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
time and and it is a strong it's a
 
02:30:37.550 --> 02:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
strong is a strong number in even though
 
02:30:40.309 --> 02:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
100 million was taken from
 
02:30:43.130 --> 02:30:43.140 align:start position:0%
um last year we obviously continued to
 
02:30:46.070 --> 02:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
have a strong Reserve uh in our in our
 
02:30:47.690 --> 02:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
in our
 
02:30:47.700 --> 02:30:48.530 align:start position:0%
in our
um

02:30:48.530 --> 02:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:50.750 --> 02:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
for the state so one thing I want to
 
02:30:53.809 --> 02:30:53.819 align:start position:0%
point out as some
 
02:30:53.819 --> 02:30:54.950 align:start position:0%
point out as some
um

02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:57.530 --> 02:30:57.540 align:start position:0%
this this particular slide talks about
 
02:30:59.510 --> 02:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
the the maximum amount that we can hold
 
02:31:01.550 --> 02:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:31:03.710 --> 02:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
um one way to look at that is right now
 
02:31:07.130 --> 02:31:07.140 align:start position:0%
we we hold about 47 of what we are
 
02:31:09.830 --> 02:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
allowed to haul in a rainy day fund
 
02:31:12.889 --> 02:31:12.899 align:start position:0%
um 10 of the total revenue says what we
 
02:31:14.929 --> 02:31:14.939 align:start position:0%
can call for the for the buy animals as
 
02:31:18.469 --> 02:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
much as we can go we go about 47 percent
 
02:31:20.690 --> 02:31:20.700 align:start position:0%
um but again one way to another way to
 
02:31:22.370 --> 02:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
look at that is how you know how much
 
02:31:24.170 --> 02:31:24.180 align:start position:0%
money we have on a researcher fund our
 
02:31:27.050 --> 02:31:27.060 align:start position:0%
reserves and how the state will be able
 
02:31:29.809 --> 02:31:29.819 align:start position:0%
to uh cover expenses if you only had
 
02:31:33.830 --> 02:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
those reserves to to to continue
 
02:31:36.170 --> 02:31:36.180 align:start position:0%
um uh operating so another way to look
 
02:31:38.929 --> 02:31:38.939 align:start position:0%
at that is a number of days that
 
02:31:38.939 --> 02:31:39.650 align:start position:0%
at that is a number of days that
um

02:31:39.650 --> 02:31:39.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:42.770 --> 02:31:42.780 align:start position:0%
we could cover our expenditures with
 
02:31:44.450 --> 02:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
demand that we have in our research so
 
02:31:46.910 --> 02:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
this there's a research study done by
 
02:31:49.190 --> 02:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
few terrible trusts and um they're
 
02:31:52.429 --> 02:31:52.439 align:start position:0%
saying that the median is about 42.5
 
02:31:55.130 --> 02:31:55.140 align:start position:0%
days and we have you know if you want to
 
02:31:57.410 --> 02:31:57.420 align:start position:0%
cover the rain um the general funds we
 
02:31:59.870 --> 02:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
we could cover about 36.
 
02:32:03.770 --> 02:32:03.780 align:start position:0%
um 36.3 days and in order to cover both
 
02:32:06.349 --> 02:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
the general funding expense and and
 
02:32:08.990 --> 02:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
education trust fund expenditures we
 
02:32:10.750 --> 02:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
will cover about
 
02:32:14.330 --> 02:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
21.6 states of expenditure so again it's
 
02:32:16.190 --> 02:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
just a quick another way to look at our
 
02:32:20.450 --> 02:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:20.460 --> 02:32:22.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:32:22.670 --> 02:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:25.130 --> 02:32:25.140 align:start position:0%
again we're investing already they found
 
02:32:27.110 --> 02:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
it in a different way we just developed
 
02:32:29.630 --> 02:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
a an investment policy for this now that
 
02:32:32.450 --> 02:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
we have a lot more funds in there we're
 
02:32:35.389 --> 02:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
trying to take advantage of we're so so
 
02:32:37.190 --> 02:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
we we have a very similar investment
 
02:32:39.830 --> 02:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
policy than we have for operating funds
 
02:32:41.950 --> 02:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
uh which is Preservation of capital
 
02:32:44.990 --> 02:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
liquidity in in we obviously want to
 
02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
maximize the rate of return the
 
02:32:48.230 --> 02:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
difference between the rainy day fund
 
02:32:51.230 --> 02:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
and our operating funds is that um we
 
02:32:53.389 --> 02:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
expect to have the renew the fund amount
 
02:32:56.750 --> 02:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
the reserves longer in there and so the
 
02:32:58.849 --> 02:32:58.859 align:start position:0%
way the average material or security is
 
02:33:01.910 --> 02:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
obviously are longer than one year
 
02:33:04.429 --> 02:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
so so there's a lot to to discuss about
 
02:33:06.230 --> 02:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
interest as you all heard you know the
 
02:33:07.670 --> 02:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
interest rates the good news is that
 
02:33:10.309 --> 02:33:10.319 align:start position:0%
interest rates are are higher and with
 
02:33:12.050 --> 02:33:12.060 align:start position:0%
that amount of cash that we have right
 
02:33:15.050 --> 02:33:15.060 align:start position:0%
now we are earning interest for the
 
02:33:17.090 --> 02:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
first time so we recorded interest in
 
02:33:20.210 --> 02:33:20.220 align:start position:0%
fifth year 22 about only 3 million
 
02:33:20.220 --> 02:33:20.990 align:start position:0%
fifth year 22 about only 3 million
um

02:33:20.990 --> 02:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:23.150 --> 02:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal year today we have recorded about
 
02:33:26.809 --> 02:33:26.819 align:start position:0%
17 million and we expect to at least
 
02:33:28.670 --> 02:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
have double the amount by the end of the
 
02:33:30.770 --> 02:33:30.780 align:start position:0%
fiscal year we still need to refine our
 
02:33:32.510 --> 02:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
estimates but that's what it looks like
 
02:33:35.450 --> 02:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
so obviously um the rest of the other
 
02:33:38.990 --> 02:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
two the biennium uh fiscuer 24 and 25
 
02:33:42.590 --> 02:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
will depend on the average balance and
 
02:33:45.110 --> 02:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
of our cash so uh but again you you've
 
02:33:46.429 --> 02:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
been hearing about the yields how
 
02:33:47.809 --> 02:33:47.819 align:start position:0%
perhaps those yields are going to be
 
02:33:49.849 --> 02:33:49.859 align:start position:0%
over the next two years
 
02:33:52.070 --> 02:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
um so we will have interest income for
 
02:33:57.230 --> 02:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:59.090 --> 02:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
um our debt has been decreasing over
 
02:34:00.889 --> 02:34:00.899 align:start position:0%
time that's that's good news we have our
 
02:34:02.510 --> 02:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
outstanding debt we've been paying that
 
02:34:04.550 --> 02:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
debt um
 
02:34:07.910 --> 02:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
again the train has been uh decline in
 
02:34:11.630 --> 02:34:11.640 align:start position:0%
um the general obligation bonds are
 
02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:12.770 align:start position:0%
um the general obligation bonds are
um

02:34:12.770 --> 02:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:16.250 --> 02:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
again decline in turnpikes doesn't have
 
02:34:18.290 --> 02:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
um they did a refunding this year they
 
02:34:19.969 --> 02:34:19.979 align:start position:0%
haven't had a need to issue more bonds
 
02:34:23.210 --> 02:34:23.220 align:start position:0%
and the other um the Garvey is is
 
02:34:23.220 --> 02:34:24.230 align:start position:0%
and the other um the Garvey is is
another

02:34:24.230 --> 02:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:34:26.150 --> 02:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
um type of bond that we've just been
 
02:34:29.030 --> 02:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
paying uh The Debt Service on that and
 
02:34:31.370 --> 02:34:31.380 align:start position:0%
again it's been declining
 
02:34:34.550 --> 02:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
um we are right now trying to um
 
02:34:37.309 --> 02:34:37.319 align:start position:0%
try to determine how much money we're
 
02:34:39.950 --> 02:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
gonna issue for bonds this year
 
02:34:42.170 --> 02:34:42.180 align:start position:0%
um one key component of that is we
 
02:34:43.910 --> 02:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
typically issue bonds based on Capital
 
02:34:46.429 --> 02:34:46.439 align:start position:0%
expenditures well Capital expenditures
 
02:34:48.770 --> 02:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
have been decline in because of all the
 
02:34:51.170 --> 02:34:51.180 align:start position:0%
delays and projects so perhaps we're
 
02:34:53.510 --> 02:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
going to issue less bonds and we're
 
02:34:56.450 --> 02:34:56.460 align:start position:0%
trying to uh determine uh obviously the
 
02:34:59.210 --> 02:34:59.220 align:start position:0%
amount but over the last two years those
 
02:35:01.190 --> 02:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
Capital expenditures have been again
 
02:35:03.889 --> 02:35:03.899 align:start position:0%
declining because of all the delays and
 
02:35:06.290 --> 02:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
we issue a small amount in 2020 within
 
02:35:10.610 --> 02:35:10.620 align:start position:0%
Nation 21 we should above what is 59
 
02:35:12.950 --> 02:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
million and
 
02:35:16.130 --> 02:35:16.140 align:start position:0%
um in 22 and right now expenditures what
 
02:35:17.570 --> 02:35:17.580 align:start position:0%
we see for a couple of expenditures are
 
02:35:20.389 --> 02:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
very low so we ex if we issue debt this
 
02:35:22.010 --> 02:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
year it's going to be a very small
 
02:35:23.570 --> 02:35:23.580 align:start position:0%
amount but
 
02:35:23.580 --> 02:35:29.510 align:start position:0%
amount but
um

02:35:29.510 --> 02:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:31.670 --> 02:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
and a rating so I just want to jump to
 
02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
the ratings
 
02:35:36.590 --> 02:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
so um the good news we have very strong
 
02:35:40.550 --> 02:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
ratings Square ratings and Moody's and
 
02:35:43.670 --> 02:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
Fitch have affirmed the rate and so we
 
02:35:46.090 --> 02:35:46.100 align:start position:0%
we have a strong rate with with them
 
02:35:51.710 --> 02:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
last year s p Global ratings changed the
 
02:35:54.110 --> 02:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
outlook for the stay from stable to
 
02:35:56.270 --> 02:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
positive and that's because obviously
 
02:35:59.150 --> 02:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
the economy are our financials have been
 
02:36:00.370 --> 02:36:00.380 align:start position:0%
very strong
 
02:36:03.110 --> 02:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
they obviously have been observing the
 
02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:04.130 align:start position:0%
they obviously have been observing the
activity

02:36:04.130 --> 02:36:04.140 align:start position:0%
activity
 
02:36:07.790 --> 02:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh are our revenues of performance
 
02:36:09.710 --> 02:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
um they love the idea that we increase
 
02:36:11.510 --> 02:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
the capacity for the Rainy they find
 
02:36:13.309 --> 02:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
they love the idea that we added more
 
02:36:15.530 --> 02:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
money to the rainy day fund
 
02:36:18.170 --> 02:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
um so their um they outlook for the
 
02:36:20.270 --> 02:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
state changed from stable to positive so
 
02:36:21.770 --> 02:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
that's an indication that perhaps
 
02:36:23.929 --> 02:36:23.939 align:start position:0%
they're considering an upgrade for us so
 
02:36:25.309 --> 02:36:25.319 align:start position:0%
that would be wonderful news but
 
02:36:27.290 --> 02:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
obviously they'll continue to monitor
 
02:36:33.710 --> 02:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:36.170 --> 02:36:36.180 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:36:38.990 --> 02:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
obviously the Rainy the um the raiding
 
02:36:41.270 --> 02:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
agencies are in addition to look at all
 
02:36:43.309 --> 02:36:43.319 align:start position:0%
our and I go back to one slide for a
 
02:36:45.410 --> 02:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
moment in addition to looking at you
 
02:36:47.330 --> 02:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
know the the the the cons they obviously
 
02:36:49.070 --> 02:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
they look our rainy day fund balances
 
02:36:52.309 --> 02:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
and and levels um the you know New
 
02:36:53.389 --> 02:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has always been here to
 
02:36:55.550 --> 02:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
obviously to balance the budget they
 
02:36:58.910 --> 02:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
they they review the levels of Medicaid
 
02:37:01.490 --> 02:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
expenditure how that increases
 
02:37:02.929 --> 02:37:02.939 align:start position:0%
um how that provides
 
02:37:05.690 --> 02:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
um or causes budgetary pressures the
 
02:37:07.670 --> 02:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
levels of funding of the pension and you
 
02:37:09.230 --> 02:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
have liabilities obvious that they are
 
02:37:11.809 --> 02:37:11.819 align:start position:0%
concerned about that
 
02:37:13.490 --> 02:37:13.500 align:start position:0%
um they also like to see
 
02:37:15.110 --> 02:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
um you know our ability to manage our
 
02:37:16.730 --> 02:37:16.740 align:start position:0%
revenues our expenditures and reserves
 
02:37:18.170 --> 02:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
so the flexibility that the state will
 
02:37:20.510 --> 02:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
have but again we've received what we
 
02:37:23.270 --> 02:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
call credit positive and so again that's
 
02:37:25.190 --> 02:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
the reason that we've been have we
 
02:37:27.230 --> 02:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
continue to have an accelerate uh
 
02:37:28.370 --> 02:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
something that they're watching
 
02:37:30.469 --> 02:37:30.479 align:start position:0%
something to watch is obviously their
 
02:37:32.389 --> 02:37:32.399 align:start position:0%
rain ages are watching macroeconomic
 
02:37:32.399 --> 02:37:33.530 align:start position:0%
rain ages are watching macroeconomic
conditions

02:37:33.530 --> 02:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
02:37:34.969 --> 02:37:34.979 align:start position:0%
um how we're going to respond to this
 
02:37:36.530 --> 02:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
lower economy how we're going to respond
 
02:37:38.570 --> 02:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
to this sticky inflation perhaps higher
 
02:37:40.550 --> 02:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
borrowing cost
 
02:37:43.490 --> 02:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
um in you know other factors that they
 
02:37:45.889 --> 02:37:45.899 align:start position:0%
review is how the city of New Hampshire
 
02:37:48.230 --> 02:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
for example is going to manage
 
02:37:50.090 --> 02:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
additional funding that is going to be
 
02:37:52.429 --> 02:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
for infrastructure is is how the state
 
02:37:55.190 --> 02:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
is taking advantage of that additional
 
02:37:56.929 --> 02:37:56.939 align:start position:0%
funding and and how that will benefit
 
02:37:58.670 --> 02:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
our state and how we're going to take
 
02:38:01.070 --> 02:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
advantage of all that how the state
 
02:38:03.170 --> 02:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
manages additional risk you know new
 
02:38:06.230 --> 02:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
threats have a secure risks as I
 
02:38:08.349 --> 02:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned at that last time we met
 
02:38:11.690 --> 02:38:11.700 align:start position:0%
new rests you know cryptocurrency see
 
02:38:13.730 --> 02:38:13.740 align:start position:0%
how we are responding to regulation
 
02:38:16.550 --> 02:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
relative to that and and how we
 
02:38:18.170 --> 02:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
responded to extreme weather you know
 
02:38:20.270 --> 02:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
what are the measures that we provide
 
02:38:23.330 --> 02:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
climate resilience
 
02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
um so so with that I think that ends my
 
02:38:27.290 --> 02:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
presentation I went through very quickly
 
02:38:29.630 --> 02:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
uh but with that um just so I want to
 
02:38:29.640 --> 02:38:30.590 align:start position:0%
uh but with that um just so I want to
mention

02:38:30.590 --> 02:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
mention
 
02:38:32.570 --> 02:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
um s p for example foresee is a
 
02:38:34.910 --> 02:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
recession a shallow recession and they
 
02:38:38.270 --> 02:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
believe in general that Public Finance
 
02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
or states are going to be able to
 
02:38:42.530 --> 02:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
weather that because of the strong
 
02:38:44.690 --> 02:38:44.700 align:start position:0%
strong economy that we've had and the
 
02:38:46.670 --> 02:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
financial conditions that we currently
 
02:38:50.330 --> 02:38:50.340 align:start position:0%
have so yeah that yet to see so I
 
02:38:51.770 --> 02:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
apologize for the time
 
02:38:54.530 --> 02:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
um but but thank you for having me and
 
02:38:55.849 --> 02:38:55.859 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to answer any questions if
 
02:38:57.830 --> 02:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
there's time for that thank you so much
 
02:38:59.690 --> 02:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
are there any very quick questions
 
02:39:01.910 --> 02:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative Army
 
02:39:06.290 --> 02:39:06.300 align:start position:0%
thank you on I know some a number of the
 
02:39:08.030 --> 02:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
things that where we're compared with
 
02:39:09.889 --> 02:39:09.899 align:start position:0%
other states only look at our general
 
02:39:09.899 --> 02:39:11.330 align:start position:0%
other states only look at our general
fund

02:39:11.330 --> 02:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
do the Credit Agencies also look at our
 
02:39:17.330 --> 02:39:17.340 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
02:39:20.450 --> 02:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
and the highway fund
 
02:39:22.969 --> 02:39:22.979 align:start position:0%
to a lesser extent um they do I mean
 
02:39:25.790 --> 02:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
they know that the the the revenue is
 
02:39:28.490 --> 02:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
restricted to the the revenue that is
 
02:39:28.500 --> 02:39:29.330 align:start position:0%
restricted to the the revenue that is
um

02:39:29.330 --> 02:39:29.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:31.250 --> 02:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
or the education trust fund is
 
02:39:33.410 --> 02:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
restrictive for that purpose so what
 
02:39:35.330 --> 02:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
they really review is are you know
 
02:39:38.330 --> 02:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
flexible on restricted revenue and and
 
02:39:40.969 --> 02:39:40.979 align:start position:0%
so how that increases and because
 
02:39:42.530 --> 02:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
obviously that provides greater
 
02:39:45.410 --> 02:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
flexibility for the state for again all
 
02:39:47.450 --> 02:39:47.460 align:start position:0%
of those pieces that could create
 
02:39:49.790 --> 02:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
budgetary pressures they are constantly
 
02:39:51.410 --> 02:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
worried about well how the states
 
02:39:54.849 --> 02:39:54.859 align:start position:0%
responding to those changes emergencies
 
02:39:58.730 --> 02:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
new programs you know you create you
 
02:40:02.090 --> 02:40:02.100 align:start position:0%
generate enough Revenue to to to pay for
 
02:40:03.770 --> 02:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
those new programs and new initiatives
 
02:40:06.830 --> 02:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
and things like that so could I just I
 
02:40:09.650 --> 02:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
didn't quite understand so the education
 
02:40:12.710 --> 02:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
trust fund even though we can take money
 
02:40:15.830 --> 02:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
out of it and put money into it uh from
 
02:40:18.590 --> 02:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
the general fund is not considered while
 
02:40:20.750 --> 02:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
they're looking at this they do look at
 
02:40:22.370 --> 02:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
it as just it's just considered
 
02:40:24.770 --> 02:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
restricted and so again they pay more
 
02:40:26.570 --> 02:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
attention to the unrestrictive portion
 
02:40:29.889 --> 02:40:29.899 align:start position:0%
uh what is called the net
 
02:40:33.230 --> 02:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
again this they look at the ability for
 
02:40:36.349 --> 02:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
issuers of bonds to be able to pay debt
 
02:40:39.290 --> 02:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
service you know this is this is a
 
02:40:39.300 --> 02:40:40.190 align:start position:0%
service you know this is this is a
credit

02:40:40.190 --> 02:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
credit
 
02:40:43.429 --> 02:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
um credit rating that is presented to
 
02:40:45.770 --> 02:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
investors so our ability to generate
 
02:40:47.990 --> 02:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue so our ability to pay our net
 
02:40:50.389 --> 02:40:50.399 align:start position:0%
tax supported debt those are the things
 
02:40:52.550 --> 02:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
that they pay close attention to thank
 
02:40:54.950 --> 02:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
you very much Senator link that wasn't a
 
02:40:56.510 --> 02:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
question just a comment to some of the
 
02:40:58.550 --> 02:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
members so one of the things she talked
 
02:41:00.110 --> 02:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
the treasure talked about was 100
 
02:41:01.610 --> 02:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
million withdrawal from the rainy day
 
02:41:02.750 --> 02:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
fund while at the same time we're
 
02:41:04.190 --> 02:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
talking about how great the revenue is
 
02:41:05.750 --> 02:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
doing and we're making all kinds of
 
02:41:07.610 --> 02:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
money across all of our tax revenues and
 
02:41:08.809 --> 02:41:08.819 align:start position:0%
I just want to remind especially the
 
02:41:10.969 --> 02:41:10.979 align:start position:0%
freshmen that 100 million dollars was
 
02:41:13.190 --> 02:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
the sununu center it was an offset to
 
02:41:15.590 --> 02:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
put aside for the lawsuit against the
 
02:41:18.410 --> 02:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
new news center and all those cases and
 
02:41:20.270 --> 02:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
so we withdrew from the rainy day fund
 
02:41:22.070 --> 02:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
100 million dollars instead of the side
 
02:41:24.889 --> 02:41:24.899 align:start position:0%
to deal with any of those lawsuits so
 
02:41:26.450 --> 02:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
just you didn't think we took money out
 
02:41:28.550 --> 02:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
because it was raining it was just a
 
02:41:29.990 --> 02:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
potential rainstorm that was coming and
 
02:41:31.730 --> 02:41:31.740 align:start position:0%
we set it aside and plan for it just
 
02:41:33.530 --> 02:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
just quickly to add to that I mean to
 
02:41:34.969 --> 02:41:34.979 align:start position:0%
take the time but
 
02:41:36.830 --> 02:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
um that is something I had to have a
 
02:41:38.450 --> 02:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
conversation with a rating agencies and
 
02:41:41.510 --> 02:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
they I did explain to them it was it was
 
02:41:43.250 --> 02:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
it was a rainy day
 
02:41:45.170 --> 02:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
um but obviously the question that came
 
02:41:48.170 --> 02:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
back um to to me to us to all of us is
 
02:41:50.210 --> 02:41:50.220 align:start position:0%
what does it say what are they say what
 
02:41:51.830 --> 02:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
are the plans to replenish that amount
 
02:41:53.570 --> 02:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
if there's a plan to replenish obviously
 
02:41:54.830 --> 02:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
they're interested in increasing our
 
02:41:57.410 --> 02:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
reserves because it's a way for them to
 
02:41:59.809 --> 02:41:59.819 align:start position:0%
to see how New Hampshire is going to
 
02:42:02.389 --> 02:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
respond to a potential recession so the
 
02:42:03.950 --> 02:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
more money we have on our reserves and
 
02:42:06.010 --> 02:42:06.020 align:start position:0%
our cash position
 
02:42:08.809 --> 02:42:08.819 align:start position:0%
the better prepared we're going to be to
 
02:42:11.870 --> 02:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
face or mitigate a recession
 
02:42:13.610 --> 02:42:13.620 align:start position:0%
we will be more competitive and
 
02:42:15.170 --> 02:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
attractive than the neighboring states
 
02:42:16.429 --> 02:42:16.439 align:start position:0%
because that's how we're going to do it
 
02:42:18.110 --> 02:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:42:35.110 --> 02:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:37.910 --> 02:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
speaking of being better economically
 
02:42:39.950 --> 02:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
than our neighboring states we have to
 
02:42:42.170 --> 02:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
recognize I hope he's here commissioner
 
02:42:45.710 --> 02:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:48.170 --> 02:42:48.180 align:start position:0%

02:44:33.530 --> 02:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
explains maybe some of our flashy slides
 
02:44:35.929 --> 02:44:35.939 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of creative materials to
 
02:44:38.510 --> 02:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
use for those sorts of things but we do
 
02:44:41.150 --> 02:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
all the states marketing around tourism
 
02:44:42.889 --> 02:44:42.899 align:start position:0%
hospitality and I'll talk a little bit
 
02:44:44.750 --> 02:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
more about that but we also have the
 
02:44:46.429 --> 02:44:46.439 align:start position:0%
division of Economic Development and
 
02:44:48.469 --> 02:44:48.479 align:start position:0%
this is a larger organization within the
 
02:44:50.450 --> 02:44:50.460 align:start position:0%
department that is focused heavily on
 
02:44:52.309 --> 02:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
business retention business recruitment
 
02:44:54.050 --> 02:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
we handle the international relations
 
02:44:57.230 --> 02:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
for the state we have our office of
 
02:44:59.270 --> 02:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
Workforce opportunity which works on the
 
02:45:01.910 --> 02:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
workforce develop development end of
 
02:45:04.550 --> 02:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
things and uh and a few other entities
 
02:45:07.929 --> 02:45:07.939 align:start position:0%
within Bea that all together have been
 
02:45:13.070 --> 02:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
our own entity since 2017. so a lot of
 
02:45:14.090 --> 02:45:14.100 align:start position:0%
these functions were handled
 
02:45:16.250 --> 02:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
individually at the former Department of
 
02:45:18.230 --> 02:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
Revenue and economic or not Revenue
 
02:45:19.670 --> 02:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
Department of resource and economic
 
02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:20.630 align:start position:0%
Department of resource and economic
development

02:45:20.630 --> 02:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
development
 
02:45:24.070 --> 02:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
formerly known as dread we've been in in
 
02:45:29.030 --> 02:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:31.790 --> 02:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
so I would say just just kind of
 
02:45:33.830 --> 02:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
headline here the top two challenges
 
02:45:35.210 --> 02:45:35.220 align:start position:0%
that we're facing from a policy
 
02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
standpoint and from an economic
 
02:45:39.530 --> 02:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
standpoint in the state remain Workforce
 
02:45:42.530 --> 02:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
and uh and housing so those are two
 
02:45:43.849 --> 02:45:43.859 align:start position:0%
areas that I'm going to focus a little
 
02:45:46.429 --> 02:45:46.439 align:start position:0%
bit on today and then again you'll be
 
02:45:48.170 --> 02:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
able to hear some more about the
 
02:45:49.849 --> 02:45:49.859 align:start position:0%
different components of that and how
 
02:45:53.570 --> 02:45:53.580 align:start position:0%
they all go together uh after lunch
 
02:45:56.030 --> 02:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
so this very basic slide of the
 
02:45:57.950 --> 02:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate I put this here really
 
02:45:59.809 --> 02:45:59.819 align:start position:0%
because it's a good measure there's
 
02:46:03.230 --> 02:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
obviously a lot more to analyzing uh the
 
02:46:05.870 --> 02:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
health of the economy but this one I
 
02:46:07.849 --> 02:46:07.859 align:start position:0%
think really sort of demonstrates for us
 
02:46:10.550 --> 02:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
at least on a standard that we see
 
02:46:12.349 --> 02:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
across a multitude of different states
 
02:46:13.849 --> 02:46:13.859 align:start position:0%
and across the United States that New
 
02:46:15.650 --> 02:46:15.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire remains highly competitive
 
02:46:17.630 --> 02:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
from a from a from a standpoint of
 
02:46:19.730 --> 02:46:19.740 align:start position:0%
available Workforce and when we work
 
02:46:21.349 --> 02:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
with companies and we work with
 
02:46:23.330 --> 02:46:23.340 align:start position:0%
companies that are either looking to
 
02:46:26.330 --> 02:46:26.340 align:start position:0%
expand here or looking to move here this
 
02:46:28.610 --> 02:46:28.620 align:start position:0%
is the first question we get what about
 
02:46:31.370 --> 02:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
the workforce and how are we going to be
 
02:46:34.490 --> 02:46:34.500 align:start position:0%
able to access a Workforce for the work
 
02:46:37.309 --> 02:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
that we're doing and that is something
 
02:46:40.130 --> 02:46:40.140 align:start position:0%
that we obviously work very closely with
 
02:46:41.809 --> 02:46:41.819 align:start position:0%
partners of the University system and
 
02:46:43.309 --> 02:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
Community College system and with New
 
02:46:44.809 --> 02:46:44.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employment services and others
 
02:46:46.910 --> 02:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
sort of make those components go
 
02:46:48.469 --> 02:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
together for the employers that we're
 
02:46:51.110 --> 02:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:51.120 --> 02:46:52.010 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:46:52.010 --> 02:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:46:53.870 --> 02:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
the other as I mentioned and something
 
02:46:55.490 --> 02:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
that I'll I'll talk a little bit more in
 
02:46:59.330 --> 02:46:59.340 align:start position:0%
detail about uh in a minute or two is is
 
02:47:01.490 --> 02:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
the housing situation this is a map that
 
02:47:03.950 --> 02:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
shows uh from New Hampshire Housing
 
02:47:05.650 --> 02:47:05.660 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority
 
02:47:09.530 --> 02:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
where things stand as far as rental
 
02:47:11.630 --> 02:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
metrics in the state and you know we're
 
02:47:15.349 --> 02:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
at a 1500 per month median gross rent we
 
02:47:18.230 --> 02:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
have a 0.3 and in some cases even lower
 
02:47:21.530 --> 02:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
than that vacancy rate for uh housing
 
02:47:26.110 --> 02:47:26.120 align:start position:0%
units across the state this is remains
 
02:47:28.429 --> 02:47:28.439 align:start position:0%
our number one challenge in my view
 
02:47:31.130 --> 02:47:31.140 align:start position:0%
because when we start talking about what
 
02:47:34.610 --> 02:47:34.620 align:start position:0%
are the issues around Workforce we have
 
02:47:36.950 --> 02:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
jobs we have people that fill those jobs
 
02:47:38.870 --> 02:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
in a lot of places we have access to
 
02:47:41.150 --> 02:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
people who want to live here and take
 
02:47:43.490 --> 02:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
advantage of these jobs we see data that
 
02:47:46.370 --> 02:47:46.380 align:start position:0%
supports all of that and it is uh the on
 
02:47:48.530 --> 02:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
the ground sort of experience of our
 
02:47:50.990 --> 02:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
staff that we are seeing that if we
 
02:47:53.210 --> 02:47:53.220 align:start position:0%
don't have places for people to live and
 
02:47:56.150 --> 02:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
we don't have adequate sort of steps of
 
02:47:57.950 --> 02:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
people or places for people to live so
 
02:47:59.929 --> 02:47:59.939 align:start position:0%
in other words come in looking for an
 
02:48:02.090 --> 02:48:02.100 align:start position:0%
efficiency apartment maybe move to a two
 
02:48:03.530 --> 02:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
bedroom three bedroom and then buy a
 
02:48:06.770 --> 02:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
house all of those markets uh are seeing
 
02:48:08.750 --> 02:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
a real Challenge and they continue to
 
02:48:11.630 --> 02:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
see that challenge nothing new we've
 
02:48:13.490 --> 02:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
been facing this for some time but it is
 
02:48:15.110 --> 02:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
definitely accelerated and it's a lot
 
02:48:17.450 --> 02:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
more obvious in the environment that
 
02:48:19.190 --> 02:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
we're in right now and I would also
 
02:48:20.630 --> 02:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
point out of course that we are not the
 
02:48:23.270 --> 02:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
only state facing this challenge but
 
02:48:25.010 --> 02:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
when people say that to me I say well
 
02:48:26.570 --> 02:48:26.580 align:start position:0%
then that means that we need to solve it
 
02:48:28.969 --> 02:48:28.979 align:start position:0%
faster than anyone else
 
02:48:30.650 --> 02:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
um and I'll talk some more about those
 
02:48:34.910 --> 02:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:35.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:48:35.750 --> 02:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:38.870 --> 02:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
tourism another major function of our
 
02:48:38.880 --> 02:48:39.770 align:start position:0%
tourism another major function of our
department

02:48:39.770 --> 02:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:48:42.530 --> 02:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
we have been since we were established
 
02:48:47.270 --> 02:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
back in 2017 really working to integrate
 
02:48:49.370 --> 02:48:49.380 align:start position:0%
the messaging that we do for tourism
 
02:48:52.250 --> 02:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
with the work that we do to attract
 
02:48:54.410 --> 02:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
Workforce and attract businesses to New
 
02:48:56.630 --> 02:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a lot of the quality of life
 
02:48:58.910 --> 02:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
components that we all know and love
 
02:49:01.130 --> 02:49:01.140 align:start position:0%
here are things that are very appealing
 
02:49:04.010 --> 02:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
to all of those audiences and in fact in
 
02:49:05.870 --> 02:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of the research that we do we it
 
02:49:08.950 --> 02:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
does we do see a very common
 
02:49:13.190 --> 02:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
representation of having access to the
 
02:49:14.650 --> 02:49:14.660 align:start position:0%
quality of life and the outdoor
 
02:49:17.389 --> 02:49:17.399 align:start position:0%
activities as being a major driver for
 
02:49:19.309 --> 02:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
people who either want to visit here for
 
02:49:21.590 --> 02:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
a weekend or people who want to move
 
02:49:23.750 --> 02:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
here or start a business here or move
 
02:49:27.469 --> 02:49:27.479 align:start position:0%
their business here it is a common uh
 
02:49:30.110 --> 02:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
strategy that we have really tried to
 
02:49:32.510 --> 02:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
accelerate over the last few years and I
 
02:49:34.990 --> 02:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
think to some success we do see
 
02:49:37.610 --> 02:49:37.620 align:start position:0%
increases in numbers of people that have
 
02:49:40.010 --> 02:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
come to the state that are look looking
 
02:49:42.590 --> 02:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
to come to the state we can demonstrate
 
02:49:45.290 --> 02:49:45.300 align:start position:0%
that in net migration numbers that over
 
02:49:47.630 --> 02:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
the last five years have seen increases
 
02:49:48.889 --> 02:49:48.899 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire particularly in
 
02:49:51.770 --> 02:49:51.780 align:start position:0%
younger demographics Mr Johnson will
 
02:49:52.910 --> 02:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
probably be able to speak to you a
 
02:49:54.230 --> 02:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
little bit about that a little later
 
02:49:54.240 --> 02:49:55.630 align:start position:0%
little bit about that a little later
today

02:49:55.630 --> 02:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:49:59.809 --> 02:49:59.819 align:start position:0%
but we do really work hard to make those
 
02:50:01.790 --> 02:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
pieces all flow together while also
 
02:50:04.190 --> 02:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
supporting our very important tourism
 
02:50:07.250 --> 02:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
industry uh the other only other point I
 
02:50:09.710 --> 02:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
would make on this slide is we do
 
02:50:11.630 --> 02:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
calculate the return on investment that
 
02:50:14.389 --> 02:50:14.399 align:start position:0%
we make with the marketing funds that we
 
02:50:17.030 --> 02:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
do receive from the legislature we are
 
02:50:18.889 --> 02:50:18.899 align:start position:0%
currently somewhere between 14 and 15
 
02:50:22.969 --> 02:50:22.979 align:start position:0%
dollars returned to the state in terms
 
02:50:25.429 --> 02:50:25.439 align:start position:0%
of meals and rentals revenue for every
 
02:50:27.830 --> 02:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
dollar that we spend in our marketing
 
02:50:27.840 --> 02:50:29.750 align:start position:0%
dollar that we spend in our marketing
budgets

02:50:29.750 --> 02:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
budgets
 
02:50:31.429 --> 02:50:31.439 align:start position:0%
um well you know I said the last thing
 
02:50:34.130 --> 02:50:34.140 align:start position:0%
second last thing on this really is also
 
02:50:37.130 --> 02:50:37.140 align:start position:0%
that uh we have been using this strategy
 
02:50:39.530 --> 02:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
for many years and in fact you could go
 
02:50:42.050 --> 02:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
back uh many years in New Hampshire's
 
02:50:44.929 --> 02:50:44.939 align:start position:0%
history and see that using tourism and
 
02:50:47.929 --> 02:50:47.939 align:start position:0%
using the outdoor activities as a
 
02:50:50.450 --> 02:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
marketing strategy not just for uh
 
02:50:52.730 --> 02:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
tourism but also for the wider aspects
 
02:50:55.130 --> 02:50:55.140 align:start position:0%
of our economy is nothing terribly new
 
02:50:58.490 --> 02:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
but I would say that we are seeing a a
 
02:51:01.550 --> 02:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
much larger audience that is receptive
 
02:51:04.190 --> 02:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
to this message after the experience of
 
02:51:07.370 --> 02:51:07.380 align:start position:0%
covet we have a lot of individuals and
 
02:51:08.990 --> 02:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
families that are in urban areas
 
02:51:11.090 --> 02:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
particularly in the Northeast that are
 
02:51:13.910 --> 02:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
seeing the value of quality of life and
 
02:51:16.429 --> 02:51:16.439 align:start position:0%
they are looking at New Hampshire as an
 
02:51:18.830 --> 02:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity for them and of course this
 
02:51:20.630 --> 02:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
ties back to the issues that we spoke
 
02:51:24.050 --> 02:51:24.060 align:start position:0%
about earlier but that continues to be
 
02:51:26.330 --> 02:51:26.340 align:start position:0%
something that we can demonstrate that
 
02:51:29.090 --> 02:51:29.100 align:start position:0%
we're seeing progress
 
02:51:31.730 --> 02:51:31.740 align:start position:0%
uh another very simple just sort of
 
02:51:34.610 --> 02:51:34.620 align:start position:0%
overview of the change in visitation
 
02:51:38.030 --> 02:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
versus 2021 and spend rates you see fall
 
02:51:40.610 --> 02:51:40.620 align:start position:0%
really continues to be a very uh a very
 
02:51:42.830 --> 02:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh important season for the State of New
 
02:51:42.840 --> 02:51:44.090 align:start position:0%
uh important season for the State of New
Hampshire

02:51:44.090 --> 02:51:44.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:51:46.969 --> 02:51:46.979 align:start position:0%
um we see this in both Drive markets but
 
02:51:49.610 --> 02:51:49.620 align:start position:0%
also in in international and long-haul
 
02:51:51.950 --> 02:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
markets from areas like Texas and
 
02:51:55.010 --> 02:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
Florida people come for a short a very
 
02:51:58.849 --> 02:51:58.859 align:start position:0%
focused period of time uh winter is a
 
02:52:03.070 --> 02:52:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:06.769 --> 02:52:06.779 align:start position:0%
industry as we're experiencing this year
 
02:52:08.389 --> 02:52:08.399 align:start position:0%
and then the spring and summer numbers
 
02:52:09.830 --> 02:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
the summer numbers are a little lower
 
02:52:12.110 --> 02:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
this year that's not that unusual we see
 
02:52:14.389 --> 02:52:14.399 align:start position:0%
a very consistent number in our in our
 
02:52:17.090 --> 02:52:17.100 align:start position:0%
in our summer numbers and we had a huge
 
02:52:22.190 --> 02:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
bump in 20 in 2020 and 2021 which is uh
 
02:52:24.110 --> 02:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
reflected that uh here in this number
 
02:52:26.570 --> 02:52:26.580 align:start position:0%
the 2022 we saw those numbers starting
 
02:52:28.309 --> 02:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
to return a little bit more towards a
 
02:52:31.910 --> 02:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
normal visitation statistic
 
02:52:35.030 --> 02:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
and this I put here just for uh this was
 
02:52:37.969 --> 02:52:37.979 align:start position:0%
our projection that we've made for uh
 
02:52:40.309 --> 02:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
this current season that we're in uh of
 
02:52:42.490 --> 02:52:42.500 align:start position:0%
course we had this projection was done
 
02:52:44.870 --> 02:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
with some variables related to weather
 
02:52:48.290 --> 02:52:48.300 align:start position:0%
but uh the the lack of snow particularly
 
02:52:51.230 --> 02:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
in the extreme North country has has
 
02:52:53.510 --> 02:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
been a challenge thus far this year uh
 
02:52:55.250 --> 02:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
the snowmobiling industry in particular
 
02:52:59.150 --> 02:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
not seeing a lot of product to be able
 
02:53:02.210 --> 02:53:02.220 align:start position:0%
to ride on although I would say for
 
02:53:04.730 --> 02:53:04.740 align:start position:0%
anyone who's watching the skiers are
 
02:53:06.469 --> 02:53:06.479 align:start position:0%
doing fine they are able to make a lot
 
02:53:09.110 --> 02:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
of snow and it's very worth coming to
 
02:53:10.610 --> 02:53:10.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for the long weekend and
 
02:53:13.790 --> 02:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
maybe getting in some skiing
 
02:53:19.730 --> 02:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:22.910 --> 02:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to uh quickly run through an
 
02:53:24.469 --> 02:53:24.479 align:start position:0%
overview here this is something that I'm
 
02:53:25.849 --> 02:53:25.859 align:start position:0%
happy you know and some of you have seen
 
02:53:27.230 --> 02:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
me talk about this before and it's
 
02:53:28.490 --> 02:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
something we'll continue to talk about
 
02:53:30.769 --> 02:53:30.779 align:start position:0%
as we go through the session but our
 
02:53:32.570 --> 02:53:32.580 align:start position:0%
economic recovery and expansion strategy
 
02:53:34.130 --> 02:53:34.140 align:start position:0%
this was something that we put together
 
02:53:37.490 --> 02:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
late 2020 early 21 we're still operating
 
02:53:41.210 --> 02:53:41.220 align:start position:0%
from this it's designed obviously in in
 
02:53:44.450 --> 02:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
in in light of the pandemic to be a
 
02:53:46.490 --> 02:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
strategy that recognizes that the world
 
02:53:47.929 --> 02:53:47.939 align:start position:0%
of Economic Development and Community
 
02:53:50.030 --> 02:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
Development feels very different than it
 
02:53:52.910 --> 02:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
did uh in 2019 and so we've been trying
 
02:53:54.670 --> 02:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
really hard to stay ahead of the curve
 
02:53:57.230 --> 02:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
using components of this strategy to
 
02:53:59.690 --> 02:53:59.700 align:start position:0%
make investments in design programs that
 
02:54:00.950 --> 02:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
give New Hampshire that competitive
 
02:54:02.330 --> 02:54:02.340 align:start position:0%
advantage over the states that we
 
02:54:05.450 --> 02:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
compete with for economic investment
 
02:54:07.790 --> 02:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
five major goals this is very high level
 
02:54:10.510 --> 02:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
this is all on our website
 
02:54:13.190 --> 02:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
and something that has a lot of backup
 
02:54:14.690 --> 02:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
material in it if you're interested in
 
02:54:17.389 --> 02:54:17.399 align:start position:0%
looking at that some of these are pretty
 
02:54:19.070 --> 02:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
obvious and I've talked about almost all
 
02:54:21.410 --> 02:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
of these here recruiting and retaining
 
02:54:23.510 --> 02:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
amount the workforce the connection of
 
02:54:25.730 --> 02:54:25.740 align:start position:0%
Tourism the recruitment uh building
 
02:54:27.469 --> 02:54:27.479 align:start position:0%
resiliency in our high growth sectors
 
02:54:30.410 --> 02:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
high growth right now sectors are there
 
02:54:33.790 --> 02:54:33.800 align:start position:0%
are several but life science Health Care
 
02:54:36.769 --> 02:54:36.779 align:start position:0%
manufacturing tourism continues to be in
 
02:54:40.130 --> 02:54:40.140 align:start position:0%
that space Advanced manufacturing and so
 
02:54:42.590 --> 02:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
on those are areas that we continue to
 
02:54:46.190 --> 02:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
see growth but also potential for
 
02:54:48.710 --> 02:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
additional investment which those two
 
02:54:51.469 --> 02:54:51.479 align:start position:0%
together it really kind of forms what
 
02:54:54.130 --> 02:54:54.140 align:start position:0%
we're most interested in working and and
 
02:54:56.630 --> 02:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
focusing on I should say
 
02:54:58.550 --> 02:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh entrepreneurship and then the
 
02:55:00.170 --> 02:55:00.180 align:start position:0%
infrastructure piece I would also point
 
02:55:02.870 --> 02:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
out here uh that isn't just roads and
 
02:55:05.389 --> 02:55:05.399 align:start position:0%
bridges that's things like Broadband uh
 
02:55:08.090 --> 02:55:08.100 align:start position:0%
and the ability to have a state that has
 
02:55:10.610 --> 02:55:10.620 align:start position:0%
access to high-speed internet in the
 
02:55:13.250 --> 02:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
21st century uh now that we're what 20
 
02:55:16.429 --> 02:55:16.439 align:start position:0%
through it uh it remains a really
 
02:55:18.230 --> 02:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
critical component to the overall
 
02:55:20.809 --> 02:55:20.819 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention strategies uh
 
02:55:22.370 --> 02:55:22.380 align:start position:0%
as anyone will tell you we're working on
 
02:55:24.530 --> 02:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
people working remotely people being
 
02:55:26.929 --> 02:55:26.939 align:start position:0%
able to live in a small town and work
 
02:55:29.570 --> 02:55:29.580 align:start position:0%
for a firm that might not have a huge
 
02:55:30.769 --> 02:55:30.779 align:start position:0%
presence in New Hampshire but they're
 
02:55:33.230 --> 02:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
getting paid uh by that firm and they're
 
02:55:34.929 --> 02:55:34.939 align:start position:0%
spending that money in a local community
 
02:55:37.730 --> 02:55:37.740 align:start position:0%
these are all things that aren't
 
02:55:39.469 --> 02:55:39.479 align:start position:0%
necessary and are part of what I was
 
02:55:41.170 --> 02:55:41.180 align:start position:0%
saying earlier about that
 
02:55:43.849 --> 02:55:43.859 align:start position:0%
what looks different about economic and
 
02:55:45.110 --> 02:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
Community Development in New Hampshire
 
02:55:47.269 --> 02:55:47.279 align:start position:0%
after the pandemic that certainly is one
 
02:55:49.490 --> 02:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
of them when we start to take those
 
02:55:52.490 --> 02:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
things uh those five key areas and we
 
02:55:54.170 --> 02:55:54.180 align:start position:0%
break them down into the functions that
 
02:55:55.849 --> 02:55:55.859 align:start position:0%
the department really sort of works with
 
02:55:58.849 --> 02:55:58.859 align:start position:0%
our collaborative Partners to uh to to
 
02:56:01.910 --> 02:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
advance those initiatives these are the
 
02:56:05.269 --> 02:56:05.279 align:start position:0%
eight areas that again guide uh where we
 
02:56:07.130 --> 02:56:07.140 align:start position:0%
go with those sort of things and I I
 
02:56:08.690 --> 02:56:08.700 align:start position:0%
know we're short on time so I'm not
 
02:56:10.969 --> 02:56:10.979 align:start position:0%
going to go through all of these uh
 
02:56:13.730 --> 02:56:13.740 align:start position:0%
independently uh again I've spoken to
 
02:56:16.670 --> 02:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
most of these and there are areas where
 
02:56:20.210 --> 02:56:20.220 align:start position:0%
we must have relationships and
 
02:56:21.950 --> 02:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
collaborations both with our fellow
 
02:56:24.050 --> 02:56:24.060 align:start position:0%
state agencies but with local and
 
02:56:26.929 --> 02:56:26.939 align:start position:0%
Regional officials municipalities and
 
02:56:28.190 --> 02:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
with other economic development
 
02:56:31.130 --> 02:56:31.140 align:start position:0%
organizations around the state and one
 
02:56:32.690 --> 02:56:32.700 align:start position:0%
of the ways that we do that which is
 
02:56:34.790 --> 02:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
part of this economic strategy or what
 
02:56:36.590 --> 02:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
we call collaborative Economic
 
02:56:38.929 --> 02:56:38.939 align:start position:0%
Development regions we have four of
 
02:56:41.090 --> 02:56:41.100 align:start position:0%
these across the state we've developed
 
02:56:43.490 --> 02:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
these over the last couple of years they
 
02:56:45.710 --> 02:56:45.720 align:start position:0%
are forums for all of those partners
 
02:56:47.990 --> 02:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
that I just mentioned to take part in
 
02:56:51.349 --> 02:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
contribute and help us regionalize a lot
 
02:56:55.010 --> 02:56:55.020 align:start position:0%
of those five high-level strategies that
 
02:56:58.010 --> 02:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
we mentioned earlier and put actionable
 
02:57:01.190 --> 02:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
strategies into place this has been a
 
02:57:03.550 --> 02:57:03.560 align:start position:0%
huge benefit to us to be able to
 
02:57:06.889 --> 02:57:06.899 align:start position:0%
effectively leverage the uh the ability
 
02:57:10.190 --> 02:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
for the state to give support to this
 
02:57:12.410 --> 02:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
type of activity to take some common
 
02:57:14.990 --> 02:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
strategies and say we feel free strongly
 
02:57:16.910 --> 02:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
that we need to go through that door not
 
02:57:19.010 --> 02:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
that door for right now but um we get on
 
02:57:20.510 --> 02:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
the other side that door things might
 
02:57:22.250 --> 02:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
look different in the North country than
 
02:57:24.230 --> 02:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
they do on the Seacoast so we want to be
 
02:57:25.849 --> 02:57:25.859 align:start position:0%
able to regionalize some of the activity
 
02:57:26.950 --> 02:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
that we do
 
02:57:29.929 --> 02:57:29.939 align:start position:0%
and give those strategies a flavor that
 
02:57:31.550 --> 02:57:31.560 align:start position:0%
actually has an applicability and a
 
02:57:35.090 --> 02:57:35.100 align:start position:0%
value to employers and organizations in
 
02:57:37.130 --> 02:57:37.140 align:start position:0%
that region so the Cedars are a big
 
02:57:39.710 --> 02:57:39.720 align:start position:0%
function of that this slide gives a
 
02:57:41.450 --> 02:57:41.460 align:start position:0%
little more detail I guess in terms of
 
02:57:44.050 --> 02:57:44.060 align:start position:0%
what we actually do with them
 
02:57:47.330 --> 02:57:47.340 align:start position:0%
they have received some resources from
 
02:57:49.130 --> 02:57:49.140 align:start position:0%
us to be able to to advance some
 
02:57:52.010 --> 02:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
specific initiatives in their areas and
 
02:57:53.870 --> 02:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
this has been I can't emphasize this
 
02:57:55.730 --> 02:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
enough because one of the things that
 
02:57:57.349 --> 02:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
was missing from New Hampshire for many
 
02:57:58.969 --> 02:57:58.979 align:start position:0%
years was what I referred as the
 
02:58:00.830 --> 02:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
economic development infrastructure for
 
02:58:02.870 --> 02:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
the state the systems that are in place
 
02:58:05.269 --> 02:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
to be able to advance common initiatives
 
02:58:08.389 --> 02:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
and strategies that make sense that the
 
02:58:10.490 --> 02:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
state is seeing a value based in data
 
02:58:12.769 --> 02:58:12.779 align:start position:0%
based in not somebody just sort of
 
02:58:14.030 --> 02:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
picking something and throwing a dart
 
02:58:16.309 --> 02:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
against the wall but these are high
 
02:58:18.830 --> 02:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
value targets high value strategies and
 
02:58:21.349 --> 02:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
then to have the support of
 
02:58:23.150 --> 02:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
organizations like Regional development
 
02:58:25.610 --> 02:58:25.620 align:start position:0%
corporations or planning commissions or
 
02:58:27.650 --> 02:58:27.660 align:start position:0%
local municipalities that have Economic
 
02:58:30.050 --> 02:58:30.060 align:start position:0%
Development offices getting in Chambers
 
02:58:32.150 --> 02:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
of Commerce getting these organizations
 
02:58:34.910 --> 02:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
to all sort of see a common vision and
 
02:58:36.650 --> 02:58:36.660 align:start position:0%
be able to look towards ways to make
 
02:58:39.410 --> 02:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
those things happen in their own way has
 
02:58:41.450 --> 02:58:41.460 align:start position:0%
been a big success and I think it will
 
02:58:43.969 --> 02:58:43.979 align:start position:0%
continue to be particularly if we end up
 
02:58:48.290 --> 02:58:48.300 align:start position:0%
moving in a downtrend in our economy
 
02:58:51.110 --> 02:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh I was obviously going to mention uh
 
02:58:53.510 --> 02:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
the program that we uh started earlier
 
02:58:56.389 --> 02:58:56.399 align:start position:0%
about mid-year last year the invest NH
 
02:58:59.510 --> 02:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
housing program uh this is something uh
 
02:59:01.130 --> 02:59:01.140 align:start position:0%
where we have already started to deploy
 
02:59:02.750 --> 02:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
60 million dollars under the capital
 
02:59:05.870 --> 02:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
Grant component of this program uh this
 
02:59:07.790 --> 02:59:07.800 align:start position:0%
is a pretty exciting opportunity to
 
02:59:10.190 --> 02:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
advance a number of different projects
 
02:59:12.410 --> 02:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
30 in fact separate projects around the
 
02:59:15.349 --> 02:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
state that are going to result in 900
 
02:59:18.349 --> 02:59:18.359 align:start position:0%
new affordable units uh in New Hampshire
 
02:59:21.950 --> 02:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
these are rental units new build across
 
02:59:24.110 --> 02:59:24.120 align:start position:0%
the state not just in any one area but
 
02:59:25.969 --> 02:59:25.979 align:start position:0%
we've gotten them geographically diverse
 
02:59:28.849 --> 02:59:28.859 align:start position:0%
and then with the uh with that Capital
 
02:59:30.830 --> 02:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
grant program are a number of programs
 
02:59:32.929 --> 02:59:32.939 align:start position:0%
that we are instituting to help support
 
02:59:37.370 --> 02:59:37.380 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh in uh engaging in a
 
02:59:39.889 --> 02:59:39.899 align:start position:0%
process to consider how to bring more
 
02:59:41.389 --> 02:59:41.399 align:start position:0%
housing to their Community how it might
 
02:59:43.610 --> 02:59:43.620 align:start position:0%
fit there if it works in that community
 
02:59:46.370 --> 02:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
and if it does what are some ways that
 
02:59:47.990 --> 02:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
we can help incentivize and cover some
 
02:59:49.849 --> 02:59:49.859 align:start position:0%
of the us that may come with that either
 
02:59:52.190 --> 02:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
strategically or in the long term so
 
02:59:54.530 --> 02:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
these programs are also available and
 
02:59:55.490 --> 02:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
we're working with different
 
02:59:57.769 --> 02:59:57.779 align:start position:0%
municipalities around the state we have
 
02:59:59.830 --> 02:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
a separate website for this program it's
 
03:00:02.030 --> 03:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
invest603.com again there's a lot more
 
03:00:05.750 --> 03:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:09.170 --> 03:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
lastly I did mention Broadband this is a
 
03:00:11.389 --> 03:00:11.399 align:start position:0%
pretty uh this is a program that for
 
03:00:14.510 --> 03:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
those of you who don't have Broadband is
 
03:00:16.790 --> 03:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
a really big issue and for those of you
 
03:00:19.150 --> 03:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
who don't who already have it is
 
03:00:21.050 --> 03:00:21.060 align:start position:0%
congratulations I think that that's
 
03:00:22.969 --> 03:00:22.979 align:start position:0%
great but we have a lot of areas of the
 
03:00:25.370 --> 03:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
state that continue to not have access
 
03:00:28.070 --> 03:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
to high-speed internet and this is a
 
03:00:30.110 --> 03:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
I've referred to it as a once in a
 
03:00:32.210 --> 03:00:32.220 align:start position:0%
lifetime opportunity to bring a
 
03:00:33.769 --> 03:00:33.779 align:start position:0%
significant amount of federal resource
 
03:00:36.230 --> 03:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
to bear on this issue and to get as many
 
03:00:38.510 --> 03:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
unserved and underserved locations
 
03:00:40.490 --> 03:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
around the state hooked up as quickly
 
03:00:43.370 --> 03:00:43.380 align:start position:0%
and as efficiently as we possibly can we
 
03:00:45.469 --> 03:00:45.479 align:start position:0%
have already deployed 60 million dollars
 
03:00:48.110 --> 03:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
of the 122 million that we were awarded
 
03:00:50.570 --> 03:00:50.580 align:start position:0%
under the arpa funds for this specific
 
03:00:53.090 --> 03:00:53.100 align:start position:0%
purpose those funds are already being
 
03:00:55.070 --> 03:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
spent to expand into areas that are
 
03:00:56.690 --> 03:00:56.700 align:start position:0%
unserved and underserved and under the
 
03:00:59.090 --> 03:00:59.100 align:start position:0%
contract that we awarded to the New
 
03:01:00.410 --> 03:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Electric Co-op for that
 
03:01:04.429 --> 03:01:04.439 align:start position:0%
purpose we expect to see 23 000 new
 
03:01:07.370 --> 03:01:07.380 align:start position:0%
locations getting high-speed internet in
 
03:01:09.769 --> 03:01:09.779 align:start position:0%
rural areas of the state we will be
 
03:01:12.050 --> 03:01:12.060 align:start position:0%
awarding sometime in the next few weeks
 
03:01:14.750 --> 03:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
the second round of that program which I
 
03:01:16.550 --> 03:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
expect we'll see somewhere between 15
 
03:01:19.790 --> 03:01:19.800 align:start position:0%
and 18 000 additional new locations
 
03:01:22.490 --> 03:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
bringing us almost 40 000 new locations
 
03:01:24.410 --> 03:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
getting high-speed internet in areas
 
03:01:26.269 --> 03:01:26.279 align:start position:0%
that in some cases have not seen
 
03:01:28.730 --> 03:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
anything better than dial up for decades
 
03:01:32.269 --> 03:01:32.279 align:start position:0%
so in terms of the capability that this
 
03:01:35.150 --> 03:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
brings to recruit and retain a Workforce
 
03:01:38.570 --> 03:01:38.580 align:start position:0%
for employers to be able to access the
 
03:01:41.210 --> 03:01:41.220 align:start position:0%
internet to do their business to help
 
03:01:45.050 --> 03:01:45.060 align:start position:0%
individuals and and elderly reach their
 
03:01:46.790 --> 03:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
doctors using Telehealth and video
 
03:01:50.349 --> 03:01:50.359 align:start position:0%
Services the list is somewhat endless
 
03:01:53.510 --> 03:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
and the internet is a very very critical
 
03:01:55.670 --> 03:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
component of all Commerce in the state
 
03:01:58.309 --> 03:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
and if we can move quickly as we are and
 
03:02:00.050 --> 03:02:00.060 align:start position:0%
get those changes and get those
 
03:02:02.210 --> 03:02:02.220 align:start position:0%
Investments made quicker than States we
 
03:02:04.429 --> 03:02:04.439 align:start position:0%
compete with we will see the value of
 
03:02:08.150 --> 03:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
that once again again for a long time to
 
03:02:08.160 --> 03:02:08.870 align:start position:0%
that once again again for a long time to
come

03:02:08.870 --> 03:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
come
 
03:02:12.050 --> 03:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
so again that's me we've been through a
 
03:02:13.610 --> 03:02:13.620 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of stuff there's a lot more
 
03:02:15.110 --> 03:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
there obviously I look forward to
 
03:02:16.969 --> 03:02:16.979 align:start position:0%
talking with you as the session goes on
 
03:02:20.030 --> 03:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned uh my friend Brian gotlab
 
03:02:22.849 --> 03:02:22.859 align:start position:0%
and others will have more to add to
 
03:02:26.150 --> 03:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
these same components as we as you go
 
03:02:27.889 --> 03:02:27.899 align:start position:0%
through your day but I'm happy to answer
 
03:02:29.870 --> 03:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
any questions commissioner thank you so
 
03:02:31.309 --> 03:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
much there's a question behind you
 
03:02:36.910 --> 03:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:39.230 --> 03:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
because as I'm looking at your rate
 
03:02:41.570 --> 03:02:41.580 align:start position:0%
functional areas critical for economic
 
03:02:44.690 --> 03:02:44.700 align:start position:0%
development I noticed that energy costs
 
03:02:47.210 --> 03:02:47.220 align:start position:0%
and a nationally competitive tax
 
03:02:49.610 --> 03:02:49.620 align:start position:0%
structure are not bullets would you
 
03:02:53.030 --> 03:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
would you tell us why that's those are
 
03:02:56.330 --> 03:02:56.340 align:start position:0%
not folk eye of your group I wouldn't
 
03:02:59.150 --> 03:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
say they're not uh Foci we certainly
 
03:03:02.150 --> 03:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
recognize the value of our tax program
 
03:03:05.090 --> 03:03:05.100 align:start position:0%
and it is a major component of what we
 
03:03:07.370 --> 03:03:07.380 align:start position:0%
do in terms of Recruitment and Retention
 
03:03:12.130 --> 03:03:12.140 align:start position:0%
so the value of our tax structure
 
03:03:14.929 --> 03:03:14.939 align:start position:0%
should not be understated
 
03:03:17.929 --> 03:03:17.939 align:start position:0%
and I guess some ways it's been so much
 
03:03:19.670 --> 03:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
part of the culture of the work that we
 
03:03:21.710 --> 03:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
do that maybe it didn't get its own line
 
03:03:24.410 --> 03:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
here but it is definitely uh definitely
 
03:03:27.469 --> 03:03:27.479 align:start position:0%
a component in terms of energy this is a
 
03:03:29.809 --> 03:03:29.819 align:start position:0%
challenge much like housing that we are
 
03:03:33.170 --> 03:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
not alone in facing and I think that
 
03:03:36.610 --> 03:03:36.620 align:start position:0%
there's there's been some Market
 
03:03:39.710 --> 03:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
some Market reaction at least on the
 
03:03:42.469 --> 03:03:42.479 align:start position:0%
commercial side to the fact that we do
 
03:03:44.929 --> 03:03:44.939 align:start position:0%
have high energy rates in in New
 
03:03:46.130 --> 03:03:46.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in New England generally
 
03:03:50.389 --> 03:03:50.399 align:start position:0%
so we have seen maybe a decline in the
 
03:03:53.650 --> 03:03:53.660 align:start position:0%
type of heavy industry that that we saw
 
03:03:56.389 --> 03:03:56.399 align:start position:0%
through many many decades back you know
 
03:03:59.090 --> 03:03:59.100 align:start position:0%
going back sometime now and we're seeing
 
03:04:01.730 --> 03:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
an increase in terms of businesses in
 
03:04:04.670 --> 03:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
the tech space or in life sciences or in
 
03:04:08.050 --> 03:04:08.060 align:start position:0%
other areas that maybe have a lower
 
03:04:12.010 --> 03:04:12.020 align:start position:0%
cost per dollar of investment let's say
 
03:04:14.929 --> 03:04:14.939 align:start position:0%
in energy than some of those heavy and
 
03:04:17.630 --> 03:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
Street manufacturers so there there's an
 
03:04:19.610 --> 03:04:19.620 align:start position:0%
adaptation that's occurring and we don't
 
03:04:22.610 --> 03:04:22.620 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of time going after like big
 
03:04:26.030 --> 03:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
metal manufacturers to locate in New
 
03:04:27.469 --> 03:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but we do spend a lot of time
 
03:04:30.050 --> 03:04:30.060 align:start position:0%
trying to get uh you know New Life
 
03:04:31.730 --> 03:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
Science companies to come here to New
 
03:04:34.070 --> 03:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because the access to a
 
03:04:36.590 --> 03:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
world-class Workforce exists and because
 
03:04:38.330 --> 03:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
you know there are other aspects to that
 
03:04:42.290 --> 03:04:42.300 align:start position:0%
business type that um that recognize
 
03:04:44.630 --> 03:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
that in particular the energy issue
 
03:04:46.429 --> 03:04:46.439 align:start position:0%
you're welcome representative McGuire is
 
03:04:48.950 --> 03:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
also behind you yeah
 
03:04:52.610 --> 03:04:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:54.290 --> 03:04:54.300 align:start position:0%
so there was an article in the union
 
03:04:58.010 --> 03:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
leader recently that said that 16 of all
 
03:05:00.410 --> 03:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
home sales in the state go to people
 
03:05:03.170 --> 03:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
moving here from Massachusetts and
 
03:05:05.690 --> 03:05:05.700 align:start position:0%
that's greater than the sum of all
 
03:05:07.730 --> 03:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
people moving here from all of other
 
03:05:10.849 --> 03:05:10.859 align:start position:0%
states so that implies that 50 of your
 
03:05:12.769 --> 03:05:12.779 align:start position:0%
marketing should be directed at
 
03:05:14.510 --> 03:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is that what you're doing
 
03:05:17.330 --> 03:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if it's 50 percent dead
 
03:05:20.389 --> 03:05:20.399 align:start position:0%
on but for sure Massachusetts uh
 
03:05:22.790 --> 03:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and we have we have
 
03:05:25.309 --> 03:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
increased our uh our presence in the New
 
03:05:28.250 --> 03:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
York area as well over over the last
 
03:05:30.650 --> 03:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
couple of years but no question uh
 
03:05:33.349 --> 03:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
Boston in particular and you know again
 
03:05:36.309 --> 03:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
connecting that to the type of
 
03:05:38.690 --> 03:05:38.700 align:start position:0%
businesses that we're seeing with the
 
03:05:41.110 --> 03:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
highest level of growth and the high
 
03:05:43.969 --> 03:05:43.979 align:start position:0%
high quality high education needs of
 
03:05:46.610 --> 03:05:46.620 align:start position:0%
those uh of those individuals it fits
 
03:05:47.750 --> 03:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
very nicely
 
03:05:52.550 --> 03:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:54.830 --> 03:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
representative Army
 
03:05:58.490 --> 03:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
thank you uh two things that I
 
03:06:02.030 --> 03:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
always find lacking in this uh one on
 
03:06:05.510 --> 03:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
the taxation side that businesses pay
 
03:06:08.870 --> 03:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
property taxes and property taxes are
 
03:06:11.389 --> 03:06:11.399 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of our tax system and we pay
 
03:06:13.670 --> 03:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
no attention to that usually in this
 
03:06:13.680 --> 03:06:15.469 align:start position:0%
no attention to that usually in this
body

03:06:15.469 --> 03:06:15.479 align:start position:0%
body
 
03:06:17.870 --> 03:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know if you've had
 
03:06:21.110 --> 03:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
conversations with businesses that were
 
03:06:22.670 --> 03:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
calculating and if you go after
 
03:06:26.630 --> 03:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
businesses that don't need much real
 
03:06:26.640 --> 03:06:27.950 align:start position:0%
businesses that don't need much real
property

03:06:27.950 --> 03:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
property
 
03:06:31.070 --> 03:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
in order to function here but the other
 
03:06:32.990 --> 03:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
one is that
 
03:06:35.870 --> 03:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
there is on
 
03:06:39.050 --> 03:06:39.060 align:start position:0%
the people in this state that earn under
 
03:06:41.269 --> 03:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
the median
 
03:06:44.030 --> 03:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
um we have fewer and fewer of them
 
03:06:47.030 --> 03:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
willing to work in the services that
 
03:06:49.910 --> 03:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
maintain the infrastructure and the
 
03:06:54.170 --> 03:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
recreation and the general quality of
 
03:06:58.370 --> 03:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
life of the ones that are in the higher
 
03:07:01.010 --> 03:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
income brackets and
 
03:07:04.670 --> 03:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
living in Lebanon as I do which on I
 
03:07:06.530 --> 03:07:06.540 align:start position:0%
just noticed your chart says that
 
03:07:09.110 --> 03:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
Grafton County as a whole has the
 
03:07:12.530 --> 03:07:12.540 align:start position:0%
highest increase in housing costs and
 
03:07:15.170 --> 03:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
the second highest amount of housing
 
03:07:19.309 --> 03:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
cost in the state and most of that is my
 
03:07:23.290 --> 03:07:23.300 align:start position:0%
area yes uh then on
 
03:07:27.590 --> 03:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
the we have a extraordinary number of
 
03:07:29.809 --> 03:07:29.819 align:start position:0%
young people that have come to work in
 
03:07:32.809 --> 03:07:32.819 align:start position:0%
our startups and in Dartmouth medical
 
03:07:38.570 --> 03:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
and in Dartmouth College on who on are
 
03:07:41.210 --> 03:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
always on the internet complaining we
 
03:07:43.849 --> 03:07:43.859 align:start position:0%
have no target we have no place to go in
 
03:07:47.510 --> 03:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
the evening on we can't get anybody to
 
03:07:50.510 --> 03:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
repair the gadget in our house that
 
03:07:55.130 --> 03:07:55.140 align:start position:0%
broke uh and or to put in a new heating
 
03:07:58.250 --> 03:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
system on and
 
03:08:02.450 --> 03:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
there we we have been training aside
 
03:08:04.630 --> 03:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
from the housing problem which is huge
 
03:08:07.370 --> 03:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
we have been training people for 30
 
03:08:09.950 --> 03:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
years in our schools not to want to do
 
03:08:12.410 --> 03:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing to be told that
 
03:08:15.410 --> 03:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
success means you go to college and so a
 
03:08:17.750 --> 03:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of kids drop out and start
 
03:08:19.969 --> 03:08:19.979 align:start position:0%
doing drugs representative is there a
 
03:08:23.150 --> 03:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
question there yes uh can you possibly
 
03:08:23.160 --> 03:08:24.590 align:start position:0%
question there yes uh can you possibly
uh

03:08:24.590 --> 03:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:08:27.830 --> 03:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
talk about whether you are working with
 
03:08:30.170 --> 03:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
companion groups and other departments
 
03:08:31.990 --> 03:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
about these problems
 
03:08:34.670 --> 03:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
yes on all of them and I agree with the
 
03:08:36.110 --> 03:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
many of the points you made
 
03:08:38.570 --> 03:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
representative as usual I think
 
03:08:41.750 --> 03:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
um Lebanon certainly is a very popular
 
03:08:44.929 --> 03:08:44.939 align:start position:0%
area and I think many reasons why there
 
03:08:46.910 --> 03:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
are challenges in in particular that
 
03:08:49.190 --> 03:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
area but it's not unique there are same
 
03:08:52.070 --> 03:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
challenges in all parts of the state in
 
03:08:53.510 --> 03:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
terms of Workforce and Workforce
 
03:08:56.809 --> 03:08:56.819 align:start position:0%
training we absolutely work very closely
 
03:08:58.910 --> 03:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
with the community college system and
 
03:09:00.190 --> 03:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
our CTE
 
03:09:02.450 --> 03:09:02.460 align:start position:0%
programs around the state and look for
 
03:09:05.690 --> 03:09:05.700 align:start position:0%
opportunity opportunities to invest both
 
03:09:07.250 --> 03:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
either in terms of technical resource
 
03:09:09.050 --> 03:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
but actually in financial dollars in
 
03:09:10.490 --> 03:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
those programs to do a lot of things
 
03:09:11.950 --> 03:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
you've just said
 
03:09:15.910 --> 03:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
the the degree to which uh we have
 
03:09:19.670 --> 03:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
challenges in services and Hospitality
 
03:09:22.490 --> 03:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
all continue to remain I would say
 
03:09:25.130 --> 03:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
there's been a little glimmer of hope in
 
03:09:27.410 --> 03:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
the service industry nationally speaking
 
03:09:30.170 --> 03:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
anyway we don't have the the most recent
 
03:09:32.750 --> 03:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
data for New Hampshire yet but there is
 
03:09:34.550 --> 03:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
some hope I think and people coming back
 
03:09:37.070 --> 03:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
to the some of those jobs uh on a
 
03:09:38.690 --> 03:09:38.700 align:start position:0%
national scale we'll hope that we see
 
03:09:41.389 --> 03:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
similar Trends here in New Hampshire but
 
03:09:43.429 --> 03:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
uh there are questions and I think
 
03:09:45.170 --> 03:09:45.180 align:start position:0%
you'll see one of the slides that I'm
 
03:09:46.670 --> 03:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
pretty sure Brian always likes to show
 
03:09:49.070 --> 03:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
that you'll see after lunch is uh where
 
03:09:51.730 --> 03:09:51.740 align:start position:0%
the Gap is in terms of the individuals
 
03:09:53.929 --> 03:09:53.939 align:start position:0%
who are have not returned to the
 
03:09:56.330 --> 03:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
workforce we have not yet quite gotten
 
03:09:58.730 --> 03:09:58.740 align:start position:0%
to where we were at 2019 in terms of
 
03:10:00.889 --> 03:10:00.899 align:start position:0%
individuals working in the you know res
 
03:10:02.330 --> 03:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
the residents of New Hampshire are
 
03:10:03.910 --> 03:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
working and there's a specific
 
03:10:07.130 --> 03:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
population that uh that falls into that
 
03:10:09.830 --> 03:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
category a lot of times it has to do
 
03:10:12.490 --> 03:10:12.500 align:start position:0%
with whether or not individuals have
 
03:10:14.570 --> 03:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for others in their
 
03:10:17.330 --> 03:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
family so that gives you I think a very
 
03:10:20.090 --> 03:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
uh uh look at either end of the
 
03:10:24.230 --> 03:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
workforce age Spectrum so we continue to
 
03:10:25.550 --> 03:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
try to find ways to get those
 
03:10:27.590 --> 03:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
individuals back into the workforce to
 
03:10:29.090 --> 03:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
make up some of the Gap but I have to
 
03:10:30.769 --> 03:10:30.779 align:start position:0%
say probably in the end if we got every
 
03:10:31.849 --> 03:10:31.859 align:start position:0%
single person
 
03:10:33.769 --> 03:10:33.779 align:start position:0%
uh in New Hampshire who's not working
 
03:10:35.870 --> 03:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
who could be working working we'd still
 
03:10:38.030 --> 03:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
have a gap so
 
03:10:40.610 --> 03:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
um the challenges remain I think the
 
03:10:42.969 --> 03:10:42.979 align:start position:0%
tools that we have at our disposal are
 
03:10:45.650 --> 03:10:45.660 align:start position:0%
training and giving people opportunities
 
03:10:48.830 --> 03:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
to see the value of I mean if you were
 
03:10:51.110 --> 03:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
an electrician anywhere in the North
 
03:10:52.849 --> 03:10:52.859 align:start position:0%
Country these days you'd probably be
 
03:10:55.429 --> 03:10:55.439 align:start position:0%
doing pretty well uh yeah I know one in
 
03:10:56.990 --> 03:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
Littleton is telling me that they don't
 
03:10:59.030 --> 03:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
even think about coming out until April
 
03:11:02.690 --> 03:11:02.700 align:start position:0%
at this point for that type of work and
 
03:11:04.130 --> 03:11:04.140 align:start position:0%
you've got companies that are able to
 
03:11:05.750 --> 03:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
really pick and choose the type of areas
 
03:11:08.630 --> 03:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
that they're in based on the reality so
 
03:11:14.570 --> 03:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:17.570 --> 03:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
representative Elber
 
03:11:19.730 --> 03:11:19.740 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:11:22.309 --> 03:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
um I representative uh Ward one in
 
03:11:26.150 --> 03:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
Nashua uh I have when I was campaigning
 
03:11:29.210 --> 03:11:29.220 align:start position:0%
I spoke with a good many people who were
 
03:11:31.250 --> 03:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
talking about how they live in Nashville
 
03:11:34.550 --> 03:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
but they can't afford to work in Nashua
 
03:11:37.190 --> 03:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
teachers who can earn twenty thousand
 
03:11:39.590 --> 03:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
dollars a year more by just going across
 
03:11:41.510 --> 03:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
the border
 
03:11:44.510 --> 03:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
um what are we doing in terms of or
 
03:11:47.150 --> 03:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
what's your office doing in terms of
 
03:11:49.130 --> 03:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
looking at salaries
 
03:11:53.269 --> 03:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
Nashua for example was looking for a
 
03:11:55.849 --> 03:11:55.859 align:start position:0%
master's level speech pathologist
 
03:11:57.889 --> 03:11:57.899 align:start position:0%
paying forty nine thousand dollars a
 
03:12:01.070 --> 03:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
year now my own research showed me that
 
03:12:03.050 --> 03:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
the average one-bedroom apartment in
 
03:12:05.510 --> 03:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
Nashua was seventeen hundred dollars a
 
03:12:08.210 --> 03:12:08.220 align:start position:0%
month which meant that the growth more
 
03:12:10.190 --> 03:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
than 20 percent of that
 
03:12:12.050 --> 03:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
staff member's salary would be going
 
03:12:13.910 --> 03:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
toward rent
 
03:12:16.730 --> 03:12:16.740 align:start position:0%
how are we approaching the fact that
 
03:12:20.690 --> 03:12:20.700 align:start position:0%
employers aren't paying enough to be
 
03:12:22.550 --> 03:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
able to allow people to afford to work
 
03:12:24.469 --> 03:12:24.479 align:start position:0%
here well I think I would say a good
 
03:12:26.750 --> 03:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
thing well first of all employers if
 
03:12:29.210 --> 03:12:29.220 align:start position:0%
they are experiencing shortages in their
 
03:12:31.670 --> 03:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
Workforce typically will find the among
 
03:12:33.230 --> 03:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
the tools they have to attract the
 
03:12:35.990 --> 03:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
workforce is paying more and that's
 
03:12:39.050 --> 03:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
something that uh we certainly uh remind
 
03:12:41.870 --> 03:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
them of as much as we as we can but I
 
03:12:44.150 --> 03:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
would say on the other side uh with
 
03:12:46.389 --> 03:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
regard to the housing component again
 
03:12:50.809 --> 03:12:50.819 align:start position:0%
this goes uh to the most basic need of
 
03:12:53.150 --> 03:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
any individual which is to have housing
 
03:12:55.809 --> 03:12:55.819 align:start position:0%
that that matches
 
03:12:59.210 --> 03:12:59.220 align:start position:0%
the basic income levels in an area and
 
03:13:01.490 --> 03:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
that's where we have some capability to
 
03:13:03.349 --> 03:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
at least raise the issue we have a
 
03:13:04.490 --> 03:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
hundred million dollars that we're
 
03:13:07.250 --> 03:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
putting towards this program uh through
 
03:13:10.250 --> 03:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
the invest in age program and that just
 
03:13:12.710 --> 03:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
scratches the surface right I think
 
03:13:14.809 --> 03:13:14.819 align:start position:0%
there are a multitude of reasons that
 
03:13:16.969 --> 03:13:16.979 align:start position:0%
you can get into as to what causes all
 
03:13:19.250 --> 03:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
these things to happen most of which the
 
03:13:20.809 --> 03:13:20.819 align:start position:0%
government doesn't have a lot of control
 
03:13:23.870 --> 03:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
over but we can make some Investments
 
03:13:27.769 --> 03:13:27.779 align:start position:0%
and demonstrate that by by making some
 
03:13:29.950 --> 03:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
Investments by making some
 
03:13:33.170 --> 03:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
alterations to local policies to be able
 
03:13:35.809 --> 03:13:35.819 align:start position:0%
to accommodate those individuals that we
 
03:13:37.550 --> 03:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
can make some progress in affecting the
 
03:13:39.650 --> 03:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates which in which will in
 
03:13:42.710 --> 03:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
turn affect the total rent costs that
 
03:13:46.090 --> 03:13:46.100 align:start position:0%
are in any individual community
 
03:13:47.990 --> 03:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
03:13:49.969 --> 03:13:49.979 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you for
 
03:13:52.250 --> 03:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh work participation
 
03:13:55.010 --> 03:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
rate versus uh say 20 or 30 years ago
 
03:13:57.110 --> 03:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
was on a decline and how do you
 
03:14:00.650 --> 03:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
determine that that right I don't know I
 
03:14:03.469 --> 03:14:03.479 align:start position:0%
can't I can't say specifically that uh I
 
03:14:05.389 --> 03:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
can I can riddle off the top of my head
 
03:14:07.429 --> 03:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
what the labor participation rates were
 
03:14:10.849 --> 03:14:10.859 align:start position:0%
uh at that rate but we do have uh
 
03:14:12.830 --> 03:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
nationally one of the highest labor
 
03:14:14.870 --> 03:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
participation rates we were in the 70s
 
03:14:16.849 --> 03:14:16.859 align:start position:0%
last I saw
 
03:14:19.010 --> 03:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
um and again I'm pretty certain you're
 
03:14:20.929 --> 03:14:20.939 align:start position:0%
going to see a slide from Brian on that
 
03:14:23.090 --> 03:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
this is an area that he really focuses
 
03:14:26.269 --> 03:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
on because we we have seen that slip
 
03:14:30.650 --> 03:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:32.389 --> 03:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
thank you so much if there any other
 
03:14:35.929 --> 03:14:35.939 align:start position:0%
questions as representative Bolton
 
03:14:38.090 --> 03:14:38.100 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um regarding
 
03:14:38.100 --> 03:14:39.410 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um regarding
housing

03:14:39.410 --> 03:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
housing
 
03:14:42.710 --> 03:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
um I live in Plymouth and there
 
03:14:44.389 --> 03:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
um is some wrestling over the language
 
03:14:47.330 --> 03:14:47.340 align:start position:0%
of zoning changes that must be put in
 
03:14:49.550 --> 03:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
place in order to encourage Workforce
 
03:14:52.250 --> 03:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
housing or affordable housing is there
 
03:14:54.410 --> 03:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
model language that yep you've been
 
03:14:56.870 --> 03:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
producing that you could share so I
 
03:14:59.269 --> 03:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
would say uh it would be easy to connect
 
03:15:01.309 --> 03:15:01.319 align:start position:0%
them to me and I will get them to the
 
03:15:03.830 --> 03:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
right place but it is we have staff but
 
03:15:05.510 --> 03:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
we also work with New Hampshire Housing
 
03:15:08.090 --> 03:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire housing has actually
 
03:15:10.670 --> 03:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
some funding that is available through
 
03:15:13.690 --> 03:15:13.700 align:start position:0%
our invest in h program to help
 
03:15:16.550 --> 03:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
local communities that want to make some
 
03:15:18.950 --> 03:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
analysis or review or changes to their
 
03:15:21.590 --> 03:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
zoning rules to to participate in the
 
03:15:24.230 --> 03:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
program at no cost
 
03:15:26.269 --> 03:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
so that's a worthy program to look at
 
03:15:27.490 --> 03:15:27.500 align:start position:0%
but if you want to send them to me I'm
 
03:15:31.130 --> 03:15:31.140 align:start position:0%
taylor.caswell nh.gov pretty easy
 
03:15:33.349 --> 03:15:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much just send them to me
 
03:15:35.630 --> 03:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
wonderful presentation we appreciate you

good afternoon
 
04:05:20.870 --> 04:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
time being one o'clock we should
 
04:05:23.630 --> 04:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
probably get started it's actually 102.
 
04:05:27.410 --> 04:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
welcome back to the 2000 no 2023 joint
 
04:05:30.110 --> 04:05:30.120 align:start position:0%

guests uh Rich lavers from the Deputy
 
04:05:35.210 --> 04:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of the Department of
 
04:05:37.729 --> 04:05:37.739 align:start position:0%

hopefully will educate us on the state's
 
04:05:46.790 --> 04:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
labor market among other things so we
 
04:05:50.510 --> 04:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:52.910 --> 04:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you so much so we
 
04:05:55.550 --> 04:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
do everyone should have copies of the
 
04:05:57.530 --> 04:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
slides that Brian and I will be working
 
04:06:00.349 --> 04:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
from so I'll kick us off I'll talk for a
 
04:06:02.870 --> 04:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
little bit hopefully not too much uh
 
04:06:05.330 --> 04:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
Brian will then present we'll go back
 
04:06:06.830 --> 04:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
and forth and then Brian will have the
 
04:06:08.450 --> 04:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
big finish
 
04:06:10.610 --> 04:06:10.620 align:start position:0%
um really trying to set up those
 
04:06:12.710 --> 04:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
expectations for his part of the
 
04:06:16.010 --> 04:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
presentation here and deflate mine so
 
04:06:19.150 --> 04:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
um but let's get let's get started
 
04:06:19.160 --> 04:06:21.050 align:start position:0%
um but let's get let's get started
so

04:06:21.050 --> 04:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:06:24.170 --> 04:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
um I'll multitask here I'll work the
 
04:06:27.110 --> 04:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
computer and talk at the same time so
 
04:06:30.349 --> 04:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
our first slide that that folks have and
 
04:06:32.929 --> 04:06:32.939 align:start position:0%
uh trying just to put everything into
 
04:06:35.229 --> 04:06:35.239 align:start position:0%
context for what we've experienced
 
04:06:38.990 --> 04:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
coming out of the pandemic caused
 
04:06:41.269 --> 04:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
recession from a labor force perspective
 
04:06:43.130 --> 04:06:43.140 align:start position:0%
you can see here that we have a
 
04:06:45.769 --> 04:06:45.779 align:start position:0%
comparison of of how the state did
 
04:06:47.710 --> 04:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
coming out of the Great Recession
 
04:06:50.990 --> 04:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
compared to the labor force recovery
 
04:06:54.889 --> 04:06:54.899 align:start position:0%
coming out of the pandemic so when we
 
04:06:57.110 --> 04:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
when we look at labor force recovery and
 
04:07:00.490 --> 04:07:00.500 align:start position:0%
we look at that Peak recession
 
04:07:04.130 --> 04:07:04.140 align:start position:0%
labor force number it took us nearly
 
04:07:07.790 --> 04:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
seven years to get back to that Peak
 
04:07:10.670 --> 04:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
coming out of the Great Recession you
 
04:07:14.269 --> 04:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
compare that to how quickly we were able
 
04:07:16.610 --> 04:07:16.620 align:start position:0%
to recover private sector employment
 
04:07:20.450 --> 04:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
lost during the pandemic session we're
 
04:07:23.330 --> 04:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
looking at about two and a half years so
 
04:07:26.389 --> 04:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
really no comparison between the two
 
04:07:28.309 --> 04:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
hard to put the two of them on the same
 
04:07:31.130 --> 04:07:31.140 align:start position:0%
chart but we felt it was important to
 
04:07:34.309 --> 04:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
show how quickly things occurred from a
 
04:07:37.370 --> 04:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
labor force perspective both uh on the
 
04:07:41.030 --> 04:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
on the downturn back in 2020 and then
 
04:07:43.010 --> 04:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
how quickly the state has been able to
 
04:07:45.650 --> 04:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
recover private sector employment coming
 
04:07:49.550 --> 04:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
out of the pandemic caused recession
 
04:07:53.330 --> 04:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
how New Hampshire is doing compared to
 
04:07:57.349 --> 04:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
other states so again looking at our
 
04:08:01.189 --> 04:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
private sector employment and right now
 
04:08:04.610 --> 04:08:04.620 align:start position:0%
you see New Hampshire the Red Bar you
 
04:08:07.429 --> 04:08:07.439 align:start position:0%
also see that we've noted our other New
 
04:08:09.710 --> 04:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
England states but New Hampshire is a
 
04:08:13.849 --> 04:08:13.859 align:start position:0%
little bit over one percent above where
 
04:08:16.910 --> 04:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
we were in our pre-pandemic Peak again
 
04:08:19.210 --> 04:08:19.220 align:start position:0%
for private sector employment
 
04:08:23.030 --> 04:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
and you see Maine is is right up there
 
04:08:24.830 --> 04:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire in terms of having
 
04:08:26.889 --> 04:08:26.899 align:start position:0%
recovered all of its private sector
 
04:08:30.349 --> 04:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
employment and then some other New
 
04:08:32.510 --> 04:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
England states are are not there yet you
 
04:08:34.689 --> 04:08:34.699 align:start position:0%
see where Massachusetts is Connecticut
 
04:08:38.870 --> 04:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island and Vermont still have some
 
04:08:41.269 --> 04:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
distance to go in terms of recovering
 
04:08:44.990 --> 04:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
that lost private sector employment and
 
04:08:47.870 --> 04:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
but puts it into perspective of how New
 
04:08:50.510 --> 04:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fares compared to the rest of
 
04:08:52.630 --> 04:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
the Northeast
 
04:08:55.729 --> 04:08:55.739 align:start position:0%
now I could tell you that everyone is
 
04:08:58.429 --> 04:08:58.439 align:start position:0%
happy every sector has shared in that
 
04:09:02.150 --> 04:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
recovery equally but we all know that is
 
04:09:05.269 --> 04:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
not the case and what this next slide
 
04:09:08.689 --> 04:09:08.699 align:start position:0%
presents to you is a breakdown of
 
04:09:12.250 --> 04:09:12.260 align:start position:0%
employment gains and losses
 
04:09:16.189 --> 04:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
compared back to pre-pandemic and how
 
04:09:19.490 --> 04:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
each of our sectors are doing from the
 
04:09:21.889 --> 04:09:21.899 align:start position:0%
perspective of the number of jobs in
 
04:09:24.650 --> 04:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
that sector for this slide what we use
 
04:09:28.370 --> 04:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
for numbers are taken from our quarterly
 
04:09:31.010 --> 04:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
census of employment and wages so these
 
04:09:34.790 --> 04:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
are the actual reports filed by New
 
04:09:36.410 --> 04:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses that have
 
04:09:39.229 --> 04:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
employment they file that on a quarterly
 
04:09:41.170 --> 04:09:41.180 align:start position:0%
basis when they report
 
04:09:45.349 --> 04:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
their employees and the wages paid to
 
04:09:47.150 --> 04:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
Employment Security as part of the
 
04:09:49.370 --> 04:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance
 
04:09:51.050 --> 04:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
tax system
 
04:09:53.929 --> 04:09:53.939 align:start position:0%
so that's where this data is coming from
 
04:09:56.330 --> 04:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
and here you can see the sectors that
 
04:09:58.910 --> 04:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
have had the the largest amount of
 
04:10:01.189 --> 04:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
growth with our our professional
 
04:10:04.130 --> 04:10:04.140 align:start position:0%
scientific and Technical Services so
 
04:10:07.729 --> 04:10:07.739 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of I.T occupations in this
 
04:10:07.739 --> 04:10:08.990 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of I.T occupations in this
sector

04:10:08.990 --> 04:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
sector
 
04:10:13.309 --> 04:10:13.319 align:start position:0%
um Architects legal engineering so a lot
 
04:10:17.210 --> 04:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
of higher paying type of professions
 
04:10:19.849 --> 04:10:19.859 align:start position:0%
um in in this sector that have had the
 
04:10:23.170 --> 04:10:23.180 align:start position:0%
most growth construction has fared well
 
04:10:26.570 --> 04:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
from an employment perspective and then
 
04:10:30.349 --> 04:10:30.359 align:start position:0%
as we move down this chart you can see
 
04:10:33.590 --> 04:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
those sectors that have shed employment
 
04:10:37.969 --> 04:10:37.979 align:start position:0%
and those that have had a more difficult
 
04:10:41.150 --> 04:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
time than others in getting back to
 
04:10:43.729 --> 04:10:43.739 align:start position:0%
where they were prior to the pandemic
 
04:10:46.370 --> 04:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
and you can see down at the bottom of
 
04:10:47.929 --> 04:10:47.939 align:start position:0%
this chart those sectors that have lost
 
04:10:51.710 --> 04:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
the most employment you see a lot of our
 
04:10:54.830 --> 04:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
health care sector so long-term care
 
04:10:58.450 --> 04:10:58.460 align:start position:0%
facilities hospitals those are
 
04:11:00.950 --> 04:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
continuing to have the the hardest time
 
04:11:03.429 --> 04:11:03.439 align:start position:0%
of getting back to where they were
 
04:11:06.830 --> 04:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic state government is also
 
04:11:08.510 --> 04:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
down there we've we've highlighted that
 
04:11:10.849 --> 04:11:10.859 align:start position:0%
in the in the red bar and then our
 
04:11:13.250 --> 04:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
retail employers as well still
 
04:11:16.670 --> 04:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
significantly down the next
 
04:11:18.469 --> 04:11:18.479 align:start position:0%
two slides try to put that together
 
04:11:20.150 --> 04:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
could we while we're on that slide could
 
04:11:21.670 --> 04:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
we would you entertain questions
 
04:11:24.590 --> 04:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely excellent Center thank you
 
04:11:27.110 --> 04:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair do you know it uh do you
 
04:11:31.550 --> 04:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
track child care as one of the sectors I
 
04:11:34.189 --> 04:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
don't see them on here but we've heard
 
04:11:38.809 --> 04:11:38.819 align:start position:0%
that there's about a 50 percent decline
 
04:11:41.570 --> 04:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
in capacity
 
04:11:44.210 --> 04:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
so there and and Brian will chime in
 
04:11:46.189 --> 04:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
here too so Child Care is part of the
 
04:11:48.349 --> 04:11:48.359 align:start position:0%
social assistance sector
 
04:11:50.570 --> 04:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
um and how it is tracked here
 
04:11:53.990 --> 04:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
um number of establishments in terms of
 
04:11:56.809 --> 04:11:56.819 align:start position:0%
um those that are providing care
 
04:11:59.269 --> 04:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
um and the number of workers what do we
 
04:12:01.309 --> 04:12:01.319 align:start position:0%
have currently Brian
 
04:12:03.650 --> 04:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
um we're down in the number of providers
 
04:12:05.330 --> 04:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
we're probably down in terms of
 
04:12:08.330 --> 04:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
employment somewhere between 10 to 20
 
04:12:10.130 --> 04:12:10.140 align:start position:0%
percent probably I would say probably
 
04:12:12.889 --> 04:12:12.899 align:start position:0%
closer to 15 percent in terms of
 
04:12:14.570 --> 04:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
employment that's a national Trend by
 
04:12:15.710 --> 04:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
the way
 
04:12:18.650 --> 04:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
um nationally it it has been rebounding
 
04:12:21.229 --> 04:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
somewhat we don't keep track of the
 
04:12:24.110 --> 04:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
number of spaces in that's something
 
04:12:25.790 --> 04:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
that I think the Department of Health
 
04:12:28.070 --> 04:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
and Human Services tracks that we don't
 
04:12:29.450 --> 04:12:29.460 align:start position:0%
have that we do have the number of
 
04:12:29.460 --> 04:12:31.429 align:start position:0%
have that we do have the number of
employees

04:12:31.429 --> 04:12:31.439 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:12:34.189 --> 04:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
and we do have some additional there are
 
04:12:35.570 --> 04:12:35.580 align:start position:0%
some other slides that we'll we'll touch
 
04:12:38.210 --> 04:12:38.220 align:start position:0%
upon that too as well senator this is a
 
04:12:39.889 --> 04:12:39.899 align:start position:0%
representative behind you representative
 
04:12:48.710 --> 04:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:48.720 --> 04:12:58.490 align:start position:0%
 
games

04:12:58.490 --> 04:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:00.710 --> 04:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
this chair doesn't make the distinction
 
04:13:02.750 --> 04:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
between part-time and full-time
 
04:13:05.150 --> 04:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
employment and you're absolutely correct
 
04:13:09.650 --> 04:13:09.660 align:start position:0%
we did see a lot of businesses that that
 
04:13:12.710 --> 04:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
ceased operating during the pandemic a
 
04:13:15.290 --> 04:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
lot of retail a lot of food services
 
04:13:18.530 --> 04:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
restaurants did as well but one of the
 
04:13:19.910 --> 04:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
things that we don't have this
 
04:13:22.070 --> 04:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in this particular
 
04:13:24.590 --> 04:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
presentation but we do in others the
 
04:13:26.389 --> 04:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
number of businesses that have started
 
04:13:29.150 --> 04:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
up new businesses that have come to
 
04:13:31.790 --> 04:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
replace those businesses has really been
 
04:13:34.189 --> 04:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
remarkable we've seen some of the
 
04:13:36.950 --> 04:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
highest levels of new business starts in
 
04:13:39.710 --> 04:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
our state in the times that I've been
 
04:13:42.110 --> 04:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
looking at the data which is at least a
 
04:13:44.210 --> 04:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
couple of decades so we've replaced a
 
04:13:48.410 --> 04:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:50.689 --> 04:13:50.699 align:start position:0%
representative leapley thank you madam
 
04:13:53.990 --> 04:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
chair just a question this graph is I'm
 
04:13:56.990 --> 04:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
assuming this number is number of jobs
 
04:13:58.520 --> 04:13:58.530 align:start position:0%
so how does that that is correct
 
04:13:58.530 --> 04:14:00.110 align:start position:0%
so how does that that is correct
[Music]

04:14:00.110 --> 04:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:14:01.849 --> 04:14:01.859 align:start position:0%
um it's hard for me to understand what
 
04:14:04.490 --> 04:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
six thousand jobs gained or lost means
 
04:14:06.830 --> 04:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
can you kind of help translate that for
 
04:14:09.229 --> 04:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
me that is a perfect segue into the next
 
04:14:11.469 --> 04:14:11.479 align:start position:0%
chart thank you so much representative
 
04:14:13.370 --> 04:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
while we're here though we have a
 
04:14:16.010 --> 04:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
question from representative almie
 
04:14:19.450 --> 04:14:19.460 align:start position:0%
didn't want to get in the way but on
 
04:14:23.510 --> 04:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
we've we've got a lot of former
 
04:14:27.769 --> 04:14:27.779 align:start position:0%
employees of head to restaurants that
 
04:14:30.110 --> 04:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
have founded their own places and are
 
04:14:31.670 --> 04:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
now discovering they don't have enough
 
04:14:35.030 --> 04:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
people work to work for them but um I
 
04:14:37.070 --> 04:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask about state government
 
04:14:39.290 --> 04:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
does that include municipal
 
04:14:41.750 --> 04:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
that does not
 
04:14:44.269 --> 04:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
so they're just not on the chart they're
 
04:14:46.610 --> 04:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
not on the chart I will I will say
 
04:14:46.620 --> 04:14:47.210 align:start position:0%
not on the chart I will I will say
um

04:14:47.210 --> 04:14:47.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:49.670 --> 04:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
interesting because I just did a another
 
04:14:51.229 --> 04:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
presentation this morning where I did
 
04:14:53.090 --> 04:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
look at local government and local
 
04:14:55.790 --> 04:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
government is around the same number of
 
04:14:58.309 --> 04:14:58.319 align:start position:0%
declines and when I look at local
 
04:14:59.929 --> 04:14:59.939 align:start position:0%
government I'm excluding educational
 
04:15:02.570 --> 04:15:02.580 align:start position:0%
services so it's not counting schools
 
04:15:05.150 --> 04:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
just looking at the the executive uh
 
04:15:07.849 --> 04:15:07.859 align:start position:0%
portion of local government and it's
 
04:15:09.710 --> 04:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
down somewhere in the order of between
 
04:15:12.710 --> 04:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
14 and 1500 as well
 
04:15:15.349 --> 04:15:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:15:17.450 --> 04:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
representative Rutherford thank you
 
04:15:19.790 --> 04:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair um just looking at the
 
04:15:22.729 --> 04:15:22.739 align:start position:0%
losses again the job losses uh as it
 
04:15:24.830 --> 04:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
relates to the nursing nursing and
 
04:15:26.689 --> 04:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
Residential Care Facilities hospitals
 
04:15:28.189 --> 04:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
Health Care
 
04:15:28.199 --> 04:15:29.210 align:start position:0%
Health Care
um

04:15:29.210 --> 04:15:29.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:31.670 --> 04:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
are you attributing are you able to
 
04:15:35.150 --> 04:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
attribute that to burnout of employees
 
04:15:38.689 --> 04:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
because clearly these facilities are are
 
04:15:41.570 --> 04:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
would hire if they could
 
04:15:44.750 --> 04:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
and this this data set doesn't capture
 
04:15:48.349 --> 04:15:48.359 align:start position:0%
that right but certainly with
 
04:15:51.590 --> 04:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
um not only anecdotal evidence but with
 
04:15:53.510 --> 04:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
the stories that we hear and talking
 
04:15:55.969 --> 04:15:55.979 align:start position:0%
with those employer groups certainly
 
04:15:58.429 --> 04:15:58.439 align:start position:0%
burnout is a big factor
 
04:16:00.349 --> 04:16:00.359 align:start position:0%
um with that service sector type work
 
04:16:02.269 --> 04:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
particularly in healthcare we do see
 
04:16:04.370 --> 04:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
quit rates in the healthcare industry
 
04:16:07.010 --> 04:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
have risen sharply traditionally they've
 
04:16:09.229 --> 04:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
had lower quit rates among all
 
04:16:09.239 --> 04:16:10.630 align:start position:0%
had lower quit rates among all
Industries

04:16:10.630 --> 04:16:10.640 align:start position:0%
Industries
 
04:16:13.070 --> 04:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
Hospitality has high quit rates retail
 
04:16:15.050 --> 04:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
has high quit rates traditionally
 
04:16:17.330 --> 04:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
Healthcare has low crit rates it has
 
04:16:20.450 --> 04:16:20.460 align:start position:0%
increased very sharply post pandemic and
 
04:16:23.030 --> 04:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic the other thing that
 
04:16:25.670 --> 04:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
we attribute this to we know that
 
04:16:27.650 --> 04:16:27.660 align:start position:0%
there's job openings in the healthcare
 
04:16:30.229 --> 04:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
industry it is perennially at least in
 
04:16:32.210 --> 04:16:32.220 align:start position:0%
the last few years been at the top of
 
04:16:35.330 --> 04:16:35.340 align:start position:0%
the list of job openings in the state so
 
04:16:37.389 --> 04:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
it's not a function of lack of demand
 
04:16:41.090 --> 04:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
it's a function of lack of Supply in in
 
04:16:43.849 --> 04:16:43.859 align:start position:0%
the field build occupations
 
04:16:46.189 --> 04:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
and that was going back prior to the
 
04:16:48.410 --> 04:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
pandemic you know registered nurses are
 
04:16:51.769 --> 04:16:51.779 align:start position:0%
one of the most high demand occupations
 
04:16:53.809 --> 04:16:53.819 align:start position:0%
when we look at posting data and that
 
04:16:55.309 --> 04:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
you know that was true before the
 
04:16:56.990 --> 04:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic it's even
 
04:16:59.570 --> 04:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
um more so true now
 
04:17:02.269 --> 04:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you um can
 
04:17:04.969 --> 04:17:04.979 align:start position:0%
you tell me if in particular like the
 
04:17:04.979 --> 04:17:06.250 align:start position:0%
you tell me if in particular like the
nursing

04:17:06.250 --> 04:17:06.260 align:start position:0%
nursing
 
04:17:10.250 --> 04:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
bar if it includes the traveling nurses
 
04:17:13.010 --> 04:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
the ones that come here on work for our
 
04:17:15.050 --> 04:17:15.060 align:start position:0%
agency and come here on a you know
 
04:17:18.110 --> 04:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
short-term basis that that would be in a
 
04:17:20.389 --> 04:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
in a different industry that would be
 
04:17:24.050 --> 04:17:24.060 align:start position:0%
because they're generally hired by
 
04:17:26.030 --> 04:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
um though they belong to employment
 
04:17:28.370 --> 04:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
service organizations
 
04:17:30.550 --> 04:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
um so they're not technically employed
 
04:17:33.830 --> 04:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
specifically by a health care provider
 
04:17:35.809 --> 04:17:35.819 align:start position:0%
but rather by some sort of employment
 
04:17:38.689 --> 04:17:38.699 align:start position:0%
agency so they tend to they fall into
 
04:17:40.189 --> 04:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
um the administrative and support
 
04:17:44.210 --> 04:17:44.220 align:start position:0%
services which is includes um temporary
 
04:17:48.469 --> 04:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
help agencies so the occup the
 
04:17:50.630 --> 04:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
occupation itself
 
04:17:53.510 --> 04:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
um actually hasn't shrunk that much it's
 
04:17:56.990 --> 04:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
just that the demand has been so high
 
04:17:59.870 --> 04:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
and the the demand is a little bit more
 
04:18:02.630 --> 04:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
Diversified as well and and talking
 
04:18:05.630 --> 04:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
about some of it shifting to the the
 
04:18:08.750 --> 04:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
temporary uh type of Occupational
 
04:18:10.990 --> 04:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
providers but also looking at other
 
04:18:14.809 --> 04:18:14.819 align:start position:0%
non-health care type of employers who
 
04:18:17.450 --> 04:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
have positions requiring that that
 
04:18:19.670 --> 04:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
nursing skill set
 
04:18:22.610 --> 04:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
um so you see a lot of that occupational
 
04:18:25.849 --> 04:18:25.859 align:start position:0%
skill set in those other sectors as well
 
04:18:27.950 --> 04:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
because the the amount of hiring that's
 
04:18:29.750 --> 04:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
being done of that occupational skill
 
04:18:32.269 --> 04:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
set is about the same as it was right
 
04:18:34.610 --> 04:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic it's just a lot of
 
04:18:36.469 --> 04:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
it is being done outside of the health
 
04:18:39.170 --> 04:18:39.180 align:start position:0%
care sector people like organizations
 
04:18:41.710 --> 04:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
like Walmart CVS
 
04:18:44.809 --> 04:18:44.819 align:start position:0%
you know retail operators are hiring
 
04:18:46.969 --> 04:18:46.979 align:start position:0%
Health Care Providers they're hiring
 
04:18:49.010 --> 04:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
nurses they're hiring pharmacists so
 
04:18:50.929 --> 04:18:50.939 align:start position:0%
that's not showing up in these in the
 
04:18:52.370 --> 04:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
healthcare Industries it is showing up
 
04:18:54.110 --> 04:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
in the occupational data which is a
 
04:18:59.630 --> 04:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:01.670 --> 04:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
um so trying to put this into
 
04:19:04.210 --> 04:19:04.220 align:start position:0%
perspective so you know great question
 
04:19:07.130 --> 04:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
6600 job gains
 
04:19:09.530 --> 04:19:09.540 align:start position:0%
um do I care about that what is that in
 
04:19:11.570 --> 04:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
relationship to the to the sector to the
 
04:19:15.290 --> 04:19:15.300 align:start position:0%
state's private sector employment base
 
04:19:16.849 --> 04:19:16.859 align:start position:0%
um does it matter
 
04:19:20.269 --> 04:19:20.279 align:start position:0%
um here you can see when we look at the
 
04:19:23.030 --> 04:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
gains and losses as a percentage of
 
04:19:24.590 --> 04:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
those sectors
 
04:19:26.990 --> 04:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
um and what those numbers uh from that
 
04:19:30.290 --> 04:19:30.300 align:start position:0%
from that prior slide actually translate
 
04:19:33.110 --> 04:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
to for the significance within that
 
04:19:35.990 --> 04:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
sector so again uh professional
 
04:19:38.269 --> 04:19:38.279 align:start position:0%
scientific and Technical Services being
 
04:19:40.309 --> 04:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
at the top in terms of gains you can see
 
04:19:42.849 --> 04:19:42.859 align:start position:0%
that that gains about a 17
 
04:19:46.610 --> 04:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
gain in terms of employment within that
 
04:19:48.889 --> 04:19:48.899 align:start position:0%
sector and then we look at our sectors
 
04:19:52.070 --> 04:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
that have lost you see that our our
 
04:19:53.809 --> 04:19:53.819 align:start position:0%
social assistance down a little over
 
04:19:56.510 --> 04:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
seven percent long-term care facilities
 
04:19:58.429 --> 04:19:58.439 align:start position:0%
in nursing and residential being down
 
04:20:00.429 --> 04:20:00.439 align:start position:0%
eight and a half half percent
 
04:20:03.889 --> 04:20:03.899 align:start position:0%
in hospitals down close to six percent
 
04:20:06.769 --> 04:20:06.779 align:start position:0%
so you can see what those gains and
 
04:20:10.490 --> 04:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
losses represent to that sector and in
 
04:20:12.950 --> 04:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
our our next slide we look at what those
 
04:20:15.110 --> 04:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
sectors mean for total private sector
 
04:20:18.590 --> 04:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
employment within the state so here you
 
04:20:21.550 --> 04:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
can see what percentage or what share
 
04:20:26.210 --> 04:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
each of these sectors is in terms of the
 
04:20:28.910 --> 04:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
amount of employees that they have as a
 
04:20:30.950 --> 04:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
percentage of the state's total private
 
04:20:33.950 --> 04:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
sector employment base
 
04:20:33.960 --> 04:20:39.250 align:start position:0%
sector employment base
foreign

04:20:39.250 --> 04:20:39.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:42.170 --> 04:20:42.180 align:start position:0%
moving right along here so
 
04:20:46.030 --> 04:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
um looking at what the activity is uh
 
04:20:49.130 --> 04:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
currently experiencing right now in the
 
04:20:52.070 --> 04:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
unemployment program you'll see that
 
04:20:55.189 --> 04:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
here in this slide that the initial
 
04:20:58.250 --> 04:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
claims for unemployment so people filing
 
04:21:01.849 --> 04:21:01.859 align:start position:0%
that initial claim having lost covered
 
04:21:04.610 --> 04:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
employment being through no fault of
 
04:21:07.929 --> 04:21:07.939 align:start position:0%
their own those initial claims are
 
04:21:11.570 --> 04:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
significantly down when we compare that
 
04:21:14.269 --> 04:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
to prior to the pandemic you know the
 
04:21:17.330 --> 04:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
pandemic period kind of throws all
 
04:21:20.450 --> 04:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
comparisons out when we look at the fact
 
04:21:23.809 --> 04:21:23.819 align:start position:0%
that we had 175 000 people filing we
 
04:21:25.849 --> 04:21:25.859 align:start position:0%
paid more benefits in two years than we
 
04:21:28.969 --> 04:21:28.979 align:start position:0%
did in the entire prior decade so when
 
04:21:32.450 --> 04:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
we look back at prior to the pandemic
 
04:21:34.429 --> 04:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
and we look at those initial claims New
 
04:21:36.910 --> 04:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is about 40 percent
 
04:21:41.210 --> 04:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
below where we were for initial claim
 
04:21:43.969 --> 04:21:43.979 align:start position:0%
volume compare that to the the country
 
04:21:46.070 --> 04:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
as a whole
 
04:21:49.969 --> 04:21:49.979 align:start position:0%
um not really the case uh nationally in
 
04:21:52.849 --> 04:21:52.859 align:start position:0%
terms of that large of a decline in
 
04:21:55.610 --> 04:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
initial claims nationally down about 10
 
04:21:55.620 --> 04:21:56.469 align:start position:0%
initial claims nationally down about 10
percent

04:21:56.469 --> 04:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:21:58.969 --> 04:21:58.979 align:start position:0%
when we look at
 
04:22:02.389 --> 04:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
weekly claims so payable claims claims
 
04:22:04.910 --> 04:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
that an individual is filing as they
 
04:22:07.490 --> 04:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
continue to be unemployed and seeking
 
04:22:11.389 --> 04:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits those that that
 
04:22:15.290 --> 04:22:15.300 align:start position:0%
volume's about 36 percent below where we
 
04:22:17.750 --> 04:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
were prior to the pandemic that now
 
04:22:20.269 --> 04:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
these both both of these charts are a
 
04:22:22.849 --> 04:22:22.859 align:start position:0%
four-week moving average this data comes
 
04:22:25.370 --> 04:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
out every Thursday
 
04:22:27.110 --> 04:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
um so it's a nice high frequency metric
 
04:22:29.769 --> 04:22:29.779 align:start position:0%
for us to look at and compare against
 
04:22:32.689 --> 04:22:32.699 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic but New Hampshire down 36
 
04:22:35.689 --> 04:22:35.699 align:start position:0%
and weekly weekly claims in the
 
04:22:37.670 --> 04:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
unemployment program you compare that
 
04:22:39.530 --> 04:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
against our neighbor to the South with
 
04:22:41.510 --> 04:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they're down about seven
 
04:22:44.809 --> 04:22:44.819 align:start position:0%
percent and nationally that's down about
 
04:22:48.830 --> 04:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
16 so again New Hampshire is an outlier
 
04:22:52.849 --> 04:22:52.859 align:start position:0%
with regard to the significant decline
 
04:22:55.370 --> 04:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
in utilization of the unemployment
 
04:22:58.969 --> 04:22:58.979 align:start position:0%
program throughout 2022 when we compare
 
04:23:04.729 --> 04:23:04.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:07.790 --> 04:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
um so not only are our claims down in in
 
04:23:09.710 --> 04:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire near record lows but also
 
04:23:13.010 --> 04:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
our duration so the the length of time
 
04:23:15.830 --> 04:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
that someone is filing an unemployment
 
04:23:19.510 --> 04:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
claim that is significantly down as well
 
04:23:21.710 --> 04:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
this slide tries to put that into
 
04:23:23.450 --> 04:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
perspective and you can see that New
 
04:23:25.610 --> 04:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has about the fifth lowest
 
04:23:30.110 --> 04:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
average duration at about 10 weeks we
 
04:23:32.630 --> 04:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
compare that out against our other New
 
04:23:34.010 --> 04:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
England neighbors
 
04:23:35.510 --> 04:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
um and you can see that New Hampshire
 
04:23:35.520 --> 04:23:36.830 align:start position:0%
um and you can see that New Hampshire
really

04:23:36.830 --> 04:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:23:40.010 --> 04:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
um is an outlier in the Northeast for
 
04:23:42.590 --> 04:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
the duration of an average unemployment
 
04:23:48.729 --> 04:23:48.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:52.670 --> 04:23:52.680 align:start position:0%
and getting into some of the other
 
04:23:55.729 --> 04:23:55.739 align:start position:0%
um uh questions about the increased
 
04:23:58.250 --> 04:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
demand for labor
 
04:24:00.290 --> 04:24:00.300 align:start position:0%
um so what you can what you can see here
 
04:24:04.849 --> 04:24:04.859 align:start position:0%
from a quarterly perspective is how uh
 
04:24:06.889 --> 04:24:06.899 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has increased the number
 
04:24:08.769 --> 04:24:08.779 align:start position:0%
of employers
 
04:24:12.110 --> 04:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
going back to prior to the pandemic so
 
04:24:14.389 --> 04:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
these are employers that are providing
 
04:24:16.370 --> 04:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
employment in New Hampshire they
 
04:24:19.670 --> 04:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
register with Employment Security as is
 
04:24:22.309 --> 04:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
required for purposes of their
 
04:24:24.290 --> 04:24:24.300 align:start position:0%
supporting the unemployment program
 
04:24:27.050 --> 04:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
through payment of quarterly taxes so
 
04:24:30.110 --> 04:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
the number of registered employers is up
 
04:24:35.389 --> 04:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
about 14 percent when you look at where
 
04:24:37.250 --> 04:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
we were at the beginning of the pandemic
 
04:24:39.769 --> 04:24:39.779 align:start position:0%
that first quarter of 2020 a little over
 
04:24:43.550 --> 04:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
43 000 registered employers to where we
 
04:24:43.560 --> 04:24:44.410 align:start position:0%
43 000 registered employers to where we
are

04:24:44.410 --> 04:24:44.420 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:24:47.510 --> 04:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
currently based on the this data or up
 
04:24:51.410 --> 04:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
over 52 000 and employers so a lot of
 
04:24:56.330 --> 04:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
additional demand for a tight supply of
 
04:24:56.340 --> 04:25:01.490 align:start position:0%
additional demand for a tight supply of
labor

04:25:01.490 --> 04:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:04.610 --> 04:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
and moving right along
 
04:25:06.769 --> 04:25:06.779 align:start position:0%
looking at the
 
04:25:10.490 --> 04:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
taxes and the overall burden on
 
04:25:13.450 --> 04:25:13.460 align:start position:0%
employers from an unemployment insurance
 
04:25:16.370 --> 04:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
perspective so employers through their
 
04:25:19.189 --> 04:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
payment of quarterly taxes support the
 
04:25:21.050 --> 04:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
unemployment program and the payment of
 
04:25:23.630 --> 04:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
benefits that go out and what we show
 
04:25:27.590 --> 04:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
here is how employer and unemployment
 
04:25:30.710 --> 04:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
taxes what we experience during the
 
04:25:33.769 --> 04:25:33.779 align:start position:0%
pandemic what has occurred since how
 
04:25:35.389 --> 04:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
that compared against the Great
 
04:25:39.729 --> 04:25:39.739 align:start position:0%
Recession and this is all leading to uh
 
04:25:42.830 --> 04:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
kind of trying to show you the pieces
 
04:25:44.630 --> 04:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
that contribute to how our unemployment
 
04:25:47.750 --> 04:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
trust fund is currently doing so here
 
04:25:50.030 --> 04:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
you can see Great Recession Peak tax
 
04:25:52.450 --> 04:25:52.460 align:start position:0%
rate employers were up over
 
04:25:56.689 --> 04:25:56.699 align:start position:0%
3.6 percent that's the rate that they
 
04:25:58.550 --> 04:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
pay on the first fourteen thousand
 
04:26:00.769 --> 04:26:00.779 align:start position:0%
dollars in annual wages paid to each
 
04:26:05.389 --> 04:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
employee so peaked at almost 3.7 percent
 
04:26:10.429 --> 04:26:10.439 align:start position:0%
had four quarters over 3.3 percent for
 
04:26:12.530 --> 04:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
the Great Recession you compare that to
 
04:26:14.389 --> 04:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
04:26:17.450 --> 04:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
um and we peaked it about 2.3 percent so
 
04:26:20.750 --> 04:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
close to 40 percent below our Great
 
04:26:24.170 --> 04:26:24.180 align:start position:0%
Recession Peak and those rates have come
 
04:26:26.870 --> 04:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
down significant significantly and would
 
04:26:30.050 --> 04:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
be down even more if not for the
 
04:26:32.510 --> 04:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
substantial increase in new employers
 
04:26:34.910 --> 04:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
registered with the state and I say that
 
04:26:37.130 --> 04:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
because when a when an employer comes in
 
04:26:39.710 --> 04:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
and registers for the first time setting
 
04:26:41.990 --> 04:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
up their their unemployment account they
 
04:26:44.149 --> 04:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
are automatically signed a new employer
 
04:26:47.510 --> 04:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
tax rate of 2.7 percent
 
04:26:49.910 --> 04:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
um that rate goes up or down based on
 
04:26:51.950 --> 04:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
their experience in their first four
 
04:26:54.889 --> 04:26:54.899 align:start position:0%
quarters but that that many new
 
04:26:57.410 --> 04:26:57.420 align:start position:0%
employers all starting at 2.7 percent
 
04:26:57.420 --> 04:26:59.030 align:start position:0%
employers all starting at 2.7 percent
actually

04:26:59.030 --> 04:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:27:01.849 --> 04:27:01.859 align:start position:0%
um inflates that average uh tax rate
 
04:27:06.170 --> 04:27:06.180 align:start position:0%
that you see here of 1.42 so more
 
04:27:08.090 --> 04:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
established employers are paying at a
 
04:27:11.269 --> 04:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
much lower rate but it looks a little
 
04:27:13.429 --> 04:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
bit higher because the the number of new
 
04:27:15.229 --> 04:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
employers registering at that higher
 
04:27:15.239 --> 04:27:17.570 align:start position:0%
employers registering at that higher
rate

04:27:17.570 --> 04:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:20.990 --> 04:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative how sticky is that 2.7
 
04:27:22.910 --> 04:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
percent how long do they have to be in
 
04:27:24.769 --> 04:27:24.779 align:start position:0%
your good graces before it goes down
 
04:27:28.070 --> 04:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
significantly uh so so they keep that
 
04:27:31.729 --> 04:27:31.739 align:start position:0%
2.7 with with one caveat that I'll
 
04:27:35.330 --> 04:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
explain for the first four quarters
 
04:27:38.330 --> 04:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
um the one caveat is that if there are
 
04:27:43.429 --> 04:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
any uh fund balance of reductions so uh
 
04:27:46.189 --> 04:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
the statutory solvency control for the
 
04:27:49.070 --> 04:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
trust fund which automatically requires
 
04:27:52.130 --> 04:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
a reduction in employer rates based upon
 
04:27:55.070 --> 04:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
the balance in the trust fund if those
 
04:27:57.710 --> 04:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
kick in in any of those four quarters
 
04:28:00.410 --> 04:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
that new employer does benefit from
 
04:28:03.830 --> 04:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
those for instance right now employers
 
04:28:07.429 --> 04:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
are receiving a half Point fund balance
 
04:28:09.349 --> 04:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
reduction because the unemployment trust
 
04:28:09.359 --> 04:28:10.330 align:start position:0%
reduction because the unemployment trust
fund

04:28:10.330 --> 04:28:10.340 align:start position:0%
fund
 
04:28:13.429 --> 04:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
maintained at least a balance of 250
 
04:28:16.370 --> 04:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
million dollars during the third quarter
 
04:28:20.269 --> 04:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
of last year so so and so those positive
 
04:28:22.250 --> 04:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
rated tax paying employers got a half
 
04:28:23.929 --> 04:28:23.939 align:start position:0%
Point reduction in the fourth quarter
 
04:28:25.910 --> 04:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
new employers would also get that so
 
04:28:28.729 --> 04:28:28.739 align:start position:0%
that 2.7 percent employer would be down
 
04:28:31.370 --> 04:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
at 2.2 percent
 
04:28:34.189 --> 04:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
and then uh following years after that
 
04:28:36.590 --> 04:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
that employer's rate is adjusted based
 
04:28:39.110 --> 04:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
on their experience so if they've for
 
04:28:41.090 --> 04:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
some reason had a lot of layoff activity
 
04:28:42.830 --> 04:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
and we've paid out a lot of benefits
 
04:28:45.170 --> 04:28:45.180 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a negative against their
 
04:28:47.630 --> 04:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
experience increasing their rate if they
 
04:28:49.429 --> 04:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
haven't had any layoff activity we
 
04:28:51.649 --> 04:28:51.659 align:start position:0%
haven't paid out any benefits but
 
04:28:54.050 --> 04:28:54.060 align:start position:0%
they've paid their taxes timely then
 
04:28:56.870 --> 04:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's a positive on their rate and that
 
04:28:59.030 --> 04:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
brings down that experience based rate
 
04:29:00.950 --> 04:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
so they would be paying less than that
 
04:29:03.469 --> 04:29:03.479 align:start position:0%
2.7 percent going into that second year
 
04:29:05.269 --> 04:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
of existence
 
04:29:08.149 --> 04:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
representative almond
 
04:29:09.950 --> 04:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:29:14.990 --> 04:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
could um first if you have an employer
 
04:29:18.229 --> 04:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
with one employee say a woman with a
 
04:29:20.210 --> 04:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
nanny uh
 
04:29:22.729 --> 04:29:22.739 align:start position:0%
just are they
 
04:29:25.450 --> 04:29:25.460 align:start position:0%
obliged to register and pay this
 
04:29:28.250 --> 04:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
depending on the the amount of wages
 
04:29:31.070 --> 04:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
that they're paying to that Nanny yes
 
04:29:33.830 --> 04:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
if they say that she's working full-time
 
04:29:35.689 --> 04:29:35.699 align:start position:0%
and she's getting a hundred dollars a
 
04:29:38.450 --> 04:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
month do you do anything about it
 
04:29:40.729 --> 04:29:40.739 align:start position:0%
um so the they don't report to us
 
04:29:43.130 --> 04:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
whether that person is working full-time
 
04:29:44.990 --> 04:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
or part-time that's not part of the
 
04:29:45.000 --> 04:29:46.429 align:start position:0%
or part-time that's not part of the
reporting

04:29:46.429 --> 04:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
04:29:48.469 --> 04:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
um but once they
 
04:29:50.929 --> 04:29:50.939 align:start position:0%
um exceed a certain number of wages paid
 
04:29:52.729 --> 04:29:52.739 align:start position:0%
to that individual they're required to
 
04:29:55.729 --> 04:29:55.739 align:start position:0%
then register and report and pay taxes
 
04:29:58.070 --> 04:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
on those wages thank you a small
 
04:30:01.010 --> 04:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
follow-up a rather a larger follow-up on
 
04:30:05.929 --> 04:30:05.939 align:start position:0%
our on do you have information on how
 
04:30:08.149 --> 04:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
many of the new employers and the
 
04:30:10.790 --> 04:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
Employers in general are have more than
 
04:30:12.590 --> 04:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
10 workers for instance or something
 
04:30:15.950 --> 04:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
like that we do yes we don't have that
 
04:30:18.189 --> 04:30:18.199 align:start position:0%
in in these slides but we can certainly
 
04:30:20.630 --> 04:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
get that to you and get it to the
 
04:30:22.969 --> 04:30:22.979 align:start position:0%
members of the committee whether that's
 
04:30:26.330 --> 04:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
changed between the new people and what
 
04:30:33.349 --> 04:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:36.889 --> 04:30:36.899 align:start position:0%
um and so moving on here
 
04:30:36.899 --> 04:30:38.689 align:start position:0%
um and so moving on here
um

04:30:38.689 --> 04:30:38.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:41.870 --> 04:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
looking at overall tax burden so each
 
04:30:45.229 --> 04:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
state has a slightly different uh
 
04:30:47.030 --> 04:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance tax system
 
04:30:50.389 --> 04:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
different taxable wage bases experience
 
04:30:52.370 --> 04:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
is factored differently from state to
 
04:30:54.410 --> 04:30:54.420 align:start position:0%
state so a great way to compare one
 
04:30:57.349 --> 04:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
state to the the next in terms of how
 
04:30:59.809 --> 04:30:59.819 align:start position:0%
much of a overall tax burden is
 
04:31:01.490 --> 04:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
attributed to on an unemployment
 
04:31:03.410 --> 04:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
insurance taxes we look at total
 
04:31:06.290 --> 04:31:06.300 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance taxes paid as a
 
04:31:09.170 --> 04:31:09.180 align:start position:0%
comparison against total wages paid and
 
04:31:11.389 --> 04:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
here you can see New Hampshire
 
04:31:13.910 --> 04:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
um in that in the red bar at about a
 
04:31:17.389 --> 04:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
point four percent and how that compares
 
04:31:20.510 --> 04:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
to other states in the Northeast again
 
04:31:23.570 --> 04:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Stacks up very well with
 
04:31:27.050 --> 04:31:27.060 align:start position:0%
uh with our neighboring states from an
 
04:31:30.050 --> 04:31:30.060 align:start position:0%
overall tax burden perspective for how
 
04:31:31.429 --> 04:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
much employers are required to
 
04:31:33.229 --> 04:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
contribute to the functioning of the
 
04:31:37.010 --> 04:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:37.020 --> 04:31:38.450 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:31:38.450 --> 04:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:31:40.250 --> 04:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
um last slide for me and then I'll turn
 
04:31:42.170 --> 04:31:42.180 align:start position:0%
it over to Brian but all of those
 
04:31:45.950 --> 04:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
factors so increase in employers
 
04:31:45.960 --> 04:31:46.610 align:start position:0%
factors so increase in employers
um

04:31:46.610 --> 04:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:49.610 --> 04:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
low number of claims being filed low
 
04:31:53.389 --> 04:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
duration of claims being filed you can
 
04:31:55.790 --> 04:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
see all of that contributes to the
 
04:31:58.670 --> 04:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
overall health of the unemployment trust
 
04:32:03.290 --> 04:32:03.300 align:start position:0%
fund right now we're at about 357
 
04:32:04.790 --> 04:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
04:32:07.429 --> 04:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
in that account we started the pandemic
 
04:32:11.570 --> 04:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
at right at 300 million dollars we have
 
04:32:15.170 --> 04:32:15.180 align:start position:0%
benefited uh from uh federal dollars
 
04:32:15.180 --> 04:32:16.149 align:start position:0%
benefited uh from uh federal dollars
Federal

04:32:16.149 --> 04:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
04:32:20.050 --> 04:32:20.060 align:start position:0%
cares act money that has been
 
04:32:23.330 --> 04:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
deposited into the trust fund that was
 
04:32:25.729 --> 04:32:25.739 align:start position:0%
originally designated for other uses not
 
04:32:29.149 --> 04:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
used for those other other programs but
 
04:32:31.010 --> 04:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
rather than those dollars go back to the
 
04:32:33.110 --> 04:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
feds those dollars have been waterfalled
 
04:32:34.969 --> 04:32:34.979 align:start position:0%
into the unemployment trust fund that's
 
04:32:37.309 --> 04:32:37.319 align:start position:0%
about 109 million dollars that's gone
 
04:32:39.469 --> 04:32:39.479 align:start position:0%
into the trust fund so right now we're
 
04:32:42.170 --> 04:32:42.180 align:start position:0%
at 357 million
 
04:32:45.229 --> 04:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
um and important to note that that
 
04:32:49.849 --> 04:32:49.859 align:start position:0%
balance and that that speedy recovery in
 
04:32:52.010 --> 04:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
the unemployment trust fund has led to
 
04:32:54.710 --> 04:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
employers getting a tax rate reduction
 
04:32:57.349 --> 04:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
much faster than originally anticipated
 
04:32:59.990 --> 04:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
so because the unemployment trust fund
 
04:33:03.110 --> 04:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
reached and maintained a balance of 250
 
04:33:05.090 --> 04:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
million dollars during the Third third
 
04:33:08.390 --> 04:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
quarter of 2022 employers started
 
04:33:11.090 --> 04:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
receiving a reduction of a half point to
 
04:33:13.910 --> 04:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
their rate so that 2.7 percent employer
 
04:33:16.070 --> 04:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
new employer got their rate knocked down
 
04:33:19.910 --> 04:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
to 2.2 percent uh for the fourth quarter
 
04:33:22.189 --> 04:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
they will also have that same rate
 
04:33:24.051 --> 04:33:24.061 align:start position:0%
reduction for the first quarter that
 
04:33:27.170 --> 04:33:27.180 align:start position:0%
we're currently in the savings that are
 
04:33:30.289 --> 04:33:30.299 align:start position:0%
forecast for the that rate reduction for
 
04:33:32.330 --> 04:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
employers over the course of those two
 
04:33:35.570 --> 04:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
quarters is about 28 million dollars in
 
04:33:38.510 --> 04:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
savings because of the accelerated pace
 
04:33:41.269 --> 04:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
which the trust fund has recovered
 
04:33:44.631 --> 04:33:44.641 align:start position:0%
um and now it's further contributing to
 
04:33:47.269 --> 04:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
reducing those rates making it less
 
04:33:49.131 --> 04:33:49.141 align:start position:0%
expensive for those employers to hire
 
04:33:50.570 --> 04:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
because every employee that they bring
 
04:33:53.631 --> 04:33:53.641 align:start position:0%
on comes with that cost of paying their
 
04:33:55.730 --> 04:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance taxes for the
 
04:33:58.070 --> 04:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
first fourteen thousand dollars in
 
04:34:00.109 --> 04:34:00.119 align:start position:0%
annual wages to that employee so all of
 
04:34:03.529 --> 04:34:03.539 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:05.449 --> 04:34:05.459 align:start position:0%
uh making things a little bit more
 
04:34:07.429 --> 04:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
affordable for that employer so I'll
 
04:34:09.769 --> 04:34:09.779 align:start position:0%
turn it over to Brian now to go on the
 
04:34:11.990 --> 04:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
next slide we have a few questions if we
 
04:34:13.131 --> 04:34:13.141 align:start position:0%
could just see if we can address those
 
04:34:14.929 --> 04:34:14.939 align:start position:0%
first behind you representative McGuire
 
04:34:16.551 --> 04:34:16.561 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:34:20.810 --> 04:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:22.551 --> 04:34:22.561 align:start position:0%
um I know we in the past we haven't
 
04:34:24.709 --> 04:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
compared very favorably to other states
 
04:34:28.670 --> 04:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
on that regard can you talk about that
 
04:34:31.730 --> 04:34:31.740 align:start position:0%
um we are are not involved in the
 
04:34:33.051 --> 04:34:33.061 align:start position:0%
administration of the workers comp
 
04:34:35.929 --> 04:34:35.939 align:start position:0%
program so we're strictly in the
 
04:34:37.730 --> 04:34:37.740 align:start position:0%
Unemployment Compensation Program so
 
04:34:40.970 --> 04:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
workers comp is managed by the State
 
04:34:43.910 --> 04:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor so any questions
 
04:34:46.609 --> 04:34:46.619 align:start position:0%
that we have on that have to defer to
 
04:34:49.429 --> 04:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
those folks
 
04:34:51.650 --> 04:34:51.660 align:start position:0%
representative Platt yes earlier a
 
04:34:54.590 --> 04:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
discussion about quit rate uh people
 
04:34:56.510 --> 04:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
voluntarily leaving the labor force how
 
04:34:59.150 --> 04:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
do you know you you survey employers
 
04:35:01.310 --> 04:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't show up in the
 
04:35:04.131 --> 04:35:04.141 align:start position:0%
unemployment lines yeah the um U.S
 
04:35:05.869 --> 04:35:05.879 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Labor Statistics does a
 
04:35:08.689 --> 04:35:08.699 align:start position:0%
monthly survey of employers including
 
04:35:11.449 --> 04:35:11.459 align:start position:0%
Employers in New Hampshire so the quit
 
04:35:16.849 --> 04:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:18.890 --> 04:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
representative picture
 
04:35:20.269 --> 04:35:20.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:35:22.490 --> 04:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh we heard this
 
04:35:24.529 --> 04:35:24.539 align:start position:0%
morning that New Hampshire's participate
 
04:35:27.609 --> 04:35:27.619 align:start position:0%
participation rate was around 62 percent
 
04:35:30.410 --> 04:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
nationally it's a little over 70 percent
 
04:35:33.529 --> 04:35:33.539 align:start position:0%
why is there such a actually it's not
 
04:35:35.390 --> 04:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
accurate New Hampshire has a higher
 
04:35:37.910 --> 04:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
labor force participation rate we're
 
04:35:41.750 --> 04:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
just under 65 around 65 percent we have
 
04:35:45.470 --> 04:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
been as high as 68 at the peak and labor
 
04:35:47.209 --> 04:35:47.219 align:start position:0%
force participation rate by the way is
 
04:35:50.090 --> 04:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
is in part a function of whether people
 
04:35:51.890 --> 04:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
want to be in the labor force but it's
 
04:35:54.230 --> 04:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
also a function of the demographics of a
 
04:35:54.240 --> 04:35:55.150 align:start position:0%
also a function of the demographics of a
state

04:35:55.150 --> 04:35:55.160 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:35:59.029 --> 04:35:59.039 align:start position:0%
people who are very young have lower
 
04:36:00.949 --> 04:36:00.959 align:start position:0%
participation rates and people who are
 
04:36:00.959 --> 04:36:02.470 align:start position:0%
participation rates and people who are
older

04:36:02.470 --> 04:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
older
 
04:36:05.929 --> 04:36:05.939 align:start position:0%
once get Beyond age 55 participation
 
04:36:09.410 --> 04:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
rate begins to to slip so depending on
 
04:36:10.970 --> 04:36:10.980 align:start position:0%
your demographics you're going to have a
 
04:36:14.209 --> 04:36:14.219 align:start position:0%
higher or lower also it depends on some
 
04:36:15.189 --> 04:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:36:17.090 --> 04:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic characteristics of a
 
04:36:18.949 --> 04:36:18.959 align:start position:0%
community New Hampshire is about 65
 
04:36:21.289 --> 04:36:21.299 align:start position:0%
percent nationally it's about 62 percent
 
04:36:24.590 --> 04:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
it has declined in the nation it's
 
04:36:28.250 --> 04:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:32.029 --> 04:36:32.039 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:36:35.090 --> 04:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
put a more finer point on that that
 
04:36:38.449 --> 04:36:38.459 align:start position:0%
is that a 65 is that the difference
 
04:36:41.449 --> 04:36:41.459 align:start position:0%
between 65 100 are those the people that
 
04:36:43.670 --> 04:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
are not in the labor force choose not to
 
04:36:44.929 --> 04:36:44.939 align:start position:0%
be in the labor force have given up
 
04:36:47.029 --> 04:36:47.039 align:start position:0%
looking for a job that that sort of
 
04:36:49.970 --> 04:36:49.980 align:start position:0%
thing yeah uh the the way the measure is
 
04:36:53.510 --> 04:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
calculated is basically you have to be
 
04:36:57.470 --> 04:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
either employed or actively looking for
 
04:36:59.750 --> 04:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
work and actively looking for work means
 
04:37:02.029 --> 04:37:02.039 align:start position:0%
in the prior month have you have you
 
04:37:04.429 --> 04:37:04.439 align:start position:0%
searched for a job so you will have
 
04:37:07.250 --> 04:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
people who are marginally attached maybe
 
04:37:08.990 --> 04:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
occasionally work
 
04:37:11.330 --> 04:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
um throughout the year they could be
 
04:37:13.131 --> 04:37:13.141 align:start position:0%
surveyed and indicate that they're not
 
04:37:16.310 --> 04:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
in the labor force and it's also a
 
04:37:20.209 --> 04:37:20.219 align:start position:0%
measured traditionally by ages 16 and
 
04:37:23.449 --> 04:37:23.459 align:start position:0%
above so again if you're counting
 
04:37:26.209 --> 04:37:26.219 align:start position:0%
everybody age 16 and above the higher
 
04:37:28.730 --> 04:37:28.740 align:start position:0%
percentage you have in the upper age of
 
04:37:32.990 --> 04:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
range so above 65 above 75 you're going
 
04:37:36.529 --> 04:37:36.539 align:start position:0%
to have a lower participation rate there
 
04:37:39.051 --> 04:37:39.061 align:start position:0%
we have a number of slides that look at
 
04:37:40.789 --> 04:37:40.799 align:start position:0%
the details of and rich is going to talk
 
04:37:43.490 --> 04:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
about those details of how it's changed
 
04:37:46.250 --> 04:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
by demographic group and that's really I
 
04:37:48.650 --> 04:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
think instructive of of some of the
 
04:37:50.449 --> 04:37:50.459 align:start position:0%
things that are going on here but I do
 
04:37:52.789 --> 04:37:52.799 align:start position:0%
want to move a little bit to kind of
 
04:37:55.970 --> 04:37:55.980 align:start position:0%
where the trends are at the moment and
 
04:37:58.609 --> 04:37:58.619 align:start position:0%
this is a chart that looks at job
 
04:38:01.490 --> 04:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
openings again employers are surveyed
 
04:38:03.709 --> 04:38:03.719 align:start position:0%
and asked about the number of open
 
04:38:05.150 --> 04:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
positions that they have that they're
 
04:38:08.390 --> 04:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
actively searching for and this chart
 
04:38:10.551 --> 04:38:10.561 align:start position:0%
Compares New Hampshire is always the red
 
04:38:12.590 --> 04:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
line Massachusetts when we compare them
 
04:38:15.470 --> 04:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
the Blue Line U.S the black line and
 
04:38:18.769 --> 04:38:18.779 align:start position:0%
what you see is as the recession
 
04:38:21.551 --> 04:38:21.561 align:start position:0%
um started to ease
 
04:38:24.349 --> 04:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
the job openings rate jumped and it
 
04:38:25.670 --> 04:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
jumped for a couple of reasons one
 
04:38:27.769 --> 04:38:27.779 align:start position:0%
initially a lot of people left the labor
 
04:38:27.779 --> 04:38:28.789 align:start position:0%
initially a lot of people left the labor
market

04:38:28.789 --> 04:38:28.799 align:start position:0%
market
 
04:38:31.189 --> 04:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
um during the pandemic but also there
 
04:38:33.109 --> 04:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
was a tremendous increase in the quit
 
04:38:36.830 --> 04:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
rate the churning people were switching
 
04:38:38.390 --> 04:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
occupations they were switching
 
04:38:41.330 --> 04:38:41.340 align:start position:0%
Industries so even if you weren't adding
 
04:38:44.029 --> 04:38:44.039 align:start position:0%
new jobs there was a tremendous need to
 
04:38:45.890 --> 04:38:45.900 align:start position:0%
hire because there was just a lot of
 
04:38:48.051 --> 04:38:48.061 align:start position:0%
churn in the labor market and churn in
 
04:38:49.849 --> 04:38:49.859 align:start position:0%
the labor market is problem for
 
04:38:51.470 --> 04:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
everybody it's a problem for businesses
 
04:38:54.529 --> 04:38:54.539 align:start position:0%
very costly so those quit rates by the
 
04:38:56.631 --> 04:38:56.641 align:start position:0%
way are starting to ease but quit rates
 
04:38:58.670 --> 04:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
are usually a sign High quit rates are
 
04:39:00.051 --> 04:39:00.061 align:start position:0%
usually a sign that there's a lot of
 
04:39:02.150 --> 04:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities out there and there was
 
04:39:04.849 --> 04:39:04.859 align:start position:0%
there was following the worst of the
 
04:39:07.929 --> 04:39:07.939 align:start position:0%
pandemic employers were raising wages
 
04:39:10.310 --> 04:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
employees were emboldened looking for
 
04:39:11.929 --> 04:39:11.939 align:start position:0%
better opportunities better working
 
04:39:13.310 --> 04:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
conditions so there was a lot of
 
04:39:13.320 --> 04:39:14.330 align:start position:0%
conditions so there was a lot of
turnover

04:39:14.330 --> 04:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
turnover
 
04:39:17.810 --> 04:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
that said New Hampshire had higher job
 
04:39:20.570 --> 04:39:20.580 align:start position:0%
openings rate for much of the post
 
04:39:22.750 --> 04:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic if there is such a thing period
 
04:39:25.369 --> 04:39:25.379 align:start position:0%
it has come down
 
04:39:28.551 --> 04:39:28.561 align:start position:0%
it's come down everywhere but it's still
 
04:39:32.029 --> 04:39:32.039 align:start position:0%
very strong it's still above what it was
 
04:39:34.369 --> 04:39:34.379 align:start position:0%
if I go back another 10 or 15 years
 
04:39:36.230 --> 04:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
you'll see that that rate is
 
04:39:39.170 --> 04:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
traditionally much lower than it is now
 
04:39:41.930 --> 04:39:41.940 align:start position:0%
and this is we talked a little bit about
 
04:39:43.850 --> 04:39:43.860 align:start position:0%
the kinds of occupations that are in
 
04:39:46.788 --> 04:39:46.798 align:start position:0%
demand this is a really busy chart I
 
04:39:48.530 --> 04:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
apologize for that this is one you know
 
04:39:50.750 --> 04:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
before bedtime as a substitute for a
 
04:39:53.208 --> 04:39:53.218 align:start position:0%
mild sedative or a stiff drink you you
 
04:39:57.130 --> 04:39:57.140 align:start position:0%
might you might take a look at um
 
04:40:00.770 --> 04:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
uh but some of the occupations that are
 
04:40:02.750 --> 04:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
highlighted here in red just gets at
 
04:40:04.430 --> 04:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
that one issue that we talked about the
 
04:40:06.530 --> 04:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
medical professions medical occupations
 
04:40:08.990 --> 04:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
they have traditionally been among the
 
04:40:11.330 --> 04:40:11.340 align:start position:0%
highest in demand and this compares
 
04:40:14.750 --> 04:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
the same period in 2019 September
 
04:40:17.570 --> 04:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
through November to September through
 
04:40:20.810 --> 04:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
November of 2022 and the number and
 
04:40:23.930 --> 04:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
change in the demand or the job postings
 
04:40:25.610 --> 04:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for those occupations
 
04:40:28.490 --> 04:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
and you see the tremendous jump in the
 
04:40:30.170 --> 04:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
percentage both the numbers and
 
04:40:32.868 --> 04:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
percentage there so across the board
 
04:40:35.868 --> 04:40:35.878 align:start position:0%
strong demand in a number of occupations
 
04:40:39.050 --> 04:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:41.810 --> 04:40:41.820 align:start position:0%
um that's oh was there a question yes if
 
04:40:47.570 --> 04:40:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:51.350 --> 04:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards behind you
 
04:40:54.410 --> 04:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
I uh on the previous slide
 
04:40:57.170 --> 04:40:57.180 align:start position:0%
um I noticed healthcare workers have a
 
04:40:59.630 --> 04:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
very high growth rate
 
04:41:02.448 --> 04:41:02.458 align:start position:0%
um overall I'm just curious if your kept
 
04:41:05.448 --> 04:41:05.458 align:start position:0%
any statistics on it okay how many of
 
04:41:09.770 --> 04:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
those uh 2022 openings are driven
 
04:41:13.430 --> 04:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
because they're replacing workers who
 
04:41:15.708 --> 04:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
were forced out over mandatory vaccine
 
04:41:15.718 --> 04:41:17.690 align:start position:0%
were forced out over mandatory vaccine
policies

04:41:17.690 --> 04:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
policies
 
04:41:22.550 --> 04:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
well well uh let I'll I'll well beyond
 
04:41:25.430 --> 04:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
my uh pay grade um we don't have that I
 
04:41:27.830 --> 04:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
don't have any of that data
 
04:41:30.890 --> 04:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
um so this this data set doesn't capture
 
04:41:33.948 --> 04:41:33.958 align:start position:0%
that however we do know from
 
04:41:36.830 --> 04:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
um unemployment claim filings uh that
 
04:41:39.650 --> 04:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
they were very very few unemployment
 
04:41:42.890 --> 04:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
claims filed by individuals that uh lost
 
04:41:46.368 --> 04:41:46.378 align:start position:0%
employment due to a vaccine requirement
 
04:41:48.948 --> 04:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:41:51.410 --> 04:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
I'm taking a look at the the actual
 
04:41:54.530 --> 04:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
Trends in job growth this is um a year
 
04:41:57.830 --> 04:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
Compares year over year job growth um on
 
04:41:59.990 --> 04:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
a three-month moving average so New
 
04:42:01.670 --> 04:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right now as of through
 
04:42:04.250 --> 04:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
November our December numbers will be
 
04:42:06.110 --> 04:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
coming out next week
 
04:42:07.850 --> 04:42:07.860 align:start position:0%
um we're about two and a half percent
 
04:42:10.010 --> 04:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
two point six percent
 
04:42:12.550 --> 04:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
um private sector job growth
 
04:42:15.830 --> 04:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
compared to the US which is a little bit
 
04:42:17.930 --> 04:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
higher I do not believe that it is
 
04:42:19.610 --> 04:42:19.620 align:start position:0%
because we have a weaker economy than
 
04:42:21.050 --> 04:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
the national economy I believe it is
 
04:42:23.930 --> 04:42:23.940 align:start position:0%
because we are more labor constrained we
 
04:42:25.850 --> 04:42:25.860 align:start position:0%
have had a tighter labor market and I'll
 
04:42:28.250 --> 04:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
show you a number of
 
04:42:30.770 --> 04:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
charts that will that will support that
 
04:42:34.190 --> 04:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
in 2021 we had faster job growth in the
 
04:42:36.670 --> 04:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
U.S significantly faster
 
04:42:38.690 --> 04:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
significantly faster in the private
 
04:42:41.030 --> 04:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
sector but also total non-farm job
 
04:42:41.040 --> 04:42:42.110 align:start position:0%
sector but also total non-farm job
growth

04:42:42.110 --> 04:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
growth
 
04:42:44.510 --> 04:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
this by the way is is Good from one
 
04:42:46.430 --> 04:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
perspective the Federal Reserve is can
 
04:42:48.170 --> 04:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
very concerned about inflation it wants
 
04:42:50.030 --> 04:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
to see the labor market slow down
 
04:42:52.550 --> 04:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to see job losses but it
 
04:42:54.590 --> 04:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
wants to see it slow down because it's
 
04:42:58.190 --> 04:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
concerned about wage wages Rising
 
04:43:01.070 --> 04:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
rapidly and contributing to inflation so
 
04:43:05.628 --> 04:43:05.638 align:start position:0%
this is actually a fairly positive trend
 
04:43:08.448 --> 04:43:08.458 align:start position:0%
um looking at again I say New Hampshire
 
04:43:11.030 --> 04:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
is not a weaker economy it is just more
 
04:43:13.310 --> 04:43:13.320 align:start position:0%
labor constrained and this is one way I
 
04:43:15.770 --> 04:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
measure that again businesses are
 
04:43:18.410 --> 04:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
surveyed every month how many job
 
04:43:20.570 --> 04:43:20.580 align:start position:0%
openings they have and how many people
 
04:43:23.390 --> 04:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
have they hired and that's measured here
 
04:43:26.750 --> 04:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
as a rate so the job openings rate is
 
04:43:28.490 --> 04:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
the number of openings plus the number
 
04:43:31.190 --> 04:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
of people employed in total divided by
 
04:43:34.310 --> 04:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
that combination of numbers so the
 
04:43:37.368 --> 04:43:37.378 align:start position:0%
openings rate compared to the hiring
 
04:43:40.128 --> 04:43:40.138 align:start position:0%
rate is the gap it's the Delta between
 
04:43:42.650 --> 04:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
how many jobs are available and how many
 
04:43:46.670 --> 04:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
and the ability to to hire people for
 
04:43:49.070 --> 04:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
those jobs and what you see here it
 
04:43:50.930 --> 04:43:50.940 align:start position:0%
jumped again dramatically after the
 
04:43:52.970 --> 04:43:52.980 align:start position:0%
pandemic indicating the difficulty that
 
04:43:56.208 --> 04:43:56.218 align:start position:0%
employers have had hiring it was more
 
04:43:58.910 --> 04:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
difficult for most of this time period
 
04:44:02.330 --> 04:44:02.340 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire employers to hire it
 
04:44:04.730 --> 04:44:04.740 align:start position:0%
is coming down a bit it's coming down
 
04:44:08.448 --> 04:44:08.458 align:start position:0%
bit because again openings are starting
 
04:44:10.730 --> 04:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
to ease there's businesses are becoming
 
04:44:11.690 --> 04:44:11.700 align:start position:0%
a little bit more concerned about
 
04:44:14.150 --> 04:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
economic prospects moving forward so
 
04:44:15.708 --> 04:44:15.718 align:start position:0%
they're cutting back a little bit on
 
04:44:19.610 --> 04:44:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:22.070 --> 04:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
big issue that we Face here in New
 
04:44:23.868 --> 04:44:23.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think the number one issue
 
04:44:25.490 --> 04:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
that our economy faces is what's
 
04:44:27.830 --> 04:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
happening with the labor force and our
 
04:44:31.070 --> 04:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
ability to get more people back into the
 
04:44:33.410 --> 04:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
labor force or do people who haven't
 
04:44:35.448 --> 04:44:35.458 align:start position:0%
been into the labor force in the labor
 
04:44:38.270 --> 04:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
force this chart again New Hampshire the
 
04:44:41.510 --> 04:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
red line U.S black Massachusetts blue
 
04:44:44.030 --> 04:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
just indicates compared to the
 
04:44:47.448 --> 04:44:47.458 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic peak labor force number of
 
04:44:49.788 --> 04:44:49.798 align:start position:0%
people in the labor force set a number
 
04:44:51.410 --> 04:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
of 100
 
04:44:54.350 --> 04:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
how has it changed and where is it
 
04:44:57.650 --> 04:44:57.660 align:start position:0%
compared to that Peak number so the US
 
04:45:01.490 --> 04:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
is back in terms of numbers it to its
 
04:45:03.948 --> 04:45:03.958 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic peak not participation rate
 
04:45:06.230 --> 04:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
but because there's more people even
 
04:45:08.090 --> 04:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
with a lower rate it can have the same
 
04:45:09.650 --> 04:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
number of people it has in the labor
 
04:45:11.930 --> 04:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
forces it did prior to the pandemic New
 
04:45:14.090 --> 04:45:14.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not there yet we're still
 
04:45:16.310 --> 04:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
about one percent below our Peak and to
 
04:45:18.708 --> 04:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
put that into numbers that's almost 8
 
04:45:22.070 --> 04:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
000 people fewer than we had and our
 
04:45:24.128 --> 04:45:24.138 align:start position:0%
Peak which was November of
 
04:45:26.868 --> 04:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
2019. Massachusetts is going in the
 
04:45:28.368 --> 04:45:28.378 align:start position:0%
opposite direction the wrong direction
 
04:45:30.410 --> 04:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire by the way took us a long
 
04:45:32.030 --> 04:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
time to start picking up but we are
 
04:45:34.430 --> 04:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
picking up we're seeing some pretty good
 
04:45:36.770 --> 04:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
uh labor force growth over the last
 
04:45:40.310 --> 04:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:42.708 --> 04:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
um this is a extremely nerdy chart I
 
04:45:45.050 --> 04:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
apologize it takes some time but it's my
 
04:45:46.730 --> 04:45:46.740 align:start position:0%
favorite measure of how tight the labor
 
04:45:47.810 --> 04:45:47.820 align:start position:0%
market is
 
04:45:50.090 --> 04:45:50.100 align:start position:0%
most people look at the unemployment
 
04:45:53.390 --> 04:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
rate as the measure of how tight the
 
04:45:55.788 --> 04:45:55.798 align:start position:0%
labor market is but that's in part a
 
04:45:58.670 --> 04:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
function of how many people are actively
 
04:46:01.190 --> 04:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
looking for work it's not necessarily an
 
04:46:03.310 --> 04:46:03.320 align:start position:0%
indicator of how many jobs are available
 
04:46:06.590 --> 04:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
this measure is the employment the
 
04:46:08.810 --> 04:46:08.820 align:start position:0%
population ratio among what is
 
04:46:10.670 --> 04:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
considered the prime working age group
 
04:46:13.550 --> 04:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
age 25 to 54. this is the age group that
 
04:46:15.890 --> 04:46:15.900 align:start position:0%
has the by far the highest labor force
 
04:46:19.010 --> 04:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
participation almost you know 90 percent
 
04:46:21.410 --> 04:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
or more people in that age group are in
 
04:46:22.910 --> 04:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
the labor force
 
04:46:25.570 --> 04:46:25.580 align:start position:0%
so when
 
04:46:28.550 --> 04:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
85 percent of those people in that age
 
04:46:31.310 --> 04:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
group are employed in New Hampshire I
 
04:46:33.288 --> 04:46:33.298 align:start position:0%
consider that full employment and this
 
04:46:35.330 --> 04:46:35.340 align:start position:0%
chart shows you time periods where we've
 
04:46:38.448 --> 04:46:38.458 align:start position:0%
been above that 85 percent those are
 
04:46:41.448 --> 04:46:41.458 align:start position:0%
periods of pretty severe labor shortage
 
04:46:43.670 --> 04:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
just before the pandemic we knew we had
 
04:46:46.670 --> 04:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
a real significant labor shortages back
 
04:46:49.010 --> 04:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
in the late 90s we had really severe
 
04:46:50.510 --> 04:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
labor shortages
 
04:46:52.670 --> 04:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
in contrast following the Great
 
04:46:55.070 --> 04:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
Recession you see it dipped well below
 
04:46:56.930 --> 04:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
that's that seven year period that rich
 
04:47:00.530 --> 04:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
mentioned in terms of getting back to to
 
04:47:03.770 --> 04:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
um recovering all of the jobs so we
 
04:47:06.590 --> 04:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
follow like the U.S fell during the
 
04:47:08.208 --> 04:47:08.218 align:start position:0%
pandemics the US by the way has a
 
04:47:10.490 --> 04:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
different demographic so their full
 
04:47:13.190 --> 04:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
employment is about 80 percent
 
04:47:15.770 --> 04:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
um but New Hampshire importantly is well
 
04:47:19.550 --> 04:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
below that 85 what that says to me we've
 
04:47:21.590 --> 04:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
got a lot of people who are on this on
 
04:47:23.090 --> 04:47:23.100 align:start position:0%
the sidelines so what I talk to
 
04:47:24.708 --> 04:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
businesses and they say oh we've got a
 
04:47:27.410 --> 04:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
2.6 unemployment rate there's nobody to
 
04:47:31.670 --> 04:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
hire I say no we have this is capacity
 
04:47:34.310 --> 04:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
utilization we are under utilizing the
 
04:47:35.990 --> 04:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
capacity of our labor force right now
 
04:47:39.890 --> 04:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
and our job is really to make that labor
 
04:47:43.070 --> 04:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
for increase the capacity of utilization
 
04:47:45.288 --> 04:47:45.298 align:start position:0%
of our labor force as much as it is
 
04:47:47.030 --> 04:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
getting those unemployed people which we
 
04:47:49.310 --> 04:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
know is is a small number getting those
 
04:47:51.110 --> 04:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
people on the sidelines into the into
 
04:47:55.070 --> 04:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:57.770 --> 04:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
this may be impossible to answer but as
 
04:47:59.868 --> 04:47:59.878 align:start position:0%
part of the problem less than full
 
04:48:01.850 --> 04:48:01.860 align:start position:0%
employment is employers that are overly
 
04:48:04.690 --> 04:48:04.700 align:start position:0%
picky with the requirements
 
04:48:07.610 --> 04:48:07.620 align:start position:0%
and maybe soften a little bit and do a
 
04:48:10.368 --> 04:48:10.378 align:start position:0%
little in-person training
 
04:48:12.830 --> 04:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
that's a good question I don't know
 
04:48:15.050 --> 04:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
um I I this is one of those when you
 
04:48:20.690 --> 04:48:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:22.550 --> 04:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
um I think employers have learned some
 
04:48:25.128 --> 04:48:25.138 align:start position:0%
good lessons about the the problems that
 
04:48:26.690 --> 04:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
they create for themselves about being
 
04:48:29.570 --> 04:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
overly picky as you've described it and
 
04:48:32.330 --> 04:48:32.340 align:start position:0%
also being slow to higher being slow to
 
04:48:34.850 --> 04:48:34.860 align:start position:0%
make decisions and and the more
 
04:48:37.250 --> 04:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
successful employers the employers that
 
04:48:39.230 --> 04:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
have gained employment the sectors that
 
04:48:41.390 --> 04:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
have gained employment because there's
 
04:48:43.010 --> 04:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
been some real success stories
 
04:48:45.530 --> 04:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic they've they've
 
04:48:47.628 --> 04:48:47.638 align:start position:0%
adjusted how they go about doing the
 
04:48:51.470 --> 04:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
hiring but certainly the old school way
 
04:48:53.750 --> 04:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
of thinking in terms of constantly
 
04:48:56.990 --> 04:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
looking at degrees and less focus on
 
04:49:01.250 --> 04:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
skill sets is something that employers
 
04:49:03.470 --> 04:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
are really taking a second look at need
 
04:49:06.490 --> 04:49:06.500 align:start position:0%
to to take a second look at in terms of
 
04:49:09.470 --> 04:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
overly limiting their candidate pools
 
04:49:12.470 --> 04:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
and needing to be more focused on skills
 
04:49:16.788 --> 04:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
rather than degrees but some some of
 
04:49:19.550 --> 04:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
that sure employers being overly picky
 
04:49:22.730 --> 04:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
but uh that uh I think they've learned
 
04:49:25.730 --> 04:49:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:25.740 --> 04:49:32.090 align:start position:0%
 
representatively

04:49:32.090 --> 04:49:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:33.708 --> 04:49:33.718 align:start position:0%
I mean our state and neighboring states
 
04:49:36.590 --> 04:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
but my second thought was
 
04:49:38.750 --> 04:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
is if this is
 
04:49:41.270 --> 04:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
based on population of people living in
 
04:49:42.770 --> 04:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:49:45.110 --> 04:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
um is it possible more folks have chosen
 
04:49:47.750 --> 04:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
to work in neighboring states and so
 
04:49:49.730 --> 04:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
that these folks might have jobs that
 
04:49:52.550 --> 04:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
would be captured in this because
 
04:49:55.430 --> 04:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
04:49:58.550 --> 04:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
there's two surveys of employment one is
 
04:50:01.550 --> 04:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
done of for Employers in New Hampshire
 
04:50:03.288 --> 04:50:03.298 align:start position:0%
and that measures the number of people
 
04:50:05.090 --> 04:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
who are actually employed in
 
04:50:06.948 --> 04:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
organizations in New Hampshire then
 
04:50:09.530 --> 04:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
there's a household survey which is what
 
04:50:11.750 --> 04:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
the labor force estimates and the
 
04:50:13.070 --> 04:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate are based on that
 
04:50:16.730 --> 04:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
basically calls households and asks
 
04:50:20.030 --> 04:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
people whether they're employed whether
 
04:50:22.850 --> 04:50:22.860 align:start position:0%
they're looking for work a whole host of
 
04:50:25.550 --> 04:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
other issues so this measure of
 
04:50:27.230 --> 04:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
employment to population
 
04:50:29.930 --> 04:50:29.940 align:start position:0%
is irrespective of where anybody is
 
04:50:29.940 --> 04:50:33.590 align:start position:0%
is irrespective of where anybody is
employed

04:50:33.590 --> 04:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:36.770 --> 04:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
but that to kind of go back to Brian's
 
04:50:38.868 --> 04:50:38.878 align:start position:0%
statement about the measure that looks
 
04:50:41.628 --> 04:50:41.638 align:start position:0%
at actual private sector jobs so those
 
04:50:43.788 --> 04:50:43.798 align:start position:0%
are New Hampshire jobs
 
04:50:45.350 --> 04:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
um and when you look at the the
 
04:50:47.270 --> 04:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
information that we have in here you see
 
04:50:49.850 --> 04:50:49.860 align:start position:0%
that those are those are the the jobs
 
04:50:52.368 --> 04:50:52.378 align:start position:0%
that are up over where they were prior
 
04:50:54.110 --> 04:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
to the pandemic and we know those are
 
04:50:56.330 --> 04:50:56.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire based so that's up about a
 
04:50:58.490 --> 04:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
little over one percent and that's a
 
04:50:59.930 --> 04:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
great point because sometimes you will
 
04:51:02.628 --> 04:51:02.638 align:start position:0%
see reports in the media that say
 
04:51:05.570 --> 04:51:05.580 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire lost X number of jobs
 
04:51:07.010 --> 04:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
we've seen that in the last couple of
 
04:51:08.690 --> 04:51:08.700 align:start position:0%
months when in fact that's not the case
 
04:51:10.490 --> 04:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
there may be fewer New Hampshire
 
04:51:13.850 --> 04:51:13.860 align:start position:0%
residents who have jobs but there hasn't
 
04:51:16.490 --> 04:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
been fewer jobs in New Hampshire and so
 
04:51:18.110 --> 04:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
you have to make the distinction between
 
04:51:20.390 --> 04:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
the household survey and the payroll or
 
04:51:23.570 --> 04:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
employer survey and those two surveys
 
04:51:25.250 --> 04:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
tend to a lot of times tell different
 
04:51:27.170 --> 04:51:27.180 align:start position:0%
stories or at least on the surface tell
 
04:51:28.970 --> 04:51:28.980 align:start position:0%
different stories so Brian and I just
 
04:51:31.250 --> 04:51:31.260 align:start position:0%
pick the one that looks better
 
04:51:33.650 --> 04:51:33.660 align:start position:0%
um and we go with that um but usually
 
04:51:36.410 --> 04:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
when you in in all seriousness usually
 
04:51:38.750 --> 04:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
when you peel back the layers of the
 
04:51:38.760 --> 04:51:39.650 align:start position:0%
when you peel back the layers of the
onion

04:51:39.650 --> 04:51:39.660 align:start position:0%
onion
 
04:51:41.930 --> 04:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
um in both of those surveys you can find
 
04:51:43.730 --> 04:51:43.740 align:start position:0%
the consistencies and that they aren't
 
04:51:46.670 --> 04:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
aren't really telling different stories
 
04:51:48.230 --> 04:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
um and you can you can better understand
 
04:51:50.510 --> 04:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
them but there that is a good
 
04:51:52.310 --> 04:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
distinction between what each one each
 
04:51:53.990 --> 04:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
one of those is telling you
 
04:51:56.030 --> 04:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald has a question and
 
04:51:58.610 --> 04:51:58.620 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
04:52:03.288 --> 04:52:03.298 align:start position:0%
um do you know to what extent
 
04:52:06.850 --> 04:52:06.860 align:start position:0%
the people sitting on the sidelines are
 
04:52:10.970 --> 04:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
disproportionately women who lack access
 
04:52:14.150 --> 04:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
to child care that makes it
 
04:52:17.410 --> 04:52:17.420 align:start position:0%
worth going to work
 
04:52:21.350 --> 04:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
no we do have some indication of that we
 
04:52:23.770 --> 04:52:23.780 align:start position:0%
don't survey that but during the
 
04:52:23.780 --> 04:52:25.448 align:start position:0%
don't survey that but during the
pandemic

04:52:25.448 --> 04:52:25.458 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
04:52:28.670 --> 04:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor
 
04:52:30.890 --> 04:52:30.900 align:start position:0%
Statistics but primarily the Census
 
04:52:32.690 --> 04:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
Bureau asked a number of questions of
 
04:52:36.230 --> 04:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
households about reasons why they
 
04:52:39.170 --> 04:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
weren't working that were unique and
 
04:52:40.788 --> 04:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
different from the way we traditionally
 
04:52:43.448 --> 04:52:43.458 align:start position:0%
had asked those questions they asked
 
04:52:46.610 --> 04:52:46.620 align:start position:0%
specifically if you
 
04:52:49.070 --> 04:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
um you know if you weren't working
 
04:52:50.930 --> 04:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
here are some of the possible reasons
 
04:52:52.788 --> 04:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
why you aren't looking for work or why
 
04:52:54.770 --> 04:52:54.780 align:start position:0%
you are and one of them was
 
04:52:57.770 --> 04:52:57.780 align:start position:0%
uh the need to take care of a child
 
04:53:00.110 --> 04:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
under the age of one was under the age
 
04:53:02.390 --> 04:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
of six who did wasn't in school and
 
04:53:03.830 --> 04:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
didn't have access to child care another
 
04:53:06.110 --> 04:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
one was ages seven to fourteen whatever
 
04:53:09.050 --> 04:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't there was an increase so
 
04:53:11.448 --> 04:53:11.458 align:start position:0%
we do know that that has increased and
 
04:53:13.128 --> 04:53:13.138 align:start position:0%
we also have anecdotal evidence that
 
04:53:16.128 --> 04:53:16.138 align:start position:0%
riches we'll talk about eventually that
 
04:53:19.490 --> 04:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
seems to indicate that it has played a
 
04:53:21.890 --> 04:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
role there's some gender differences
 
04:53:24.170 --> 04:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
there particularly among women who are
 
04:53:26.628 --> 04:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
have are most likely to have the
 
04:53:32.708 --> 04:53:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:36.170 --> 04:53:36.180 align:start position:0%
and I think you're up rich
 
04:53:37.730 --> 04:53:37.740 align:start position:0%
representative Almy had a quick question
 
04:53:41.868 --> 04:53:41.878 align:start position:0%
thank you on it's a methodological
 
04:53:46.368 --> 04:53:46.378 align:start position:0%
question again on Dutch do the does the
 
04:53:47.930 --> 04:53:47.940 align:start position:0%
labor department and the census
 
04:53:50.510 --> 04:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
Department do they have access to all of
 
04:53:55.250 --> 04:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
our cell phones how are they sampling
 
04:53:57.050 --> 04:53:57.060 align:start position:0%
good question
 
04:53:57.060 --> 04:53:57.730 align:start position:0%
good question
um

04:53:57.730 --> 04:53:57.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:00.948 --> 04:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know and and my
 
04:54:02.868 --> 04:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
experience as someone who works closely
 
04:54:04.610 --> 04:54:04.620 align:start position:0%
with the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics
 
04:54:04.620 --> 04:54:05.750 align:start position:0%
with the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics
anyway

04:54:05.750 --> 04:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
04:54:05.760 --> 04:54:06.410 align:start position:0%
anyway
um

04:54:06.410 --> 04:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:09.110 --> 04:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
not always those kinds of questions can
 
04:54:11.810 --> 04:54:11.820 align:start position:0%
be difficult to get answers to you will
 
04:54:13.730 --> 04:54:13.740 align:start position:0%
see about
 
04:54:16.128 --> 04:54:16.138 align:start position:0%
um you know General sampling procedures
 
04:54:18.470 --> 04:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
but I have not seen anything that says
 
04:54:18.480 --> 04:54:19.730 align:start position:0%
but I have not seen anything that says
particularly

04:54:19.730 --> 04:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
04:54:21.708 --> 04:54:21.718 align:start position:0%
um addresses the issue of cell phones
 
04:54:23.750 --> 04:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's Pro it's problematic in any any
 
04:54:26.030 --> 04:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
telephone survey for sure and I will
 
04:54:27.350 --> 04:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
tell you one of the problems that we've
 
04:54:29.330 --> 04:54:29.340 align:start position:0%
had there's been a lot of data problems
 
04:54:31.910 --> 04:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
in the pandemic one of the data problems
 
04:54:34.250 --> 04:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
is that response rates have been
 
04:54:37.010 --> 04:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
exceptionally low and it's created more
 
04:54:39.830 --> 04:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
error in the data and we've had the
 
04:54:42.948 --> 04:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
factors some of that in and as Rich
 
04:54:45.288 --> 04:54:45.298 align:start position:0%
knows I'm not one of the favorite people
 
04:54:46.730 --> 04:54:46.740 align:start position:0%
of the Bureau of Labor Statistics
 
04:54:49.788 --> 04:54:49.798 align:start position:0%
because I ask a lot of questions and I
 
04:54:50.930 --> 04:54:50.940 align:start position:0%
have concerns about some of the
 
04:54:53.510 --> 04:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
methodologies in particular with New
 
04:54:56.030 --> 04:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the results but but we
 
04:54:58.250 --> 04:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
don't have an answer for that I'm sorry
 
04:55:00.830 --> 04:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
we and not having an answer to that is
 
04:55:03.050 --> 04:55:03.060 align:start position:0%
not due to lack of effort
 
04:55:05.510 --> 04:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
um so as Brian had indicated I think it
 
04:55:07.128 --> 04:55:07.138 align:start position:0%
was an understatement we did have some
 
04:55:09.230 --> 04:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
very interesting conversations with the
 
04:55:10.610 --> 04:55:10.620 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Labor Statistics throughout
 
04:55:11.868 --> 04:55:11.878 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
04:55:14.868 --> 04:55:14.878 align:start position:0%
um because we were looking at numbers
 
04:55:17.448 --> 04:55:17.458 align:start position:0%
that they were were releasing we didn't
 
04:55:19.430 --> 04:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
feel they were fairly reflective on the
 
04:55:22.070 --> 04:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
actual state of the labor force in New
 
04:55:24.230 --> 04:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire based on other metrics
 
04:55:26.868 --> 04:55:26.878 align:start position:0%
um you know we asked for to do things
 
04:55:30.110 --> 04:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
such as to do a ride along with with the
 
04:55:32.208 --> 04:55:32.218 align:start position:0%
survey takers just to listen in not not
 
04:55:35.030 --> 04:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
say anything we keep our mouth shut
 
04:55:37.430 --> 04:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
um but they just kind of giggled a
 
04:55:39.590 --> 04:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
little bit when we asked that and uh
 
04:55:41.030 --> 04:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
they weren't going to have any part of
 
04:55:45.070 --> 04:55:45.080 align:start position:0%
it so we try to get into the um
 
04:55:47.448 --> 04:55:47.458 align:start position:0%
what is actually going on with that
 
04:55:50.628 --> 04:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
monthly survey but it it's really
 
04:55:52.310 --> 04:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
um you know states are really kind of
 
04:56:00.590 --> 04:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:02.690 --> 04:56:02.700 align:start position:0%
um a couple of slides I think getting
 
04:56:04.750 --> 04:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
into uh
 
04:56:07.128 --> 04:56:07.138 align:start position:0%
refining some of the data to look at
 
04:56:09.410 --> 04:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that uh Senator
 
04:56:11.090 --> 04:56:11.100 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald you've been you've been asking
 
04:56:11.100 --> 04:56:12.050 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald you've been you've been asking
here

04:56:12.050 --> 04:56:12.060 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:56:14.270 --> 04:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
um and we try to get into that we try to
 
04:56:17.390 --> 04:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
learn more about
 
04:56:20.930 --> 04:56:20.940 align:start position:0%
um the labor force participation
 
04:56:23.448 --> 04:56:23.458 align:start position:0%
um falling off from from prior to the
 
04:56:25.850 --> 04:56:25.860 align:start position:0%
pandemic overall labor force being down
 
04:56:28.250 --> 04:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
about 8 500 people compared to our
 
04:56:30.110 --> 04:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic Peak
 
04:56:32.990 --> 04:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
um so we we try to look at as much of
 
04:56:36.050 --> 04:56:36.060 align:start position:0%
the detail as we can to learn a little
 
04:56:38.570 --> 04:56:38.580 align:start position:0%
bit more about those characteristics
 
04:56:40.190 --> 04:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
um not just because it's good
 
04:56:42.288 --> 04:56:42.298 align:start position:0%
information to have but it also shapes
 
04:56:45.530 --> 04:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
our policies in terms of what we do from
 
04:56:48.470 --> 04:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
an engagement perspective and trying to
 
04:56:50.628 --> 04:56:50.638 align:start position:0%
promote re-employment services and
 
04:56:52.550 --> 04:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
programs and virtual job fairs to
 
04:56:54.110 --> 04:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
different populations in the state and
 
04:56:56.628 --> 04:56:56.638 align:start position:0%
trying to grow the labor force so what
 
04:57:00.110 --> 04:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
you see here is a comparison of some
 
04:57:02.930 --> 04:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
data that we presented last year when
 
04:57:04.430 --> 04:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
when we're in front of the The Joint
 
04:57:07.490 --> 04:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
Committee these with a with the gray bar
 
04:57:10.150 --> 04:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
and then you see the updated information
 
04:57:12.650 --> 04:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
in I guess what we would say is an
 
04:57:16.250 --> 04:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
orange bar but looking at labor force
 
04:57:19.970 --> 04:57:19.980 align:start position:0%
participation by uh by age cohorts
 
04:57:19.980 --> 04:57:21.590 align:start position:0%
participation by uh by age cohorts
and

04:57:21.590 --> 04:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:57:25.128 --> 04:57:25.138 align:start position:0%
um to highlight a few areas here so when
 
04:57:26.810 --> 04:57:26.820 align:start position:0%
we were when we were last talking with
 
04:57:29.150 --> 04:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
the joint committees we had what we
 
04:57:31.310 --> 04:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
referred to as a bookend problem with
 
04:57:32.990 --> 04:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
the labor force from a participation
 
04:57:35.750 --> 04:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
rate perspective we had older workers
 
04:57:39.890 --> 04:57:39.900 align:start position:0%
who were very slow to come back to the
 
04:57:42.830 --> 04:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
labor force after the pandemic so our 60
 
04:57:45.170 --> 04:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
to 69 year old group when you look at
 
04:57:47.150 --> 04:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
those gray bars in this chart you see
 
04:57:50.750 --> 04:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
you know 60 to 64 off by nearly 7
 
04:57:54.650 --> 04:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
percent 65 to 69 off by another three
 
04:57:57.230 --> 04:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
percent and we go to the other end of
 
04:58:00.708 --> 04:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
the labor force Spectrum to complete the
 
04:58:03.110 --> 04:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
that the book ends and you look at our
 
04:58:07.270 --> 04:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
20 year olds and particularly 25 to 29
 
04:58:10.550 --> 04:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
was a problematic age group when we last
 
04:58:13.310 --> 04:58:13.320 align:start position:0%
spoke to you down about five and a half
 
04:58:13.320 --> 04:58:15.050 align:start position:0%
spoke to you down about five and a half
percent

04:58:15.050 --> 04:58:15.060 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:58:16.970 --> 04:58:16.980 align:start position:0%
um now fast forward to where we are now
 
04:58:18.890 --> 04:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
with the orange line you can see what
 
04:58:20.208 --> 04:58:20.218 align:start position:0%
has occurred
 
04:58:22.190 --> 04:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
um during the past year since we last
 
04:58:24.050 --> 04:58:24.060 align:start position:0%
spoke and you can see when we look again
 
04:58:27.830 --> 04:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
at those older workers 60 to 69 quite an
 
04:58:30.110 --> 04:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
improvement uh from a labor force
 
04:58:33.650 --> 04:58:33.660 align:start position:0%
participation perspective so 60 to 64
 
04:58:36.110 --> 04:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
year olds going from a seven percent
 
04:58:38.930 --> 04:58:38.940 align:start position:0%
decline to just over a one percent
 
04:58:41.868 --> 04:58:41.878 align:start position:0%
decline so significant Improvement and
 
04:58:44.750 --> 04:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
then our 65 to 69 year olds going from a
 
04:58:46.788 --> 04:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
three percent decline to a two percent
 
04:58:51.530 --> 04:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
gain so a five percent swing there so
 
04:58:53.750 --> 04:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
some significant change improve change
 
04:58:56.208 --> 04:58:56.218 align:start position:0%
in older workers in their participation
 
04:58:58.070 --> 04:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
in the labor force over the past year
 
04:59:01.550 --> 04:59:01.560 align:start position:0%
but when we look at our younger workers
 
04:59:04.730 --> 04:59:04.740 align:start position:0%
particularly our 25 to 29 year olds and
 
04:59:09.050 --> 04:59:09.060 align:start position:0%
our 30 to 34 year olds 25 to 29 have
 
04:59:12.708 --> 04:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
been stubbornly not moving uh very much
 
04:59:15.050 --> 04:59:15.060 align:start position:0%
when you look at where where they were
 
04:59:16.610 --> 04:59:16.620 align:start position:0%
from a decline in labor force
 
04:59:20.330 --> 04:59:20.340 align:start position:0%
participation at 5.5 percent
 
04:59:23.090 --> 04:59:23.100 align:start position:0%
um just a slight tick of an improvement
 
04:59:26.330 --> 04:59:26.340 align:start position:0%
down to 5.4 percent so still a
 
04:59:29.390 --> 04:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
problematic age group from labor force
 
04:59:31.970 --> 04:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
recovery participation recovery looking
 
04:59:34.128 --> 04:59:34.138 align:start position:0%
you know compared back to pre-pandemic
 
04:59:37.670 --> 04:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
and then our 30 to 34 year olds have a
 
04:59:40.070 --> 04:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
have a a significant
 
04:59:42.830 --> 04:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
decline in participation when we compare
 
04:59:46.010 --> 04:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
data that we had last year in the gray
 
04:59:49.430 --> 04:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
bar to the the more recent data looking
 
04:59:51.850 --> 04:59:51.860 align:start position:0%
at a little bit over of a three percent
 
04:59:55.368 --> 04:59:55.378 align:start position:0%
decline in labor force participation
 
04:59:58.730 --> 04:59:58.740 align:start position:0%
um when we look at what that means from
 
05:00:01.788 --> 05:00:01.798 align:start position:0%
a numbers perspective so if we you know
 
05:00:04.430 --> 05:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
we've had as Brian has indicated we've
 
05:00:07.670 --> 05:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
had our population increases over the
 
05:00:09.948 --> 05:00:09.958 align:start position:0%
last few years but when you take
 
05:00:12.948 --> 05:00:12.958 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic participation rates and you
 
05:00:15.650 --> 05:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
layer that over those population cohorts
 
05:00:17.930 --> 05:00:17.940 align:start position:0%
if we had that pre-pandemic
 
05:00:19.788 --> 05:00:19.798 align:start position:0%
participation we'd be looking at about
 
05:00:21.530 --> 05:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
an additional 18
 
05:00:23.990 --> 05:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
000 people participating in the labor
 
05:00:26.810 --> 05:00:26.820 align:start position:0%
force compared to what we have now uh
 
05:00:29.030 --> 05:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
the in the the 20 year old group that's
 
05:00:32.448 --> 05:00:32.458 align:start position:0%
about 9 000 additional people when you
 
05:00:34.430 --> 05:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
look in the 30 some odd year old group
 
05:00:36.948 --> 05:00:36.958 align:start position:0%
that's a little over 6 000 additional
 
05:00:40.850 --> 05:00:40.860 align:start position:0%
people so so both from a percentage
 
05:00:43.128 --> 05:00:43.138 align:start position:0%
participation perspective and when you
 
05:00:45.230 --> 05:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
look at the raw numbers of that that is
 
05:00:47.810 --> 05:00:47.820 align:start position:0%
a significant impact on labor force
 
05:00:49.730 --> 05:00:49.740 align:start position:0%
recovery and when when we talk to you
 
05:00:53.448 --> 05:00:53.458 align:start position:0%
about still being down about a percent
 
05:00:55.788 --> 05:00:55.798 align:start position:0%
um and getting back to that pre-pandemic
 
05:00:58.310 --> 05:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
Peak and being down about 8 500
 
05:01:01.070 --> 05:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
individuals participating in the labor
 
05:01:04.310 --> 05:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
force now you can see where where that
 
05:01:07.850 --> 05:01:07.860 align:start position:0%
shakes up what age cohorts have been uh
 
05:01:10.788 --> 05:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
the the most impacted and when we look
 
05:01:12.890 --> 05:01:12.900 align:start position:0%
at we we break that down a little bit
 
05:01:15.288 --> 05:01:15.298 align:start position:0%
further trying to get to a point that
 
05:01:17.868 --> 05:01:17.878 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald had raised looking at
 
05:01:21.350 --> 05:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
the the prime uh child bearing and
 
05:01:24.530 --> 05:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
rearing ages when we look at 25 to 34
 
05:01:27.110 --> 05:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
year olds both labor force participation
 
05:01:29.030 --> 05:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
and the epop with employment to
 
05:01:33.050 --> 05:01:33.060 align:start position:0%
population ratio compared by gender you
 
05:01:34.128 --> 05:01:34.138 align:start position:0%
can see
 
05:01:36.948 --> 05:01:36.958 align:start position:0%
uh that female participation is off more
 
05:01:38.510 --> 05:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
than male
 
05:01:41.208 --> 05:01:41.218 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to stop you there there
 
05:01:42.770 --> 05:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
seems to be a lot of interest in this
 
05:01:44.628 --> 05:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
topic I can see hands trying to be
 
05:01:46.250 --> 05:01:46.260 align:start position:0%
raised right now and we're also out of
 
05:01:46.260 --> 05:01:47.570 align:start position:0%
raised right now and we're also out of
time

05:01:47.570 --> 05:01:47.580 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:01:49.070 --> 05:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
so if you don't mind I'm going to
 
05:01:50.690 --> 05:01:50.700 align:start position:0%
recognize the folks that have questions
 
05:01:53.570 --> 05:01:53.580 align:start position:0%
and invite you to come to house Ways and
 
05:01:56.090 --> 05:01:56.100 align:start position:0%
Means again if you're interested if if
 
05:01:58.550 --> 05:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
you would be interested members
 
05:02:00.410 --> 05:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
um maybe in the next week or so and that
 
05:02:02.330 --> 05:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
way we could continue if you have the
 
05:02:04.730 --> 05:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
time absolutely tell us
 
05:02:06.530 --> 05:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
um tell us when you want us back and
 
05:02:07.910 --> 05:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
we'll be more than happy to be there
 
05:02:09.410 --> 05:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
awesome because obviously there's a lot
 
05:02:11.030 --> 05:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
of great information in here and I think
 
05:02:11.990 --> 05:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of good questions
 
05:02:15.590 --> 05:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth has a question
 
05:02:17.570 --> 05:02:17.580 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair you might have
 
05:02:19.610 --> 05:02:19.620 align:start position:0%
just answered it I was trying to match
 
05:02:22.490 --> 05:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
several slides back the growth and the
 
05:02:27.050 --> 05:02:27.060 align:start position:0%
professional uh I.T type area with the
 
05:02:27.060 --> 05:02:28.190 align:start position:0%
professional uh I.T type area with the
Slowdown

05:02:28.190 --> 05:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
Slowdown
 
05:02:32.570 --> 05:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
um 25 to 29 within my family my nieces
 
05:02:35.150 --> 05:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
and nephews that are 25 29 are actually
 
05:02:36.890 --> 05:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
doing great getting some really good
 
05:02:39.590 --> 05:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
jobs so it doesn't quite match what I've
 
05:02:42.470 --> 05:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:46.430 --> 05:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
I mean it it's difficult to
 
05:02:51.410 --> 05:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
um to say why or on what basis the 25 to
 
05:02:53.690 --> 05:02:53.700 align:start position:0%
29 year old group has stepped out of
 
05:02:55.910 --> 05:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
Labor Force we've talked about this a
 
05:03:00.490 --> 05:03:00.500 align:start position:0%
lot internally it's our one of our our
 
05:03:04.430 --> 05:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
hypotheses is that there are 25 to 29
 
05:03:06.708 --> 05:03:06.718 align:start position:0%
year olds who are being compensated in
 
05:03:08.570 --> 05:03:08.580 align:start position:0%
some fashion
 
05:03:10.250 --> 05:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
um but they're not what would be
 
05:03:12.590 --> 05:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
considered or they consider
 
05:03:16.368 --> 05:03:16.378 align:start position:0%
employed or looking for work they may be
 
05:03:19.788 --> 05:03:19.798 align:start position:0%
doing gig jobs we joke about uh an
 
05:03:21.708 --> 05:03:21.718 align:start position:0%
occupation that I had never heard of
 
05:03:23.570 --> 05:03:23.580 align:start position:0%
people getting paid to play video games
 
05:03:26.230 --> 05:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
online Apparently that is a thing
 
05:03:30.470 --> 05:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
but if you have a gig job you're not a w
 
05:03:33.708 --> 05:03:33.718 align:start position:0%
two wage earner
 
05:03:36.708 --> 05:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
um and you're getting compensated for
 
05:03:38.570 --> 05:03:38.580 align:start position:0%
your gig work and somebody from the
 
05:03:40.368 --> 05:03:40.378 align:start position:0%
government calls you and asks about
 
05:03:41.868 --> 05:03:41.878 align:start position:0%
whether you're employed and how much
 
05:03:44.510 --> 05:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
you're earning you may be reluctant to
 
05:03:47.330 --> 05:03:47.340 align:start position:0%
say yes and so we think that that it's
 
05:03:49.430 --> 05:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
not the only reason but we do believe
 
05:03:51.650 --> 05:03:51.660 align:start position:0%
that it's played some role in those
 
05:03:51.660 --> 05:03:52.910 align:start position:0%
that it's played some role in those
numbers

05:03:52.910 --> 05:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
05:03:54.470 --> 05:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we're actually down
 
05:03:57.530 --> 05:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
quite that much they clearly are down
 
05:03:59.270 --> 05:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
um part of that had to do early in the
 
05:04:00.530 --> 05:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
pandemic with the fact that they've
 
05:04:02.690 --> 05:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
they've got a lot of stimulus money you
 
05:04:04.330 --> 05:04:04.340 align:start position:0%
know everybody got four thousand dollars
 
05:04:07.430 --> 05:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
that younger cohort is was most likely
 
05:04:08.990 --> 05:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
to be employed more likely to be
 
05:04:11.090 --> 05:04:11.100 align:start position:0%
employed in the industries that had the
 
05:04:13.368 --> 05:04:13.378 align:start position:0%
biggest layoffs they received a lot of
 
05:04:16.670 --> 05:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
um you know both compensation from the
 
05:04:18.170 --> 05:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
state unemployment but also from the
 
05:04:19.730 --> 05:04:19.740 align:start position:0%
federal government so I gave them a
 
05:04:21.830 --> 05:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
cushion to stay out of the labor force a
 
05:04:23.330 --> 05:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
little bit longer and we heard that a
 
05:04:26.650 --> 05:04:26.660 align:start position:0%
lot anecdotally now that's run out so
 
05:04:28.550 --> 05:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards has a question
 
05:04:32.840 --> 05:04:32.850 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:32.850 --> 05:04:38.448 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:04:38.448 --> 05:04:38.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:41.868 --> 05:04:41.878 align:start position:0%
CEO the underground economy or the black
 
05:04:44.330 --> 05:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
market of employment these are people
 
05:04:47.690 --> 05:04:47.700 align:start position:0%
who make their living by doing illegal
 
05:04:51.050 --> 05:04:51.060 align:start position:0%
activities or do housekeeping or
 
05:04:53.390 --> 05:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
something else in the margins that are
 
05:04:56.448 --> 05:04:56.458 align:start position:0%
just cash basis with their employer do
 
05:04:58.970 --> 05:04:58.980 align:start position:0%
we have any statistics are we doing any
 
05:05:02.750 --> 05:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
data collection around the size and
 
05:05:04.970 --> 05:05:04.980 align:start position:0%
scope of New Hampshire's underground
 
05:05:04.980 --> 05:05:07.910 align:start position:0%
scope of New Hampshire's underground
economy

05:05:07.910 --> 05:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:09.770 --> 05:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:05:12.410 --> 05:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
similar to prior to the pandemic and and
 
05:05:15.770 --> 05:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
here here we are in 2023
 
05:05:15.780 --> 05:05:16.550 align:start position:0%
here here we are in 2023
um

05:05:16.550 --> 05:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:19.730 --> 05:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
we capture for in terms of employment
 
05:05:23.090 --> 05:05:23.100 align:start position:0%
that which is compensated on a W-2
 
05:05:26.810 --> 05:05:26.820 align:start position:0%
that's what's reported to us on the on
 
05:05:28.910 --> 05:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
the quarterly census of employment wages
 
05:05:31.310 --> 05:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh so to the extent that that existed
 
05:05:33.350 --> 05:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic
 
05:05:36.708 --> 05:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
um as I am sure that it did hence why
 
05:05:39.530 --> 05:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
several agencies have Auditors that are
 
05:05:41.930 --> 05:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
traveling the state occasionally to talk
 
05:05:44.150 --> 05:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
to employers and why we get blocked
 
05:05:46.730 --> 05:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
unemployment claims from people who file
 
05:05:50.208 --> 05:05:50.218 align:start position:0%
and then uh don't have any wages on
 
05:05:51.890 --> 05:05:51.900 align:start position:0%
record and we have to determine what's
 
05:05:55.190 --> 05:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
going on I'm sure that is still uh going
 
05:06:00.410 --> 05:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
on but the uh participate the
 
05:06:02.868 --> 05:06:02.878 align:start position:0%
participation drop off
 
05:06:05.150 --> 05:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
um here I would
 
05:06:09.350 --> 05:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
we theorize is more attributed to that
 
05:06:11.810 --> 05:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
non-traditional but still perfectly
 
05:06:11.820 --> 05:06:12.948 align:start position:0%
non-traditional but still perfectly
legal

05:06:12.948 --> 05:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
legal
 
05:06:16.310 --> 05:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
type of employment albeit compensated by
 
05:06:19.010 --> 05:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
a 1099 and not a traditional covered
 
05:06:21.890 --> 05:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
employment situation of W-2 type
 
05:06:24.050 --> 05:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
employment now there might be an
 
05:06:27.110 --> 05:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be able to compare some
 
05:06:30.470 --> 05:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
of that with 1099 activity we've talked
 
05:06:33.650 --> 05:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
about that and there might be as we do
 
05:06:38.448 --> 05:06:38.458 align:start position:0%
experience that a Slowdown in 2023 there
 
05:06:40.610 --> 05:06:40.620 align:start position:0%
might be a more of a movement back to
 
05:06:42.410 --> 05:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
what is perceived as more stable
 
05:06:44.750 --> 05:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
traditional employment as well which
 
05:06:47.090 --> 05:06:47.100 align:start position:0%
could drive some of that non-traditional
 
05:06:49.570 --> 05:06:49.580 align:start position:0%
employment but legal
 
05:06:52.430 --> 05:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
internet-based gig type of work maybe
 
05:06:55.128 --> 05:06:55.138 align:start position:0%
back to traditional employment but the
 
05:06:59.390 --> 05:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
to the extent that there's uh the cash
 
05:07:03.110 --> 05:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
type of economy and that is
 
05:07:03.120 --> 05:07:04.250 align:start position:0%
type of economy and that is
um

05:07:04.250 --> 05:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:07.430 --> 05:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
part of the situation well that you know
 
05:07:09.650 --> 05:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
that that existed prior to the pandemic
 
05:07:14.150 --> 05:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
to the extent it continues to exist
 
05:07:15.830 --> 05:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
I shut you off completely I just
 
05:07:17.208 --> 05:07:17.218 align:start position:0%
realized that I don't see our next
 
05:07:20.390 --> 05:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
presenter is Dr Kenneth Johnson here you
 
05:07:22.970 --> 05:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
are wonderful okay thank you for your
 
05:07:25.368 --> 05:07:25.378 align:start position:0%
patience so ah yes representative
 
05:07:26.510 --> 05:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
spillsburg we've got a couple quick
 
05:07:27.708 --> 05:07:27.718 align:start position:0%
questions and then we'll wrap it up
 
05:07:29.750 --> 05:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you madam chairman uh
 
05:07:32.930 --> 05:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
before we have our guests return I would
 
05:07:36.590 --> 05:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
love to have this slide Set uh sent as
 
05:07:38.448 --> 05:07:38.458 align:start position:0%
an email attachment so I can absorb the
 
05:07:40.970 --> 05:07:40.980 align:start position:0%
Glorious color and get more out of it

all of these attachments in full color
 
05:07:58.550 --> 05:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
but there'll be spoiler alerts if you
 
05:07:59.690 --> 05:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
look at it because we were going to give
 
05:08:01.430 --> 05:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
you our forecasts and now you're gonna
 
05:08:04.010 --> 05:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
the spoiler alert there's no reason for
 
05:08:06.050 --> 05:08:06.060 align:start position:0%
us to come back we may actually have an
 
05:08:08.330 --> 05:08:08.340 align:start position:0%

you
 
05:09:18.890 --> 05:09:18.900 align:start position:0%
so this is the difficult time to be a
 
05:09:20.990 --> 05:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
demographer although the 2020 census is
 
05:09:22.850 --> 05:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
done there's been delays in the release
 
05:09:25.910 --> 05:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
of the data from it so that complicates
 
05:09:27.770 --> 05:09:27.780 align:start position:0%
my job of trying to talk to you about
 
05:09:30.170 --> 05:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
what's going on right now but I'll do
 
05:09:31.730 --> 05:09:31.740 align:start position:0%
the best I can
 
05:09:34.070 --> 05:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
I just like to acknowledge the funding
 
05:09:36.948 --> 05:09:36.958 align:start position:0%
agencies who supported my research
 
05:09:39.050 --> 05:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
and one thing that's going to come out
 
05:09:41.150 --> 05:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
in the in the data that we're going to
 
05:09:44.390 --> 05:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
see is that long term the population
 
05:09:46.128 --> 05:09:46.138 align:start position:0%
gains to the state of New Hampshire have
 
05:09:48.410 --> 05:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
diminished New Hampshire is not growing
 
05:09:51.170 --> 05:09:51.180 align:start position:0%
as much as it was during the 70s 80s 90s
 
05:09:53.690 --> 05:09:53.700 align:start position:0%
but in the short term it's actually
 
05:09:56.390 --> 05:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
grown modestly
 
05:09:58.970 --> 05:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
and when I'm when I talk about what's
 
05:10:00.770 --> 05:10:00.780 align:start position:0%
going on in New Hampshire there are
 
05:10:03.110 --> 05:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
different elements different demographic
 
05:10:04.730 --> 05:10:04.740 align:start position:0%
elements to it
 
05:10:06.288 --> 05:10:06.298 align:start position:0%
on the one hand there's natural change
 
05:10:07.730 --> 05:10:07.740 align:start position:0%
which I'll sometimes call natural
 
05:10:10.490 --> 05:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
increase or natural decrease which is
 
05:10:11.690 --> 05:10:11.700 align:start position:0%
the difference between the number of
 
05:10:13.610 --> 05:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
births and deaths that occur in the
 
05:10:13.620 --> 05:10:14.390 align:start position:0%
births and deaths that occur in the
state

05:10:14.390 --> 05:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:10:16.430 --> 05:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
and then the other big factor and this
 
05:10:17.930 --> 05:10:17.940 align:start position:0%
is increasingly important in New
 
05:10:20.270 --> 05:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is net migration which is the
 
05:10:21.288 --> 05:10:21.298 align:start position:0%
difference between the number of people
 
05:10:22.910 --> 05:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
who move into New Hampshire and the
 
05:10:25.010 --> 05:10:25.020 align:start position:0%
number of people who leave New Hampshire
 
05:10:27.470 --> 05:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
and I'll talk about two different kinds
 
05:10:30.170 --> 05:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
of migration one is domestic migration
 
05:10:31.730 --> 05:10:31.740 align:start position:0%
which is people coming to New Hampshire
 
05:10:34.430 --> 05:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
from other U.S destinations
 
05:10:36.530 --> 05:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
and the other is immigration which is
 
05:10:39.230 --> 05:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
people coming from another country
 
05:10:39.240 --> 05:10:40.810 align:start position:0%
people coming from another country
so

05:10:40.810 --> 05:10:40.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:10:44.390 --> 05:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
this is just recent Trends this is 2010
 
05:10:46.730 --> 05:10:46.740 align:start position:0%
to 2020 so this is from the U.S census
 
05:10:49.730 --> 05:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
you can see that New Hampshire was the
 
05:10:51.350 --> 05:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
second fastest growing of the New
 
05:10:53.708 --> 05:10:53.718 align:start position:0%
England states after Massachusetts
 
05:10:56.030 --> 05:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
and one thing I want to draw your
 
05:10:57.470 --> 05:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
attention to and this will become a
 
05:11:00.170 --> 05:11:00.180 align:start position:0%
common theme the gray bar that you can
 
05:11:01.788 --> 05:11:01.798 align:start position:0%
see for New Hampshire is migration
 
05:11:03.530 --> 05:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
that's the difference between the number
 
05:11:05.150 --> 05:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
of people who moved to New Hampshire and
 
05:11:07.010 --> 05:11:07.020 align:start position:0%
the number of people who left
 
05:11:10.490 --> 05:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
and you can see that the primary source
 
05:11:13.250 --> 05:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
of population growth in New Hampshire is
 
05:11:15.530 --> 05:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
migration the orange bar is natural
 
05:11:17.150 --> 05:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
increase the difference between the
 
05:11:19.070 --> 05:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
number of deaths and the number of burrs
 
05:11:21.350 --> 05:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
and you can see that that's very modest
 
05:11:25.250 --> 05:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
compared to the migration as a factor so
 
05:11:29.390 --> 05:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:31.850 --> 05:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
this is the newest data that we have and
 
05:11:34.190 --> 05:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
these are estimates so they are subject
 
05:11:36.890 --> 05:11:36.900 align:start position:0%
to some variability but they'll they're
 
05:11:38.930 --> 05:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
generally accurate and you can see again
 
05:11:41.510 --> 05:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
this is New Hampshire from the Census in
 
05:11:44.868 --> 05:11:44.878 align:start position:0%
April of 2020 to July of 2022 which is
 
05:11:47.030 --> 05:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
the newest data that's available
 
05:11:49.310 --> 05:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
and you can see that again migration
 
05:11:51.288 --> 05:11:51.298 align:start position:0%
fueled all of the growth in New
 
05:11:53.330 --> 05:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in fact that more people
 
05:11:56.330 --> 05:11:56.340 align:start position:0%
died in New Hampshire than were born now
 
05:11:58.310 --> 05:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
in part this is a function of covid
 
05:12:00.288 --> 05:12:00.298 align:start position:0%
which increased the number of deaths in
 
05:12:02.330 --> 05:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as it did as you can see
 
05:12:04.070 --> 05:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
in New England and almost all the New
 
05:12:06.110 --> 05:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
England states there were more deaths
 
05:12:07.430 --> 05:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
than birth and actually in the United
 
05:12:10.730 --> 05:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
States more generally 24 States had more
 
05:12:13.250 --> 05:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
people dying and then be born in the
 
05:12:16.368 --> 05:12:16.378 align:start position:0%
last year that's way more than has ever
 
05:12:18.650 --> 05:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
happened in the past the highest number
 
05:12:20.390 --> 05:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
of states to have more deaths than
 
05:12:23.510 --> 05:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
bursts in U.S history is five and that
 
05:12:26.570 --> 05:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
was in 2019 before that it would be
 
05:12:28.490 --> 05:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
unusual for more than one or two states
 
05:12:30.650 --> 05:12:30.660 align:start position:0%
to have more people die and then be born
 
05:12:33.708 --> 05:12:33.718 align:start position:0%
so covet is a big factor here but New
 
05:12:35.570 --> 05:12:35.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire actually had more people dying
 
05:12:38.390 --> 05:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
in it than being born even before covet
 
05:12:41.930 --> 05:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
so migration is the driving force in
 
05:12:44.390 --> 05:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
demographic change in New Hampshire as
 
05:12:46.788 --> 05:12:46.798 align:start position:0%
you can see here as well
 
05:12:48.650 --> 05:12:48.660 align:start position:0%
these are long-term trends for New
 
05:12:51.770 --> 05:12:51.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you can see the 70s and 80s
 
05:12:53.390 --> 05:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
when the population was growing
 
05:12:53.400 --> 05:12:55.190 align:start position:0%
when the population was growing
dramatically

05:12:55.190 --> 05:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
dramatically
 
05:12:57.948 --> 05:12:57.958 align:start position:0%
and again here in those earlier years
 
05:13:00.350 --> 05:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
it's a function of both migration and
 
05:13:02.510 --> 05:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
natural increase that was fueling the
 
05:13:04.730 --> 05:13:04.740 align:start position:0%
growth of New Hampshire's population as
 
05:13:06.470 --> 05:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
we get into the more recent periods
 
05:13:08.868 --> 05:13:08.878 align:start position:0%
population change slows in New Hampshire
 
05:13:11.448 --> 05:13:11.458 align:start position:0%
and then again you can see for 2010 to
 
05:13:15.350 --> 05:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
2020 that um it was all driven by
 
05:13:18.170 --> 05:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
migration and it was relatively small
 
05:13:18.180 --> 05:13:19.368 align:start position:0%
migration and it was relatively small
growth

05:13:19.368 --> 05:13:19.378 align:start position:0%
growth
 
05:13:21.650 --> 05:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
these are more recent data
 
05:13:24.170 --> 05:13:24.180 align:start position:0%
and I wanted you to see the effect of
 
05:13:26.090 --> 05:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
the recession and the aftermath of the
 
05:13:28.190 --> 05:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
recession on New Hampshire demographic
 
05:13:29.628 --> 05:13:29.638 align:start position:0%
Trends and then what's happened since
 
05:13:32.270 --> 05:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
then so 2010 to 2015 although the
 
05:13:33.770 --> 05:13:33.780 align:start position:0%
economists would tell you that the
 
05:13:36.470 --> 05:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
recession was over in 2010 it certainly
 
05:13:38.448 --> 05:13:38.458 align:start position:0%
wasn't and even the economists who were
 
05:13:40.430 --> 05:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
just there before me made a point of
 
05:13:42.470 --> 05:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
showing you that the impact of the
 
05:13:44.930 --> 05:13:44.940 align:start position:0%
recession went on well into the 2010 to
 
05:13:48.530 --> 05:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
2020 period it didn't demography too you
 
05:13:50.448 --> 05:13:50.458 align:start position:0%
can see in New Hampshire
 
05:13:53.690 --> 05:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
that early in the period just after the
 
05:13:56.810 --> 05:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
recession ended that migration to New
 
05:13:58.250 --> 05:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire had slowed down particularly
 
05:14:01.550 --> 05:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
domestic migration the orange bar
 
05:14:03.288 --> 05:14:03.298 align:start position:0%
as we get into the later part of the
 
05:14:06.050 --> 05:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
decade migration picked up but you can
 
05:14:07.368 --> 05:14:07.378 align:start position:0%
see that there's very little actually
 
05:14:10.128 --> 05:14:10.138 align:start position:0%
natural decrease began and then in the
 
05:14:12.530 --> 05:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
in the most recent two and a half years
 
05:14:14.990 --> 05:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
or two and a quarter years you can see
 
05:14:17.208 --> 05:14:17.218 align:start position:0%
the uptick in migration domestic
 
05:14:18.948 --> 05:14:18.958 align:start position:0%
migration in particular that is people
 
05:14:21.288 --> 05:14:21.298 align:start position:0%
coming to New Hampshire from other U.S
 
05:14:21.298 --> 05:14:22.788 align:start position:0%
coming to New Hampshire from other U.S
destinations

05:14:22.788 --> 05:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
destinations
 
05:14:25.788 --> 05:14:25.798 align:start position:0%
and also we had modest immigration but
 
05:14:28.610 --> 05:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
natural decrease the excess of bursts
 
05:14:30.948 --> 05:14:30.958 align:start position:0%
over deaths the Red Bar I'm sorry the
 
05:14:33.650 --> 05:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
excess of deaths over Burrs produced
 
05:14:36.170 --> 05:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
population loss so literally all of New
 
05:14:38.570 --> 05:14:38.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's population gained in the
 
05:14:40.250 --> 05:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
last two and a half years has been from
 
05:14:40.260 --> 05:14:42.288 align:start position:0%
last two and a half years has been from
migration

05:14:42.288 --> 05:14:42.298 align:start position:0%
migration
 
05:14:44.690 --> 05:14:44.700 align:start position:0%
now this is an important slide and one
 
05:14:46.190 --> 05:14:46.200 align:start position:0%
that I
 
05:14:48.470 --> 05:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
I would hope that if you're going to
 
05:14:50.208 --> 05:14:50.218 align:start position:0%
remember one thing from this talk this
 
05:14:51.590 --> 05:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
would be one of the things I'd like you
 
05:14:55.368 --> 05:14:55.378 align:start position:0%
to remember when I talk about migration
 
05:14:57.890 --> 05:14:57.900 align:start position:0%
I'm usually talking about net migration
 
05:14:59.390 --> 05:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
which is the difference between the
 
05:15:00.830 --> 05:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
number of people moving into New
 
05:15:02.330 --> 05:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the number of people
 
05:15:05.090 --> 05:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
leaving New Hampshire if you look at the
 
05:15:07.250 --> 05:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
domestic migration that middle set of
 
05:15:10.190 --> 05:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
bars that little gray bar which is the
 
05:15:13.368 --> 05:15:13.378 align:start position:0%
amount of domestic migration net is a
 
05:15:16.970 --> 05:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
function of almost 250 000 people moving
 
05:15:20.570 --> 05:15:20.580 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire and 215
 
05:15:22.970 --> 05:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
000 people leaving New Hampshire in
 
05:15:25.610 --> 05:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
other words there's a lot of turnover in
 
05:15:27.890 --> 05:15:27.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's population and I think
 
05:15:29.930 --> 05:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
that's something that's often not
 
05:15:33.350 --> 05:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
recognized that that little bit of net
 
05:15:35.270 --> 05:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
change is the function of a lot of
 
05:15:37.490 --> 05:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
people coming and a lot of people going
 
05:15:39.770 --> 05:15:39.780 align:start position:0%
from the state you can also see the
 
05:15:41.208 --> 05:15:41.218 align:start position:0%
number of births and deaths that were
 
05:15:44.930 --> 05:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
going on that produce that modest loss
 
05:15:47.150 --> 05:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
this is 2015-19
 
05:15:49.490 --> 05:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
and then you can see immigration as well
 
05:15:52.730 --> 05:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
so again when we talk about net change
 
05:15:55.190 --> 05:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire's population recognize
 
05:15:56.930 --> 05:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the people who are here
 
05:15:59.930 --> 05:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
are gone and a lot of new people are
 
05:15:59.940 --> 05:16:01.490 align:start position:0%
are gone and a lot of new people are
here

05:16:01.490 --> 05:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:16:03.170 --> 05:16:03.180 align:start position:0%
this is birth and deaths in New
 
05:16:06.288 --> 05:16:06.298 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you can see the
 
05:16:08.570 --> 05:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
the fall off and the number of births in
 
05:16:10.070 --> 05:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which began during the
 
05:16:13.070 --> 05:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
Great Recession and has continued on
 
05:16:15.288 --> 05:16:15.298 align:start position:0%
there has been essentially no recovery
 
05:16:16.730 --> 05:16:16.740 align:start position:0%
in the birth rates from the Great
 
05:16:18.948 --> 05:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
Recession during the Great Recession the
 
05:16:20.510 --> 05:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
birth rates dropped quite dramatically
 
05:16:22.250 --> 05:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
in the United States not just in New
 
05:16:24.110 --> 05:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and there has been little if
 
05:16:25.970 --> 05:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
any evidence of recovery in those birth
 
05:16:25.980 --> 05:16:26.930 align:start position:0%
any evidence of recovery in those birth
rates

05:16:26.930 --> 05:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
rates
 
05:16:28.788 --> 05:16:28.798 align:start position:0%
so the number of births in the United
 
05:16:32.990 --> 05:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
States is quite low uh compared to what
 
05:16:34.730 --> 05:16:34.740 align:start position:0%
it would have been had the birth rates
 
05:16:36.948 --> 05:16:36.958 align:start position:0%
that were common in the United States at
 
05:16:38.050 --> 05:16:38.060 align:start position:0%
the time of the Great Recession
 
05:16:40.850 --> 05:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
continued my estimate is that about 8
 
05:16:43.368 --> 05:16:43.378 align:start position:0%
million fewer babies have been born in
 
05:16:45.948 --> 05:16:45.958 align:start position:0%
the United States over the last 15 years
 
05:16:48.410 --> 05:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
or so that would have been born you can
 
05:16:50.810 --> 05:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
also see the gradual increase in the
 
05:16:52.670 --> 05:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
death rates in New Hampshire that's
 
05:16:54.770 --> 05:16:54.780 align:start position:0%
primarily a function of the Aging of New
 
05:16:56.868 --> 05:16:56.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's population but of course you
 
05:16:59.510 --> 05:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
can see covid's effect near the end of
 
05:17:01.550 --> 05:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
that period
 
05:17:03.890 --> 05:17:03.900 align:start position:0%
so I talked to you about migration in
 
05:17:07.250 --> 05:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I I I wanted to talk
 
05:17:11.390 --> 05:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
about this a little bit more only 41 of
 
05:17:13.250 --> 05:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
the people who are living in New
 
05:17:16.150 --> 05:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire were born in New Hampshire 41
 
05:17:19.190 --> 05:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
only three states have a smaller
 
05:17:21.470 --> 05:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
proportion of their population born in
 
05:17:22.788 --> 05:17:22.798 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:17:24.890 --> 05:17:24.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a lot of population
 
05:17:29.990 --> 05:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
that comes from other U.S destinations
 
05:17:32.930 --> 05:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
and you can see that in the red bar on
 
05:17:34.490 --> 05:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
the right hand side which shows New
 
05:17:35.990 --> 05:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the place of birth in New
 
05:17:37.850 --> 05:17:37.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's current residence New
 
05:17:39.530 --> 05:17:39.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a very modest number of
 
05:17:39.540 --> 05:17:41.330 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a very modest number of
foreign-born

05:17:41.330 --> 05:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
foreign-born
 
05:17:41.340 --> 05:17:42.770 align:start position:0%
foreign-born
people

05:17:42.770 --> 05:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:17:45.050 --> 05:17:45.060 align:start position:0%
and then you can compare that to New
 
05:17:47.090 --> 05:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
England and to the United States more
 
05:17:49.128 --> 05:17:49.138 align:start position:0%
generally and you can see the striking
 
05:17:50.810 --> 05:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
difference in the proportion of New
 
05:17:52.730 --> 05:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's population that was born
 
05:17:55.190 --> 05:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
somewhere else in the United States
 
05:17:57.170 --> 05:17:57.180 align:start position:0%
so for all of the people who think that
 
05:17:58.730 --> 05:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
this is where I mean that who remember
 
05:18:00.830 --> 05:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
the west wing and Jeb Bartlett who'd
 
05:18:02.810 --> 05:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
been in New Hampshire for what 10
 
05:18:04.510 --> 05:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
Generations somebody had signed the
 
05:18:07.250 --> 05:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Independence
 
05:18:09.948 --> 05:18:09.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is not really like that it
 
05:18:11.690 --> 05:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
has a very large proportion of its
 
05:18:13.730 --> 05:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
population born else how many of you
 
05:18:17.890 --> 05:18:17.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:23.990 --> 05:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:24.000 --> 05:18:25.970 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:18:25.970 --> 05:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:18:27.650 --> 05:18:27.660 align:start position:0%
there are still owning businesses here
 
05:18:29.510 --> 05:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
they're still doing all the things that
 
05:18:31.730 --> 05:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
people do in New Hampshire this is where
 
05:18:33.948 --> 05:18:33.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire domestic migrants that is
 
05:18:35.448 --> 05:18:35.458 align:start position:0%
people moving within the United States
 
05:18:38.868 --> 05:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
come from and as you can see the largest
 
05:18:41.050 --> 05:18:41.060 align:start position:0%
source of in-migrants to New Hampshire
 
05:18:44.628 --> 05:18:44.638 align:start position:0%
is Massachusetts in fact 23 percent of
 
05:18:46.550 --> 05:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
the people who live in New Hampshire
 
05:18:48.948 --> 05:18:48.958 align:start position:0%
were born in Massachusetts
 
05:18:51.110 --> 05:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh and then on the right hand side you
 
05:18:52.850 --> 05:18:52.860 align:start position:0%
can see when people leave New Hampshire
 
05:18:55.368 --> 05:18:55.378 align:start position:0%
where they go some go to Massachusetts
 
05:18:57.890 --> 05:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
many more go to the Sun Belt than come
 
05:19:00.830 --> 05:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
from the Sun Belt
 
05:19:04.128 --> 05:19:04.138 align:start position:0%
this is the population by age and you
 
05:19:06.830 --> 05:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
can see in these data that a large part
 
05:19:08.868 --> 05:19:08.878 align:start position:0%
of the working age population in
 
05:19:11.510 --> 05:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
particular was born elsewhere in the
 
05:19:13.190 --> 05:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
United States that is in New Hampshire
 
05:19:15.050 --> 05:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
so when we were talking about the
 
05:19:17.690 --> 05:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
working age population in this state a
 
05:19:20.330 --> 05:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
lot of them are from somewhere else in
 
05:19:22.368 --> 05:19:22.378 align:start position:0%
the United States relatively modest
 
05:19:25.250 --> 05:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
numbers are immigrants from other
 
05:19:25.260 --> 05:19:27.948 align:start position:0%
numbers are immigrants from other
countries

05:19:27.948 --> 05:19:27.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:30.708 --> 05:19:30.718 align:start position:0%
this is the educational attainment of
 
05:19:35.868 --> 05:19:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:39.288 --> 05:19:39.298 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire benefits from migration a
 
05:19:41.170 --> 05:19:41.180 align:start position:0%
substantial proportion of the population
 
05:19:43.910 --> 05:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
moving into New Hampshire is well
 
05:19:46.368 --> 05:19:46.378 align:start position:0%
educated you can see that in the gra on
 
05:19:48.170 --> 05:19:48.180 align:start position:0%
the right hand size of the graphs these
 
05:19:50.448 --> 05:19:50.458 align:start position:0%
are the number of college graduates and
 
05:19:53.930 --> 05:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
graduate people with graduate degrees in
 
05:19:56.750 --> 05:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and that 41 percent of New
 
05:19:58.610 --> 05:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's population I told you was
 
05:20:01.128 --> 05:20:01.138 align:start position:0%
born in the state of the population over
 
05:20:02.690 --> 05:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
the age of 20
 
05:20:07.070 --> 05:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
25 only 32 percent less than a third of
 
05:20:08.750 --> 05:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
the adult population in New Hampshire
 
05:20:12.288 --> 05:20:12.298 align:start position:0%
was born here so migration is a really
 
05:20:15.708 --> 05:20:15.718 align:start position:0%
important part of what happens in New
 
05:20:17.690 --> 05:20:17.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as you can see
 
05:20:20.330 --> 05:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
these are age-specific migration data
 
05:20:23.750 --> 05:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
the latest data the red bars are still
 
05:20:26.270 --> 05:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
still provisional we're still working on
 
05:20:27.610 --> 05:20:27.620 align:start position:0%
these data
 
05:20:30.650 --> 05:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
but they tell a story of who comes to
 
05:20:32.570 --> 05:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and who leaves New
 
05:20:35.948 --> 05:20:35.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you can see consistently
 
05:20:38.930 --> 05:20:38.940 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire gains people in their
 
05:20:41.330 --> 05:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
30s and 40s in their Prime working age
 
05:20:45.050 --> 05:20:45.060 align:start position:0%
that's those up bars that you can see
 
05:20:47.030 --> 05:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
and they also and their children come
 
05:20:49.190 --> 05:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
with them of course and so you can see
 
05:20:53.030 --> 05:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
the influx of children and the influx of
 
05:20:56.570 --> 05:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
working age family age adults New
 
05:20:58.850 --> 05:20:58.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has in some decades
 
05:21:01.550 --> 05:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
experienced a loss of young adults as
 
05:21:03.350 --> 05:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
far as we can tell in the last decade
 
05:21:06.050 --> 05:21:06.060 align:start position:0%
between 2010 and 2020 that didn't happen
 
05:21:08.868 --> 05:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
the number of young adults moving into
 
05:21:10.730 --> 05:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
and out of New Hampshire was essentially
 
05:21:13.850 --> 05:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
even and so New Hampshire essentially
 
05:21:15.890 --> 05:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
retained about the same number of people
 
05:21:19.128 --> 05:21:19.138 align:start position:0%
in their 20s as
 
05:21:21.830 --> 05:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
as would have been here uh
 
05:21:25.010 --> 05:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
otherwise now also another stereotype
 
05:21:26.330 --> 05:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
about New Hampshire is that lots of
 
05:21:28.430 --> 05:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
older adults move to New Hampshire and
 
05:21:30.530 --> 05:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
you can see there is a modest influx of
 
05:21:32.628 --> 05:21:32.638 align:start position:0%
older adults to the state but it's not
 
05:21:34.550 --> 05:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
as if everybody in Massachusetts packs
 
05:21:36.650 --> 05:21:36.660 align:start position:0%
up a U-Haul and moves here when they
 
05:21:39.288 --> 05:21:39.298 align:start position:0%
retire so again this is the age
 
05:21:41.510 --> 05:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
structure of the population and the
 
05:21:43.970 --> 05:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
migration patterns in the state
 
05:21:46.430 --> 05:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
and again many states would do anything
 
05:21:49.788 --> 05:21:49.798 align:start position:0%
to have a age-specific migration profile
 
05:21:52.368 --> 05:21:52.378 align:start position:0%
like this where they're receiving lots
 
05:21:54.590 --> 05:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
of people in their Prime working age
 
05:21:57.288 --> 05:21:57.298 align:start position:0%
groups well-educated people in those age
 
05:21:59.990 --> 05:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
groups and holding on to almost all of
 
05:22:02.628 --> 05:22:02.638 align:start position:0%
their 20-something year olds
 
05:22:04.730 --> 05:22:04.740 align:start position:0%
just to give you some idea of what kind
 
05:22:06.830 --> 05:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
of implications this has
 
05:22:09.410 --> 05:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
this shows you the number of children
 
05:22:11.330 --> 05:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
who are born in New Hampshire the blue
 
05:22:13.490 --> 05:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
bar and the number of children who begin
 
05:22:15.590 --> 05:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
first grade in New Hampshire six years
 
05:22:19.310 --> 05:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
later and you can see consistently more
 
05:22:21.288 --> 05:22:21.298 align:start position:0%
kids begin the first grade in New
 
05:22:23.208 --> 05:22:23.218 align:start position:0%
Hampshire than were born in the states
 
05:22:25.550 --> 05:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
six years previously in other words
 
05:22:28.128 --> 05:22:28.138 align:start position:0%
that's those parents coming to New
 
05:22:30.770 --> 05:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with their children
 
05:22:33.230 --> 05:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire all those New Hampshire
 
05:22:35.390 --> 05:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
school enrollment clearly is declining
 
05:22:38.270 --> 05:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
as you can see
 
05:22:41.570 --> 05:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
um this influx of working age people and
 
05:22:44.090 --> 05:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
their children helps to keep the number
 
05:22:46.970 --> 05:22:46.980 align:start position:0%
of children uh in New Hampshire in the
 
05:22:48.350 --> 05:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
school system
 
05:22:53.570 --> 05:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:55.250 --> 05:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
I can stop here for a minute if anybody
 
05:22:57.050 --> 05:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
has questions about that part of my talk
 
05:22:59.868 --> 05:22:59.878 align:start position:0%
before I go on
 
05:23:01.490 --> 05:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
I just want to keep an eye on time just
 
05:23:03.050 --> 05:23:03.060 align:start position:0%
so you know I promise we'd be done at
 
05:23:04.730 --> 05:23:04.740 align:start position:0%
three just so you know representative
 
05:23:06.590 --> 05:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
Petrie has a question
 
05:23:08.990 --> 05:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
I'm Sharon thank you for
 
05:23:12.708 --> 05:23:12.718 align:start position:0%
great presentation uh in the last uh
 
05:23:15.170 --> 05:23:15.180 align:start position:0%
probably 10 years we've lost 25 percent
 
05:23:17.810 --> 05:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
of our public school students you know
 
05:23:19.730 --> 05:23:19.740 align:start position:0%
not lost but the enrollments have
 
05:23:22.850 --> 05:23:22.860 align:start position:0%
diminished by 25 by that much how do we
 
05:23:25.128 --> 05:23:25.138 align:start position:0%
you know maintain labor force for that
 
05:23:27.288 --> 05:23:27.298 align:start position:0%
unless we have immigration
 
05:23:29.628 --> 05:23:29.638 align:start position:0%
I mean uh have you studied that area
 
05:23:32.690 --> 05:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
right I mean it is migration that helps
 
05:23:35.708 --> 05:23:35.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire keep sufficient young
 
05:23:38.750 --> 05:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
working age people to staff its
 
05:23:40.670 --> 05:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
employment structure
 
05:23:43.128 --> 05:23:43.138 align:start position:0%
and we I mean what are we going to do
 
05:23:45.770 --> 05:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
about it I mean migration will that you
 
05:23:47.990 --> 05:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
think that will maintain uh our
 
05:23:48.000 --> 05:23:49.670 align:start position:0%
think that will maintain uh our
Workforce

05:23:49.670 --> 05:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
Workforce
 
05:23:51.708 --> 05:23:51.718 align:start position:0%
I would say I mean given the age
 
05:23:54.170 --> 05:23:54.180 align:start position:0%
structure profiles of the population
 
05:23:57.770 --> 05:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
migrating into New Hampshire that is an
 
05:24:00.530 --> 05:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
important contributor to the to the size
 
05:24:02.030 --> 05:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
of the labor force whether it will
 
05:24:04.070 --> 05:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
offset the decline in the number of
 
05:24:06.470 --> 05:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
children I mean that's a question for a
 
05:24:08.390 --> 05:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
labor Economist not for a demographer
 
05:24:12.590 --> 05:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:14.628 --> 05:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
yes do you have a question
 
05:24:17.930 --> 05:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
I'm interested in that
 
05:24:21.948 --> 05:24:21.958 align:start position:0%
the 20 to 29 that did not leave the
 
05:24:24.708 --> 05:24:24.718 align:start position:0%
state in the last decade I know that
 
05:24:28.250 --> 05:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
we've had a number of students leave the
 
05:24:29.868 --> 05:24:29.878 align:start position:0%
state for for affordable higher
 
05:24:33.350 --> 05:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
education elsewhere can you explain that
 
05:24:36.288 --> 05:24:36.298 align:start position:0%
significant change in the last decade
 
05:24:38.330 --> 05:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
that the 20th year old has been saying
 
05:24:40.430 --> 05:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
right now again remember that we're
 
05:24:43.788 --> 05:24:43.798 align:start position:0%
looking at the the balance of the flow
 
05:24:45.830 --> 05:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
in and out of the state so there are
 
05:24:46.970 --> 05:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot you have to face
 
05:24:49.010 --> 05:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
forward so you're into the mic there
 
05:24:50.090 --> 05:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot of
 
05:24:53.570 --> 05:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
20-somethings leaving the state but
 
05:24:55.610 --> 05:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
in the last decade roughly the same
 
05:24:58.010 --> 05:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
number came to the state so it's that
 
05:25:01.070 --> 05:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
balance which produced that lack of loss
 
05:25:02.448 --> 05:25:02.458 align:start position:0%
in that period
 
05:25:06.470 --> 05:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
the data are so new that we I haven't
 
05:25:08.288 --> 05:25:08.298 align:start position:0%
had time to actually try and understand
 
05:25:12.050 --> 05:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
exactly what's driving that or if to
 
05:25:14.030 --> 05:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
what extent we can so
 
05:25:16.550 --> 05:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
but again I I
 
05:25:18.350 --> 05:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
it's important to recognize that there
 
05:25:20.930 --> 05:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
are big flows under any one of these
 
05:25:23.750 --> 05:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
nets so
 
05:25:26.448 --> 05:25:26.458 align:start position:0%
now as you all know from being in New
 
05:25:28.430 --> 05:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire demographic change varies
 
05:25:31.970 --> 05:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
across the state this shows you the 2010
 
05:25:35.510 --> 05:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
to 2020 decade uh
 
05:25:39.230 --> 05:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
and Compares it to 20 2000 to 2010. now
 
05:25:41.030 --> 05:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
you can see overall there's less growth
 
05:25:42.890 --> 05:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
in the state there's less of the Blues
 
05:25:46.010 --> 05:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
and dark greens but the patterns are
 
05:25:48.470 --> 05:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
fairly similar that is you can see that
 
05:25:52.430 --> 05:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
there's more uh growth in the southeast
 
05:25:54.708 --> 05:25:54.718 align:start position:0%
part of the state and less growth in the
 
05:25:56.570 --> 05:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
northern part of the state in both
 
05:25:59.930 --> 05:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
periods so the overall growth slowed in
 
05:26:02.090 --> 05:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
2010 to 2020 compared to the earlier
 
05:26:04.670 --> 05:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
decade but the patterns are fairly
 
05:26:06.890 --> 05:26:06.900 align:start position:0%
similar in where the growth was and
 
05:26:08.868 --> 05:26:08.878 align:start position:0%
where the decline was
 
05:26:11.628 --> 05:26:11.638 align:start position:0%
just to give you a little better idea I
 
05:26:13.250 --> 05:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
wanted to show you some of the counties
 
05:26:15.830 --> 05:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to focus on Three Counties
 
05:26:20.810 --> 05:26:20.820 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro Carol and koas
 
05:26:23.090 --> 05:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
and these are this is showing you the
 
05:26:25.070 --> 05:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
amount of population change the Red Bar
 
05:26:27.890 --> 05:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
the blue bar is natural increase and the
 
05:26:30.230 --> 05:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
gray bar is migration and so you can see
 
05:26:32.270 --> 05:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
that these Counties have very different
 
05:26:34.550 --> 05:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
profiles in how they've grown or
 
05:26:34.560 --> 05:26:35.810 align:start position:0%
profiles in how they've grown or
declined

05:26:35.810 --> 05:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
declined
 
05:26:39.410 --> 05:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
so let me focus in on them so you can
 
05:26:41.208 --> 05:26:41.218 align:start position:0%
see for example in Hillsborough County
 
05:26:44.270 --> 05:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
that the population growth has occurred
 
05:26:45.590 --> 05:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
through a combination of natural
 
05:26:48.288 --> 05:26:48.298 align:start position:0%
increase more burst than deaths and also
 
05:26:49.490 --> 05:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
for migration
 
05:26:52.070 --> 05:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
so those two things together fueled
 
05:26:56.150 --> 05:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
modest growth in Hillsborough County in
 
05:26:58.190 --> 05:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
contrast Carroll County which is a
 
05:27:00.730 --> 05:27:00.740 align:start position:0%
recreational and amenity County
 
05:27:03.410 --> 05:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
experiences all of its growth for
 
05:27:03.420 --> 05:27:04.730 align:start position:0%
experiences all of its growth for
migration

05:27:04.730 --> 05:27:04.740 align:start position:0%
migration
 
05:27:06.770 --> 05:27:06.780 align:start position:0%
now this has come there are about 300
 
05:27:08.510 --> 05:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
counties like Carroll around the United
 
05:27:11.150 --> 05:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
States which are big recreational or
 
05:27:14.270 --> 05:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
amenity counties and this is a very
 
05:27:16.368 --> 05:27:16.378 align:start position:0%
typical profile for them that is they
 
05:27:18.830 --> 05:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
receive lots of migrants many of them
 
05:27:20.390 --> 05:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
older adults
 
05:27:23.090 --> 05:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
near retirement age
 
05:27:26.330 --> 05:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
but they have relatively modest sized
 
05:27:29.208 --> 05:27:29.218 align:start position:0%
populations of childbearing age and that
 
05:27:31.850 --> 05:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
plus the influx of older adults who
 
05:27:33.610 --> 05:27:33.620 align:start position:0%
eventually will have higher mortality
 
05:27:36.530 --> 05:27:36.540 align:start position:0%
produces natural decrease now of course
 
05:27:38.570 --> 05:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
this was accelerated these these data
 
05:27:40.788 --> 05:27:40.798 align:start position:0%
don't show the covid period but they
 
05:27:43.610 --> 05:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
were accelerated by the onset of covid
 
05:27:45.890 --> 05:27:45.900 align:start position:0%
and the other thing that
 
05:27:49.310 --> 05:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
is interesting here is that in the in
 
05:27:52.490 --> 05:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
the period of the pandemic
 
05:27:54.890 --> 05:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
we have seen in the United States
 
05:27:57.050 --> 05:27:57.060 align:start position:0%
generally and in New Hampshire in
 
05:27:59.930 --> 05:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
particular at least originally in the
 
05:28:02.330 --> 05:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
first year of the pandemic there was an
 
05:28:05.150 --> 05:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
inflow of migrants to recreational and
 
05:28:07.910 --> 05:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
amenity counties in some cases they were
 
05:28:10.430 --> 05:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
people moving to their second homes they
 
05:28:12.770 --> 05:28:12.780 align:start position:0%
already owned and staying in the more
 
05:28:15.230 --> 05:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
because of the flexibility of work or
 
05:28:17.570 --> 05:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
because of their concerns with the
 
05:28:17.580 --> 05:28:18.890 align:start position:0%
because of their concerns with the
pandemic

05:28:18.890 --> 05:28:18.900 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
05:28:21.770 --> 05:28:21.780 align:start position:0%
in other cases it may have been people
 
05:28:23.810 --> 05:28:23.820 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of the flexibility of
 
05:28:28.010 --> 05:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
work to move to a place where they had
 
05:28:29.750 --> 05:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
accessed outside amenities and
 
05:28:31.850 --> 05:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
Recreation and many of them have prior
 
05:28:34.310 --> 05:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
experience in these places so this was
 
05:28:36.470 --> 05:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
very common in the early stages of the
 
05:28:39.230 --> 05:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic it's a little unclear
 
05:28:42.708 --> 05:28:42.718 align:start position:0%
how much of that is continuing we've
 
05:28:44.930 --> 05:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
been looking at cell phone data and
 
05:28:47.810 --> 05:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
other kinds of of data change of address
 
05:28:52.010 --> 05:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
data and it suggests that that
 
05:28:54.530 --> 05:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
tendency may have slowed in the second
 
05:28:56.930 --> 05:28:56.940 align:start position:0%
year of the pandemic but we just don't
 
05:28:59.390 --> 05:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough data yet at the
 
05:29:01.550 --> 05:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
county level to be able to do that to
 
05:29:04.128 --> 05:29:04.138 align:start position:0%
tell for sure but anyway that's and then
 
05:29:07.010 --> 05:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
koas County the most northern County and
 
05:29:10.190 --> 05:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
the in the state experiences substantial
 
05:29:12.830 --> 05:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
natural decrease and in part this kind
 
05:29:14.390 --> 05:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
of natural decrease that's going on in
 
05:29:16.490 --> 05:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
coax County and a lot of other counties
 
05:29:19.250 --> 05:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
like it is a function of the long-term
 
05:29:21.230 --> 05:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
outflow of young adults from the labor
 
05:29:23.930 --> 05:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
from the counties in other words people
 
05:29:26.390 --> 05:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
in their 20s tend to leave counties like
 
05:29:30.830 --> 05:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
these older people stay over time as the
 
05:29:33.410 --> 05:29:33.420 align:start position:0%
number of young people keep leaving and
 
05:29:36.230 --> 05:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
the older population ages in place there
 
05:29:38.330 --> 05:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
are relatively few young women of
 
05:29:40.788 --> 05:29:40.798 align:start position:0%
childbearing age to produce children and
 
05:29:43.190 --> 05:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
there are more more older adults at high
 
05:29:46.128 --> 05:29:46.138 align:start position:0%
risk of mortality who began to die and
 
05:29:48.530 --> 05:29:48.540 align:start position:0%
so that's the kind of impact that you
 
05:29:51.288 --> 05:29:51.298 align:start position:0%
can see in a county like koas so even in
 
05:29:53.448 --> 05:29:53.458 align:start position:0%
a small state like New Hampshire you can
 
05:29:54.830 --> 05:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
see very different demographic
 
05:29:57.288 --> 05:29:57.298 align:start position:0%
Tendencies playing out over this over
 
05:29:59.628 --> 05:29:59.638 align:start position:0%
the the state
 
05:30:02.150 --> 05:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
this is and then here I focus in on just
 
05:30:04.868 --> 05:30:04.878 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County so that you can see
 
05:30:07.970 --> 05:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Nashua compared to the
 
05:30:09.890 --> 05:30:09.900 align:start position:0%
rest of Hillsborough County which I call
 
05:30:13.310 --> 05:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
the Suburban areas I'm sure if I were to
 
05:30:14.750 --> 05:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
say that in Hillsborough County there
 
05:30:16.490 --> 05:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
would be objections to that in some
 
05:30:19.850 --> 05:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
places but just bear with me and you can
 
05:30:21.530 --> 05:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
see the very different patterns in
 
05:30:23.690 --> 05:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Nashua which depend
 
05:30:26.150 --> 05:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
primarily on natural increase to fuel
 
05:30:27.610 --> 05:30:27.620 align:start position:0%
the increases in their population
 
05:30:30.170 --> 05:30:30.180 align:start position:0%
compared to the suburbs which are
 
05:30:33.368 --> 05:30:33.378 align:start position:0%
experiencing more migration into them
 
05:30:36.650 --> 05:30:36.660 align:start position:0%
and also have some natural increase now
 
05:30:38.990 --> 05:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
these patterns would be very consistent
 
05:30:41.208 --> 05:30:41.218 align:start position:0%
with what you would see in urban areas
 
05:30:43.128 --> 05:30:43.138 align:start position:0%
around the United States larger urban
 
05:30:45.708 --> 05:30:45.718 align:start position:0%
areas as well that is that they depend a
 
05:30:48.590 --> 05:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
lot on natural increase and that they
 
05:30:51.288 --> 05:30:51.298 align:start position:0%
experience relatively low levels of
 
05:30:53.930 --> 05:30:53.940 align:start position:0%
migration or out in many big urban areas
 
05:30:55.730 --> 05:30:55.740 align:start position:0%
they may actually experience out
 
05:30:58.070 --> 05:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
migration particularly we interrupt for
 
05:31:00.830 --> 05:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
a quick question representative a bit of
 
05:31:03.288 --> 05:31:03.298 align:start position:0%
a quick statement I'm from glasstown in
 
05:31:05.390 --> 05:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County one of those suburbs
 
05:31:07.970 --> 05:31:07.980 align:start position:0%
and you said nothing objectionable good
 
05:31:09.410 --> 05:31:09.420 align:start position:0%
I'm glad
 
05:31:11.448 --> 05:31:11.458 align:start position:0%
I always feel like I'm walking on eggs
 
05:31:15.230 --> 05:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
when I lump groups together so
 
05:31:17.270 --> 05:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
any other questions about this before I
 
05:31:23.330 --> 05:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:27.170 --> 05:31:27.180 align:start position:0%
this is this is age specific
 
05:31:29.628 --> 05:31:29.638 align:start position:0%
change in the New Hampshire population
 
05:31:31.490 --> 05:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's population is aging
 
05:31:33.650 --> 05:31:33.660 align:start position:0%
that's no surprise to any of you you
 
05:31:36.170 --> 05:31:36.180 align:start position:0%
know you've heard that before but I just
 
05:31:38.628 --> 05:31:38.638 align:start position:0%
wanted to show you how that process is
 
05:31:41.230 --> 05:31:41.240 align:start position:0%
going on so these are three different
 
05:31:44.930 --> 05:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
decades the blue bar is the 1990s the
 
05:31:47.208 --> 05:31:47.218 align:start position:0%
red bar is the 2000s and the green bar
 
05:31:51.110 --> 05:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
is 2010 to 2019. we don't have the data
 
05:31:53.330 --> 05:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
at this level of detail from the 2020
 
05:31:55.850 --> 05:31:55.860 align:start position:0%
Census Data yet
 
05:31:58.128 --> 05:31:58.138 align:start position:0%
and I got I want to show you two
 
05:31:59.868 --> 05:31:59.878 align:start position:0%
different cohorts
 
05:32:01.970 --> 05:32:01.980 align:start position:0%
that the Blue Core the one that's
 
05:32:04.010 --> 05:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
labeled at the top with the blue arrows
 
05:32:05.628 --> 05:32:05.638 align:start position:0%
those are people who were born between
 
05:32:08.330 --> 05:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
1950 and 1959 in other words the heart
 
05:32:11.030 --> 05:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
of the baby boom New Hampshire received
 
05:32:14.330 --> 05:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
a big influx of baby boom era people
 
05:32:17.030 --> 05:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
over the period from the 1970s forward
 
05:32:20.270 --> 05:32:20.280 align:start position:0%
and they've aged and so you can see over
 
05:32:22.610 --> 05:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
the course of the three decades them
 
05:32:25.010 --> 05:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
moving from being in their 40s to being
 
05:32:28.610 --> 05:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
in their 50s to being in their 60s and
 
05:32:30.590 --> 05:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
how the population in that age group
 
05:32:33.288 --> 05:32:33.298 align:start position:0%
grew in New Hampshire as they moved
 
05:32:35.750 --> 05:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
through the age structure in contrast
 
05:32:39.110 --> 05:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
the population born in the 1970s who
 
05:32:40.910 --> 05:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
were the children actually of the baby
 
05:32:40.920 --> 05:32:41.868 align:start position:0%
were the children actually of the baby
boom

05:32:41.868 --> 05:32:41.878 align:start position:0%
boom
 
05:32:44.510 --> 05:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
and you may remember that if you are a
 
05:32:46.430 --> 05:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
member of the baby boom that your own
 
05:32:49.310 --> 05:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
parents kind of grudgingly waited for
 
05:32:51.170 --> 05:32:51.180 align:start position:0%
you to have children a little bit later
 
05:32:52.910 --> 05:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
than they had
 
05:32:54.890 --> 05:32:54.900 align:start position:0%
there was a lag in the number of babies
 
05:32:56.810 --> 05:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
being born at that time those are
 
05:32:59.448 --> 05:32:59.458 align:start position:0%
relatively small cohorts and you can see
 
05:33:02.150 --> 05:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
as they move through the age structure
 
05:33:04.730 --> 05:33:04.740 align:start position:0%
there's a drop in the size of those age
 
05:33:06.650 --> 05:33:06.660 align:start position:0%
groups as they move from being in their
 
05:33:09.890 --> 05:33:09.900 align:start position:0%
20s to into their 30s to into their 40s
 
05:33:12.230 --> 05:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
and so you can see the shifting of New
 
05:33:14.990 --> 05:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's age structure here with the
 
05:33:16.788 --> 05:33:16.798 align:start position:0%
increase in the older part of the age
 
05:33:19.310 --> 05:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
structure and declines in the small in
 
05:33:21.590 --> 05:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
the in the young adult part of the age
 
05:33:25.310 --> 05:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
structure as these cohorts move through
 
05:33:27.590 --> 05:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
this is a population pyramid that
 
05:33:29.868 --> 05:33:29.878 align:start position:0%
demographers use to illustrate the
 
05:33:32.510 --> 05:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
population the red side
 
05:33:35.930 --> 05:33:35.940 align:start position:0%
is women the blue side is men this is
 
05:33:38.390 --> 05:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
the age structure in 1990 so this
 
05:33:41.770 --> 05:33:41.780 align:start position:0%
youngest babies born between 1986 and
 
05:33:44.390 --> 05:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
1990 are the ones at the very bottom who
 
05:33:45.890 --> 05:33:45.900 align:start position:0%
are zero to four
 
05:33:48.288 --> 05:33:48.298 align:start position:0%
and the one of those big baby boom
 
05:33:51.830 --> 05:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
cohorts born between 1956 and 60. you
 
05:33:53.868 --> 05:33:53.878 align:start position:0%
can see them in their 30s
 
05:33:55.788 --> 05:33:55.798 align:start position:0%
and so this is what the age structure of
 
05:33:58.610 --> 05:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire looked like in 1990 I'm
 
05:34:01.550 --> 05:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
going to let you see it age ahead now so
 
05:34:02.990 --> 05:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
you can see what it looks like now
 
05:34:04.970 --> 05:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
notice that the average age in New
 
05:34:08.990 --> 05:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in 1990 was 32.8
 
05:34:11.030 --> 05:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
here it here's that same age structure
 
05:34:14.628 --> 05:34:14.638 align:start position:0%
in 2000 people are aging in place plus
 
05:34:16.430 --> 05:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
the migration streams are coming and
 
05:34:16.440 --> 05:34:17.628 align:start position:0%
the migration streams are coming and
going

05:34:17.628 --> 05:34:17.638 align:start position:0%
going
 
05:34:20.570 --> 05:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
the population gets older that little
 
05:34:23.628 --> 05:34:23.638 align:start position:0%
cohort that you saw that was born uh
 
05:34:25.368 --> 05:34:25.378 align:start position:0%
that was zero to four in the last slide
 
05:34:29.390 --> 05:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
now is 10 to 14 and that's 76 to 80
 
05:34:31.788 --> 05:34:31.798 align:start position:0%
cohort that when I told you that was
 
05:34:33.410 --> 05:34:33.420 align:start position:0%
small because there hadn't been as many
 
05:34:35.690 --> 05:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
births in that period you can see that
 
05:34:38.750 --> 05:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
notch in the pyramid where they are and
 
05:34:40.670 --> 05:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
then the Baby Boomers are now in their
 
05:34:44.570 --> 05:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
40s here's the same pyramid in 2010
 
05:34:47.448 --> 05:34:47.458 align:start position:0%
see the population aging median age is
 
05:34:51.650 --> 05:34:51.660 align:start position:0%
now 41 up from 32 in 1990 and those
 
05:34:53.270 --> 05:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
cohorts are moving up through the age
 
05:34:56.330 --> 05:34:56.340 align:start position:0%
structure and then finally this is the
 
05:34:59.390 --> 05:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
newest data that we have and you can one
 
05:35:01.430 --> 05:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
of the things I want you to see is how
 
05:35:03.288 --> 05:35:03.298 align:start position:0%
big those cohorts that were the Baby
 
05:35:05.628 --> 05:35:05.638 align:start position:0%
Boomers were in the now in their 50s and
 
05:35:10.970 --> 05:35:10.980 align:start position:0%
60s and early 70s how big they are 214
 
05:35:16.128 --> 05:35:16.138 align:start position:0%
000 in the cohort 60 to 69 and 183 000
 
05:35:18.830 --> 05:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
in the cohort 50 to 59 and then notice
 
05:35:21.530 --> 05:35:21.540 align:start position:0%
how much smaller the cohorts behind them
 
05:35:21.540 --> 05:35:22.730 align:start position:0%
how much smaller the cohorts behind them
are

05:35:22.730 --> 05:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:35:25.850 --> 05:35:25.860 align:start position:0%
so that it's that that bulge is coming
 
05:35:28.010 --> 05:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
up through the age structure
 
05:35:31.430 --> 05:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
and is the result of New Hampshire's
 
05:35:31.440 --> 05:35:32.810 align:start position:0%
and is the result of New Hampshire's
population

05:35:32.810 --> 05:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
population
 
05:35:34.910 --> 05:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
getting older now as you saw from the a
 
05:35:37.550 --> 05:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
specific migration data it's not as if
 
05:35:39.650 --> 05:35:39.660 align:start position:0%
huge numbers of older adults are
 
05:35:41.930 --> 05:35:41.940 align:start position:0%
flooding into New Hampshire it's the
 
05:35:43.970 --> 05:35:43.980 align:start position:0%
Aging in place of New Hampshire's
 
05:35:50.090 --> 05:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:54.110 --> 05:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
thank you does this imply a a shrinking
 
05:35:56.810 --> 05:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
population going forward and when should
 
05:35:59.510 --> 05:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
we start seeing it based on that data a
 
05:36:00.830 --> 05:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
lot depends on what happens with
 
05:36:00.840 --> 05:36:02.270 align:start position:0%
lot depends on what happens with
migration

05:36:02.270 --> 05:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
migration
 
05:36:05.570 --> 05:36:05.580 align:start position:0%
you can see already that the
 
05:36:08.510 --> 05:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
the growth of that age structure
 
05:36:10.788 --> 05:36:10.798 align:start position:0%
of that older age structure is going to
 
05:36:14.090 --> 05:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
increase mortality in the state there
 
05:36:16.190 --> 05:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
are relatively few women of childbearing
 
05:36:18.708 --> 05:36:18.718 align:start position:0%
age and New Hampshire's birth rate is
 
05:36:20.208 --> 05:36:20.218 align:start position:0%
relatively low
 
05:36:22.910 --> 05:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
so the number of children being born is
 
05:36:25.368 --> 05:36:25.378 align:start position:0%
diminishing and so
 
05:36:27.410 --> 05:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
there will be continuing natural
 
05:36:29.690 --> 05:36:29.700 align:start position:0%
decrease that is more deaths than birth
 
05:36:31.970 --> 05:36:31.980 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire in the future whether
 
05:36:33.770 --> 05:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
the population of the state will grow or
 
05:36:35.810 --> 05:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
not depends on migration particularly
 
05:36:38.570 --> 05:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
domestic migration but also to a lesser
 
05:36:43.128 --> 05:36:43.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:46.610 --> 05:36:46.620 align:start position:0%
just and again
 
05:36:48.890 --> 05:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of variability within New
 
05:36:51.230 --> 05:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so this is the youngest these
 
05:36:53.448 --> 05:36:53.458 align:start position:0%
are the children in New Hampshire
 
05:36:56.030 --> 05:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
on the left hand side is What proportion
 
05:36:59.208 --> 05:36:59.218 align:start position:0%
of the communities are children and on
 
05:37:01.128 --> 05:37:01.138 align:start position:0%
the right hand side is the actual number
 
05:37:04.250 --> 05:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
of children in those areas so you can
 
05:37:06.170 --> 05:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
see for example in the southeast part of
 
05:37:08.390 --> 05:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
the state not only are a large
 
05:37:10.670 --> 05:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
proportion of the larger proportion of
 
05:37:13.310 --> 05:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
the population children that yellow
 
05:37:15.948 --> 05:37:15.958 align:start position:0%
or orange but also that's where a lot of
 
05:37:17.750 --> 05:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
the children are now again I know this
 
05:37:21.770 --> 05:37:21.780 align:start position:0%
is no news to you but it just shows you
 
05:37:24.650 --> 05:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
how much variability there is within the
 
05:37:26.570 --> 05:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
state and for a legislature that has to
 
05:37:28.970 --> 05:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
think about a whole state
 
05:37:31.250 --> 05:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
I just want to hope that you recognize
 
05:37:33.470 --> 05:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
that there is such striking variability
 
05:37:35.570 --> 05:37:35.580 align:start position:0%
even within the state
 
05:37:37.910 --> 05:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
this is the working age population or
 
05:37:37.920 --> 05:37:38.990 align:start position:0%
this is the working age population or
six

05:37:38.990 --> 05:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
six
 
05:37:42.288 --> 05:37:42.298 align:start position:0%
18 to 64 anyway and again you can see
 
05:37:44.270 --> 05:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
the same patterns that is that there
 
05:37:46.250 --> 05:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
there's more of a concentration in the
 
05:37:48.110 --> 05:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
Southeast and the mid part of the state
 
05:37:51.288 --> 05:37:51.298 align:start position:0%
than in the north and again it's not
 
05:37:53.448 --> 05:37:53.458 align:start position:0%
just the distribution by percentages
 
05:37:55.730 --> 05:37:55.740 align:start position:0%
which is what the left-hand graph is
 
05:37:57.410 --> 05:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
showing What proportion of the
 
05:37:59.570 --> 05:37:59.580 align:start position:0%
population is in this age group you can
 
05:38:01.970 --> 05:38:01.980 align:start position:0%
also see in the right hand map where the
 
05:38:04.730 --> 05:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
population literally is
 
05:38:07.670 --> 05:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
and then this is the older population
 
05:38:08.990 --> 05:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
and you can see that there are
 
05:38:11.390 --> 05:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
differences that the population on
 
05:38:13.490 --> 05:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
average is older in the northern part of
 
05:38:15.410 --> 05:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
the state than it is in the southern
 
05:38:17.030 --> 05:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
part of the state
 
05:38:19.250 --> 05:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
but the most older adults in New
 
05:38:20.690 --> 05:38:20.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are in the southern part of
 
05:38:22.070 --> 05:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
the state because that's where most of
 
05:38:23.868 --> 05:38:23.878 align:start position:0%
the population is
 
05:38:25.850 --> 05:38:25.860 align:start position:0%
so this is going to create challenges
 
05:38:28.430 --> 05:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
for agencies and units that are
 
05:38:31.670 --> 05:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
age-based for example school systems in
 
05:38:33.110 --> 05:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
the northern part of the state may be
 
05:38:35.090 --> 05:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
worried about closing schools or cons
 
05:38:37.788 --> 05:38:37.798 align:start position:0%
even the dreaded word of consolidating
 
05:38:40.610 --> 05:38:40.620 align:start position:0%
school districts which sets people on
 
05:38:42.770 --> 05:38:42.780 align:start position:0%
edge everywhere
 
05:38:46.368 --> 05:38:46.378 align:start position:0%
but those same places may have growing
 
05:38:48.230 --> 05:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
numbers of older adults which are going
 
05:38:50.750 --> 05:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
to put other demands on local government
 
05:38:54.288 --> 05:38:54.298 align:start position:0%
and state agencies for for things in
 
05:38:57.530 --> 05:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
that in that age group so there's a lot
 
05:39:00.288 --> 05:39:00.298 align:start position:0%
of diversity within this state on age
 
05:39:04.070 --> 05:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
both in where the numbers are and how
 
05:39:06.770 --> 05:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
the population is distributed
 
05:39:09.170 --> 05:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
this this is just one this is one more
 
05:39:11.330 --> 05:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
point I wanted you to make you'll often
 
05:39:13.368 --> 05:39:13.378 align:start position:0%
hear about how New Hampshire is the
 
05:39:16.070 --> 05:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
oldest or one of the oldest states in
 
05:39:18.410 --> 05:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
the country and I just wanted to show on
 
05:39:20.810 --> 05:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
two different measures the upper measure
 
05:39:22.690 --> 05:39:22.700 align:start position:0%
is the percentage of the population over
 
05:39:25.310 --> 05:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
65. and you can see that New Hampshire
 
05:39:28.010 --> 05:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
is about eighth in terms of the
 
05:39:31.730 --> 05:39:31.740 align:start position:0%
population over 65. the median age in
 
05:39:34.368 --> 05:39:34.378 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the second highest and
 
05:39:36.288 --> 05:39:36.298 align:start position:0%
that's primarily because so much of the
 
05:39:38.390 --> 05:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire population is in the baby
 
05:39:41.810 --> 05:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
boom cohorts and so that big block of
 
05:39:44.628 --> 05:39:44.638 align:start position:0%
people raises the median age in the
 
05:39:46.610 --> 05:39:46.620 align:start position:0%
state so
 
05:39:48.470 --> 05:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire certainly has an older
 
05:39:51.470 --> 05:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
population out where it stands in
 
05:39:53.330 --> 05:39:53.340 align:start position:0%
comparison other states depends in part
 
05:39:56.810 --> 05:39:56.820 align:start position:0%
on how you measure it
 
05:39:58.730 --> 05:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
questions about this part before I move
 
05:39:58.740 --> 05:39:59.628 align:start position:0%
questions about this part before I move
on

05:39:59.628 --> 05:39:59.638 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:40:02.448 --> 05:40:02.458 align:start position:0%
sorry I I know you should be doing that
 
05:40:08.448 --> 05:40:08.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:08.458 --> 05:40:10.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:40:10.430 --> 05:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:40:13.550 --> 05:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
diversity now you've all heard New
 
05:40:15.708 --> 05:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's not very diverse
 
05:40:17.690 --> 05:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
and in fact it is among the least
 
05:40:19.670 --> 05:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
diverse states in the United States but
 
05:40:22.070 --> 05:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
its diversity is increasing and I think
 
05:40:25.628 --> 05:40:25.638 align:start position:0%
that has important implications for many
 
05:40:27.830 --> 05:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
issues that come before the state
 
05:40:30.470 --> 05:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
legislature this is the diversity of new
 
05:40:32.810 --> 05:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
of the United States population by
 
05:40:36.170 --> 05:40:36.180 align:start position:0%
County so this is the chances that two
 
05:40:38.628 --> 05:40:38.638 align:start position:0%
people who meet randomly on the street
 
05:40:40.730 --> 05:40:40.740 align:start position:0%
would be of different racial or ethnic
 
05:40:40.740 --> 05:40:41.690 align:start position:0%
would be of different racial or ethnic
groups

05:40:41.690 --> 05:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
groups
 
05:40:43.970 --> 05:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
and so the yellows and the oranges are
 
05:40:45.530 --> 05:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
the most diverse parts of the United
 
05:40:48.590 --> 05:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
States and the blues and the greens are
 
05:40:50.150 --> 05:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
the least diverse parts of the United
 
05:40:52.788 --> 05:40:52.798 align:start position:0%
States so you can see on a graphic like
 
05:40:54.050 --> 05:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
this that Northern New Hampshire
 
05:40:57.170 --> 05:40:57.180 align:start position:0%
Northern New England is not exactly uh
 
05:40:59.090 --> 05:40:59.100 align:start position:0%
among the most diverse parts of the
 
05:40:59.100 --> 05:41:00.350 align:start position:0%
among the most diverse parts of the
country

05:41:00.350 --> 05:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
country
 
05:41:03.230 --> 05:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
this is a close-up that shows you just
 
05:41:05.510 --> 05:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
New England and you can see the striking
 
05:41:07.970 --> 05:41:07.980 align:start position:0%
difference between the southern states
 
05:41:10.190 --> 05:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
and New England and the northern part of
 
05:41:11.390 --> 05:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
New England
 
05:41:13.670 --> 05:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
there is some diversity as I'll show you
 
05:41:16.368 --> 05:41:16.378 align:start position:0%
but it it does vary
 
05:41:19.190 --> 05:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
this is New Hampshire's population in 20
 
05:41:22.730 --> 05:41:22.740 align:start position:0%
from the 2020 census so this is the
 
05:41:25.490 --> 05:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
racial breakdown and ethnic breakdown of
 
05:41:28.610 --> 05:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
the state and the way this is set up the
 
05:41:30.830 --> 05:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
white population is the non-hispanic
 
05:41:32.750 --> 05:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
white population now there's a lot of
 
05:41:35.030 --> 05:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
different ways that diversity can be
 
05:41:36.830 --> 05:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
measured but the one that's used most by
 
05:41:40.310 --> 05:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
demographers is to treat non-hispanic
 
05:41:43.670 --> 05:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
whites and in fact non-hispanics as
 
05:41:46.850 --> 05:41:46.860 align:start position:0%
racial groups but treat Hispanics as
 
05:41:49.310 --> 05:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
another group now the way the Census
 
05:41:52.010 --> 05:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
Bureau actually asks the question is a
 
05:41:53.570 --> 05:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
little different than this
 
05:41:56.750 --> 05:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
and Hispanics would be very unhappy
 
05:41:59.030 --> 05:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
about all being lumped into one category
 
05:42:01.850 --> 05:42:01.860 align:start position:0%
like this uh just like when you used to
 
05:42:03.770 --> 05:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
put Italians and swedes in the same
 
05:42:06.050 --> 05:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
category you'd have problems but anyway
 
05:42:07.490 --> 05:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
that's just the way these data are
 
05:42:09.650 --> 05:42:09.660 align:start position:0%
defined so this is the population of New
 
05:42:12.530 --> 05:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire about 12.8 percent of New
 
05:42:14.750 --> 05:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's population is minority that
 
05:42:18.170 --> 05:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
is it's not non-hispanic white
 
05:42:20.150 --> 05:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
but here's a key point
 
05:42:23.628 --> 05:42:23.638 align:start position:0%
between 19 2010 and 2020 all of the
 
05:42:25.670 --> 05:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
growth all of the growth in New
 
05:42:28.910 --> 05:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's population was minority the
 
05:42:30.770 --> 05:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
white non-hispanic white population of
 
05:42:32.930 --> 05:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire actually got smaller
 
05:42:35.868 --> 05:42:35.878 align:start position:0%
between 2010 and 2020 slightly smaller
 
05:42:38.750 --> 05:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
so all the growth in the population came
 
05:42:40.250 --> 05:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
from minorities only the even though
 
05:42:42.230 --> 05:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
they only represented 12.8 percent of
 
05:42:44.390 --> 05:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
the population they produced all the
 
05:42:47.090 --> 05:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
population increase
 
05:42:49.010 --> 05:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
and another key point and this is true
 
05:42:50.750 --> 05:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
not just in New Hampshire but all over
 
05:42:53.510 --> 05:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
the United States the most diverse part
 
05:42:57.948 --> 05:42:57.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:00.288 --> 05:43:00.298 align:start position:0%
and so you can see the Striking contrast
 
05:43:02.990 --> 05:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
here 20 over 20 percent of New
 
05:43:05.990 --> 05:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's child population is minority
 
05:43:08.030 --> 05:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
but only 11 percent of it's an adult
 
05:43:11.390 --> 05:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
population so the diversity is coming to
 
05:43:14.150 --> 05:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire from the bottom up so any
 
05:43:16.070 --> 05:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
agency or
 
05:43:19.070 --> 05:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
organization that deals with children is
 
05:43:21.110 --> 05:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
going to face diversity
 
05:43:24.288 --> 05:43:24.298 align:start position:0%
earlier or more more frequently than
 
05:43:26.628 --> 05:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
older groups are
 
05:43:28.070 --> 05:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
so I have a daughter who's a
 
05:43:30.110 --> 05:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
pediatrician in a hospital
 
05:43:32.270 --> 05:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
and not in New Hampshire but in the
 
05:43:34.970 --> 05:43:34.980 align:start position:0%
Midwest and she will often tell me that
 
05:43:38.208 --> 05:43:38.218 align:start position:0%
when people come into the hospital often
 
05:43:41.270 --> 05:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
the children have to translate for the
 
05:43:43.610 --> 05:43:43.620 align:start position:0%
parents and she said it puts them in an
 
05:43:44.990 --> 05:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
I mean you can imagine the awkward
 
05:43:46.730 --> 05:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
position with the questions that doctors
 
05:43:48.170 --> 05:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
would have to ask
 
05:43:50.810 --> 05:43:50.820 align:start position:0%
about but I mean you can just see it's
 
05:43:52.788 --> 05:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
one way that this is going to play out
 
05:43:56.390 --> 05:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
is with the child population being the
 
05:43:58.190 --> 05:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
most diverse
 
05:43:58.200 --> 05:43:58.850 align:start position:0%
most diverse
um

05:43:58.850 --> 05:43:58.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:01.368 --> 05:44:01.378 align:start position:0%
it has lots of implications for schools
 
05:44:05.150 --> 05:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:07.970 --> 05:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
so again just a key Point diversity is
 
05:44:10.730 --> 05:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
greater among the child population
 
05:44:12.470 --> 05:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
and that's true all over the United
 
05:44:14.628 --> 05:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
States not just here the most diverse
 
05:44:16.670 --> 05:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
part of the population of the babies
 
05:44:18.288 --> 05:44:18.298 align:start position:0%
that have just been born in the United
 
05:44:20.930 --> 05:44:20.940 align:start position:0%
States the least diverse are the people
 
05:44:23.750 --> 05:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
at the oldest age groups so in New
 
05:44:26.330 --> 05:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire about 88 percent of the births
 
05:44:30.110 --> 05:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
are non-hispanic white 98 of the deaths
 
05:44:32.510 --> 05:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
are non-hispanic white may we interrupt
 
05:44:34.010 --> 05:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
for a quick question right behind you
 
05:44:36.470 --> 05:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards yes thank you
 
05:44:39.110 --> 05:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair I'm just curious what other
 
05:44:41.270 --> 05:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
is Mike as I'm sitting here guessing I'm
 
05:44:43.610 --> 05:44:43.620 align:start position:0%
thinking it's multi-racial or just
 
05:44:46.250 --> 05:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
unknown data it's small yes it's
 
05:44:50.270 --> 05:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
multi-racial it's a native alaskans and
 
05:44:53.510 --> 05:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
Hawaiians it's people
 
05:44:53.520 --> 05:44:54.170 align:start position:0%
Hawaiians it's people
um

05:44:54.170 --> 05:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:59.628 --> 05:44:59.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:01.730 --> 05:45:01.740 align:start position:0%
knowledge on everyone's race in the
 
05:45:04.250 --> 05:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
state or is there how how big is your
 
05:45:06.530 --> 05:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
unknown or your fudge back these data
 
05:45:08.390 --> 05:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
come directly from the Census so they're
 
05:45:10.490 --> 05:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
the self-reported race of each
 
05:45:12.350 --> 05:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
individual who filled out a census
 
05:45:12.360 --> 05:45:13.490 align:start position:0%
individual who filled out a census
questionnaire

05:45:13.490 --> 05:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
questionnaire
 
05:45:15.850 --> 05:45:15.860 align:start position:0%
which was filled out by approximately
 
05:45:24.048 --> 05:45:24.058 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:25.730 --> 05:45:25.740 align:start position:0%
this is the change in New Hampshire's
 
05:45:29.150 --> 05:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
population between 2000 and 2019. so
 
05:45:31.490 --> 05:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
this is a 20-year period and it shows
 
05:45:33.288 --> 05:45:33.298 align:start position:0%
the changes in the different age groups
 
05:45:36.230 --> 05:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
within the population so the number of
 
05:45:38.810 --> 05:45:38.820 align:start position:0%
white children has diminished the number
 
05:45:41.510 --> 05:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
of minority children increased modestly
 
05:45:43.670 --> 05:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
I mean you can see the graph the point
 
05:45:46.128 --> 05:45:46.138 align:start position:0%
would be that the growth of the white
 
05:45:48.590 --> 05:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
population is primarily in the older
 
05:45:48.600 --> 05:45:49.570 align:start position:0%
population is primarily in the older
population

05:45:49.570 --> 05:45:49.580 align:start position:0%
population
 
05:45:52.128 --> 05:45:52.138 align:start position:0%
while the number of children who are
 
05:45:54.470 --> 05:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
non-hispanic white has diminished this
 
05:45:56.628 --> 05:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
would be this trend would be similar in
 
05:45:59.570 --> 05:45:59.580 align:start position:0%
other parts of the United States as well
 
05:46:01.548 --> 05:46:01.558 align:start position:0%
this is the distribution of the
 
05:46:01.558 --> 05:46:02.590 align:start position:0%
this is the distribution of the
population

05:46:02.590 --> 05:46:02.600 align:start position:0%
population
 
05:46:05.990 --> 05:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh by minority status
 
05:46:08.330 --> 05:46:08.340 align:start position:0%
in the state in 2020 according to the
 
05:46:10.910 --> 05:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
census and so you can see that if you
 
05:46:12.530 --> 05:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
look at the population as a whole the
 
05:46:14.090 --> 05:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
minority population is primarily
 
05:46:16.430 --> 05:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
concentrated in some areas of the state
 
05:46:17.868 --> 05:46:17.878 align:start position:0%
and there are other parts of the state
 
05:46:19.430 --> 05:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
which have very little minority
 
05:46:22.190 --> 05:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
population if you look at this for
 
05:46:24.948 --> 05:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
children and adults separately you can
 
05:46:28.310 --> 05:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
see the change coming to different parts
 
05:46:30.590 --> 05:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
of the state that is the green is the
 
05:46:33.470 --> 05:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
least diverse and the oranges and reds
 
05:46:36.048 --> 05:46:36.058 align:start position:0%
are the most diverse but you can see the
 
05:46:38.570 --> 05:46:38.580 align:start position:0%
difference how more much more widespread
 
05:46:40.788 --> 05:46:40.798 align:start position:0%
diversity is among the child population
 
05:46:43.670 --> 05:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
than it is among the adult population so
 
05:46:45.530 --> 05:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
this just underscores again the fact
 
05:46:48.048 --> 05:46:48.058 align:start position:0%
that change is coming even though New
 
05:46:49.548 --> 05:46:49.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is much less diverse in the
 
05:46:51.830 --> 05:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
nation as a whole it's becoming more
 
05:46:54.048 --> 05:46:54.058 align:start position:0%
diverse Through Time
 
05:46:56.270 --> 05:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
and if you folk I'm going to focus now
 
05:46:58.250 --> 05:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
on just the corridor that you can look
 
05:47:01.368 --> 05:47:01.378 align:start position:0%
you can see in the map from Nashua to
 
05:47:04.250 --> 05:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
Manchester this is the racial breakdown
 
05:47:07.490 --> 05:47:07.500 align:start position:0%
of that Corridor and so there are areas
 
05:47:11.510 --> 05:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
in Manchester and Nashua which are as
 
05:47:15.288 --> 05:47:15.298 align:start position:0%
diverse as big urban areas are
 
05:47:17.510 --> 05:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
right I mean you've got areas where the
 
05:47:19.010 --> 05:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
child the particularly of the child
 
05:47:21.708 --> 05:47:21.718 align:start position:0%
population where over 40 percent of the
 
05:47:24.350 --> 05:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
population is minority now you can
 
05:47:26.690 --> 05:47:26.700 align:start position:0%
imagine the challenges this produces for
 
05:47:29.270 --> 05:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
agencies and school districts that have
 
05:47:32.810 --> 05:47:32.820 align:start position:0%
to deal with a diverse population and
 
05:47:35.030 --> 05:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
again for people who are not from parts
 
05:47:37.190 --> 05:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
of the state that are diverse recognize
 
05:47:38.990 --> 05:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
that even in a state like New Hampshire
 
05:47:41.270 --> 05:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
there are some very diverse parts of the
 
05:47:41.280 --> 05:47:42.128 align:start position:0%
there are some very diverse parts of the
population

05:47:42.128 --> 05:47:42.138 align:start position:0%
population
 
05:47:46.368 --> 05:47:46.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:48.650 --> 05:47:48.660 align:start position:0%
any any questions about that before I go
 
05:47:48.660 --> 05:47:51.230 align:start position:0%
any any questions about that before I go
on

05:47:51.230 --> 05:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:54.110 --> 05:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
okay that defer the diversity is not
 
05:47:56.750 --> 05:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
just about race diversity spans a lot of
 
05:47:59.750 --> 05:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
different dimensions this is this is New
 
05:48:02.150 --> 05:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
England this is education and income
 
05:48:04.368 --> 05:48:04.378 align:start position:0%
where the oranges and reds are the
 
05:48:07.250 --> 05:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
highest education highest income areas
 
05:48:10.190 --> 05:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
and the greens are the least here is
 
05:48:13.250 --> 05:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
just New Hampshire so you can see it
 
05:48:14.868 --> 05:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
and you can see that there are large
 
05:48:16.368 --> 05:48:16.378 align:start position:0%
areas of New Hampshire which have
 
05:48:19.310 --> 05:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
extremely well-educated high-income
 
05:48:21.890 --> 05:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
populations and other parts of the state
 
05:48:23.810 --> 05:48:23.820 align:start position:0%
which have more modest income
 
05:48:26.868 --> 05:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
distributions and where uh higher
 
05:48:31.788 --> 05:48:31.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:34.910 --> 05:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
this is educational attainment by uh by
 
05:48:37.010 --> 05:48:37.020 align:start position:0%
among adults these are adults 25 and
 
05:48:40.250 --> 05:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
over by race and Hispanic origin
 
05:48:42.110 --> 05:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
so again you can see that there's quite
 
05:48:44.270 --> 05:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
a bit of variability from the Asian
 
05:48:47.270 --> 05:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
population which is relatively small but
 
05:48:50.208 --> 05:48:50.218 align:start position:0%
has an extremely high education level
 
05:48:52.788 --> 05:48:52.798 align:start position:0%
to other groups where education levels
 
05:48:55.310 --> 05:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
are not as high or are more evenly
 
05:48:55.320 --> 05:48:56.750 align:start position:0%
are not as high or are more evenly
distributed

05:48:56.750 --> 05:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
05:48:59.810 --> 05:48:59.820 align:start position:0%
so again my point is just that there's a
 
05:49:02.690 --> 05:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
diversity along among a variety of
 
05:49:06.650 --> 05:49:06.660 align:start position:0%
different characteristics this is income
 
05:49:08.810 --> 05:49:08.820 align:start position:0%
so you can see variability and income
 
05:49:11.448 --> 05:49:11.458 align:start position:0%
distributions as well from families that
 
05:49:13.548 --> 05:49:13.558 align:start position:0%
are earning relatively low incomes of
 
05:49:16.730 --> 05:49:16.740 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand or less up to very well
 
05:49:19.788 --> 05:49:19.798 align:start position:0%
uh high-income families
 
05:49:22.070 --> 05:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
and how they distribute
 
05:49:24.650 --> 05:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
this is New Hampshire is very fortunate
 
05:49:27.048 --> 05:49:27.058 align:start position:0%
in that it has either the lowest or the
 
05:49:28.970 --> 05:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
second lowest poverty rate in the United
 
05:49:31.490 --> 05:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
States particularly for children but
 
05:49:32.690 --> 05:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that there isn't
 
05:49:36.170 --> 05:49:36.180 align:start position:0%
poverty in the state and that it doesn't
 
05:49:39.170 --> 05:49:39.180 align:start position:0%
vary across the state both by race and
 
05:49:39.180 --> 05:49:40.788 align:start position:0%
vary across the state both by race and
ethnicity

05:49:40.788 --> 05:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
ethnicity
 
05:49:46.010 --> 05:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
and by poverty by geography so there are
 
05:49:48.288 --> 05:49:48.298 align:start position:0%
areas of the state particularly for
 
05:49:50.690 --> 05:49:50.700 align:start position:0%
children that are have relatively High
 
05:49:53.150 --> 05:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
poverty rates and other parts of the
 
05:49:54.948 --> 05:49:54.958 align:start position:0%
state where poverty for children is
 
05:49:54.958 --> 05:49:56.208 align:start position:0%
state where poverty for children is
relatively

05:49:56.208 --> 05:49:56.218 align:start position:0%
relatively
 
05:49:56.218 --> 05:49:57.708 align:start position:0%
relatively
unknown

05:49:57.708 --> 05:49:57.718 align:start position:0%
unknown
 
05:49:59.990 --> 05:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
so again my point here is just that
 
05:50:02.090 --> 05:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
there's diversity in the state along a
 
05:50:04.910 --> 05:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
variety of gradients from population to
 
05:50:09.048 --> 05:50:09.058 align:start position:0%
age to race to income so
 
05:50:12.170 --> 05:50:12.180 align:start position:0%
even though it's a small state it is
 
05:50:14.030 --> 05:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
remarkably diverse along a number of
 
05:50:15.708 --> 05:50:15.718 align:start position:0%
different dimensions
 
05:50:17.868 --> 05:50:17.878 align:start position:0%
one last point
 
05:50:19.730 --> 05:50:19.740 align:start position:0%
I want you to notice that the
 
05:50:21.350 --> 05:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
demographer is going to finish on time
 
05:50:26.750 --> 05:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:28.670 --> 05:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
why do people move to and why do they
 
05:50:30.530 --> 05:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
stay in New Hampshire we've done a lot
 
05:50:33.410 --> 05:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
of research on this uh and this is with
 
05:50:36.650 --> 05:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
my graduate student now PhD Christine
 
05:50:39.770 --> 05:50:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:39.780 --> 05:50:40.850 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:50:40.850 --> 05:50:40.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:43.910 --> 05:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
we asked we didn't use check boxes we
 
05:50:47.170 --> 05:50:47.180 align:start position:0%
actually asked a large cross-section of
 
05:50:49.910 --> 05:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents
 
05:50:53.690 --> 05:50:53.700 align:start position:0%
to tell us in their own words why they
 
05:50:56.208 --> 05:50:56.218 align:start position:0%
stayed in New Hampshire or if they moved
 
05:50:57.948 --> 05:50:57.958 align:start position:0%
here recently why they moved to New
 
05:50:59.990 --> 05:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and these are the answers we
 
05:51:04.310 --> 05:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
got so you can see that family reasons
 
05:51:06.590 --> 05:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
and that varies if it's older adults
 
05:51:08.030 --> 05:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
it's because they want to be close to
 
05:51:09.350 --> 05:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
their grown children or their
 
05:51:11.930 --> 05:51:11.940 align:start position:0%
grandchildren if it's younger families
 
05:51:14.208 --> 05:51:14.218 align:start position:0%
they want to be close to their their
 
05:51:16.250 --> 05:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
parents so that they can have help with
 
05:51:18.530 --> 05:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
child care and all the other things that
 
05:51:20.868 --> 05:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
come with being a young parent but
 
05:51:23.208 --> 05:51:23.218 align:start position:0%
family was an important reason the
 
05:51:25.490 --> 05:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
natural environment the beauty of New
 
05:51:27.470 --> 05:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the access to lakes and
 
05:51:30.650 --> 05:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
mountains we're all very attractive both
 
05:51:33.770 --> 05:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
to Residents who have been here for a
 
05:51:36.590 --> 05:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
long time and for recent arrivals
 
05:51:39.770 --> 05:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
quality of life which they meant they
 
05:51:42.170 --> 05:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
felt safe they felt that they were part
 
05:51:44.390 --> 05:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
of a community was another factor and
 
05:51:46.490 --> 05:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
then you can see employment and taxes
 
05:51:46.500 --> 05:51:48.590 align:start position:0%
then you can see employment and taxes
culture

05:51:48.590 --> 05:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
culture
 
05:51:50.990 --> 05:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
all kinds of other factors and one
 
05:51:53.330 --> 05:51:53.340 align:start position:0%
important point we found also was that
 
05:51:55.670 --> 05:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
people don't come here or stay here for
 
05:51:58.670 --> 05:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
only one reason they come or stay for a
 
05:52:01.010 --> 05:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons so it's not any one
 
05:52:02.570 --> 05:52:02.580 align:start position:0%
of these things
 
05:52:05.030 --> 05:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
that brings people to New Hampshire or
 
05:52:07.490 --> 05:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
keeps them here it's a combination of
 
05:52:07.500 --> 05:52:08.270 align:start position:0%
keeps them here it's a combination of
them

05:52:08.270 --> 05:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:52:11.448 --> 05:52:11.458 align:start position:0%
and given how important migration is to
 
05:52:13.430 --> 05:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
the state's future
 
05:52:15.590 --> 05:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
I think it's important that we recognize
 
05:52:18.170 --> 05:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
that there are these multi-faceted
 
05:52:20.868 --> 05:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
things that cause people to come to the
 
05:52:23.690 --> 05:52:23.700 align:start position:0%
state or stay and again when you think
 
05:52:26.750 --> 05:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
about growing New Hampshire there's two
 
05:52:28.788 --> 05:52:28.798 align:start position:0%
ways you can do it you can attract
 
05:52:31.250 --> 05:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
people to the state but you can also
 
05:52:33.948 --> 05:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
retain more of your people you can lose
 
05:52:36.170 --> 05:52:36.180 align:start position:0%
fewer of them and that's going to keep
 
05:52:38.390 --> 05:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
the population I mean that's going to
 
05:52:41.030 --> 05:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
keep the losses from going down as
 
05:52:43.030 --> 05:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
migration into the state
 
05:52:46.368 --> 05:52:46.378 align:start position:0%
increases so just
 
05:52:48.530 --> 05:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
migration as I said migration is
 
05:52:50.090 --> 05:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
important to New Hampshire again I want
 
05:52:52.250 --> 05:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
to emphasize do people don't come to New
 
05:52:53.628 --> 05:52:53.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or stay in New Hampshire for
 
05:52:56.330 --> 05:52:56.340 align:start position:0%
just one reason they're influenced by a
 
05:52:59.810 --> 05:52:59.820 align:start position:0%
variety of factors so policies aimed at
 
05:53:02.690 --> 05:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
both attracting people or retaining
 
05:53:05.750 --> 05:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
people are going to be something that
 
05:53:07.810 --> 05:53:07.820 align:start position:0%
will help New Hampshire
 
05:53:10.070 --> 05:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
so for example when you talk about
 
05:53:12.110 --> 05:53:12.120 align:start position:0%
making New Hampshire attractive to
 
05:53:13.788 --> 05:53:13.798 align:start position:0%
families that's about the quality of
 
05:53:16.368 --> 05:53:16.378 align:start position:0%
Education that's about access to child
 
05:53:19.368 --> 05:53:19.378 align:start position:0%
care all of those kinds of factors are
 
05:53:19.378 --> 05:53:20.810 align:start position:0%
care all of those kinds of factors are
important

05:53:20.810 --> 05:53:20.820 align:start position:0%
important
 
05:53:24.890 --> 05:53:24.900 align:start position:0%
if you're talking about uh the state the
 
05:53:26.690 --> 05:53:26.700 align:start position:0%
beauty of the state that's preserving
 
05:53:29.090 --> 05:53:29.100 align:start position:0%
the state's natural resources that's
 
05:53:31.430 --> 05:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
improving the parks that's committing
 
05:53:34.910 --> 05:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
more resources to conservation
 
05:53:36.708 --> 05:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
um again
 
05:53:38.330 --> 05:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
recognize that there's a lot of
 
05:53:41.448 --> 05:53:41.458 align:start position:0%
different facets to this
 
05:53:44.390 --> 05:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
so just in conclusion
 
05:53:46.788 --> 05:53:46.798 align:start position:0%
population and growth has slowed
 
05:53:48.708 --> 05:53:48.718 align:start position:0%
compared to what it was in the previous
 
05:53:50.510 --> 05:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
decades we're not people are not
 
05:53:52.670 --> 05:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
flooding into the state the way they
 
05:53:55.548 --> 05:53:55.558 align:start position:0%
were in the 70s and 80s and 90s
 
05:53:58.310 --> 05:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
the most recent census data we have
 
05:54:00.110 --> 05:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
suggests that there is a significant
 
05:54:02.150 --> 05:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
amount of domestic migration going into
 
05:54:04.730 --> 05:54:04.740 align:start position:0%
the state that people are coming to New
 
05:54:06.708 --> 05:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from other places in the
 
05:54:08.510 --> 05:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
United States we don't have as much
 
05:54:10.190 --> 05:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
immigration but there's still a modest
 
05:54:14.090 --> 05:54:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:15.770 --> 05:54:15.780 align:start position:0%
we we talked a little bit about how
 
05:54:17.390 --> 05:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
there are fewer births going on right
 
05:54:19.730 --> 05:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
now and there are more deaths because of
 
05:54:23.150 --> 05:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
covet now again that happened started to
 
05:54:25.910 --> 05:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
happen before covid so even as the
 
05:54:28.430 --> 05:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
deaths from covets diminish as they are
 
05:54:30.830 --> 05:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
now it's not as if we're going to return
 
05:54:33.830 --> 05:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
to a unless there's some remarkable
 
05:54:36.170 --> 05:54:36.180 align:start position:0%
change in women's childbearing Behavior
 
05:54:37.850 --> 05:54:37.860 align:start position:0%
we're not going to have another baby
 
05:54:39.590 --> 05:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
boom that's going to produce a lot of
 
05:54:42.230 --> 05:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
child growth in New Hampshire
 
05:54:44.810 --> 05:54:44.820 align:start position:0%
I I wanted you to see the demographic
 
05:54:47.510 --> 05:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
change in New Hampshire is uneven
 
05:54:49.670 --> 05:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
some areas are growing other areas are
 
05:54:52.368 --> 05:54:52.378 align:start position:0%
declining some some school districts are
 
05:54:53.750 --> 05:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
going to worry about opening a new
 
05:54:55.610 --> 05:54:55.620 align:start position:0%
school other students other school
 
05:54:56.448 --> 05:54:56.458 align:start position:0%
districts are going to have to worry
 
05:54:58.850 --> 05:54:58.860 align:start position:0%
about how can they consolidate two
 
05:55:01.250 --> 05:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
elementary schools into one
 
05:55:03.350 --> 05:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
diversity is growing in the state but it
 
05:55:06.650 --> 05:55:06.660 align:start position:0%
remains largely non-hispanic and white
 
05:55:10.368 --> 05:55:10.378 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire's population is aging
 
05:55:13.368 --> 05:55:13.378 align:start position:0%
so just some final implications that
 
05:55:15.230 --> 05:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
migration is important is an important
 
05:55:18.110 --> 05:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
source of human capital for the state
 
05:55:19.730 --> 05:55:19.740 align:start position:0%
the people who come to the state are
 
05:55:21.770 --> 05:55:21.780 align:start position:0%
well educated
 
05:55:21.780 --> 05:55:22.368 align:start position:0%
well educated
um

05:55:22.368 --> 05:55:22.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:24.470 --> 05:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
they some of them are bringing children
 
05:55:26.510 --> 05:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
with them as well
 
05:55:28.730 --> 05:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
the state needs both to attract those
 
05:55:31.010 --> 05:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
people but also to retain its existing
 
05:55:33.590 --> 05:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
population not lose them
 
05:55:35.390 --> 05:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
the ver we talked about diversity
 
05:55:37.548 --> 05:55:37.558 align:start position:0%
remaining modest again remember that
 
05:55:39.288 --> 05:55:39.298 align:start position:0%
diversity is greatest for the youngest
 
05:55:41.330 --> 05:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
and least among the oldest of the
 
05:55:43.310 --> 05:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
population the population change
 
05:55:45.708 --> 05:55:45.718 align:start position:0%
patterns are uneven in the state
 
05:55:48.048 --> 05:55:48.058 align:start position:0%
some State some places are going to have
 
05:55:50.628 --> 05:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
to cope with expansion and growth others
 
05:55:51.650 --> 05:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
are going to have to deal with
 
05:55:54.048 --> 05:55:54.058 align:start position:0%
contraction which in many ways is more
 
05:55:57.230 --> 05:55:57.240 align:start position:0%
difficult for places to deal with and
 
05:55:59.810 --> 05:55:59.820 align:start position:0%
the growing older population is going to
 
05:56:02.150 --> 05:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
produce a lot of challenges for the
 
05:56:02.160 --> 05:56:03.230 align:start position:0%
produce a lot of challenges for the
state

05:56:03.230 --> 05:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:56:04.970 --> 05:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much
 
05:56:06.948 --> 05:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions I'd be happy
 
05:56:09.110 --> 05:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
to answer them
 
05:56:13.070 --> 05:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:14.570 --> 05:56:14.580 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:56:17.270 --> 05:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
um do you track at all the um the
 
05:56:19.788 --> 05:56:19.798 align:start position:0%
reasons that people leave the state I
 
05:56:22.610 --> 05:56:22.620 align:start position:0%
wish we could it's it's a hard I mean if
 
05:56:25.010 --> 05:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
you think about the way we we use the
 
05:56:26.448 --> 05:56:26.458 align:start position:0%
granite state poll which is a University
 
05:56:28.430 --> 05:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire polling organization
 
05:56:30.288 --> 05:56:30.298 align:start position:0%
which takes a poll of the state every
 
05:56:32.750 --> 05:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
three months we put our questions on
 
05:56:35.510 --> 05:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
about 12 or 15 of their surveys they
 
05:56:38.030 --> 05:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
reach the people of the state reaching
 
05:56:40.368 --> 05:56:40.378 align:start position:0%
the people who leave is a lot more
 
05:56:43.070 --> 05:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
difficult to do it's not impossible but
 
05:56:45.230 --> 05:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
it's a lot more difficult so we know
 
05:56:48.230 --> 05:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
less about why people leave than why
 
05:56:49.190 --> 05:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
they come
 
05:56:53.270 --> 05:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:56.150 --> 05:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative Army
 
05:57:00.830 --> 05:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:03.530 --> 05:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
at today and it seems to me that there's
 
05:57:07.150 --> 05:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
a major split in the Hispanic and black
 
05:57:11.470 --> 05:57:11.480 align:start position:0%
sectors of the of the population
 
05:57:16.910 --> 05:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
the Hispanics and blacks have higher
 
05:57:20.930 --> 05:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
family income and higher
 
05:57:20.940 --> 05:57:21.470 align:start position:0%
family income and higher
um

05:57:21.470 --> 05:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:24.470 --> 05:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
educational attainment but when you turn
 
05:57:27.350 --> 05:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
to the next page and you're looking at
 
05:57:30.110 --> 05:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
poverty levels they also have the higher
 
05:57:32.208 --> 05:57:32.218 align:start position:0%
poverty levels
 
05:57:32.218 --> 05:57:33.650 align:start position:0%
poverty levels
right

05:57:33.650 --> 05:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:57:35.990 --> 05:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
I mean they they don't have as high
 
05:57:39.590 --> 05:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
income levels as other racial groups but
 
05:57:42.470 --> 05:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
they have moderately High poverty levels
 
05:57:44.448 --> 05:57:44.458 align:start position:0%
a part of the question would be which
 
05:57:47.390 --> 05:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
parts of the population
 
05:57:49.610 --> 05:57:49.620 align:start position:0%
I mean it it's possible that the parts
 
05:57:53.390 --> 05:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
of the population with relatively
 
05:57:55.190 --> 05:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
um High income are not the parts that
 
05:57:58.010 --> 05:57:58.020 align:start position:0%
have a lot of children either yet or
 
05:58:00.530 --> 05:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
their children are grown so
 
05:58:02.868 --> 05:58:02.878 align:start position:0%
I haven't looked in detail at it
 
05:58:05.868 --> 05:58:05.878 align:start position:0%
um I just like to apologize I can't read
 
05:58:08.030 --> 05:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
the small print on these things I'm
 
05:58:10.670 --> 05:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
sorry this is the percentage of people
 
05:58:13.788 --> 05:58:13.798 align:start position:0%
in that group right is higher
 
05:58:13.798 --> 05:58:15.410 align:start position:0%
in that group right is higher
on

05:58:15.410 --> 05:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:58:18.650 --> 05:58:18.660 align:start position:0%
with educational attainment then then
 
05:58:21.170 --> 05:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
the percentage of people in a white
 
05:58:23.810 --> 05:58:23.820 align:start position:0%
group for instance
 
05:58:26.510 --> 05:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
okay which is a somewhat different thing
 
05:58:39.948 --> 05:58:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:42.170 --> 05:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
at least the baby boom big enough to
 
05:58:43.548 --> 05:58:43.558 align:start position:0%
where we need to start worrying about
 
05:58:47.448 --> 05:58:47.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:49.610 --> 05:58:49.620 align:start position:0%
yes I've been asked this question a
 
05:58:52.010 --> 05:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
number of times at a number of different
 
05:58:55.730 --> 05:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
levels of geography there there was a
 
05:58:57.650 --> 05:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
slight uptick in birth in New Hampshire
 
05:59:00.470 --> 05:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
last year New Hampshire again has low
 
05:59:03.410 --> 05:59:03.420 align:start position:0%
birth rates there was an uptick in burst
 
05:59:05.628 --> 05:59:05.638 align:start position:0%
last year but the number of births
 
05:59:08.810 --> 05:59:08.820 align:start position:0%
declined again this year so
 
05:59:08.820 --> 05:59:09.650 align:start position:0%
declined again this year so
um

05:59:09.650 --> 05:59:09.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:12.048 --> 05:59:12.058 align:start position:0%
there is no evidence of a baby boom
 
05:59:14.690 --> 05:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
either in New Hampshire or at the
 
05:59:16.368 --> 05:59:16.378 align:start position:0%
national level
 
05:59:16.378 --> 05:59:16.970 align:start position:0%
national level
um

05:59:16.970 --> 05:59:16.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:19.610 --> 05:59:19.620 align:start position:0%
people I mean I got questions from the
 
05:59:22.430 --> 05:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
national media a lot about this
 
05:59:24.410 --> 05:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
um here are all these people at home
 
05:59:26.990 --> 05:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
with nothing else to do
 
05:59:29.330 --> 05:59:29.340 align:start position:0%
are we going to have a baby boom
 
05:59:31.970 --> 05:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
uh demographers generally said no it's
 
05:59:33.830 --> 05:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
not going to happen and in fact it
 
05:59:36.410 --> 05:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
didn't happen I mean there
 
05:59:40.310 --> 05:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
so there hasn't been a baby boom
 
05:59:42.170 --> 05:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire behind you has a
 
05:59:42.180 --> 05:59:43.548 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire behind you has a
question

05:59:43.548 --> 05:59:43.558 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:59:45.288 --> 05:59:45.298 align:start position:0%
related to that
 
05:59:48.410 --> 05:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
um when do we know how many births there
 
05:59:51.110 --> 05:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
were in 2022
 
05:59:54.650 --> 05:59:54.660 align:start position:0%
we know that now is that we we have
 
05:59:56.750 --> 05:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
preliminary data
 
05:59:58.910 --> 05:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
for the period from
 
06:00:01.850 --> 06:00:01.860 align:start position:0%
um for the first half of 2022 and the
 
06:00:04.548 --> 06:00:04.558 align:start position:0%
number of births in the first half of 22
 
06:00:07.548 --> 06:00:07.558 align:start position:0%
are down slightly from what they were in
 
06:00:07.558 --> 06:00:10.690 align:start position:0%
are down slightly from what they were in
2021.

06:00:10.690 --> 06:00:10.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:10.700 --> 06:00:12.590 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

06:00:12.590 --> 06:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:00:15.470 --> 06:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
we I mean there's always a lag and when
 
06:00:17.570 --> 06:00:17.580 align:start position:0%
birth data is reported
 
06:00:20.390 --> 06:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
um I mean it's a problematic in a state
 
06:00:22.430 --> 06:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire in particular because
 
06:00:25.128 --> 06:00:25.138 align:start position:0%
some births that are to New Hampshire
 
06:00:27.230 --> 06:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
residents will occur in hospitals in
 
06:00:29.570 --> 06:00:29.580 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and it takes a while for
 
06:00:35.930 --> 06:00:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:41.090 --> 06:00:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:43.548 --> 06:00:43.558 align:start position:0%
it's more of a statement but um I was a
 
06:00:46.010 --> 06:00:46.020 align:start position:0%
State Registrar in 2008 and I retired
 
06:00:48.770 --> 06:00:48.780 align:start position:0%
you know towards 2009 and when I was
 
06:00:52.788 --> 06:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
registered we had 15 000 births and 9
 
06:00:55.868 --> 06:00:55.878 align:start position:0%
500 deaths so you can't blame this on me
 
06:00:59.330 --> 06:00:59.340 align:start position:0%
and uh regarding the birth enumeration
 
06:01:00.948 --> 06:01:00.958 align:start position:0%
we we actually developed a program
 
06:01:03.830 --> 06:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
called Nevin Webb and if you're looking
 
06:01:06.230 --> 06:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
at just events of birth death marriage
 
06:01:09.350 --> 06:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
divorce and Fetal death it's immediately
 
06:01:09.360 --> 06:01:10.670 align:start position:0%
divorce and Fetal death it's immediately
reported

06:01:10.670 --> 06:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
reported
 
06:01:12.470 --> 06:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
um as the
 
06:01:15.890 --> 06:01:15.900 align:start position:0%
you know as the event occurs so if you
 
06:01:18.948 --> 06:01:18.958 align:start position:0%
want to Google you know never in web you
 
06:01:21.650 --> 06:01:21.660 align:start position:0%
can create a login and check out I
 
06:01:23.448 --> 06:01:23.458 align:start position:0%
actually use that quite often excellent
 
06:01:26.270 --> 06:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
well but that's one thing you can thank
 
06:01:28.850 --> 06:01:28.860 align:start position:0%
me for but I mean it was actually not
 
06:01:30.770 --> 06:01:30.780 align:start position:0%
really well received because people
 
06:01:33.948 --> 06:01:33.958 align:start position:0%
thought that it may need time to like
 
06:01:35.930 --> 06:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
ripen the data
 
06:01:39.048 --> 06:01:39.058 align:start position:0%
but um it became lauded after a while
 
06:01:41.330 --> 06:01:41.340 align:start position:0%
because it was just immediate access to
 
06:01:44.810 --> 06:01:44.820 align:start position:0%
to data like that so anyway
 
06:01:48.650 --> 06:01:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:50.708 --> 06:01:50.718 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang
 
06:01:53.090 --> 06:01:53.100 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
06:01:56.448 --> 06:01:56.458 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire so the Office of
 
06:01:58.368 --> 06:01:58.378 align:start position:0%
Vital Statistics right I believe it's in
 
06:01:59.570 --> 06:01:59.580 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office I'll get
 
06:02:00.770 --> 06:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
you the most current data if you just
 
06:02:02.570 --> 06:02:02.580 align:start position:0%
ask them they're they've been really
 
06:02:02.580 --> 06:02:13.250 align:start position:0%
ask them they're they've been really
good

06:02:13.250 --> 06:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:16.430 --> 06:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
what's available how many births
 
06:02:19.490 --> 06:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
you can um essentially well with regard
 
06:02:21.288 --> 06:02:21.298 align:start position:0%
to the bursts that occur like out of
 
06:02:23.750 --> 06:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
state it may take a while to to grab
 
06:02:25.850 --> 06:02:25.860 align:start position:0%
those but for the events that occurred
 
06:02:27.288 --> 06:02:27.298 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
06:02:29.510 --> 06:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
um you would get them within a day as
 
06:02:32.090 --> 06:02:32.100 align:start position:0%
the hospital reports it you you have
 
06:02:34.970 --> 06:02:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:37.190 --> 06:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
you're welcome sorry a lot of the my
 
06:02:39.708 --> 06:02:39.718 align:start position:0%
answer was coming mostly from nchs the
 
06:02:41.448 --> 06:02:41.458 align:start position:0%
