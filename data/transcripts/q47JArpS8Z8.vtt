to invite the university system of New

any introduction but if so she is the
 
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 align:start position:0%
chief financial and chief administrative
 
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 align:start position:0%
officer of the University system I also
 
00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 align:start position:0%
have with me my colleagues Melinda
 
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 align:start position:0%
Treadwell president of Keene State
 
00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 align:start position:0%
College and Don Burke's president of
 
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
Plymouth State University and we
 
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to speak with
 
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 align:start position:0%
you today so we have the handout which I
 
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
hope you have in front of you which has
 
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
our our logos on the front
 
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.290 align:start position:0%
our our logos on the front
good

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
all right so with that I'm going to go
 
00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
to page two of that uh that handout
 
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
and the point that we'd like you to take
 
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
away from page two is that the
 
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
university system of New Hampshire and
 
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
I'll probably say usnh after this is a
 
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
really critical provider of New
 
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Workforce this is a really
 
00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
important role that we play we work with
 
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
over 2 000 different Employers in the
 
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and by
 
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
coincidence we're also adding about same
 
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 align:start position:0%
number about 2 000 students graduates
 
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
into the workforce in New Hampshire
 
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
every year
 
00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 align:start position:0%
uh we also bring people from out of
 
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 align:start position:0%
state out of New Hampshire into the
 
00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
workforce people who simply would not be
 
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
here otherwise and many of them decide
 
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
to stay in the state and become part of
 
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
our Workforce and as it says here with
 
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
the 2x on the lower right hand side that
 
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 align:start position:0%
if we can find a way to provide
 
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
internships for these students who are
 
00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 align:start position:0%
coming from out of state they're twice
 
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
as likely to stay in New Hampshire and
 
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
become part of the workforce that we
 
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
desperately need and so anticipating
 
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
what we will be saying this is part of
 
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to get some funding
 
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
for is to help provide those kinds of
 
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.710 align:start position:0%
for is to help provide those kinds of
internships

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
on moving to page three really the point
 
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
here is is in green without additional
 
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 align:start position:0%
funding our ability to continue doing
 
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
this and helping the economy and the
 
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
workforce is going to be compromised we
 
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
do a lot of Aid a lot of financial aid
 
00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
to attract students here and to support
 
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
them once they're here and to help them
 
00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 align:start position:0%
to complete their degree
 
00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 align:start position:0%
we without additional State funding will
 
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
have fewer resources to partner with
 
00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 align:start position:0%
employers to work with them closely work
 
00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
with them on internships and so on and
 
00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 align:start position:0%
the thing that we're really trying to
 
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 align:start position:0%
avoid here is hire in-state tuition and
 
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 align:start position:0%
we'll give you some additional details
 
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 align:start position:0%
about tuition and how we've managed that
 
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
moving to page four uh as we've already
 
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
said we work pretty closely with the
 
00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 align:start position:0%
business Community within New Hampshire
 
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
and we work particularly closely with
 
00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 align:start position:0%
the business and industry Association
 
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
I've joined the board of the Bia to try
 
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 align:start position:0%
and enhance the links between the
 
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 align:start position:0%
university system and the business
 
00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 align:start position:0%
community of New Hampshire and that
 
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
that's really been a great relationship
 
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to say that the Bia has
 
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 align:start position:0%
expressed their very strong support for
 
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 align:start position:0%
enhanced funding for for usnh because
 
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 align:start position:0%
they understand how important the role
 
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
it is that we play in being able to
 
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 align:start position:0%
bring more people into the workforce in
 
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire either from in-state or
 
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 align:start position:0%
from out of state so we're very happy to
 
00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 align:start position:0%
have have their support
 
00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
and some of the details are are down
 
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
there about increased Aid to retain high
 
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
school graduates in the state train and
 
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
retain UNH CR usnh graduates and address
 
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
the health and well-being challenges of
 
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
our residents and we'll give a lot more
 
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
detail about those in just a couple of
 
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.890 align:start position:0%
detail about those in just a couple of
minutes

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 align:start position:0%
excuse me moving to page five uh the
 
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 align:start position:0%
chart that we have on there the first of
 
00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 align:start position:0%
the chart I imagine this is familiar but
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
we wanted to just remind everyone that
 
00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire provides less support to
 
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
students than any other state so you can
 
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
see whether it's by per capita on the
 
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 align:start position:0%
left side in blue or per income per one
 
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in income on the right
 
00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 align:start position:0%
side in green we are 50th out of 50
 
00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 align:start position:0%
states and
 
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 align:start position:0%
the reason that that's not just an
 
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
abstraction or a talking point is that
 
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 align:start position:0%
well by definition the other New England
 
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
states are providing more help to their
 
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
students and therefore to their
 
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
universities than we are and that makes
 
00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
it easier for them to compete with us
 
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
even for students from within New
 
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so the states will put up
 
00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 align:start position:0%
Billboards that says you can come to our
 
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
state and pay the same tuition that you
 
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
pay in New Hampshire which makes it very
 
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
difficult for us to retain people in New
 
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:16.070 align:start position:0%
difficult for us to retain people in New
Hampshire

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
moving on then to the the next slide
 
00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:22.259 align:start position:0%
uh any and again uh Mr Jerry I know
 
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 align:start position:0%
you're new so I don't know how much of
 
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 align:start position:0%
this history you know but we did receive
 
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
and this was before my time as well I
 
00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
will say uh the system usnh received a
 
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 align:start position:0%
very significant funding cut in 2012.
 
00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
um I can't imagine many University
 
00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
Systems in the country have ever
 
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
experienced a 50 budget cut in one year
 
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
and we've not recovered from that budget
 
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
cut that took place now 10 years ago
 
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
and our request that you see there in
 
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
the the blue bars on the right side is
 
00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
simply to restore the funding from 2011.
 
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
from now 12 years ago and that's uh
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
these are in uh current dollars not
 
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
Clemson dollars so this is ignoring the
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
impact of inflation over that period of
 
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
time so we're trying to get back on a
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
constant dollar basis to the funding
 
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:17.639 align:start position:0%
okay moving then to the next slide I'm
 
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
going to turn to my colleague Kathy
 
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.930 align:start position:0%
going to turn to my colleague Kathy
preventer

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
preventer
 
00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
thanks Jim
 
00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:23.819 align:start position:0%
um again good morning for the record
 
00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:25.979 align:start position:0%
Kathy Province your uh chief
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
administrative officer
 
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
for our state's University system so on
 
00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:33.539 align:start position:0%
slide seven this is a mirror of what you
 
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
find on page 4084 of your budget book
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
we have requested
 
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
um a three percent increase in fiscal 24
 
00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:47.699 align:start position:0%
and flat and fiscal 25 as the efficiency
 
00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:48.850 align:start position:0%
and flat and fiscal 25 as the efficiency
request

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:48.860 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
our funding has been flat I believe for
 
00:07:56.089 --> 00:07:56.099 align:start position:0%
four years now we have held two in-state
 
00:07:58.909 --> 00:07:58.919 align:start position:0%
tuition flat for the last five years and
 
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
our board just voted in October that it
 
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
will remain flat in the next academic
 
00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
year our additional prioritized requests
 
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
are targeted specifically to Plymouth
 
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:13.860 align:start position:0%
keen and Cooperative Extension
 
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
and the it's not sustainability dollars
 
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
for Plymouth and Keene it's primarily to
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
increase internship opportunities and
 
00:08:26.809 --> 00:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
increase problem solving work that's
 
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
done at Plymouth and I'll talk about
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
that in a minute excuse me the regional
 
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
campuses across New England just not not
 
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
just in New Hampshire our regional Camp
 
00:08:38.029 --> 00:08:38.039 align:start position:0%
higher education
 
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
campuses across New England are entering
 
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
a period of severe headwinds and we are
 
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:46.860 align:start position:0%
doing everything we can rethinking all
 
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
our work restructuring preparing for
 
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
those headwinds and they will
 
00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:54.779 align:start position:0%
become more Strong by 2025
 
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
so these dollars targeted at Plymouth
 
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
Keenan Cooperative Extension
 
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:03.300 align:start position:0%
will bolster the economic engines that
 
00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
Plymouth and Keene provide to the Lakes
 
00:09:08.449 --> 00:09:08.459 align:start position:0%
Region North Country and the Monadnock
 
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
region relative to Partnerships with
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
business nonprofits community-based
 
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.250 align:start position:0%
business nonprofits community-based
organizations

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
so if you so we're again the additional
 
00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
prioritized requests recognizing its
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
significant investment but four million
 
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:27.300 align:start position:0%
dollars in 2024 and 13 million dollars
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
in 2025
 
00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
and if you flip to the next slide I want
 
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
to just cover with Plymouth and Keen
 
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
what we intend to Target those
 
00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:42.140 align:start position:0%
Investments toward also starting on page
 
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:45.959 align:start position:0%
4087 of your budget book you'll find all
 
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
of the outcomes that we've identified
 
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:51.300 align:start position:0%
what these dollars
 
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.130 align:start position:0%
what these dollars
um

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:52.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
will will do what what the goals are
 
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
that we intend to achieve with the
 
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized requests
 
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
the intent on the funding for Keene
 
00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
State is to increase excuse me the
 
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
number of businesses that Keene State
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
engages with by 15 percent
 
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
from 80 to 105 by the end of the
 
00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:15.899 align:start position:0%
biennium and internship opportunities
 
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:18.660 align:start position:0%
that Kian would double from 100 to 200
 
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.630 align:start position:0%
that Kian would double from 100 to 200
students

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:22.380 align:start position:0%
Columbus State
 
00:10:25.389 --> 00:10:25.399 align:start position:0%
um has an under Don bursts leadership
 
00:10:29.449 --> 00:10:29.459 align:start position:0%
has reimagined how the delivery of
 
00:10:31.449 --> 00:10:31.459 align:start position:0%
higher education on a cluster model
 
00:10:31.459 --> 00:10:33.250 align:start position:0%
higher education on a cluster model
multi-disciplinary

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:33.260 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
projects are worked on but students from
 
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
different majors and they go out and and
 
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
help businesses again businesses
 
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
non-profits Community organizations
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
solve problems
 
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
every student at Plymouth does one of
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
those projects during their their four
 
00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:51.889 align:start position:0%
those projects during their their four
years

00:10:51.889 --> 00:10:51.899 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
um at the University
 
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
Plymouth would like to double that to
 
00:10:59.269 --> 00:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
get more more projects more engagement
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
in the North Country in The Lakes Region
 
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
and around the state we also have
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
examples I'll give those to Michelle
 
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:08.220 align:start position:0%
before we leave of the types of projects
 
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
that have been undertaken by students at
 
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
Plymouth State and those additional
 
00:11:15.769 --> 00:11:15.779 align:start position:0%
dollars would fund those um those
 
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:19.140 align:start position:0%
projects the other
 
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
um you know we offer the granite
 
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
guarantee which provides free and state
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
tuition to Pell eligible students and it
 
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
is um a significant cost especially at
 
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
Plymouth and Keene and we'll be able to
 
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
sustain the granite guarantee with these
 
00:11:36.769 --> 00:11:36.779 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs funded
 
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:41.220 align:start position:0%
and on slide nine the other ask we have
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
is for Cooperative Extension three
 
00:11:47.329 --> 00:11:47.339 align:start position:0%
million dollars in 2025. Cooperative
 
00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
Extension has very very wide reach
 
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:53.420 align:start position:0%
across our state
 
00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
and they they don't just work on Farming
 
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
and Forestry they have significant
 
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.769 align:start position:0%
and Forestry they have significant
educational

00:12:02.769 --> 00:12:02.779 align:start position:0%
educational
 
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
programs across the state and with
 
00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
additional funding
 
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
um we we can
 
00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:12.839 align:start position:0%
expand the the education that we provide
 
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
to older adults relative to chronic
 
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
disease and pain self-management from
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
250 to 750. these are just examples we
 
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
can increase the number of um schools
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
that we participate with teaching about
 
00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:30.660 align:start position:0%
nutritional value
 
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:31.190 align:start position:0%
nutritional value
um

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
helping parents with food insecurity
 
00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
again educational pro programs and also
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
last year Cooperative Extension
 
00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
delivered education to 600 people across
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
the state relative to mental health
 
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
programming and with additional funding
 
00:12:51.889 --> 00:12:51.899 align:start position:0%
they believe they can ramp that up to 3
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
000 people and I can we can provide more
 
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
details those are just examples of what
 
00:12:58.129 --> 00:12:58.139 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension could do with
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
additional funding I'm going to turn it
 
00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:02.220 align:start position:0%
back to you Jim okay thanks Kathy so now
 
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
we're on excuse me on page 10 of the
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
handout and the next couple slides are
 
00:13:10.129 --> 00:13:10.139 align:start position:0%
really about what we've tried to do to
 
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
survive and flourish in the environment
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
that we're in and what this slide shows
 
00:13:17.569 --> 00:13:17.579 align:start position:0%
what we've been able to do for net
 
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
tuition and fees and I know sometimes
 
00:13:21.769 --> 00:13:21.779 align:start position:0%
tuition the way people talk about it is
 
00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
somewhat complicated and so we've
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
already mentioned that we've kept the
 
00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
nominal tuition flat for five years but
 
00:13:30.829 --> 00:13:30.839 align:start position:0%
what we've actually done through the use
 
00:13:32.569 --> 00:13:32.579 align:start position:0%
of financial aid is to actually reduce
 
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
what's known as net tuition and so net
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
tuition is simply the amount that
 
00:13:38.449 --> 00:13:38.459 align:start position:0%
students actually pay not the so-called
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
list price so we've kept nominal tuition
 
00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:43.860 align:start position:0%
flat but actually reduce the cost for
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
students even at in this time of of
 
00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:49.740 align:start position:0%
higher inflation so our priority across
 
00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:51.959 align:start position:0%
the the university system is really
 
00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:53.579 align:start position:0%
about students and really trying to help
 
00:13:56.449 --> 00:13:56.459 align:start position:0%
them be successful and to flourish many
 
00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
of you are aware of that debt challenge
 
00:14:01.009 --> 00:14:01.019 align:start position:0%
that many students across the country
 
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
have and this is one way that we try to
 
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
address that by trying to keep tuition
 
00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
as low as possible even under difficult
 
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
circumstances for our students
 
00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:13.700 align:start position:0%
how have we been able to do that
 
00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
basically by reducing our costs so what
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
I want to emphasize here is that we
 
00:14:20.329 --> 00:14:20.339 align:start position:0%
didn't just run into problems and come
 
00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:22.139 align:start position:0%
to you saying you know we need more
 
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
money we've been working really really
 
00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:26.519 align:start position:0%
hard to reduce our costs to be able to
 
00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:29.220 align:start position:0%
keep tuition down for for quite a number
 
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
of years now and so the big number in
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
green there is the 50 million dollars
 
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
reduction in operating expenses
 
00:14:38.569 --> 00:14:38.579 align:start position:0%
and Kathy for context that's against a
 
00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
budget of 800 million dollars ish okay
 
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
something like just for context I
 
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
thought that would be helpful and you
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
can see that that reduction comes both
 
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
from employee compensation as well as
 
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
other operating uh expenses and if you
 
00:14:53.569 --> 00:14:53.579 align:start position:0%
think of universities as something like
 
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:55.740 align:start position:0%
running a city we have all of the things
 
00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
that are associated with that so as as
 
00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
you listen to the other president
 
00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
presentations we'll be doing many of
 
00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:03.779 align:start position:0%
those same kinds of things so we have
 
00:15:05.689 --> 00:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
really tried to get our house in order I
 
00:15:07.009 --> 00:15:07.019 align:start position:0%
know that there's a stereotype about
 
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
higher education that costs just go up
 
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
and that's not true for us our costs
 
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
have been going down there's a
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
stereotype that tuition goes up that's
 
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
not true for us our tuition has been has
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
been going down and we've done a lot of
 
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:20.220 align:start position:0%
work before we would come to you and say
 
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
we think we really need to have some
 
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
additional funding in order to to
 
00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:27.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh the next slide is probably I don't
 
00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:32.519 align:start position:0%
know A variation on a slide you're going
 
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
to see from a lot of people coming in so
 
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
we're subject to the same inflationary
 
00:15:38.569 --> 00:15:38.579 align:start position:0%
pressures uh as everyone else for the
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
cost of heating and so on but we were
 
00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:42.779 align:start position:0%
able to reduce expenses whole tuition
 
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:45.300 align:start position:0%
flat and increase financial aid despite
 
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:47.100 align:start position:0%
the pressures of inflation that we've
 
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
been facing especially over uh over the
 
00:15:51.889 --> 00:15:51.899 align:start position:0%
last year or two and that's really a
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
reflection of a lot of hard work by a
 
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
lot of people across the university
 
00:15:59.689 --> 00:15:59.699 align:start position:0%
again there may be a stereotype that
 
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
people who work for universities are not
 
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:03.180 align:start position:0%
cost conscious or are not trying to
 
00:16:05.569 --> 00:16:05.579 align:start position:0%
reduce expenses or are not concerned so
 
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
in the case of the University system of
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire really none of that's true
 
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of people making really
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
hard decisions to try and and manage
 
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
costs and reduce costs in the face of
 
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
the challenges that we're facing and
 
00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:18.779 align:start position:0%
it's something that I know that Don and
 
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
Melinda and I and Kathy and all the
 
00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
leadership team we're really proud of
 
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
that is it's not easy to do that so
 
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to have the opportunity to
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
talk about that a little and and now
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
going back to Kathy to talk about this
 
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:33.180 align:start position:0%
being recognized by a really important
 
00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:35.220 align:start position:0%
Outside Agency
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
oh thanks and we just found out a week
 
00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:41.540 align:start position:0%
and a half ago that um Moody's has
 
00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
improved our Outlook from negative to
 
00:16:44.279 --> 00:16:46.009 align:start position:0%
improved our Outlook from negative to
stable

00:16:46.009 --> 00:16:46.019 align:start position:0%
stable
 
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
um and they usually a press release I
 
00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:50.180 align:start position:0%
think it was the Friday before
 
00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.210 align:start position:0%
think it was the Friday before
Thanksgiving

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:52.220 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving
 
00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:54.839 align:start position:0%
recognizing that the work that the
 
00:16:58.009 --> 00:16:58.019 align:start position:0%
university system has been doing in Cost
 
00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:01.259 align:start position:0%
Containment cost cutting we do
 
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
um you know five-year financial planning
 
00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:08.579 align:start position:0%
assuming that the student had count the
 
00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:10.740 align:start position:0%
incoming class is going to drop two
 
00:17:12.289 --> 00:17:12.299 align:start position:0%
percent per year because that's what the
 
00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:13.860 align:start position:0%
demographics tell us
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
we assume that if financial aid is going
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
to continue to increase and we plan
 
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
accordingly and independent credible
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
Source recognize that work uh last week
 
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
we are we are as as Jim mentioned we are
 
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
in a tough environment doing tough work
 
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
the we are rethinking and restructuring
 
00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
just about everything we can get our
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
hands on again to prepare ourselves for
 
00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:42.419 align:start position:0%
2025 and
 
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
which is why it's critically important
 
00:17:48.409 --> 00:17:48.419 align:start position:0%
for us to continue to expand the reach
 
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
in the Monadnock region and lakes in
 
00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
North Country with businesses relative
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
to Workforce and again with Cooperative
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
Extension with that web across the state
 
00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
on how we can impact the health and
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
wellness of our residents
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
where we want to focus those additional
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs
 
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:23.230 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs
nuts

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
our Workforce needs in the state and our
 
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
quality of life a few years ago we
 
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
engaged a number of government leaders
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
elected officials Business Leaders and
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
ask about what are the biggest
 
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
challenges facing New Hampshire and
 
00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:37.860 align:start position:0%
there were not really any surprises
 
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
there but I'll mention that what came
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
back to us was Workforce
 
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
uh Education Health Care and the
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
environment and energy and the
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
university system is actually working on
 
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
all of those uh trying to help students
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to to graduate and succeed to
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
become part of the workforce especially
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
through Cooperative Extension but also
 
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
through our growth of programs in
 
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
nursing where we're really trying to
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
address some of the health care issues
 
00:19:06.289 --> 00:19:06.299 align:start position:0%
and many of the health issues across the
 
00:19:06.299 --> 00:19:07.310 align:start position:0%
and many of the health issues across the
state

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to keep tuition low
 
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
we're trying to support the workforce
 
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
and the economy and trying to address
 
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
the challenges for health and well-being
 
00:19:18.169 --> 00:19:18.179 align:start position:0%
of our own citizens and in summary I
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
would just say that I believe that that
 
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
the leadership of the University system
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
and our our colleagues throughout the
 
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
state have really done everything we can
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
to try and manage our costs and to try
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
and fulfill our mission in a difficult
 
00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
environment and at this point we
 
00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask for additional help
 
00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
from you in order to be able to continue
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
serving the needs of the citizens of New
 
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you
 
00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
hey thank you very much uh I have a
 
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:49.740 align:start position:0%
couple of questions uh one of the things
 
00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
that's not only affecting the university
 
00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire but but
 
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.090 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire but but
universities

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
universities
 
00:19:59.330 --> 00:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
across the country is increasing
 
00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
competition for fewer students and as
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
we've seen I mean you look at the
 
00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:04.980 align:start position:0%
demographics in New Hampshire I know
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
you've you spoke about this briefly but
 
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:08.940 align:start position:0%
I mean enrollment's been going down
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
since I believe 2003 and so all that's
 
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
heading your way in addition to that
 
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
with declining enrollment you've had
 
00:20:18.529 --> 00:20:18.539 align:start position:0%
increased competition because it seems
 
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
from you know now you don't even have to
 
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
go to a university or a college anymore
 
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
you can sit in your living room and take
 
00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
courses which I know is is becoming
 
00:20:30.289 --> 00:20:30.299 align:start position:0%
increasingly popular how are you
 
00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:32.039 align:start position:0%
positioned and how are you dealing with
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
that competition and how is it affected
 
00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for the the question of James
 
00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:46.919 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned earlier that's part of
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
our financial that's just the reality of
 
00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
of the environment and that's what we're
 
00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
planning for that's part of the
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
the whole cost cutting measures that we
 
00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
undertook back in 2019 2020 preparing
 
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
for this
 
00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:04.370 align:start position:0%
for this
um

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:07.340 align:start position:0%
I will say that
 
00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:09.980 align:start position:0%
this fall
 
00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
UNH had one of its largest incoming
 
00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:16.190 align:start position:0%
UNH had one of its largest incoming
classes

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
classes
 
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
in a number of years
 
00:21:21.409 --> 00:21:21.419 align:start position:0%
so it's um
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
it's really about marketing
 
00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:26.820 align:start position:0%
um again and it's been I'll add another
 
00:21:28.909 --> 00:21:28.919 align:start position:0%
layer of complication to what you added
 
00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
covid right people are just thinking
 
00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
about opportunities in higher education
 
00:21:36.289 --> 00:21:36.299 align:start position:0%
differently so
 
00:21:38.529 --> 00:21:38.539 align:start position:0%
um you know we're also when we when when
 
00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:40.740 align:start position:0%
leadership in our board thinks about
 
00:21:42.669 --> 00:21:42.679 align:start position:0%
Investments that we're going to make
 
00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
it's Roi has to be calculated so what
 
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
are the revenue opportunities what are
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
the Returns on investments that we're
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
going to make so it's top of Mind
 
00:21:57.289 --> 00:21:57.299 align:start position:0%
understanding that it's the reality of
 
00:21:59.270 --> 00:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
the environment that we're in
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
if I could maybe it's a really excellent
 
00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:02.700 align:start position:0%
question if I could add just one more
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
point that as soon as I say it you'll go
 
00:22:06.649 --> 00:22:06.659 align:start position:0%
yes of course that happens so in a
 
00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:07.860 align:start position:0%
competitive environment people cut
 
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
prices right so the way people cut
 
00:22:12.169 --> 00:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
prices in higher education is by
 
00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
providing additional Aid and so what
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
we're seeing now
 
00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
effectively a little bit of a price War
 
00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
if you want to get students to come in
 
00:22:21.049 --> 00:22:21.059 align:start position:0%
then you so you have to provide more
 
00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
scholarship dollars and so on so that's
 
00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
happening as well and at the extremes
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
there are institutions fortunately not
 
00:22:30.049 --> 00:22:30.059 align:start position:0%
ours that are
 
00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
teetering on the verge of not being
 
00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
successful and you've probably read some
 
00:22:36.049 --> 00:22:36.059 align:start position:0%
of those stories as well and for them
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
they will do massive reductions in
 
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:40.740 align:start position:0%
tuition in order to just get students in
 
00:22:43.789 --> 00:22:43.799 align:start position:0%
to get the discretionary dollar and that
 
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
makes for a really odd environment to
 
00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
operate in
 
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
okay if you know speaking of that though
 
00:22:53.149 --> 00:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
if keen and Plymouth can use as a
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
marketing tool they're going to be able
 
00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
to double internship opportunities
 
00:23:00.289 --> 00:23:00.299 align:start position:0%
increase the number of businesses they
 
00:23:03.289 --> 00:23:03.299 align:start position:0%
interact with double the number of these
 
00:23:06.409 --> 00:23:06.419 align:start position:0%
real world problems that they can help
 
00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
solve that could also be a marketing
 
00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:10.980 align:start position:0%
tool with the additional prioritized
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
needs for requesting
 
00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.510 align:start position:0%
needs for requesting
okay

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
Switching gears a little bit on your
 
00:23:18.169 --> 00:23:18.179 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs
 
00:23:18.179 --> 00:23:19.190 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs
um

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
there's four million in 2024 13 million
 
00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
in 2025. otherwise you could give us a
 
00:23:27.049 --> 00:23:27.059 align:start position:0%
little more detail on if we fund this
 
00:23:27.059 --> 00:23:28.010 align:start position:0%
little more detail on if we fund this
what

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
if the legislature fund this what uh
 
00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
specifically what will we get for that
 
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
money what would that mean lower tuition
 
00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:37.740 align:start position:0%
will it mean you know better physical
 
00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:42.020 align:start position:0%
plants will it mean you know
 
00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
no we this is not these additional
 
00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:47.220 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs
 
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:49.980 align:start position:0%
are not aimed at tuition
 
00:23:51.529 --> 00:23:51.539 align:start position:0%
well they're aimed at retaining the
 
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
tuition that we have now not lowering it
 
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
for correct it'll enable you to keep the
 
00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
tuition where it is now correct but
 
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
um again beginning on page we have an
 
00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
opportunity beginning on page fourth
 
00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.310 align:start position:0%
opportunity beginning on page fourth
4086.

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
4086.
 
00:24:12.409 --> 00:24:12.419 align:start position:0%
we have some fairly specific targets
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
um in numbers of the number of employers
 
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:17.220 align:start position:0%
we'll engage with the number of students
 
00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
who will participate in internships it's
 
00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
and specific to Cooperative Extension
 
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
the number of people we will reach in
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
the variety of educational programs that
 
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension
 
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
um offers as well as that granted
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
guarantee that Granite guarantee is very
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
impactful on needy New Hampshire
 
00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.390 align:start position:0%
impactful on needy New Hampshire
students

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
and it's a
 
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
a significant weight on on Plymouth and
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
Keene and maintaining that Granite
 
00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.210 align:start position:0%
Keene and maintaining that Granite
guarantee

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:50.220 align:start position:0%
guarantee
 
00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
in financial aid
 
00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:54.710 align:start position:0%
in financial aid
okay

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:24:58.930 --> 00:24:58.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:00.770 align:start position:0%
 
hi

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:00.780 align:start position:0%
hi
 
00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:01.450 align:start position:0%
hi
um

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:01.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:04.140 align:start position:0%
thanks for coming
 
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
um I have fun feelings toward uh UNH in
 
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
particular sorry
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
um because that's where in grad school I
 
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:14.940 align:start position:0%
met my wife and uh and that's on your
 
00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:17.700 align:start position:0%
campus that I proposed so that's the New
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire advantage to me
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
um whatever you want to think about it
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
um I have a couple of questions more
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
broadly you're I think you said you're
 
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:28.980 align:start position:0%
operating budget is about 800 million
 
00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry your operating budget is about
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
800 million 800 it's growing because
 
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
grants are growing but I would say 8.50
 
00:25:42.289 --> 00:25:42.299 align:start position:0%
in that range
 
00:25:45.289 --> 00:25:45.299 align:start position:0%
um what what rough and on these aren't
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
exact numbers I'm sure some of this is
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
in the system's annual report
 
00:25:49.679 --> 00:25:50.390 align:start position:0%
in the system's annual report
um

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
Oh yay thank you
 
00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:53.570 align:start position:0%
Oh yay thank you
um

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
what uh what percentages is personnel
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
Place salaries and benefits I should
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
know that right off the top of my head
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
of operating
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
so two two uh related questions you
 
00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
don't need to answer them today one is
 
00:26:15.769 --> 00:26:15.779 align:start position:0%
one is what portion of your spend is is
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
people about half
 
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
and what portion of the people spend is
 
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
if you divide that world into
 
00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:25.130 align:start position:0%
if you divide that world into
um

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:25.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
academic and non-academic if you will
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
um I I don't want to use this word is
 
00:26:33.789 --> 00:26:33.799 align:start position:0%
poison on a campus I'm sure but teachers
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
Professor faculty faculty thank you I
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
should know that my wife was a professor
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
at unh
 
00:26:43.789 --> 00:26:43.799 align:start position:0%
um faculty and then and then non-faculty
 
00:26:45.769 --> 00:26:45.779 align:start position:0%
and I and I don't say that to disparage
 
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
no either group
 
00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.190 align:start position:0%
no either group
but

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:50.820 align:start position:0%
um it's something that I'm always
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
curious about in terms of in terms of
 
00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:55.559 align:start position:0%
operating so I remember uh there's a a
 
00:26:59.090 --> 00:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
guy in a retired uh UNH Professor I
 
00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:00.299 align:start position:0%
asked him once he taught there for
 
00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
something like 40 years and I said so
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
what's the big difference between when
 
00:27:06.049 --> 00:27:06.059 align:start position:0%
you started in the and he started in the
 
00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
60s so you know when I was born because
 
00:27:09.769 --> 00:27:09.779 align:start position:0%
I'm not that old
 
00:27:09.779 --> 00:27:10.370 align:start position:0%
I'm not that old
um

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
I'm not that young either but um
 
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
I said what's the big difference and he
 
00:27:18.529 --> 00:27:18.539 align:start position:0%
said when I started the the Dean's
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
office was the dean and a secretary
 
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
and he said when I left the Dean's
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
office was like 25 people and I don't
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
know what any of them do
 
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
very cynical attitude I'm I'm sure but
 
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
there's a I think we all have this
 
00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
notion a little bit of uh the
 
00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:37.559 align:start position:0%
non-academic staff for for very good
 
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
reasons I mean the way you compete for
 
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
students is very different and it you
 
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
only have to go into the cafeteria it's
 
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
also a word you probably don't use
 
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:47.220 align:start position:0%
anymore to understand that but the way
 
00:27:48.649 --> 00:27:48.659 align:start position:0%
you have to compete for sins is very
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
different today now you're quite right
 
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.130 align:start position:0%
different today now you're quite right
sir

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
sir
 
00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:55.559 align:start position:0%
um when when covet happened it gave us
 
00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to try and and think
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
through that issue and see what we could
 
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
do and so we offered uh some retirement
 
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
incentives and Kathy May know the
 
00:28:06.769 --> 00:28:06.779 align:start position:0%
numbers for the whole system but I I
 
00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
know that just at UNH alone we had about
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
258 people leave something like that uh
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
most of them were staff and so it gave
 
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:17.820 align:start position:0%
us a chance to sort of resize the
 
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
university and and that is one of the
 
00:28:21.769 --> 00:28:21.779 align:start position:0%
reasons why our costs are so much less
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
than they were today uh one of the
 
00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:25.740 align:start position:0%
reasons for the growth of staff and by
 
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
the way I don't think we have any Dean's
 
00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
office that's anywhere near 25 people
 
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:31.140 align:start position:0%
that's good gross exaggeration
 
00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
um but are they bigger than they used to
 
00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:34.980 align:start position:0%
be yeah because we're asked to do more
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
um for just as one example of an
 
00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:39.900 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate you probably are
 
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
following or have followed Title IX and
 
00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
the responsibilities that universities
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
have in Title IX to try and address
 
00:28:49.549 --> 00:28:49.559 align:start position:0%
issues with anything that influences you
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
women different than young men that
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
started out in athletics but now it's
 
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
more about sexual assault
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
all of us have had to add a tremendous
 
00:28:58.909 --> 00:28:58.919 align:start position:0%
number of Staff in order to to address
 
00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
that unfunded mandate
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
and you don't really get any choice I
 
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
mean if you get in the wrong side of the
 
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
federal government You'll wish you
 
00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
didn't so that would be an example but
 
00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:10.140 align:start position:0%
there's others as well I mean I'll also
 
00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:13.559 align:start position:0%
say that we have across the country a
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
mental health crisis among college
 
00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:16.919 align:start position:0%
students and we've had to staff up to
 
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
try and address that we literally can't
 
00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
find enough counselors but we keep
 
00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
trying to do that so it's it's easy to
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
be cynical and say administrative blow
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah but there's two examples
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
where you really don't have any choice
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
to do that despite all that we did make
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
some very significant cuts to try and
 
00:29:36.769 --> 00:29:36.779 align:start position:0%
make sure that we were not
 
00:29:39.049 --> 00:29:39.059 align:start position:0%
any bigger than we had to be in most
 
00:29:40.909 --> 00:29:40.919 align:start position:0%
areas and and what that required us to
 
00:29:42.529 --> 00:29:42.539 align:start position:0%
do is to think differently about how we
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
do the work and to tell you about all
 
00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:46.860 align:start position:0%
that would take longer than you'd have
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
time to hear from today but we're aware
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
of the problem and I think we've
 
00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
responded pretty responsibly to it I
 
00:29:54.409 --> 00:29:54.419 align:start position:0%
thought slides 10 and 11 in particular
 
00:29:54.419 --> 00:29:55.549 align:start position:0%
thought slides 10 and 11 in particular
were

00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:29:58.490 --> 00:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
um a wonderful narrative for you
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
to tell you to tell your story
 
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
um the only thing I would end with is do
 
00:30:06.409 --> 00:30:06.419 align:start position:0%
you have are there State mandates that
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
are placed upon you I by the way we
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
hired somebody from UNH Food Service in
 
00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:15.140 align:start position:0%
my department who was uh
 
00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
uh must have done a great job for you
 
00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
because she's doing a hell of a job for
 
00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
us and so I appreciate you getting her
 
00:30:25.389 --> 00:30:25.399 align:start position:0%
ready for us you're welcome I think yes
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not gonna have the areas in which
 
00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:29.940 align:start position:0%
we're just getting killed trying to get
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
and keep people as you know so normally
 
00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:34.860 align:start position:0%
I don't I'm not able to poach from other
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
people but every now and again and I
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
take advantage of it but are we is a
 
00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
state imposing mandate most of them are
 
00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:42.539 align:start position:0%
federal I'm sure but it's the state and
 
00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
doing anything that
 
00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:46.919 align:start position:0%
there's some minor things I wouldn't say
 
00:30:48.769 --> 00:30:48.779 align:start position:0%
there's some major ones but Kathy May
 
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
know better than I yeah yes there are
 
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
there are State mandates
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
um some of them are combined with
 
00:30:58.490 --> 00:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
Federal right land Grand land grant
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
universities must provide you know
 
00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension
 
00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.450 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension
um

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:04.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
agricultural experiment station
 
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
there are a few others we also provide
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
free tuition to National Guards men and
 
00:31:14.279 --> 00:31:15.710 align:start position:0%
free tuition to National Guards men and
women

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
women
 
00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
um and all through state law which you
 
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
know we're not going to take exception
 
00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
to that for sure but but yes there are
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
State mandates in statute for various
 
00:31:30.049 --> 00:31:30.059 align:start position:0%
programs that that we're required to to
 
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:32.039 align:start position:0%
provide I think people would be
 
00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
intrigued to learn what some of those
 
00:31:36.409 --> 00:31:36.419 align:start position:0%
were at some point
 
00:31:38.769 --> 00:31:38.779 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely because they total about
 
00:31:42.769 --> 00:31:42.779 align:start position:0%
13 million dollars of the state and that
 
00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't include the free tuition the
 
00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
experiment the AG experiment station
 
00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
there's a anyway that that total is
 
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
about 13 million of the 88.5 million
 
00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
that the university system receives from
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
there's also there's a survey on sexual
 
00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
assault that's in statute that we need
 
00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
to do every year across the university
 
00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.049 align:start position:0%
to do every year across the university
system

00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:06.059 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
oops great thank you sorry I I agree
 
00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
that that would be a really good story
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
to uh we will um
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
and Charlie I will leave this for you
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you there's a chart
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
there's a chart on page 10 of the report
 
00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:23.220 align:start position:0%
that will show you the breakdown of all
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
of our
 
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:27.320 align:start position:0%
types of expense expenses instruction
 
00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.409 align:start position:0%
types of expense expenses instruction
auxiliary

00:32:29.409 --> 00:32:29.419 align:start position:0%
auxiliary
 
00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
thank you if I could have 15 more
 
00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:34.340 align:start position:0%
seconds I'll just say one thing that
 
00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's important to explain is
 
00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
that many of our faculty are involved in
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
funded research and they're bringing in
 
00:32:42.769 --> 00:32:42.779 align:start position:0%
literally millions of dollars from the
 
00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:44.700 align:start position:0%
federal government and that brings some
 
00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:46.500 align:start position:0%
costs along with it too but that's
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
really an economic engine we have some
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
strengths in in many areas so that's
 
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
probably in there as well okay one last
 
00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:55.860 align:start position:0%
quick question uh sort of the theme of
 
00:32:58.250 --> 00:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
this to these hearings uh your your
 
00:33:00.889 --> 00:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate how how difficult has it
 
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
been to attract faculty and staff and
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
retain faculty and staff at the
 
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:08.100 align:start position:0%
University system
 
00:33:10.669 --> 00:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's been difficult
 
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
um probably at least speaking for UNH
 
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
probably more for staff and for faculty
 
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
um faculty's always been competitive
 
00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
it's a competitive market especially for
 
00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:22.620 align:start position:0%
the really strong faculty who you want
 
00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:23.810 align:start position:0%
the really strong faculty who you want
um

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
but I mean honestly it's easier to hire
 
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
an English Professor than it is for
 
00:33:31.549 --> 00:33:31.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:33.289 --> 00:33:33.299 align:start position:0%
the issue at Plymouth and Keene honestly
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
is housing
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
we can bring faculty and they can't find
 
00:33:39.889 --> 00:33:39.899 align:start position:0%
housing anywhere so we've been we have
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
some faculty that are living on campus
 
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
and some don't come because they can't
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
find housing it's
 
00:33:48.649 --> 00:33:48.659 align:start position:0%
another theme I'm sure if you're hearing
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:54.049 --> 00:33:54.059 align:start position:0%
this is just a I think to take off of
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
what uh what James asked about Workforce
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know we hear from all our agencies
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
about Workforce shortages but what your
 
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
students coming in where do you see them
 
00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:04.500 align:start position:0%
leading towards in terms of where they
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
want to head career-wise I mean I know
 
00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
that they may not know where they're
 
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
heading when they're coming in the door
 
00:34:11.089 --> 00:34:11.099 align:start position:0%
um but the you know on the outside of it
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
you know we're struggling across the
 
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
board agencies coming in with Workforce
 
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
issues so how are those you know
 
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
students coming in where are they
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
navigating you know towards in terms of
 
00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
fields or things like that
 
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
it's a really good question and it's
 
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
hard to give a simple answer to it I
 
00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
would say from from Decades of dealing
 
00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:31.740 align:start position:0%
with undergraduates that there's
 
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
sort of two groups and there's the one
 
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
group that has their life planned out to
 
00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:37.740 align:start position:0%
25 or 30 and they're going to go to med
 
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
school and they're going to major in
 
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
biology and they're going to do this and
 
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:41.570 align:start position:0%
biology and they're going to do this and
that

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:43.609 --> 00:34:43.619 align:start position:0%
um uh some of the business school
 
00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
students are in the same category I'm
 
00:34:47.329 --> 00:34:47.339 align:start position:0%
going to go be a private Equity manager
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
or something along those lines uh or I'm
 
00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:51.419 align:start position:0%
going to go to law school so there's
 
00:34:53.329 --> 00:34:53.339 align:start position:0%
some that are they're pretty focused and
 
00:34:54.649 --> 00:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
then there's another group that honestly
 
00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
have no idea and I will say that the
 
00:34:59.170 --> 00:34:59.180 align:start position:0%
first group often changes their mind
 
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
right and you know I wouldn't
 
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
necessarily want to be 18 today going
 
00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
into this kind of an economy trying to
 
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
figure out where's your place it feels
 
00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:08.940 align:start position:0%
like it's just a lot hazier than it was
 
00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:10.619 align:start position:0%
I mean you read the statistics that say
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
people are going to have seven different
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
jobs for four different organizations
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
and some of the industries are working
 
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
going to work in haven't been invented
 
00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:18.829 align:start position:0%
going to work in haven't been invented
yet

00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:18.839 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
so we're again trying to do our best to
 
00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
support our students in that environment
 
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh the ones who think they know what
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
they want and the ones who are sure that
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
The Internship opportunity
 
00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
and the partnership with businesses
 
00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
non-profits and community members makes
 
00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
all the difference UNH probably four or
 
00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:47.420 align:start position:0%
five years ago
 
00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
invested in its own they call it caps
 
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
they're career advising and placement
 
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.870 align:start position:0%
they're career advising and placement
service

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
it's remarkable the work that's been
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
done and the success that they've had
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
Keenan and Plymouth don't have all the
 
00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:03.300 align:start position:0%
resources to stand that up so we want to
 
00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:05.700 align:start position:0%
partner with the state to impact the
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
workforce in those regions of the state
 
00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
the other thing is it's hard especially
 
00:36:12.349 --> 00:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
for small business to have the
 
00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:14.820 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to support the intern you
 
00:36:16.609 --> 00:36:16.619 align:start position:0%
want it to be a meaningful internship so
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
we want to build those supports to help
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
those small businesses in those regions
 
00:36:23.089 --> 00:36:23.099 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
to to have the experience meaningful not
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
only for the business but also for the
 
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.130 align:start position:0%
only for the business but also for the
student

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.410 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:32.420 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you very much
 
00:36:38.089 --> 00:36:38.099 align:start position:0%
always any follow-up questions never
 
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
hesitate our contact information is in
 
00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:41.700 align:start position:0%
the back of the deck we will be having
 
00:36:44.329 --> 00:36:44.339 align:start position:0%
discussions thank you
 
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
I'd like to invite the community college
 
00:36:47.569 --> 00:36:47.579 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire to give their
 
00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:00.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:19.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
good morning director Jerry commissioner
 
00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
arlinghaus assistant commissioner
 
00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:28.140 align:start position:0%
Rockburn supervisor Caraway and Mr
 
00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:30.839 align:start position:0%
landrigan good to see all of you and
 
00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:32.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing us some time this
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
morning to speak if you don't mind I'd
 
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
like to actually start by trying to
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
respond to the question that director
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
Jerry asked earlier regarding
 
00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
competition and demographics in some
 
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
ways that's the most common story about
 
00:37:49.609 --> 00:37:49.619 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education particularly in
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
the Northeast and in Northern New
 
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
England demographics have been driving
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
that but it's predicated on an
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
assumption that higher education only
 
00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
serves one purpose and a high school
 
00:38:02.329 --> 00:38:02.339 align:start position:0%
students coming out of high school going
 
00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:05.700 align:start position:0%
to college and in some ways for me and
 
00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:06.839 align:start position:0%
in particularly for the Community
 
00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
College systems role our analysis is
 
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
that post-secondary education actually
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
is going to be growing dramatically over
 
00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:16.140 align:start position:0%
time but it's going to grow differently
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be 18 year old
 
00:38:19.849 --> 00:38:19.859 align:start position:0%
full-time students going to college
 
00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:21.780 align:start position:0%
whether in a residential setting or
 
00:38:23.569 --> 00:38:23.579 align:start position:0%
Community College it's going to be
 
00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
reflected in the changes in people's
 
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
lives adults who need to reinvent
 
00:38:30.589 --> 00:38:30.599 align:start position:0%
themselves when the economy changes when
 
00:38:32.329 --> 00:38:32.339 align:start position:0%
technology changes when their lives
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
change they require education in
 
00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
different forms it's also the case that
 
00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
the population that even the traditional
 
00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
population if you will that
 
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education is going to
 
00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
serve is going to be different over the
 
00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
next 10 years than it's been for the
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
last 10 or 20 years and one of the most
 
00:38:51.119 --> 00:38:52.270 align:start position:0%
last 10 or 20 years and one of the most
persistent

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
persistent
 
00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:54.660 align:start position:0%
observations that I can share comes from
 
00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
data that the part of Education provides
 
00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
each year
 
00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
and I don't have the current Year's data
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
but last year 21 of the students in New
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's K-12 enrollment were
 
00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:07.380 align:start position:0%
eligible for free and reduced lunch
 
00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
that's actually down from a couple of
 
00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
years earlier it's a reflection of their
 
00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
circumstances and their parents
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances but you can look at school
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
districts like Manchester Berlin Laconia
 
00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:21.320 align:start position:0%
Littleton All Above 40 percent eligible
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
here in the state capitol Concord 33
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
percent eligible we're talking about
 
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
students for whom affordability and
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
access to post-secondary education is
 
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
going to be a real challenge for them
 
00:39:34.609 --> 00:39:34.619 align:start position:0%
and their families
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
so a significant part of our thinking
 
00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
over the last several years and I've
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
only been with community college system
 
00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:43.880 align:start position:0%
for about 15 months so I'm I'm I'm
 
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
learning as I go but a significant part
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
of the of the analysis points to the
 
00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
fact that we've got to reinvent how we
 
00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:53.940 align:start position:0%
do the work we do who we serve and how
 
00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
we engage those populations so you'll
 
00:39:58.250 --> 00:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
see that our key themes are about
 
00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:00.980 align:start position:0%
affordability and access and also about
 
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
restructuring the way in which we
 
00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:05.220 align:start position:0%
deliver the programs and services that
 
00:40:08.089 --> 00:40:08.099 align:start position:0%
we have we've identified three sets of
 
00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:09.900 align:start position:0%
priorities that involve removing
 
00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:12.300 align:start position:0%
barriers and creating bridges for
 
00:40:14.329 --> 00:40:14.339 align:start position:0%
students supporting New Hampshire's
 
00:40:16.609 --> 00:40:16.619 align:start position:0%
Workforce through lifelong learning and
 
00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
then as a bit of a sidebar we're
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
increasingly cognizant of the pressure
 
00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:23.700 align:start position:0%
that energy costs are placed on each of
 
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
our campuses operationally so we're
 
00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
trying to push down on that by shifting
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
to renewable where we can and we think
 
00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity to make a
 
00:40:32.569 --> 00:40:32.579 align:start position:0%
significant impact on our operating
 
00:40:32.579 --> 00:40:34.210 align:start position:0%
significant impact on our operating
expenses

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:34.220 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
so I I think I've gone over what's on
 
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
slide two and if you don't mind I'll
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
I'll move to slide four and uh or slide
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
three rather just talk a little bit
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
about the reinvention process and
 
00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
Community College system has faced some
 
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
of the enrollment challenges that that
 
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
you've described and have been typical
 
00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
for community colleges across the
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
country uh post 2011 and 2008 2009 was
 
00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:04.740 align:start position:0%
the was was the Golden Era refill was
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
for community colleges when the housing
 
00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:09.660 align:start position:0%
bubble burst and when the Great
 
00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
Recession or at least the last raker
 
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
session hit adults were pushed out of
 
00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
the workforce and many of them ended up
 
00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
in community colleges high water mark
 
00:41:20.089 --> 00:41:20.099 align:start position:0%
for Community College enrollment at that
 
00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:22.740 align:start position:0%
point that wave began to dissipate by
 
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
2011 and from 2011 on you can see an
 
00:41:29.089 --> 00:41:29.099 align:start position:0%
exodus of about 2 million adult Learners
 
00:41:32.109 --> 00:41:32.119 align:start position:0%
25 and older from public well from
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education no longer
 
00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
feeling the need to get the education
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
complete the degree if they hadn't gone
 
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
yet because employers were anxious for
 
00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
the talent that's increasingly the case
 
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
today we've been sub
 
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
um prior to the pandemic New Hampshire
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
sub four percent a sub three percent
 
00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
unemployment for four years and now back
 
00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
back to that that level again so
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
employers desperate for talent and the
 
00:41:59.210 --> 00:41:59.220 align:start position:0%
competition that that's created do I
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
want to spend the additional time and
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
effort and money with pursuing a degree
 
00:42:04.849 --> 00:42:04.859 align:start position:0%
or do I want to go to work and get well
 
00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
paid for my time right now and part of
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is reorient that
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
thinking that instead of competing for
 
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
students time we're trying to align our
 
00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
interests with those of students and
 
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
employers so that when everyone everyone
 
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
wins it's not a a competition but it
 
00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
really is a collaboration to succeed and
 
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
to prepare people to be successful over
 
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
time as those Cycles persist so over the
 
00:42:32.089 --> 00:42:32.099 align:start position:0%
last eight or nine years the community
 
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
college system has actually reduced the
 
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
size of its Workforce by about 30
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
percent has done a lot to reorient the
 
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
way that our programs are delivered and
 
00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:44.220 align:start position:0%
currently about 30 percent of our
 
00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
instructional engagement with students
 
00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:48.900 align:start position:0%
that is online giving students more
 
00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
access to asynchronous learning
 
00:42:56.329 --> 00:42:56.339 align:start position:0%
we see more opportunity to to grow that
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
area but we also see more opportunity to
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
spread chronologically if you will and
 
00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:06.020 align:start position:0%
one of the most well
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
engaged programs that we offer is
 
00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:09.839 align:start position:0%
running start a form of dual enrollment
 
00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
where students have access to college
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
level learning in high school we're
 
00:43:17.569 --> 00:43:17.579 align:start position:0%
trying to expand students access to that
 
00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
in large part to create more
 
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities it helps with
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
affordability but also helps to bond
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
students to the state of New Hampshire
 
00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
and when when President Dean was
 
00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
speaking earlier about the effort to
 
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:33.180 align:start position:0%
both keep students here in New Hampshire
 
00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:34.740 align:start position:0%
and then also to bring bring out of
 
00:43:36.349 --> 00:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
state students in
 
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
for students who are pursuing four-year
 
00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:41.420 align:start position:0%
degrees New Hampshire has the
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunate record of being the highest
 
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
net export on a percentage basis of
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
students pursuing four-year degrees
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
nearly 60 percent of students going out
 
00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
of state for those degrees the
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to use running start as a
 
00:43:59.690 --> 00:43:59.700 align:start position:0%
framework to attract students to bond
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
them to New Hampshire give them
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities whether they go directly
 
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
to the university system whether they
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
come to the community college system and
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
take advantage of last year's House Bill
 
00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
1530 which will establish stronger
 
00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:14.220 align:start position:0%
Pathways either way we can do a better
 
00:44:16.609 --> 00:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
job collectively of helping students to
 
00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
find their way in New Hampshire and for
 
00:44:20.329 --> 00:44:20.339 align:start position:0%
those students who are less likely to go
 
00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
to post-secondary education because cost
 
00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
is a barrier the work that we think we
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
can do by expanding access to running
 
00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
start and other forms of dual enrollment
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
again strengthening the opportunity to
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
pursue post-secondary not necessarily
 
00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
for a four-year degree but for the
 
00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:36.300 align:start position:0%
education whether Technical Training and
 
00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
career oriented but something that gives
 
00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
people a leg up and a leg into the
 
00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:44.300 align:start position:0%
workforce here in New Hampshire
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
I've shifted to pay page four at this
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
point uh with with uh with that and I've
 
00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:53.240 align:start position:0%
jumped ahead of myself a little bit but
 
00:44:56.329 --> 00:44:56.339 align:start position:0%
let me then just walk back to the top of
 
00:44:58.569 --> 00:44:58.579 align:start position:0%
that list there
 
00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:02.220 align:start position:0%
tuition freeze president Dean again on
 
00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
behalf of the University system was
 
00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
describing tuition held flat for five
 
00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
years the community college system has
 
00:45:10.609 --> 00:45:10.619 align:start position:0%
raised tuition five dollars over the
 
00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:14.220 align:start position:0%
last 12 years and that's a when it
 
00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
controlled for inflation instead of the
 
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
215 and two in 2010 is equivalent of
 
00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:20.700 align:start position:0%
about a hundred and fifty eight dollars
 
00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
so we've effectively removed 25 percent
 
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
of the cost of Education by holding
 
00:45:28.609 --> 00:45:28.619 align:start position:0%
tuition flat we'd like to continue to do
 
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
that we think it's a significant part of
 
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
that the access mission that we have but
 
00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
it costs money to do that the ability to
 
00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
absorb the expense of delivering
 
00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:40.140 align:start position:0%
programs uh will will be increasingly
 
00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
challenged if we don't have some relief
 
00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:43.210 align:start position:0%
challenged if we don't have some relief
there

00:45:43.210 --> 00:45:43.220 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:46.140 align:start position:0%
expanding Workforce credential programs
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
most of what we do is in classrooms and
 
00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
online but it's credit bearing it leads
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
to degrees as I was describing earlier
 
00:45:56.809 --> 00:45:56.819 align:start position:0%
the change in in the needs for
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education increasingly
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
are going to be about short-term
 
00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
programs very tactical and specific
 
00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:06.660 align:start position:0%
training programs and credentials that
 
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
allow people who may already have a
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
post-secondary degree to move laterally
 
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:12.780 align:start position:0%
vertically diagonally some other
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
direction that doesn't require sitting
 
00:46:17.329 --> 00:46:17.339 align:start position:0%
in a classroom needs a shorter duration
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
shorter impact or a quicker impact to
 
00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
get back in the workforce and to keep
 
00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
moving forward and those programs have a
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
different Financial structure to them
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
generally speaking not eligible for
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
federal financial aids our ability to
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
deliver those programs is going to be
 
00:46:34.849 --> 00:46:34.859 align:start position:0%
affected by our ability to make them
 
00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:37.880 align:start position:0%
affordable and accessible to people
 
00:46:41.530 --> 00:46:41.540 align:start position:0%
expanding Child Care currently DHHS
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
provides a grant funding comes to the
 
00:46:46.849 --> 00:46:46.859 align:start position:0%
community college system about two
 
00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars a year our
 
00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
observation of the data is that students
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
tend to participate in that program it
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
allows for 100 coverage of a handful of
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
courses fifty percent for another set of
 
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
courses no coverage for courses outside
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
the certificate
 
00:47:06.349 --> 00:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
what we observe is that students benefit
 
00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:09.780 align:start position:0%
from the free courses and begin to step
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
back from those where they've got to put
 
00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:13.980 align:start position:0%
money on the table and then tend to
 
00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
disappear not necessarily finish full
 
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
degrees in this area the problem that
 
00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:21.780 align:start position:0%
that creates is that for a lot of a lot
 
00:47:23.569 --> 00:47:23.579 align:start position:0%
of individuals who go into the workforce
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
for child care very quickly they find
 
00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:27.780 align:start position:0%
themselves without the credential the
 
00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
education really to grow in that field
 
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
they tend to be
 
00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
drawn away to other fields where you
 
00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
know wages are higher without the
 
00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
additional education what we're
 
00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
proposing is an initiative that would
 
00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
allow us to expand access to child care
 
00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
education prepare the child care
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
Workforce but alleviate the barrier of
 
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
cost and debt and help people who care
 
00:47:52.609 --> 00:47:52.619 align:start position:0%
about that work want to be in that field
 
00:47:55.609 --> 00:47:55.619 align:start position:0%
avoid the the pressure that finances
 
00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
will either keep them out or pull them
 
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
away and we think that that opens up
 
00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:02.220 align:start position:0%
opportunities for almost every sector of
 
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
the state's economy by creating more
 
00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
capacity see for high quality child care
 
00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:08.780 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
as I started earlier about the Dual and
 
00:48:13.970 --> 00:48:13.980 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment currently we
 
00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:15.980 align:start position:0%
benefit from a
 
00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
extensive collaboration with more than
 
00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:20.220 align:start position:0%
100 high schools in New Hampshire to
 
00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
deliver those courses that in the
 
00:48:24.589 --> 00:48:24.599 align:start position:0%
running Start program the legislature
 
00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
has also grant us a million and a half
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
dollars in scholarship for stem and CTE
 
00:48:31.329 --> 00:48:31.339 align:start position:0%
courses to alleviate the fifty dollar
 
00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:35.220 align:start position:0%
per credit cost for students in this
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
instance we're not simply looking for
 
00:48:38.329 --> 00:48:38.339 align:start position:0%
more scholarship dollars what we're
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
actually looking for some additional
 
00:48:42.109 --> 00:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
dollars to allow us to be a little bit
 
00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:44.700 align:start position:0%
more creative can we in fact help
 
00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
overcome some of the barriers to dual
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
enrollment in some cases it's because
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
high schools don't have academically
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
qualified teachers to deliver those
 
00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:55.260 align:start position:0%
courses can we have our faculty teaching
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
those courses on site can we find
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
different ways to partner with school
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
districts to to assist in expanding
 
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
access to these courses again with the
 
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:07.079 align:start position:0%
idea that we're giving students a
 
00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
stronger foundation for their education
 
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
creating more affordability alleviating
 
00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
the risk of loan and debt over time and
 
00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:16.740 align:start position:0%
bonding those students to New Hampshire
 
00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:19.400 align:start position:0%
more effectively
 
00:49:22.849 --> 00:49:22.859 align:start position:0%
those are the core pieces of what we do
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
today that we think we can build on
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
you'll see the next item there is a
 
00:49:29.329 --> 00:49:29.339 align:start position:0%
tuition reset this is a little bit more
 
00:49:32.089 --> 00:49:32.099 align:start position:0%
out of the box but what we're interested
 
00:49:35.109 --> 00:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
in testing is a theory that if we make
 
00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:37.380 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education more affordable
 
00:49:40.569 --> 00:49:40.579 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire we can actually expand
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
participation Health students and
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
families engage about 12 years ago
 
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
former Chancellor Ross cattell had
 
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
initiated this effort and the approach
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
was intended to lower tuition gradually
 
00:49:55.069 --> 00:49:55.079 align:start position:0%
with the expectation that enrollment
 
00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
would grow and service apply and demand
 
00:49:59.690 --> 00:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
and the way an economist might think
 
00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
um it did not work out the way anyone
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
would have anticipated part of it was
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
the downdraft in in enrollment
 
00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:10.260 align:start position:0%
particularly among adult Learners at
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
that point but some of it may also been
 
00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
that five dollars on a 215 tuition is
 
00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
not enough to move the needle what we're
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
proposing is to actually reduce tuition
 
00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:21.780 align:start position:0%
to a hundred and seventy dollars a
 
00:50:23.569 --> 00:50:23.579 align:start position:0%
credit that may seem a little bit
 
00:50:25.309 --> 00:50:25.319 align:start position:0%
arbitrary but what that would allow us
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
to do would be at least on a test basis
 
00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:30.900 align:start position:0%
for most of our programs offer what
 
00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:32.940 align:start position:0%
amounts to free community college for
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
students who are pale eligible allows us
 
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
to put something on the table next to
 
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
what Maine and Vermont are doing to to
 
00:50:41.569 --> 00:50:41.579 align:start position:0%
neighboring states who are are
 
00:50:44.329 --> 00:50:44.339 align:start position:0%
approaching free community college and
 
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:46.140 align:start position:0%
make sure that we don't become at a
 
00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:47.390 align:start position:0%
make sure that we don't become at a
disadvantage

00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
disadvantage
 
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
in competing for Employers in the area
 
00:50:53.809 --> 00:50:53.819 align:start position:0%
um yeah but before I go to the last
 
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
initiative which is the solar piece
 
00:50:58.609 --> 00:50:58.619 align:start position:0%
um I would like to just step back for a
 
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
second and talk a little bit about what
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
all of all of the uh changes that we've
 
00:51:04.849 --> 00:51:04.859 align:start position:0%
been doing with dual and concurrent
 
00:51:08.089 --> 00:51:08.099 align:start position:0%
enrollment uh mean for us in some ways
 
00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
by making more of what we offer
 
00:51:12.049 --> 00:51:12.059 align:start position:0%
available through high schools we've
 
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
shifted the portfolio of programs that
 
00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
we offer we we've concentrated the ones
 
00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
that we're offering on site with the
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
most important most expensive programs
 
00:51:25.309 --> 00:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
that we offer whether it's radiation
 
00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
therapy nursing dental hygiene
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
automotive technology electronic
 
00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:32.099 align:start position:0%
engineering technology if you roll back
 
00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
the clock five years what you would have
 
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
found is with more liberal arts courses
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
more business courses we were
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
effectively generating that Revenue that
 
00:51:41.809 --> 00:51:41.819 align:start position:0%
it was offsetting the costly's more
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
expensive programs over time as we have
 
00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
worked hard to make these courses more
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
accessible through running start we've
 
00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:50.220 align:start position:0%
shifted that portfolio we've left
 
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
ourselves with a more offensive set of
 
00:51:54.589 --> 00:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
programs but they're also programs that
 
00:51:56.329 --> 00:51:56.339 align:start position:0%
are absolutely critical to the state so
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
it's changed our business model it's
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
something that we've got to navigate and
 
00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:02.460 align:start position:0%
we've been able to do that largely with
 
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:05.220 align:start position:0%
with support from the state so again
 
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
didn't want to lose sight of the fact
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
that underneath the the relatively even
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
Keel of of what you might see we've got
 
00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
a shift in the gears that we've got to
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
to navigate
 
00:52:19.309 --> 00:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
I mean the last piece is the Solar
 
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
projects and again just uh a simple
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
version of this we recognize that with
 
00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
energy costs growing rapidly for
 
00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:29.700 align:start position:0%
everybody some of this is opportunity
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
can serve resource for the community
 
00:52:33.049 --> 00:52:33.059 align:start position:0%
college system and some of this is also
 
00:52:35.809 --> 00:52:35.819 align:start position:0%
because of the scale uh that that we use
 
00:52:38.569 --> 00:52:38.579 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to alleviate some of the
 
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
pressure on utility companies for the
 
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
electricity that has to be generated we
 
00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:46.020 align:start position:0%
see that we've got uh the opportunity
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
with with moderate investment of capital
 
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:51.900 align:start position:0%
to make an impact in both directions
 
00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:54.660 align:start position:0%
so if I can stop there and perhaps
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
answer any questions okay excellent
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you uh you you just touched on my
 
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
first question which is you know the the
 
00:53:05.329 --> 00:53:05.339 align:start position:0%
shift between a liberal arts education
 
00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:07.140 align:start position:0%
more towards the towards why we call a
 
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
more skilled based education and
 
00:53:11.809 --> 00:53:11.819 align:start position:0%
certainly we hear from employers all the
 
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
time and what no one ever comes to us
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
and says is we need someone with a
 
00:53:18.650 --> 00:53:18.660 align:start position:0%
liberal arts education they say we need
 
00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
skills and could you I don't know if you
 
00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
have even just rough numbers as far as
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
enrollments in what you know the liberal
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
arts education versus the those going
 
00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:31.740 align:start position:0%
skills like like the dental hygienist
 
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
nursing uh computer high-tech things
 
00:53:37.609 --> 00:53:37.619 align:start position:0%
like that yeah our our single largest
 
00:53:40.609 --> 00:53:40.619 align:start position:0%
program and let me just say full
 
00:53:42.349 --> 00:53:42.359 align:start position:0%
disclosure liberal arts graduate history
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
in English and and proud of it political
 
00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:46.700 align:start position:0%
science policy studies economics and
 
00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
what we find I I think that most
 
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
employers say what I need right now is
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
the skills over time to grow into
 
00:53:56.329 --> 00:53:56.339 align:start position:0%
supervisory roles and having the liberal
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
arts skills critical thinking effective
 
00:54:00.349 --> 00:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
communication those things pay off in
 
00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:02.220 align:start position:0%
the long run in terms of value to the
 
00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:04.740 align:start position:0%
employer uh to have that but right now
 
00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
what I need is that burning you know set
 
00:54:08.329 --> 00:54:08.339 align:start position:0%
of skills
 
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
um our single largest degree program is
 
00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
nursing last year we we conferred 243
 
00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
degrees to our ends another 37 to LPNs
 
00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
over the last 12 years over 3 200
 
00:54:25.549 --> 00:54:25.559 align:start position:0%
nursing degrees awarded that is twice as
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
many degrees as any other program which
 
00:54:29.569 --> 00:54:29.579 align:start position:0%
by the way the number two in that list
 
00:54:31.849 --> 00:54:31.859 align:start position:0%
is liberal arts
 
00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:34.740 align:start position:0%
um but again roughly a thousand a
 
00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
thousand certificates in welding over
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
the last decade 600 automotive
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
technology certifications
 
00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:44.700 align:start position:0%
um in 400 dental hygienists and
 
00:54:48.049 --> 00:54:48.059 align:start position:0%
radiologic technicians about 400 as well
 
00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
you can go down the list and we've got
 
00:54:53.089 --> 00:54:53.099 align:start position:0%
this broad mix of programs that balance
 
00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
you know include both a particularly
 
00:54:58.250 --> 00:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
High concentration in health care but
 
00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
also a range of Technology programs to
 
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
some degree the the throughput if you
 
00:55:06.290 --> 00:55:06.300 align:start position:0%
will is a product of student interest
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
we're seeing
 
00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:10.380 align:start position:0%
relatively stable interest in health
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
care related programs particularly
 
00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:13.750 align:start position:0%
care related programs particularly
nursing

00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
nursing
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
liberal arts is the area where there's
 
00:55:17.809 --> 00:55:17.819 align:start position:0%
been less interest even though it's
 
00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:19.559 align:start position:0%
still the second largest number of
 
00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:21.900 align:start position:0%
conferrals just because a lot of
 
00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
students and families recognize that
 
00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:25.559 align:start position:0%
that's a building block for transfer to
 
00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:27.660 align:start position:0%
a four-year institution or other things
 
00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:30.380 align:start position:0%
they want to do in life okay
 
00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
another question on when for your online
 
00:55:36.829 --> 00:55:36.839 align:start position:0%
component for students who take courses
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
online obviously that would at least
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
would appear to me that that would
 
00:55:42.770 --> 00:55:42.780 align:start position:0%
increase your technology technology
 
00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
budget and
 
00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:46.030 align:start position:0%
budget and
um

00:55:46.030 --> 00:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
obviously increase that as more and more
 
00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
students come online are you set in that
 
00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
area or are you looking for upgrades in
 
00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
any of your technology areas I I think
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
the technology is always going to be a
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
pressure point for us we partnered with
 
00:56:04.849 --> 00:56:04.859 align:start position:0%
the university system and with
 
00:56:06.890 --> 00:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
Department of Education in fact within
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
the last two years for a common license
 
00:56:10.790 --> 00:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
or at least a shared vendor or a
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
relationship with canvas for our LMS
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
their continued opportunities there but
 
00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:18.780 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll see see upward pressure you
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
know if I think long term the potential
 
00:56:24.829 --> 00:56:24.839 align:start position:0%
for technology to enhance particular
 
00:56:27.410 --> 00:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
particularly virtual reality as an
 
00:56:30.049 --> 00:56:30.059 align:start position:0%
element again I think they're going to
 
00:56:31.849 --> 00:56:31.859 align:start position:0%
be growing expenses not just for online
 
00:56:34.609 --> 00:56:34.619 align:start position:0%
but things that that we'll want to do on
 
00:56:34.619 --> 00:56:35.930 align:start position:0%
but things that that we'll want to do on
campuses

00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
campuses
 
00:56:40.030 --> 00:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
Hi how are you nice to see you again
 
00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:48.839 align:start position:0%
I have a couple questions
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
um I want to start with um how big is
 
00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:53.220 align:start position:0%
your question I asked um the system as
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
well the other system as well
 
00:56:58.010 --> 00:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
um how big is your total budget
 
00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
operating budget ballpark about 115
 
00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839 align:start position:0%
million dollars about 115.
 
00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:05.700 align:start position:0%
and that's across all the campuses
 
00:57:07.730 --> 00:57:07.740 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
um thank you I I appreciate that I I in
 
00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
the back of my head I always try to
 
00:57:14.809 --> 00:57:14.819 align:start position:0%
remember this that
 
00:57:17.569 --> 00:57:17.579 align:start position:0%
the state appropriation is
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
well it's critical for both
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
systems that's critical in slightly
 
00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
different ways we're on smaller portion
 
00:57:28.329 --> 00:57:28.339 align:start position:0%
of the of Kathy's budget and we're
 
00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:31.260 align:start position:0%
quite a larger portion of yours
 
00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:31.910 align:start position:0%
quite a larger portion of yours
um

00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
which is both good and bad for you
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
it's one of those things that's a
 
00:57:38.690 --> 00:57:38.700 align:start position:0%
double-edged sword right it is but it it
 
00:57:42.049 --> 00:57:42.059 align:start position:0%
makes clear the critical relationship we
 
00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
have for the state and you know again my
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
vantage point we're uh we're also a
 
00:57:50.569 --> 00:57:50.579 align:start position:0%
resource for the state having heard the
 
00:57:52.790 --> 00:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
governor yesterday describing the
 
00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:54.900 align:start position:0%
challenges that the state as an employer
 
00:57:56.569 --> 00:57:56.579 align:start position:0%
will face for delivering critical
 
00:57:59.089 --> 00:57:59.099 align:start position:0%
services for New Hampshire citizens and
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for uh in community
 
00:58:03.410 --> 00:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
college system and the university system
 
00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:05.700 align:start position:0%
to be into in-house partner for
 
00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
delivering that kind of training and
 
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
it's probably an underutilized uh
 
00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
resource right now but something that we
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
could deliver
 
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
you know and frankly the the you know
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
some of us have a more direct
 
00:58:21.049 --> 00:58:21.059 align:start position:0%
relationship with the community system
 
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
the college system than others but
 
00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:25.309 align:start position:0%
the college system than others but
um

00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
it's a critical component and the
 
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
nursing piece speaks to that I wanted to
 
00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:29.640 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about child care
 
00:58:31.849 --> 00:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
because that's a you know nursing is a
 
00:58:33.770 --> 00:58:33.780 align:start position:0%
very very much a headline issue that
 
00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:36.839 align:start position:0%
people and critical and you know we
 
00:58:38.690 --> 00:58:38.700 align:start position:0%
you know the veteran system is the
 
00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
Veterans Home is able to offer fewer
 
00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
places because they have
 
00:58:45.049 --> 00:58:45.059 align:start position:0%
staff issues not because they couldn't
 
00:58:46.569 --> 00:58:46.579 align:start position:0%
take care of them if they had the staff
 
00:58:49.130 --> 00:58:49.140 align:start position:0%
and that happens everywhere it's very
 
00:58:51.530 --> 00:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
true in child care and it has a
 
00:58:53.569 --> 00:58:53.579 align:start position:0%
cascading effect right where where if
 
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:54.799 align:start position:0%
you can't get
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
you know I deal with and and we only
 
00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
have about 450 employees in my
 
00:59:02.569 --> 00:59:02.579 align:start position:0%
department but it's something that comes
 
00:59:02.579 --> 00:59:03.589 align:start position:0%
department but it's something that comes
up

00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:05.700 align:start position:0%
um continually is the the notion of
 
00:59:07.730 --> 00:59:07.740 align:start position:0%
child care issues and
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
um you know people who people who take
 
00:59:13.069 --> 00:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
time off from work to
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
um become well typically mothers
 
00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
um and um uh they don't always come back
 
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
in a large component of that as child
 
00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:22.010 align:start position:0%
in a large component of that as child
care

00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
and I mean sometimes it's not child care
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
which is okay too but if if you're able
 
00:59:30.789 --> 00:59:30.799 align:start position:0%
to go through with us do you anticipate
 
00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
will we be able to see results fairly
 
00:59:36.109 --> 00:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
quickly will we be able to evaluate
 
00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
results fairly quickly
 
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of the duration of the
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
program I would think that by the time
 
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
we sat down next time for a conversation
 
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
like this we'd be able to see some
 
00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:49.559 align:start position:0%
measurable impact
 
00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:51.900 align:start position:0%
I think this is going to require like so
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
much of what we do partnership because
 
00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
part of it is the ability to deliver
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
these programs part of this is actually
 
01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
identifying the participants in these
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
programs and so again thinking about
 
01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:06.180 align:start position:0%
this as an ecosystem with child care
 
01:00:09.549 --> 01:00:09.559 align:start position:0%
providers as partners
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
whether there's an apprenticeship
 
01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:13.380 align:start position:0%
element to this model something that
 
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
helps to engage people directly so that
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
they don't have even the wait time of
 
01:00:19.789 --> 01:00:19.799 align:start position:0%
completing the degree but can they begin
 
01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
to learn while they're earning or while
 
01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:23.700 align:start position:0%
they're learning and you're partnering
 
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
already with with HHS on this
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
well HHS provides grant funding that we
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
benefit from I think there's an
 
01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
opportunity for more extensive
 
01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
relationship to figure out how to treat
 
01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:37.980 align:start position:0%
this as a systemic problem rather than
 
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
just a funding problem
 
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
okay I just it's a it's an area where
 
01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
where I sat through a
 
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
probably a year ago at this point a big
 
01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
presentation at one other Council
 
01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
breakfasts on on the challenges in in
 
01:00:55.130 --> 01:00:55.140 align:start position:0%
this area and uh and I think you know
 
01:00:56.690 --> 01:00:56.700 align:start position:0%
like I say nursing is a very much a
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
headline thing but this is just as
 
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
critical and he's very interested in
 
01:01:02.089 --> 01:01:02.099 align:start position:0%
hearing more about you have larger
 
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
employers that provide on-site child
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
care and that's one potential partner
 
01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:07.980 align:start position:0%
you have a lot of small businesses New
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that don't necessarily have
 
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
the resources to create on-site care but
 
01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
through some sort of collaborative you
 
01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
know Consortium agreement in partnership
 
01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
with DHS that there's a way to build
 
01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
structures around this to make it more
 
01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
sustainable and I think that it's partly
 
01:01:23.569 --> 01:01:23.579 align:start position:0%
the funding and partly it's getting
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
people to the right tables to to develop
 
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
those structures
 
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
do you do you have a sense on and I know
 
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
this is not on a deep dive your
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
particular area of expertise but do you
 
01:01:34.609 --> 01:01:34.619 align:start position:0%
have a sense like let's say we were you
 
01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
were a particularly large employer and
 
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
had maybe 10 000 people working for you
 
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
and you wanted to create
 
01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
um child care
 
01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:44.220 align:start position:0%
leaving aside the fact that there's
 
01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:46.260 align:start position:0%
Child Care player
 
01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:47.089 align:start position:0%
Child Care player
um

01:01:47.089 --> 01:01:47.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.329 --> 01:01:53.339 align:start position:0%
or is that a particular issue right now
 
01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:55.980 align:start position:0%
um I I think that part of the challenge
 
01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
has been that this is an area where
 
01:01:59.510 --> 01:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
there's a fair amount of turnover that
 
01:02:01.849 --> 01:02:01.859 align:start position:0%
in people's persistence in the field is
 
01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:04.980 align:start position:0%
is shorter than in other fields and some
 
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
of that I think is wage in discussing
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
that with the faculty than community
 
01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
college system faculty who work in early
 
01:02:13.849 --> 01:02:13.859 align:start position:0%
childhood education they identify wages
 
01:02:15.970 --> 01:02:15.980 align:start position:0%
as one of the primary
 
01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
impediments to longevity in the field
 
01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
but education that allows for
 
01:02:22.809 --> 01:02:22.819 align:start position:0%
professional growth and allows for
 
01:02:26.089 --> 01:02:26.099 align:start position:0%
increased wages is potentially
 
01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:29.339 align:start position:0%
sustaining so if you can lessen the
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
revolving door of people entering and
 
01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
leaving at about the same pace and
 
01:02:35.450 --> 01:02:35.460 align:start position:0%
actually build capacity by keeping
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
people longer growing them in this field
 
01:02:40.370 --> 01:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
you can expand capacity
 
01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
okay um thank you I I could go on I
 
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to belabor this though thank
 
01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:45.510 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you
 
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:46.849 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you
[Music]

01:02:46.849 --> 01:02:46.859 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:49.799 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning um I
 
01:02:52.370 --> 01:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
um have done a lot of adjunct teaching
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
over the years primarily for uh for you
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
guys and a few others but
 
01:03:01.130 --> 01:03:01.140 align:start position:0%
um do you offer any and this is really
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
kind of stemmed from what Charlie was
 
01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
just speaking about but any Partnerships
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
directly with employers for
 
01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
um Workforce training uh so not
 
01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:12.660 align:start position:0%
necessarily degree programs but
 
01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
um you know as an example I did a
 
01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
project once for granite College where
 
01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
they had a large employer that wanted
 
01:03:18.119 --> 01:03:20.089 align:start position:0%
they had a large employer that wanted
some

01:03:20.089 --> 01:03:20.099 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
um Advanced skill set for their
 
01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:22.740 align:start position:0%
employers you know for their employees
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
you know and so they offered a course
 
01:03:27.049 --> 01:03:27.059 align:start position:0%
and they had enough of uh interest that
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
they could offer a course that was you
 
01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
know dedicated just for that that
 
01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
employer really is scalable to others
 
01:03:34.730 --> 01:03:34.740 align:start position:0%
but and I just I think about that
 
01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
thinking just in Concord here you know
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
the large State employer that's right
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
here and looking for
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
um more training opportunities you know
 
01:03:44.329 --> 01:03:44.339 align:start position:0%
that building blocks whether it's the
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
accounting field or child care or other
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
areas I didn't know if the school does
 
01:03:50.809 --> 01:03:50.819 align:start position:0%
any of those types of Partnerships we we
 
01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
do each of our colleges has a business
 
01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
training center that specifically does
 
01:03:57.049 --> 01:03:57.059 align:start position:0%
that type of work or coordinates that
 
01:03:59.089 --> 01:03:59.099 align:start position:0%
type of work Nashville Community College
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
has relationship delivering training for
 
01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.910 align:start position:0%
has relationship delivering training for
Fidelity

01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
Fidelity
 
01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:06.119 align:start position:0%
Manchester Community College as an
 
01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:09.780 align:start position:0%
example is doing some work with both CMC
 
01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:13.740 align:start position:0%
and the Elliott or Mas and other health
 
01:04:16.490 --> 01:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
care roles so again we have those kinds
 
01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:18.780 align:start position:0%
of relationships and from my vantage
 
01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
point in the State as an employer would
 
01:04:24.109 --> 01:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
be a critical partner for for us and and
 
01:04:26.809 --> 01:04:26.819 align:start position:0%
I think a sensible one in part because
 
01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
we have locations across New Hampshire
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's in Berlin or or Nashua
 
01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
whether it's in Pisa or or or in Keene
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
so the opportunity to be accessible
 
01:04:41.569 --> 01:04:41.579 align:start position:0%
where the state's Workforce is
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
okay and you said you do have programs
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
so you said Fidelity and CMC as examples
 
01:04:49.690 --> 01:04:49.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:52.250 --> 01:04:52.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you greatly
 
01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:53.700 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:55.730 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
yeah

01:04:55.730 --> 01:04:55.740 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:04:57.770 --> 01:04:57.780 align:start position:0%
I'd like to invite the Department of

the Department
 
01:05:56.270 --> 01:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
um if you'll go to the next page you
 
01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
will see this is a history of our
 
01:06:03.289 --> 01:06:03.299 align:start position:0%
Appropriations goes back to 2018. the we
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
have our 24 25 this is our proposed
 
01:06:08.089 --> 01:06:08.099 align:start position:0%
budget this is what we have submitted in
 
01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
our agency phase
 
01:06:12.890 --> 01:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
the top portion is our funding sources
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
we have General funds of about 25
 
01:06:18.829 --> 01:06:18.839 align:start position:0%
million federal funds vote about 266
 
01:06:23.329 --> 01:06:23.339 align:start position:0%
million 1.1 million billion in education
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
trust fund and five to six million
 
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
dollars in other funds
 
01:06:31.130 --> 01:06:31.140 align:start position:0%
um of note the 266 million dollars of
 
01:06:32.930 --> 01:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
federal funds does not include our
 
01:06:36.289 --> 01:06:36.299 align:start position:0%
coveted money right now we have we will
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
be going to fiscal with about 350
 
01:06:42.589 --> 01:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
million dollars for our Esser funds and
 
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
that will be in July of 24.
 
01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
moving down we have our general fund
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
state aid you will see there are many
 
01:06:51.599 --> 01:06:53.089 align:start position:0%
state aid you will see there are many
blank

01:06:53.089 --> 01:06:53.099 align:start position:0%
blank
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
um cells that's not because those
 
01:06:57.770 --> 01:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
programs have been unfunded they have
 
01:06:59.690 --> 01:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
simply been moved down to the education
 
01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
trust fund and we'll discuss that a
 
01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
little bit later
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
um we do have our special ed
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
Statewide special ed at 50 000 that's
 
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
level funded as is our careertech

student orgs fifty thousand
 
01:07:16.250 --> 01:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
our next category is
 
01:07:18.829 --> 01:07:18.839 align:start position:0%
um are other programs that these are
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
general fund pass-through Aid we have
 
01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:22.980 align:start position:0%

to our school nutrition federal funds
 
01:07:43.609 --> 01:07:43.619 align:start position:0%
2.1 million is for state required
 
01:07:43.619 --> 01:07:45.470 align:start position:0%
2.1 million is for state required
assessments

01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
assessments
 
01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
the next four are all federal programs
 
01:07:51.289 --> 01:07:51.299 align:start position:0%
these are a matching dollars for to
 
01:07:53.329 --> 01:07:53.339 align:start position:0%
those Federal programs we have a hundred
 
01:07:56.410 --> 01:07:56.420 align:start position:0%
thousand for our CTE folk Ed
 
01:07:59.329 --> 01:07:59.339 align:start position:0%
4.4 million for our adult education
 
01:07:59.339 --> 01:08:01.270 align:start position:0%
4.4 million for our adult education
program

01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:08:03.730 --> 01:08:03.740 align:start position:0%
3.4 million for our VR program
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
vocational rehabilitation
 
01:08:09.829 --> 01:08:09.839 align:start position:0%
about 49 000 this is for our independent
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
blind services
 
01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
and then we have 700 000 for our
 
01:08:16.729 --> 01:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
robotics program
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
the next category is our operating
 
01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
budget these are our general funds
 
01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
you'll see an increase in our salary and
 
01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
benefit lines The Many Factors involved
 
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
there are when we reclass positions we
 
01:08:30.769 --> 01:08:30.779 align:start position:0%
have an increase
 
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
we have when we hire staff that are
 
01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:35.460 align:start position:0%
external to the state we may have to
 
01:08:37.309 --> 01:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
bring them in at a higher step than what
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
we've budgeted as well as the yearly
 
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
increments for our existing staff
 
01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
additionally we've moved three positions
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
into our general funds those are two
 
01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
auditor positions as well as a contracts
 
01:08:52.610 --> 01:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
position those three positions will
 
01:08:54.769 --> 01:08:54.779 align:start position:0%
become part of our indirect cost plan so
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
that we can recoup the federal funds
 
01:08:59.209 --> 01:08:59.219 align:start position:0%
associated with those activities and
 
01:09:02.269 --> 01:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
whatever we recoup will be part of our
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
department lapse at year end
 
01:09:08.689 --> 01:09:08.699 align:start position:0%
um finally we did requests for new
 
01:09:11.450 --> 01:09:11.460 align:start position:0%
positions for the 7D process we were
 
01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
able to include these in our efficiency
 
01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
requests the dollar amount given to us
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
by the governor's office so they will
 
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
not be prioritized needs for those four
 
01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:21.769 align:start position:0%
not be prioritized needs for those four
positions

01:09:21.769 --> 01:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:09:24.289 --> 01:09:24.299 align:start position:0%
our next category is the education trust
 
01:09:26.809 --> 01:09:26.819 align:start position:0%
fund Caitlyn will talk about that as
 
01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
for the education trust fund these are
 
01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
primarily grants that flow to school
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
districts for various different
 
01:09:38.329 --> 01:09:38.339 align:start position:0%
grants that are in law the first one
 
01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
that you see here is building Aid the
 
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
building Aid that I'm out is in our
 
01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
operating budget is the building Aid
 
01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
tail paying for projects that were
 
01:09:48.530 --> 01:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
approved prior to 2008 the Department of
 
01:09:50.809 --> 01:09:50.819 align:start position:0%
Education additionally has a prioritized
 
01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:53.460 align:start position:0%
need of up to 50 million dollars per
 
01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
year which is the cap that is in law for
 
01:09:58.189 --> 01:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
building Aid projects the Department of
 
01:09:59.689 --> 01:09:59.699 align:start position:0%
Education and State Board of Education
 
01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
just provided the ranked list of school
 
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
district projects for the 24 and 25
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
budget last State Board of Education
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
meeting few weeks ago and it was there
 
01:10:12.530 --> 01:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
are 227 million dollars worth of
 
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
requests that the state could
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
potentially fund for building Aid
 
01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
next you have school district adequacy
 
01:10:22.130 --> 01:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
the adequacy that you see presented here
 
01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
is 956 million dollars that is the
 
01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
amount that is in our biennium budget
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
request that we had prepared prior to
 
01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
our November 15th estimate however our
 
01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
November 15th estimate has come in a
 
01:10:35.810 --> 01:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
little bit higher than that at 962
 
01:10:37.570 --> 01:10:37.580 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:39.900 align:start position:0%
tuition and transportation is funding
 
01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
that is provided to school districts for
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
the tuition and transportation relative
 
01:10:46.729 --> 01:10:46.739 align:start position:0%
related to State Career and Tech
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
um charter school adequacy is State
 
01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
funding that is provided to charter
 
01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
schools in the same manner that District
 
01:10:57.290 --> 01:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
education Aid is funded plus an
 
01:11:00.649 --> 01:11:00.659 align:start position:0%
additional Charter School differential
 
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
the next down on your line is special
 
01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
education Aid previously known as
 
01:11:08.930 --> 01:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid that money goes to high
 
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
cost special education students or two
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
districts that have high cost special
 
01:11:15.709 --> 01:11:15.719 align:start position:0%
education students in a formula that's
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
prescribed in law that amount has
 
01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
typically been capped in the past or
 
01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
prorated in the past last biennium
 
01:11:24.890 --> 01:11:24.900 align:start position:0%
budget this is the first time it wasn't
 
01:11:27.290 --> 01:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
prorated however we are anticipating a
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
proration again this year relative to
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
increasing costs
 
01:11:34.669 --> 01:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
um the next thing down on your side is
 
01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
building a lease that building a lease
 
01:11:38.689 --> 01:11:38.699 align:start position:0%
is lease Aid that is available for
 
01:11:40.370 --> 01:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
charter schools so provide lease
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
payments that amount has previously been
 
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
in the general fund and we suggested
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
moving it to the education trust fund
 
01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
just as a other building Aid costs are
 
01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
associated with the education trust fund
 
01:11:52.189 --> 01:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
and we thought that it made more sense
 
01:11:53.689 --> 01:11:53.699 align:start position:0%
to move it there
 
01:11:56.930 --> 01:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
and additionally we have presented a
 
01:12:00.770 --> 01:12:00.780 align:start position:0%
slight increase because of the number uh
 
01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
the amount of the proration that we are
 
01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
currently providing
 
01:12:06.410 --> 01:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts we are
 
01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
estimating to be about 30 million
 
01:12:10.010 --> 01:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
dollars next year there are 15 million
 
01:12:12.649 --> 01:12:12.659 align:start position:0%
dollars this year
 
01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
um and that includes an amount that is
 
01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
for an expansion which we'll discuss on
 
01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
the next page
 
01:12:21.229 --> 01:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts phase out
 
01:12:22.970 --> 01:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
grants is a separate line item but it's
 
01:12:24.649 --> 01:12:24.659 align:start position:0%
associated with the education Freedom
 
01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:26.340 align:start position:0%
accounts it's funding that goes to
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
school districts when a child leaves a
 
01:12:32.830 --> 01:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
school district and then takes an EFA
 
01:12:34.729 --> 01:12:34.739 align:start position:0%
that money then goes to the school
 
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
district to replace a portion of the
 
01:12:38.410 --> 01:12:38.420 align:start position:0%
child's adequacy for a number of years
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
and then the last two more lines Public
 
01:12:44.689 --> 01:12:44.699 align:start position:0%
School infrastructure fund so we've
 
01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
received a million dollars last year we
 
01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
have requested five million dollars in
 
01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
our prioritized needs for the public
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure fund these funds
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
go to school districts to pay largely
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
for safety type of projects we just
 
01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
awarded about 15 million dollars in
 
01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:03.780 align:start position:0%
across the state and safety projects and
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
we have ongoing needs of another 20-ish
 
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
million dollars just of our regular open
 
01:13:11.570 --> 01:13:11.580 align:start position:0%
applications we have told the
 
01:13:13.610 --> 01:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
legislature at fiscal as well as the
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
executive Council that the department is
 
01:13:17.570 --> 01:13:17.580 align:start position:0%
committed to continuing to seek funds to
 
01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
fund those projects so this is how we
 
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
are doing that in addition to seeking
 
01:13:23.689 --> 01:13:23.699 align:start position:0%
additional federal funds for these
 
01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
projects and lastly you have the ETF
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
Administration student information
 
01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
account that account has there are new
 
01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
student information system that this
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
it's a Statewide student information
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
system that the seat has purchased to
 
01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
replace its uh Antiquated system that
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
we've had from 2001 you'll see that we
 
01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
received three million dollars in a
 
01:13:46.270 --> 01:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
01:13:48.649 --> 01:13:48.659 align:start position:0%
22-23 it wasn't obligated in a specific
 
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
year so we those are the ongoing costs
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
we were able to receive or apply and
 
01:13:56.450 --> 01:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
receive a Federal grant they covered the
 
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
first year of our ongoing operating
 
01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
costs for implementation cost of that
 
01:14:02.209 --> 01:14:02.219 align:start position:0%
system so those are the ongoing
 
01:14:03.649 --> 01:14:03.659 align:start position:0%
operating costs that you see in our
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
budget going forward
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
the next slide that you have here is the
 
01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
Department's proposal for the expansion
 
01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
of the education Freedom accounts
 
01:14:13.970 --> 01:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
program the education Freedom accounts
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
program was passed in hb2 for the fiscal
 
01:14:18.770 --> 01:14:18.780 align:start position:0%
year 22 23 biennium budget in the first
 
01:14:20.930 --> 01:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
year of operation there were 1600 kids
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
that took advantage of efas in fiscal
 
01:14:25.729 --> 01:14:25.739 align:start position:0%
year 23 we have about 3 000 kids that
 
01:14:29.890 --> 01:14:29.900 align:start position:0%
are taking advantage and right now the
 
01:14:32.209 --> 01:14:32.219 align:start position:0%
students in order to be eligible they
 
01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
must be 300 percent or less of the
 
01:14:36.649 --> 01:14:36.659 align:start position:0%
federal poverty limit this expansion
 
01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
proposed by the department will include
 
01:14:41.390 --> 01:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
additional categories that are are
 
01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
detailed out in front of you on this
 
01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:45.410 align:start position:0%
detailed out in front of you on this
slide

01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:46.490 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:14:46.490 --> 01:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:14:50.450 --> 01:14:50.460 align:start position:0%
page four is our prioritized needs so
 
01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
the first two categories are numbers
 
01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
that we received the rent from admin
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
Services they give us a number and we
 
01:14:58.610 --> 01:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
plug it into our budget as to what they
 
01:15:00.649 --> 01:15:00.659 align:start position:0%
say their prioritized needs are for the
 
01:15:03.050 --> 01:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
the renting of those buildings and the
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
same applies to Department of
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
Information Technology they give us
 
01:15:08.450 --> 01:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
numbers that we plug into our budget
 
01:15:10.910 --> 01:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
the next one is court order placements
 
01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
we're requesting to an additional 2.5
 
01:15:14.890 --> 01:15:14.900 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
the trend currently is that there's an
 
01:15:21.189 --> 01:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
increase of about 500 000 year over year
 
01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:25.140 align:start position:0%
last year we paid out 4.2 million
 
01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:26.110 align:start position:0%
last year we paid out 4.2 million
dollars

01:15:26.110 --> 01:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:15:30.530 --> 01:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
the RSA 186-c requires that we pay the
 
01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
actual cost no matter what our
 
01:15:35.630 --> 01:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
appropriation is and so we are
 
01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
requesting we expect that this year will
 
01:15:40.010 --> 01:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
be about 4.5 million dollars based on
 
01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
the trend
 
01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
the next category Caitlyn touched on
 
01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
building Aid this 22 and 26 million
 
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
dollars is the difference between the
 
01:15:52.850 --> 01:15:52.860 align:start position:0%
tail and the bond for those years in the
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
50 million dollar cap
 
01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
so we're requesting
 
01:15:58.850 --> 01:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
um that as part of the education trust
 
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
fund additional request
 
01:16:03.890 --> 01:16:03.900 align:start position:0%
school security Caitlyn also touched on
 
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
the five million dollar
 
01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
education trust fund request for the
 
01:16:10.010 --> 01:16:10.020 align:start position:0%
security portion of the edu Public
 
01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
School infrastructure grants so those
 
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
are our prioritized needs
 
01:16:18.649 --> 01:16:18.659 align:start position:0%
Slide Five talks about our positions we
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
currently have 291 positions at the
 
01:16:22.970 --> 01:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
department we've submitted a requests
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
for 13 new positions of those 13
 
01:16:27.709 --> 01:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
positions four of them are generally
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
funded one's to support the division of
 
01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:33.900 align:start position:0%
edge educator analytics and resources
 
01:16:37.310 --> 01:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
one for our adult education program and
 
01:16:38.570 --> 01:16:38.580 align:start position:0%
two for the new office of Early
 
01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
Childhood Program
 
01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
the next
 
01:16:43.490 --> 01:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
um eight we are requesting eight
 
01:16:45.530 --> 01:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
federally funded positions five of them
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
are for our special education one for a
 
01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
vocational rehabilitation to work in the
 
01:16:53.930 --> 01:16:53.940 align:start position:0%
Nashua office and two for the Bureau of
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
assessment and accountability
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
and then finally we are requesting one
 
01:17:00.770 --> 01:17:00.780 align:start position:0%
position to be funded with the education
 
01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
trust fund and that's for an
 
01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
administrator of that one billion dollar
 
01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:08.090 align:start position:0%
administrator of that one billion dollar
program

01:17:08.090 --> 01:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
the next slide slide six these are
 
01:17:12.169 --> 01:17:12.179 align:start position:0%
additional general fund requests that
 
01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:13.739 align:start position:0%
came about after we've submitted our
 
01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
agency budget
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
for fy25 we're requesting an additional
 
01:17:19.199 --> 01:17:20.870 align:start position:0%
for fy25 we're requesting an additional
255

01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
255
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
000 in general funds this is to close
 
01:17:26.689 --> 01:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
out our Essa grants like I said that's
 
01:17:30.169 --> 01:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
350 million dollars we've discussed with
 
01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
the feds um the possibility of using
 
01:17:34.189 --> 01:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
federal funds to do those activities
 
01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:37.980 align:start position:0%
which has been denied so once that Grant
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
closes in September of 24 we need to do
 
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
about 18 months worth of closeout
 
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
activities monitoring and Reporting on
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
those rpasser funds
 
01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
the next is an increase to our I
 
01:17:53.209 --> 01:17:53.219 align:start position:0%
previously discussed that we have a
 
01:17:54.530 --> 01:17:54.540 align:start position:0%
hundred and forty seven thousand dollars
 
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
for New England Board of higher ed
 
01:17:58.370 --> 01:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
that's in our efficiency we have since
 
01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
received a request from that
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
um entity of four thousand four hundred
 
01:18:05.689 --> 01:18:05.699 align:start position:0%
dollars so we need additional four
 
01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
thousand four hundred dollars to pay
 
01:18:09.229 --> 01:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
that membership fee now that membership
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
fee allows students in New Hampshire who
 
01:18:13.850 --> 01:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
want to take a degree program that's not
 
01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
offered in New Hampshire to attend any
 
01:18:18.530 --> 01:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
of the other five New England states at
 
01:18:20.890 --> 01:18:20.900 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition cost
 
01:18:24.050 --> 01:18:24.060 align:start position:0%
and finally um under we're requesting a
 
01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
new position this would be the
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
administrator of facilities at 425 Hall
 
01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
Street so we've submitted a capital
 
01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:33.300 align:start position:0%
budget request to purchase that building
 
01:18:35.810 --> 01:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
the Granite State Building
 
01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
um originally I was under the impression
 
01:18:39.050 --> 01:18:39.060 align:start position:0%
that if we did that that the building
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
would actually be owned by Das and that
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
we would continue to pay rent to them
 
01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
but apparently since we submitted the
 
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
request we may actually own the building
 
01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
and if we do own the building then we
 
01:18:51.169 --> 01:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
need an administrator of that building
 
01:18:54.410 --> 01:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
to do all the contracts for plumbing and
 
01:18:56.450 --> 01:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
heating and HVAC Charlie if you want to
 
01:18:57.860 --> 01:18:57.870 align:start position:0%
own the building you are welcome
 
01:18:57.870 --> 01:19:00.050 align:start position:0%
own the building you are welcome
[Laughter]

01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
um so we did an analysis of the rent for
 
01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
land again Hall and Walker building the
 
01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
staff that we have at Walker that we
 
01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
could potentially move over to 25 Hall
 
01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
that's 467 thousand dollars
 
01:19:15.649 --> 01:19:15.659 align:start position:0%
um based on Granite State costs they've
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
given us an estimate of 355 that 355 000
 
01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:21.900 align:start position:0%
does include the ninety thousand dollars
 
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:30.060 align:start position:0%
moving to page seven if we actually do
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
own 25 Hall Street we would need
 
01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
language added to House Bill one
 
01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:39.060 align:start position:0%
um RSA 9 colon 16 does not allow us to
 
01:19:41.090 --> 01:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
transfer any of the funds that we have
 
01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
in our class 28 which is transfers to
 
01:19:46.189 --> 01:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
General Services basically our rent line
 
01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
so if we do end up purchasing the
 
01:19:50.450 --> 01:19:50.460 align:start position:0%
building we need to have the authority
 
01:19:52.729 --> 01:19:52.739 align:start position:0%
to do those transfers into either a
 
01:19:55.610 --> 01:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
class 48 or a 103 so that we can enter
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
into contracts to be able to manage that
 
01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:01.149 align:start position:0%
into contracts to be able to manage that
building

01:20:01.149 --> 01:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:05.090 --> 01:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
uh slide eight this is a new Federal
 
01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
grant that was just received this month
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
it was accepted by fiso approved by
 
01:20:11.630 --> 01:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal and governor and Council it's
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
called the stronger connections Grant
 
01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
and it's about 4.8 million dollars that
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
Grant goes through September 30th of 25
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
and so we're requesting to be able to
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
submit a budget to include that Grant in
 
01:20:29.209 --> 01:20:29.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:31.970 --> 01:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
and our last request is for additional
 
01:20:34.010 --> 01:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
capital budget funds
 
01:20:36.169 --> 01:20:36.179 align:start position:0%
um since those budgets were submitted
 
01:20:39.169 --> 01:20:39.179 align:start position:0%
last April both of the CTE centers have
 
01:20:40.729 --> 01:20:40.739 align:start position:0%
seen an increase in the construction
 
01:20:40.739 --> 01:20:42.470 align:start position:0%
seen an increase in the construction
cost

01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:20:44.330 --> 01:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
um 1.5 million dollars is being
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
requested for the Newport CTE Center
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
that Center has been approved by the
 
01:20:52.189 --> 01:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
budget uh by the voters and then when a
 
01:20:55.130 --> 01:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
Squam is requesting another 970 thousand
 
01:20:58.790 --> 01:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
dollars for their Center and they expect
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
that they will have approval of that
 
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
Center at this Springs vote last the
 
01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
last vote that they did they missed it
 
01:21:07.610 --> 01:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
by six votes so they're expecting
 
01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
peace thank you
 
01:21:18.649 --> 01:21:18.659 align:start position:0%
I have a few questions I will I'll keep
 
01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:20.219 align:start position:0%
the 25 hall question for the
 
01:21:20.219 --> 01:21:22.010 align:start position:0%
the 25 hall question for the
commissioner

01:21:22.010 --> 01:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
um going back to the first page the the
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet uh looking at it it looks as
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
if local education spending uh has gone
 
01:21:34.910 --> 01:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
from 3.1 billion up to 3.4 billion
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
roughly a 10 increase
 
01:21:39.649 --> 01:21:39.659 align:start position:0%
uh per capita spending has gone from
 
01:21:42.649 --> 01:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
fifteen thousand eight hundred to over
 
01:21:45.649 --> 01:21:45.659 align:start position:0%
19 022.
 
01:21:49.370 --> 01:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
uh my questions are is is spending per
 
01:21:51.850 --> 01:21:51.860 align:start position:0%
capita to you a meaningful statistic
 
01:21:55.070 --> 01:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
what does that tell you and how does
 
01:21:57.229 --> 01:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
that do you know how that ranks either
 
01:21:58.910 --> 01:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
regionally or nationally
 
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
as far as what New Hampshire is spending
 
01:22:03.890 --> 01:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:05.630 --> 01:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
a couple of different things so when
 
01:22:07.010 --> 01:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the spending per capita
 
01:22:09.770 --> 01:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
for student the state local communities
 
01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
and the federal government have all
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
invested in education in the last
 
01:22:14.689 --> 01:22:14.699 align:start position:0%
several years so that's part of the
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
reason why we've seen continued
 
01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
increases your office has increased
 
01:22:21.890 --> 01:22:21.900 align:start position:0%
adequate education funding included home
 
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
hold harmlesses relative to decreasing
 
01:22:27.229 --> 01:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
adequacy funds and populations for free
 
01:22:29.209 --> 01:22:29.219 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch in the pandemic as
 
01:22:31.090 --> 01:22:31.100 align:start position:0%
well as adding additional grants
 
01:22:34.010 --> 01:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
specifically the relief Aid Grant and
 
01:22:37.130 --> 01:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary needs Grant so that is
 
01:22:39.649 --> 01:22:39.659 align:start position:0%
part of the increase additionally in
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
that local spending you're also seeing
 
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
increase in federal funding so in a
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
normal year pre-pandemic we received
 
01:22:48.649 --> 01:22:48.659 align:start position:0%
around 200 million dollars of federal
 
01:22:50.209 --> 01:22:50.219 align:start position:0%
funding at the Department of Education
 
01:22:54.709 --> 01:22:54.719 align:start position:0%
we are up to at one point over 700
 
01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
million dollars of extra money so that
 
01:22:58.669 --> 01:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
is part of what you're seeing we
 
01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
typically if you look at the cost per
 
01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
pupil we are New England itself self
 
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
does typically be as high nationally
 
01:23:11.630 --> 01:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
however we are usually in the top 10 if
 
01:23:13.790 --> 01:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
not the top five as far as spending per
 
01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:14.990 align:start position:0%
not the top five as far as spending per
pupil

01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
pupil
 
01:23:17.630 --> 01:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
okay is do you manage that number is
 
01:23:19.070 --> 01:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
there is there a number per capita do
 
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
you think that's the perfect number or
 
01:23:23.169 --> 01:23:23.179 align:start position:0%
it is just what it happens to be
 
01:23:26.570 --> 01:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
we don't manage it no okay
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh look at the education Freedom
 
01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:30.709 align:start position:0%
uh look at the education Freedom
accounts

01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:30.719 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
um it looks like it's basically going to
 
01:23:37.850 --> 01:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:39.950 --> 01:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
how confident are you that that's going
 
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
to happen all at once I mean
 
01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
with the with the numbers that that you
 
01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
have being equal from 24 and 25
 
01:23:52.010 --> 01:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
uh is it all going to happen in you know
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
the first year where it jumps up
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
dramatically like that um so two
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
um two kind of no two things to keep in
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
um keep in mind here so we expand we
 
01:24:05.330 --> 01:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
doubled from the first year to the
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
second year which is what we would
 
01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:07.750 align:start position:0%
second year which is what we would
expect

01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
expect
 
01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
any time you know you have a new program
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
so there's obviously a quite a bit of
 
01:24:14.330 --> 01:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
ramp up so we would continue an
 
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
increased ramp up relative to the new
 
01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%
program however that that 30 million
 
01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
dollars does include the expansion that
 
01:24:23.689 --> 01:24:23.699 align:start position:0%
we've proposed to the number additional
 
01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
number of students the department of
 
01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:27.540 align:start position:0%
education does have some data with some
 
01:24:28.610 --> 01:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
of these numbers of the students but
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
some of these categories we don't have
 
01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
data so we uh kind of just looked at our
 
01:24:35.450 --> 01:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
projections and what we have now and
 
01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
that was our best guess that we could
 
01:24:39.770 --> 01:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
come up with with these numbers okay uh
 
01:24:43.130 --> 01:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
if the nation does go into a recession
 
01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:44.510 align:start position:0%
if the nation does go into a recession
which

01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
um where we are I mean the governor's
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:52.669 --> 01:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
that will obviously mean that far more
 
01:24:54.890 --> 01:24:54.900 align:start position:0%
many far more people are now eligible
 
01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
for the program under the original
 
01:25:00.110 --> 01:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
guidance which is what the 300 level is
 
01:25:02.810 --> 01:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
that taking into account here we did not
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
take that into account no okay if it did
 
01:25:06.890 --> 01:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
that would obviously be higher that
 
01:25:08.689 --> 01:25:08.699 align:start position:0%
would include additional children that
 
01:25:12.370 --> 01:25:12.380 align:start position:0%
it could be eligible yes okay thank you
 
01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
thanks I have a handful of questions
 
01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:16.790 align:start position:0%
thanks I have a handful of questions
um

01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
the efas are they statutorily capped
 
01:25:23.330 --> 01:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
the number that we're allowed to give
 
01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
out yeah no no okay I didn't think so I
 
01:25:28.430 --> 01:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
just wanted to check on that
 
01:25:30.350 --> 01:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
um it's just an income cap per student
 
01:25:32.209 --> 01:25:32.219 align:start position:0%
or per family rather
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
so the budgeted number would be
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
fundamentally an estimate correct yeah
 
01:25:36.719 --> 01:25:38.209 align:start position:0%
fundamentally an estimate correct yeah
um

01:25:38.209 --> 01:25:38.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:40.250 --> 01:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
and does it carry forward year to year
 
01:25:42.890 --> 01:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
it doesn't carry forward but it's uh we
 
01:25:44.689 --> 01:25:44.699 align:start position:0%
have a warrant Authority
 
01:25:47.090 --> 01:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
so no matter what the appropriation is
 
01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
we have a want to draw on that okay oh
 
01:25:53.570 --> 01:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
that makes sense um secondly for special
 
01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
education Aid I think you said that um
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
the 33 9 is a cap
 
01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
um it's yes it counts and and prorated
 
01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's prorated prorated if it weren't
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
prorated and it were just uh given out
 
01:26:09.290 --> 01:26:09.300 align:start position:0%
according to the formula do you have an
 
01:26:11.570 --> 01:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
estimate for how much that would be
 
01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:15.350 align:start position:0%
estimate for how much that would be
um

01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
um I believe it's right around 34 35
 
01:26:19.970 --> 01:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
million so it's not capped by very much
 
01:26:21.470 --> 01:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:26:23.570 --> 01:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
um one thing to keep in a um keep in
 
01:26:24.890 --> 01:26:24.900 align:start position:0%
mind that we don't know what is going to
 
01:26:27.169 --> 01:26:27.179 align:start position:0%
affect yet is that the law change to
 
01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
include students up through the age of
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
22 but so that will include some
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
additional kids that not may have not
 
01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
been eligible in the past but we're not
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
sure what that is
 
01:26:36.719 --> 01:26:37.610 align:start position:0%
sure what that is
um

01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
an additional factor is is that any
 
01:26:42.649 --> 01:26:42.659 align:start position:0%
appropriation that's left over in this
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
line at the end of the year so if we did
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
have excess appropriation it goes to
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
fund our court ordered placements
 
01:26:54.050 --> 01:26:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:56.990 --> 01:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
I've forgotten that entirely
 
01:26:59.330 --> 01:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
um but generally speaking even with the
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
even with the 22 and the in the mix
 
01:27:03.649 --> 01:27:03.659 align:start position:0%
you'd be looking at
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
if we didn't put a proration on it it
 
01:27:09.530 --> 01:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
would be more like uh 36.37
 
01:27:12.050 --> 01:27:12.060 align:start position:0%
it would likely not be a substantial
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:16.970 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:27:16.970 --> 01:27:16.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
again another thing um who told you that
 
01:27:21.410 --> 01:27:21.420 align:start position:0%
if we if the state buys the building
 
01:27:23.450 --> 01:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
that you need to set up a property
 
01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:26.510 align:start position:0%
that you need to set up a property
Bureau

01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:28.669 --> 01:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
that's I don't understand what who told
 
01:27:29.689 --> 01:27:29.699 align:start position:0%
you you have to manage your own
 
01:27:29.699 --> 01:27:32.510 align:start position:0%

01:27:35.689 --> 01:27:35.699 align:start position:0%
um one of your staff said that he told
 
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
me that we put in the capital budget so
 
01:27:40.970 --> 01:27:40.980 align:start position:0%
he did not expect that it would be a Das
 
01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:43.430 align:start position:0%
he did not expect that it would be a Das
building

01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:49.970 --> 01:27:49.980 align:start position:0%
I would be happy for you to manage that
 
01:27:49.980 --> 01:27:51.649 align:start position:0%
I would be happy for you to manage that
building

01:27:51.649 --> 01:27:51.659 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:27:53.330 --> 01:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
there are statutes that would have to be
 
01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
changed amended and will be written
 
01:27:59.149 --> 01:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
and it would be weird for
 
01:28:01.490 --> 01:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
every agency to manage its own buildings
 
01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:08.270 align:start position:0%
every agency to manage its own buildings
nope

01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:11.149 --> 01:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
I just had a court order placement
 
01:28:12.110 --> 01:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
because I was just thinking about that
 
01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
when Charlie mentioned it um is that
 
01:28:16.490 --> 01:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
currently um funded from funds on others
 
01:28:18.050 --> 01:28:18.060 align:start position:0%
appropriated if it exceeds that amount
 
01:28:19.129 --> 01:28:19.139 align:start position:0%
that's where that comes from it's
 
01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
generally funded it's generally yes we
 
01:28:23.330 --> 01:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
request a warrant for additional sites
 
01:28:26.689 --> 01:28:26.699 align:start position:0%
okay and the education Freedom accounts
 
01:28:28.370 --> 01:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
because that's also a similar thing only
 
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
education funded is that done usually
 
01:28:32.810 --> 01:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
just once a year or do you make payments
 
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
throughout the year on that
 
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
we have three four payments throughout
 
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
the year September 1st November 1st
 
01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
January 1st and April 1st I was thinking
 
01:28:42.169 --> 01:28:42.179 align:start position:0%
something was more front loaded so
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
September November it follows the same
 
01:28:46.729 --> 01:28:46.739 align:start position:0%
schedule as Traditional School District
 
01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:48.780 align:start position:0%
adequacy okay
 
01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:49.410 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:28:49.410 --> 01:28:52.850 align:start position:0%
thank you

we have invited the executive Council up

01:29:59.930 --> 01:29:59.940 align:start position:0%
three more minutes we just want to

hey could you put your microphone in the
 
01:30:21.649 --> 01:30:21.659 align:start position:0%
red button that's probably better watch
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
all the times I've given people a hard
 
01:30:26.810 --> 01:30:26.820 align:start position:0%
time on not turning their mic on
 
01:30:29.629 --> 01:30:29.639 align:start position:0%
glorious okay so again for the record my
 
01:30:31.250 --> 01:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
name is Megan Rose I'm the executive
 
01:30:34.189 --> 01:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
assistant to the executive Council our
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
office is made up of myself a part-time
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
position and the five executive
 
01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.810 align:start position:0%
position and the five executive
counselors

01:30:41.810 --> 01:30:41.820 align:start position:0%
counselors
 
01:30:44.810 --> 01:30:44.820 align:start position:0%
um what you see before you in my budget
 
01:30:47.390 --> 01:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
request or at least what I'm hoping that
 
01:30:49.129 --> 01:30:49.139 align:start position:0%
you noticed is that I met the targets I
 
01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
was asked to meet
 
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
and then um did the best that I could
 
01:30:55.310 --> 01:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
for the efficiency budget and then the
 
01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs addressed
 
01:31:00.590 --> 01:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
two of the important things that we need
 
01:31:03.709 --> 01:31:03.719 align:start position:0%
for our office and to help us kind of
 
01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
keep things running smoothly the first
 
01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:08.330 align:start position:0%
keep things running smoothly the first
is

01:31:08.330 --> 01:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
increasing what exists in our budget so
 
01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
we can have an adequate
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
amount to pay a part-time staff member I
 
01:31:18.530 --> 01:31:18.540 align:start position:0%
currently have a part-time staff member
 
01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
who is asking to be done sadly for me
 
01:31:25.970 --> 01:31:25.980 align:start position:0%
and as I'm sure everybody knows it's not
 
01:31:28.010 --> 01:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
exactly easy to
 
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
recruit people especially for a position
 
01:31:33.050 --> 01:31:33.060 align:start position:0%
that does not offer any benefits of any
 
01:31:36.169 --> 01:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
sort there's no time off there's no
 
01:31:36.179 --> 01:31:36.950 align:start position:0%
sort there's no time off there's no
um

01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:38.990 --> 01:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
health benefits for vacation benefits
 
01:31:41.090 --> 01:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
and so it really is going to be a unique
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
challenge to fill the position and I
 
01:31:44.810 --> 01:31:44.820 align:start position:0%
would like to be able to make sure that
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
I can offer somebody a wage that will
 
01:31:53.090 --> 01:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
help entice them to come fill in and be
 
01:31:55.970 --> 01:31:55.980 align:start position:0%
there as an assistant to help me assist
 
01:31:58.669 --> 01:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
the counselors and then to make sure
 
01:32:02.209 --> 01:32:02.219 align:start position:0%
that we maintain office coverage when
 
01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
um if I'm not available or if I'm on
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
vacation or if I'm Ill
 
01:32:09.229 --> 01:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we're addressing in
 
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
the budget is
 
01:32:13.610 --> 01:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
the stipend increase for the council so
 
01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
the counselor the council unlike
 
01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:17.750 align:start position:0%
the counselor the council unlike
um

01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
the legislature they get a step a
 
01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
stipend and that basically covers their
 
01:32:26.990 --> 01:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
travel so back in the days of
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
the early days of Ray Burton
 
01:32:31.729 --> 01:32:31.739 align:start position:0%
um the base basically how it was handled
 
01:32:34.370 --> 01:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
is the counselors had some kind of a
 
01:32:36.110 --> 01:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
phone at some point that was issued by
 
01:32:37.129 --> 01:32:37.139 align:start position:0%
the state and they had travel
 
01:32:39.229 --> 01:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and
 
01:32:41.870 --> 01:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
um that eventually changed over to just
 
01:32:43.729 --> 01:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
a stipend that they would a fixed
 
01:32:45.470 --> 01:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
stipend that they would get every month
 
01:32:48.110 --> 01:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
that would cover like mail or postage
 
01:32:49.729 --> 01:32:49.739 align:start position:0%
from their home it would cover all of
 
01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
their travel it would cover like
 
01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
the use of their own home phones or cell
 
01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:56.450 align:start position:0%
the use of their own home phones or cell
phones

01:32:56.450 --> 01:32:56.460 align:start position:0%
phones
 
01:32:59.090 --> 01:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
um that has not increased in the last 14
 
01:32:59.100 --> 01:33:00.169 align:start position:0%
um that has not increased in the last 14
years

01:33:00.169 --> 01:33:00.179 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
and we the increase that we have asked
 
01:33:07.070 --> 01:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
for to kind of catch them up a little
 
01:33:10.610 --> 01:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
bit is basically the equivalent of the
 
01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:11.810 align:start position:0%
bit is basically the equivalent of the
last

01:33:11.810 --> 01:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:33:14.810 --> 01:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
over the last 14-ish years or 12-ish
 
01:33:17.810 --> 01:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
years uh like a two percent increase
 
01:33:21.169 --> 01:33:21.179 align:start position:0%
the amount would be the amount is a
 
01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
little bit different so district one has
 
01:33:24.590 --> 01:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
always historically because it's a
 
01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
larger District received a little bit
 
01:33:28.450 --> 01:33:28.460 align:start position:0%
larger of a stipend
 
01:33:32.570 --> 01:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the other four districts
 
01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
but with the recent redistricting and
 
01:33:38.450 --> 01:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
the size of District 2 now being very
 
01:33:42.110 --> 01:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
close to District One both of those
 
01:33:44.570 --> 01:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
districts would be receiving a slightly
 
01:33:47.810 --> 01:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
larger stipend for their travel needs um
 
01:33:54.649 --> 01:33:54.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:58.610 --> 01:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
excellent uh question on that sure when
 
01:34:02.450 --> 01:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
when I when I first saw this I thought
 
01:34:03.890 --> 01:34:03.900 align:start position:0%
well that doesn't make a lot of sense
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
and then I looked at the map and I saw
 
01:34:08.090 --> 01:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
with the redrawn map we're like oh that
 
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense but other than just
 
01:34:14.209 --> 01:34:14.219 align:start position:0%
eyeballing looking at it uh do you have
 
01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
any or could you get any numbers behind
 
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
it such as if your district is over so
 
01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
many square miles you get this if it's
 
01:34:25.729 --> 01:34:25.739 align:start position:0%
under you get that so there's not just
 
01:34:27.950 --> 01:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
you know me looking at a map saying okay
 
01:34:30.169 --> 01:34:30.179 align:start position:0%
that makes sense well it's funny you say
 
01:34:33.050 --> 01:34:33.060 align:start position:0%
that so yesterday the 11th hour I
 
01:34:36.290 --> 01:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
decided I wanted to know how like the
 
01:34:38.330 --> 01:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
square mileage we're talking about
 
01:34:40.850 --> 01:34:40.860 align:start position:0%
so I I looked that up for district one
 
01:34:42.770 --> 01:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
in District Two I haven't done the
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
latter three yet but district one covers
 
01:34:48.649 --> 01:34:48.659 align:start position:0%
we'll say approximately because I mean I
 
01:34:50.689 --> 01:34:50.699 align:start position:0%
did check my math but you know and this
 
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
is specifically just land
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
um because when you look up the square
 
01:34:57.649 --> 01:34:57.659 align:start position:0%
miles it will include it will give you a
 
01:34:59.270 --> 01:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
total and then it will break that total
 
01:35:01.850 --> 01:35:01.860 align:start position:0%
down to land and water
 
01:35:05.890 --> 01:35:05.900 align:start position:0%
so Council district one covers
 
01:35:08.410 --> 01:35:08.420 align:start position:0%
3639.87 square miles
 
01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:10.129 align:start position:0%
3639.87 square miles
approximately

01:35:10.129 --> 01:35:10.139 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
01:35:15.010 --> 01:35:15.020 align:start position:0%
and Council District 2 is
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:22.669 --> 01:35:22.679 align:start position:0%
how about the others don't know yet I
 
01:35:24.530 --> 01:35:24.540 align:start position:0%
didn't get that far but they they're
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
significantly less yes significantly
 
01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
okay that was that was Mike would you
 
01:35:37.490 --> 01:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
like me to come back like provide the
 
01:35:38.930 --> 01:35:38.940 align:start position:0%
other three
 
01:35:41.450 --> 01:35:41.460 align:start position:0%
at another time I I think it would be it
 
01:35:43.010 --> 01:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
would be helpful during the legislative
 
01:35:44.330 --> 01:35:44.340 align:start position:0%
phase because you may get asked that
 
01:35:47.629 --> 01:35:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:49.729 --> 01:35:49.739 align:start position:0%
I would just say having having
 
01:35:51.709 --> 01:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
researched this myself
 
01:35:51.719 --> 01:35:53.030 align:start position:0%
researched this myself
um

01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
yeah historically
 
01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:55.910 align:start position:0%
yeah historically
um

01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
you know and I only went back about 35
 
01:36:00.649 --> 01:36:00.659 align:start position:0%
40 years but um
 
01:36:02.689 --> 01:36:02.699 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
you know going back to the late 80s uh
 
01:36:07.850 --> 01:36:07.860 align:start position:0%
love was Ray Burton's sister then too
 
01:36:09.110 --> 01:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't it
 
01:36:10.729 --> 01:36:10.739 align:start position:0%
um that District was more and everybody
 
01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
else's class and it was you know I think
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
it started out he got nine thousand they
 
01:36:16.729 --> 01:36:16.739 align:start position:0%
got six thousand and historically you
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
look at the redistrictings of the of
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
1980 1990 2000 2010
 
01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
and there was always this anomaly
 
01:36:24.610 --> 01:36:24.620 align:start position:0%
there's one giant District in the north
 
01:36:27.649 --> 01:36:27.659 align:start position:0%
and four Rel moderately compact
 
01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:30.300 align:start position:0%
districts in the South and
 
01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:30.830 align:start position:0%
districts in the South and
um

01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
and that dramatically changed in the
 
01:36:34.970 --> 01:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
last three districting and and
 
01:36:37.189 --> 01:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
um I think you could do a stipend based
 
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
on number of towns you could do a
 
01:36:41.450 --> 01:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
stipend because in theory an executive
 
01:36:43.189 --> 01:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
counselor is going to visit each of his
 
01:36:45.229 --> 01:36:45.239 align:start position:0%
or her towns frequently
 
01:36:47.450 --> 01:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
you could do it based on some sort of
 
01:36:51.050 --> 01:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
DOT road mileage thing well that that
 
01:36:53.530 --> 01:36:53.540 align:start position:0%
becomes a whole different kettle of fish
 
01:36:56.930 --> 01:36:56.940 align:start position:0%
or you could do it based on eyeballing
 
01:36:59.149 --> 01:36:59.159 align:start position:0%
and I think at the end of the day it's
 
01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
very hard not to look at the map and go
 
01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
two of these things are the same way and
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
three of them are a different way and uh
 
01:37:07.010 --> 01:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
and to do it that way and I think it
 
01:37:08.930 --> 01:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
makes sense but I think I think it would
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
not make sense or be defensible to do
 
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
just district one or just District Two
 
01:37:16.129 --> 01:37:16.139 align:start position:0%
correct yes I did you have to do
 
01:37:18.649 --> 01:37:18.659 align:start position:0%
district one and two otherwise you end
 
01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
up in a weirdness
 
01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
question the do the counselors
 
01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:31.250 align:start position:0%
question the do the counselors
themselves

01:37:31.250 --> 01:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:32.810 --> 01:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
are they aware
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
of the budget presentation yes okay
 
01:37:39.950 --> 01:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
I mean I they never come and I sort of
 
01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
get that they're
 
01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
you know co-equal whatever so that's a
 
01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:45.470 align:start position:0%
you know co-equal whatever so that's a
thing

01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:37:48.290 --> 01:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
and you unanimous support for this yes
 
01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you any question great
 
01:37:52.310 --> 01:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:37:57.470 --> 01:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:59.570 --> 01:37:59.580 align:start position:0%
I would now like to invite the board of
 
01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
tax and land appeals up for their
 
01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:20.590 align:start position:0%
tax and land appeals up for their
testimony

01:38:20.590 --> 01:38:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
good morning it's great to see you again
 
01:38:27.229 --> 01:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
I'm used to testifying before you but it
 
01:38:29.930 --> 01:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
has my old job so
 
01:38:32.090 --> 01:38:32.100 align:start position:0%
uh if you could just hit the the button
 
01:38:34.370 --> 01:38:34.380 align:start position:0%
to turn it on there we go I think I did
 
01:38:37.570 --> 01:38:37.580 align:start position:0%
turn it on didn't I you perfectly now
 
01:38:39.890 --> 01:38:39.900 align:start position:0%
pardon me ready
 
01:38:42.910 --> 01:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
red is hot I it was red

thank you for the opportunity
 
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
um for the board to provide an overview
 
01:38:50.930 --> 01:38:50.940 align:start position:0%
of the fifth skill 24 and 25 youth
 
01:38:54.169 --> 01:38:54.179 align:start position:0%
budget requests as you both know my name
 
01:38:55.850 --> 01:38:55.860 align:start position:0%

01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
I am the chair of the board and with me
 
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
is Ann stillmack the boards Clerk
 
01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:02.629 align:start position:0%
is Ann stillmack the boards Clerk
um

01:39:02.629 --> 01:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:06.830 --> 01:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
as I'm sure you both are aware also the
 
01:39:09.890 --> 01:39:09.900 align:start position:0%
boardster jurisdiction is hearing and
 
01:39:11.870 --> 01:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
deciding property tax
 
01:39:16.209 --> 01:39:16.219 align:start position:0%
appeals and we also hear and process
 
01:39:18.550 --> 01:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
eminent domain
 
01:39:21.410 --> 01:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
condemnations who hold hearings we go
 
01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:22.250 align:start position:0%
condemnations who hold hearings we go
out

01:39:22.250 --> 01:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
to the Views and the properties where
 
01:39:27.890 --> 01:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
the where the takings are located
 
01:39:30.530 --> 01:39:30.540 align:start position:0%
the matters that are appealable to the
 
01:39:34.189 --> 01:39:34.199 align:start position:0%
board are on pages 11 and 12 of the
 
01:39:34.199 --> 01:39:35.330 align:start position:0%
board are on pages 11 and 12 of the
budget

01:39:35.330 --> 01:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:39:38.090 --> 01:39:38.100 align:start position:0%
it's a long list
 
01:39:40.970 --> 01:39:40.980 align:start position:0%
um luckily we don't hear them all
 
01:39:44.090 --> 01:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
but they are available by Statute should
 
01:39:46.330 --> 01:39:46.340 align:start position:0%
they be necessary
 
01:39:50.450 --> 01:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
uh budget is a maintenance budget our
 
01:39:53.629 --> 01:39:53.639 align:start position:0%
only priority that ties needs for rent
 
01:39:55.570 --> 01:39:55.580 align:start position:0%
and doit
 
01:39:58.610 --> 01:39:58.620 align:start position:0%
and we have no control as you're aware
 
01:40:01.010 --> 01:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
over those two classes
 
01:40:03.709 --> 01:40:03.719 align:start position:0%
uh the board's been very frugal with its
 
01:40:05.570 --> 01:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
needs and we
 
01:40:08.050 --> 01:40:08.060 align:start position:0%
have only increased
 
01:40:13.250 --> 01:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
some classes to reflect the increased
 
01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
cost and inflation so we've decreased
 
01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
some areas and increased sellers but our
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
budget is the maintenance budget
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
and with that that's all we have to say
 
01:40:30.250 --> 01:40:30.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:32.810 --> 01:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
you have any questions we'd be glad to
 
01:40:35.090 --> 01:40:35.100 align:start position:0%
answer them yeah I I have a couple
 
01:40:37.310 --> 01:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
questions uh I I know in their last
 
01:40:40.610 --> 01:40:40.620 align:start position:0%
legislative session that uh you like
 
01:40:43.850 --> 01:40:43.860 align:start position:0%
like many towns and the dra itself had
 
01:40:47.149 --> 01:40:47.159 align:start position:0%
problems finding an assessor to to work
 
01:40:49.790 --> 01:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
for you and you had to go in to the
 
01:40:52.189 --> 01:40:52.199 align:start position:0%
legislature to basically contract that
 
01:40:54.530 --> 01:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
out we did could you give us an update
 
01:40:57.169 --> 01:40:57.179 align:start position:0%
on that and how that's working actually
 
01:41:01.250 --> 01:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
we haven't used contracts yet we've got
 
01:41:02.649 --> 01:41:02.659 align:start position:0%
quite a few
 
01:41:06.350 --> 01:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
towns that their mid-process that we may
 
01:41:09.890 --> 01:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
in fact have to use them the
 
01:41:12.890 --> 01:41:12.900 align:start position:0%
that contract is only until the end of
 
01:41:15.590 --> 01:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
this fiscal year though so
 
01:41:19.250 --> 01:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
coming up for the 24-25 fiscal year
 
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
we'll be back to having the position of
 
01:41:26.870 --> 01:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
tax review appraiser and hopefully we'll
 
01:41:29.330 --> 01:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
be able to find someone that's been a
 
01:41:32.570 --> 01:41:32.580 align:start position:0%
difficult position to find right
 
01:41:32.580 --> 01:41:32.990 align:start position:0%
difficult position to find right
[Music]

01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:33.770 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:41:33.770 --> 01:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:36.129 --> 01:41:36.139 align:start position:0%
they they just
 
01:41:38.709 --> 01:41:38.719 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
the the municipalities pay much more
 
01:41:45.050 --> 01:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
than the board could pay for such a
 
01:41:48.590 --> 01:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
position so we were struggling to figure
 
01:41:51.649 --> 01:41:51.659 align:start position:0%
out what we're going to do but it is in
 
01:41:53.390 --> 01:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
the budget for
 
01:41:56.270 --> 01:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's at the base rate again because
 
01:41:59.270 --> 01:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
of the change and um which is another
 
01:42:01.609 --> 01:42:01.619 align:start position:0%
reason why our budget is a maintenance
 
01:42:01.619 --> 01:42:04.010 align:start position:0%
reason why our budget is a maintenance
budget

01:42:04.010 --> 01:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:42:06.050 --> 01:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
do you have an estimate given you've had
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
the difficulty on what it would take
 
01:42:10.370 --> 01:42:10.380 align:start position:0%
to hire someone
 
01:42:12.890 --> 01:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
what it would take to hire someone right
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
an additional resources from what you
 
01:42:16.910 --> 01:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
have here
 
01:42:18.709 --> 01:42:18.719 align:start position:0%
money yeah
 
01:42:21.530 --> 01:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
let's see if the dollar figure yeah I
 
01:42:23.570 --> 01:42:23.580 align:start position:0%
think it is yeah and just said six
 
01:42:26.270 --> 01:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
figures and I think she is the right
 
01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:27.229 align:start position:0%
figures and I think she is the right
um

01:42:27.229 --> 01:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:27.239 --> 01:42:29.450 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:42:29.450 --> 01:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:31.070 align:start position:0%
I talked to
 
01:42:31.070 --> 01:42:31.490 align:start position:0%
I talked to
[Music]

01:42:31.490 --> 01:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:32.750 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:35.090 --> 01:42:35.100 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's office
 
01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:36.290 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's office
um

01:42:36.290 --> 01:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:38.689 --> 01:42:38.699 align:start position:0%
when we
 
01:42:42.290 --> 01:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm losing it to them having a
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
little bit of pain today so I'm trying
 
01:42:46.129 --> 01:42:46.139 align:start position:0%
to struggle through
 
01:42:46.139 --> 01:42:46.850 align:start position:0%
to struggle through
um

01:42:46.850 --> 01:42:46.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:48.830 --> 01:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
I talked to the commissioner's office
 
01:42:52.010 --> 01:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
when we did go into the contract phase
 
01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:55.679 align:start position:0%
and went to fiscal committee and GNC and
 
01:43:00.070 --> 01:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
he had also mentioned that we could also
 
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
seek additional funds over and above
 
01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
even with the board members of making to
 
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
try and and do that the problem is we
 
01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:12.290 align:start position:0%
try and and do that the problem is we
don't

01:43:12.290 --> 01:43:12.300 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:43:16.850 --> 01:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
that position isn't totally full time
 
01:43:21.290 --> 01:43:21.300 align:start position:0%
we we found that when we have a a person
 
01:43:24.050 --> 01:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
in that position it isn't
 
01:43:26.570 --> 01:43:26.580 align:start position:0%
it isn't something that we need
 
01:43:30.350 --> 01:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
seven and a half hours a day 37 and a
 
01:43:33.290 --> 01:43:33.300 align:start position:0%
half hours a week it it's an ebb and
 
01:43:35.570 --> 01:43:35.580 align:start position:0%
flow type of position
 
01:43:39.290 --> 01:43:39.300 align:start position:0%
so we have struggled and we and we're
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
looking for advice from anyone on how we
 
01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
would process that and
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
do you have any suggestions
 
01:43:53.810 --> 01:43:53.820 align:start position:0%
no I think that um I think that what
 
01:43:55.790 --> 01:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
we've heard we've talked to you like
 
01:43:57.950 --> 01:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
your like dra was we've talked to many
 
01:44:00.229 --> 01:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
in the field and money is the chief
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
complaint um the contractors are we've
 
01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
had a lot of interesting contracts going
 
01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:06.229 align:start position:0%
had a lot of interesting contracts going
forward

01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:44:08.450 --> 01:44:08.460 align:start position:0%
um again they are Town dependent on
 
01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
certain cases so we have two that are
 
01:44:13.250 --> 01:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
nearing completion with revalves
 
01:44:14.930 --> 01:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
um one of them
 
01:44:16.850 --> 01:44:16.860 align:start position:0%
um one of the municipalities I mean that
 
01:44:18.770 --> 01:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
that could be months and months of work
 
01:44:21.590 --> 01:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
to do a ratio study and and see how the
 
01:44:23.390 --> 01:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
balancing comes out
 
01:44:25.970 --> 01:44:25.980 align:start position:0%
um but certainly it's um as Michelle
 
01:44:28.010 --> 01:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
said you could have one municipality
 
01:44:29.689 --> 01:44:29.699 align:start position:0%
that could take months and months to
 
01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:32.639 align:start position:0%
complete that study whereas a smaller
 
01:44:34.609 --> 01:44:34.619 align:start position:0%
municipality may take quicker time so it
 
01:44:36.050 --> 01:44:36.060 align:start position:0%
does evident flow I mean I don't think
 
01:44:37.550 --> 01:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
we're advocating to make it a part-time
 
01:44:40.189 --> 01:44:40.199 align:start position:0%
position by any means the research that
 
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
I did in preparing was to show that
 
01:44:44.330 --> 01:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
Statewide our appraiser is one of the
 
01:44:46.609 --> 01:44:46.619 align:start position:0%
higher paid and even that's a struggle
 
01:44:47.689 --> 01:44:47.699 align:start position:0%
but when you're competing with a
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
municipality like Rochester who's paying
 
01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
109 000 and we're barely able to offer
 
01:44:54.850 --> 01:44:54.860 align:start position:0%
high 80s
 
01:44:58.129 --> 01:44:58.139 align:start position:0%
you know we can't recruit it it I was
 
01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
spinning my wheels ad after ad after ad
 
01:45:03.410 --> 01:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
um and frankly no one wakes up in this
 
01:45:04.970 --> 01:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
day and age and says geez I want to be
 
01:45:06.890 --> 01:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
an assessor they're not coming into the
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
field it is a I hate to say it's a dying
 
01:45:11.090 --> 01:45:11.100 align:start position:0%
heart but it is one that's phasing it's
 
01:45:13.490 --> 01:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
very hard to compete and let alone find
 
01:45:15.050 --> 01:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
people that are coming up in the ranks
 
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
to do this kind of work so it's kind of
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
hitting us as everyone is understanding
 
01:45:22.370 --> 01:45:22.380 align:start position:0%
it's twofold I wish personally that the
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
state would have a group of appraisers
 
01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
that all agencies could kind of pull
 
01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:26.149 align:start position:0%
that all agencies could kind of pull
from

01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:45:27.890 --> 01:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
we're not the only ones that have
 
01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:29.629 align:start position:0%
we're not the only ones that have
appraisers

01:45:29.629 --> 01:45:29.639 align:start position:0%
appraisers
 
01:45:31.850 --> 01:45:31.860 align:start position:0%
um the trick with our job is we need one
 
01:45:33.530 --> 01:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
that knows assessing and knows
 
01:45:35.570 --> 01:45:35.580 align:start position:0%
appraising those are two different
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
um sometimes two different skill sets
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
um so getting a strict appraiser
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily cover because if
 
01:45:43.669 --> 01:45:43.679 align:start position:0%
they don't have mass appraisal
 
01:45:46.370 --> 01:45:46.380 align:start position:0%
experience that's not that's the what
 
01:45:48.410 --> 01:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
we're looking for so ours is kind of a
 
01:45:50.270 --> 01:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
complex position and unique in that way
 
01:45:52.370 --> 01:45:52.380 align:start position:0%
as opposed to someone at dot that might
 
01:45:53.870 --> 01:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
be just doing straight appraisals all
 
01:45:56.810 --> 01:45:56.820 align:start position:0%
day we're we need the education in Mass
 
01:45:59.629 --> 01:45:59.639 align:start position:0%
appraisal so it's a little challenging I
 
01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
don't have an answer if I did we might
 
01:46:03.709 --> 01:46:03.719 align:start position:0%
do things differently but we've done
 
01:46:05.330 --> 01:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
everything we can think of Joe Bouchard
 
01:46:07.490 --> 01:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
was was wonderful with his information
 
01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
on this old statute that we were able to
 
01:46:11.330 --> 01:46:11.340 align:start position:0%
do the cuts to ship the money into the
 
01:46:13.310 --> 01:46:13.320 align:start position:0%
contract and I do have a line of
 
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
candidates waiting for rfps when those
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities are done is it possible
 
01:46:20.270 --> 01:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
we come back to GNC in the next biennium
 
01:46:22.010 --> 01:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
and say hey can we move it one more time
 
01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
and then if if that does prove we have
 
01:46:26.570 --> 01:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
to prove that that's going to work that
 
01:46:28.370 --> 01:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
may be the ultimate goal after this next
 
01:46:30.590 --> 01:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
biennium if we could leave it in 10 for
 
01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:31.790 align:start position:0%
biennium if we could leave it in 10 for
now

01:46:31.790 --> 01:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:46:34.010 --> 01:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
funded where it is and then perhaps in
 
01:46:35.930 --> 01:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
that biennium we make the decision to
 
01:46:37.729 --> 01:46:37.739 align:start position:0%
once again just shift it and then maybe
 
01:46:39.910 --> 01:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
keep in a contract basis permanently
 
01:46:42.590 --> 01:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
that might be the solution
 
01:46:44.450 --> 01:46:44.460 align:start position:0%
um because I think contracts would work
 
01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
01:46:47.209 --> 01:46:47.219 align:start position:0%
um because you have a greater pool of
 
01:46:48.649 --> 01:46:48.659 align:start position:0%
people that don't have you know when you
 
01:46:50.510 --> 01:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
have conflicts
 
01:46:52.189 --> 01:46:52.199 align:start position:0%
um that that might be the answer long
 
01:46:55.010 --> 01:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
term so okay
 
01:46:56.990 --> 01:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'd like to sit down with you
 
01:46:59.390 --> 01:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
sometime between now and February and I
 
01:47:01.669 --> 01:47:01.679 align:start position:0%
have some ideas that maybe we can
 
01:47:03.649 --> 01:47:03.659 align:start position:0%
craft together something to alleviate
 
01:47:06.590 --> 01:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
your problem I mean hopefully yeah that
 
01:47:11.050 --> 01:47:11.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
I think a contract is a long term as
 
01:47:17.870 --> 01:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
might be exactly the way to go and I
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
think there are multiple people who have
 
01:47:22.970 --> 01:47:22.980 align:start position:0%
experienced a need for does anybody have
 
01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
contracts with appraisers other than Dot
 
01:47:26.159 --> 01:47:26.990 align:start position:0%
contracts with appraisers other than Dot
um

01:47:26.990 --> 01:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
because they use all theirs
 
01:47:32.030 --> 01:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
um looking at pill but I think it could
 
01:47:33.649 --> 01:47:33.659 align:start position:0%
I mean you know a lot of positions we
 
01:47:35.090 --> 01:47:35.100 align:start position:0%
can't hire because the state doesn't pay
 
01:47:38.930 --> 01:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
and you don't necessarily need someone
 
01:47:41.930 --> 01:47:41.940 align:start position:0%
um on call Mike ready to go in the next
 
01:47:44.930 --> 01:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
10 minutes and that might be a thing
 
01:47:47.450 --> 01:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
um I have a question
 
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
for Michelle yes how long have you
 
01:47:52.370 --> 01:47:52.380 align:start position:0%
worked for the state
 
01:47:54.410 --> 01:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
50 years
 
01:47:57.169 --> 01:47:57.179 align:start position:0%
I just wanted that I wanted to say that
 
01:47:58.669 --> 01:47:58.679 align:start position:0%
because I we were talking on the phone
 
01:48:01.250 --> 01:48:01.260 align:start position:0%
the other day and I looked up longevity
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
payments yes you did and there was and
 
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
there and there was one
 
01:48:10.370 --> 01:48:10.380 align:start position:0%
so I uh I can't say for certain but I
 
01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
think that it is in all likelihood you
 
01:48:14.510 --> 01:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
are the longest currently longest
 
01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
serving state employee
 
01:48:20.330 --> 01:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
I just I I hope I'm not the oldest I did
 
01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
not I I did not say that
 
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
I didn't go anywhere near that
 
01:48:30.229 --> 01:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
you started when you were 12 is my
 
01:48:30.239 --> 01:48:31.510 align:start position:0%
you started when you were 12 is my
understanding

01:48:31.510 --> 01:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:48:35.810 --> 01:48:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
anyway that's all I want to say and
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much great
 
01:48:41.870 --> 01:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
thank you and congratulations on your 50
 
01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
I would like to invite the insurance
 
01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:23.709 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:49:23.709 --> 01:49:23.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
ER of Insurance I'm joined here by
 
01:49:28.129 --> 01:49:28.139 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner DJ Bettencourt
 
01:49:30.590 --> 01:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner Christy rice
 
01:49:33.950 --> 01:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
and Ted Perkins our this operations guy
 
01:49:35.810 --> 01:49:35.820 align:start position:0%
behind me and they're here in case I
 
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer and I can tag out
 
01:49:39.950 --> 01:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
um insurance company had a great year I
 
01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
think we had a record for premium tax
 
01:49:45.169 --> 01:49:45.179 align:start position:0%
collected at about 136 million uh and
 
01:49:47.930 --> 01:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
another record for fees uh let primarily
 
01:49:51.010 --> 01:49:51.020 align:start position:0%
license fees uh between adjusters and
 
01:49:53.870 --> 01:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
agents of nearly 25 million
 
01:49:55.910 --> 01:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh so the Department's doing well there
 
01:49:59.810 --> 01:49:59.820 align:start position:0%
we currently have 86 full-time positions
 
01:50:02.030 --> 01:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
in the department of which 72 of those
 
01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
are filled or 71 of those are filled
 
01:50:05.930 --> 01:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
leaving 15 open positions
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
when you look at those 15 open positions
 
01:50:09.470 --> 01:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
one of them will be filled on Friday
 
01:50:12.169 --> 01:50:12.179 align:start position:0%
we're so excited about that uh four of
 
01:50:15.410 --> 01:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
them were currently have postings and
 
01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
looking for candidates leaving
 
01:50:20.990 --> 01:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
um 10 10 other 10 other positions one of
 
01:50:22.250 --> 01:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
those we've not been able to fill since
 
01:50:24.709 --> 01:50:24.719 align:start position:0%
2018 and we're not actively looking to
 
01:50:26.450 --> 01:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
fill that
 
01:50:28.669 --> 01:50:28.679 align:start position:0%
um but the other nine we are uh we're
 
01:50:30.709 --> 01:50:30.719 align:start position:0%
we're looking at filling them when it's
 
01:50:32.629 --> 01:50:32.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate on average those positions
 
01:50:34.850 --> 01:50:34.860 align:start position:0%
have been open about nine months
 
01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:36.649 align:start position:0%
have been open about nine months
um

01:50:36.649 --> 01:50:36.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:38.149 --> 01:50:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's important to understand
 
01:50:40.250 --> 01:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
that our insurance public staff are
 
01:50:42.290 --> 01:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
generally uh highly trained insurance
 
01:50:44.990 --> 01:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
industry experts that typically come to
 
01:50:46.490 --> 01:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
the department after years of service in
 
01:50:48.770 --> 01:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
the industry uh when they come to the
 
01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
department they tend to stay to
 
01:50:52.430 --> 01:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
retirement unfortunately we look at our
 
01:50:54.770 --> 01:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
uh our colleagues more than half of them
 
01:50:57.590 --> 01:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
are eligible to to retire already and so
 
01:50:59.149 --> 01:50:59.159 align:start position:0%
as an executive team we're spending a
 
01:51:01.010 --> 01:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
lot of time ensuring that we've trained
 
01:51:02.810 --> 01:51:02.820 align:start position:0%
the next generation of folks to step up
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
and to to serve these critical roles
 
01:51:07.609 --> 01:51:07.619 align:start position:0%
you'll see in our budget request for
 
01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
24.25 that we're asking for three Junior
 
01:51:12.590 --> 01:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
examiner positions uh nearly 20 of our
 
01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
staff members are insurance company
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
examiners of some sort and what we've
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
what we've learned is there's not really
 
01:51:21.050 --> 01:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to bring somebody on that
 
01:51:22.430 --> 01:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
has a little bit of the experience that
 
01:51:24.050 --> 01:51:24.060 align:start position:0%
we need to transition them into that
 
01:51:26.209 --> 01:51:26.219 align:start position:0%
full career insurance company examiner
 
01:51:29.090 --> 01:51:29.100 align:start position:0%
position uh and ultimately we think this
 
01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
is the way to ensure that we can
 
01:51:33.169 --> 01:51:33.179 align:start position:0%
continue to deliver all the services uh
 
01:51:35.570 --> 01:51:35.580 align:start position:0%
as a regulator uh internally in the
 
01:51:37.010 --> 01:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
house without having to go outside and
 
01:51:38.629 --> 01:51:38.639 align:start position:0%
hire Consultants
 
01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh we had uh we had an opportunity this
 
01:51:42.470 --> 01:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
year with one of our actuaries who
 
01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:43.970 align:start position:0%
year with one of our actuaries who
retired

01:51:43.970 --> 01:51:43.980 align:start position:0%
retired
 
01:51:46.729 --> 01:51:46.739 align:start position:0%
um we were required to hire a consultant
 
01:51:49.850 --> 01:51:49.860 align:start position:0%
Actuarial firm they build the regulated
 
01:51:52.430 --> 01:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
entities directly and it's like eight
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
times more expensive to have that person
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
on hand and so we have that position
 
01:51:59.270 --> 01:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
posted and we're looking to find a life
 
01:52:01.070 --> 01:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
and health actuary
 
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to understand uh
 
01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
what the kind of primary consumer
 
01:52:08.450 --> 01:52:08.460 align:start position:0%
contact for our department is and that's
 
01:52:10.430 --> 01:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
nearly 5 000 consumer inquiries that
 
01:52:11.750 --> 01:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
come in every year through our consumer
 
01:52:13.250 --> 01:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
division we have seven people on our
 
01:52:15.830 --> 01:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
staff that are there to manage New
 
01:52:18.530 --> 01:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh residents who don't
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
understand something about their
 
01:52:22.010 --> 01:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
insurance relationship and it may be as
 
01:52:23.689 --> 01:52:23.699 align:start position:0%
simple as what does actual cash value
 
01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
mean or why is something on my policy
 
01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
excluded and then endorsed back on
 
01:52:29.629 --> 01:52:29.639 align:start position:0%
something that our people can handle
 
01:52:29.639 --> 01:52:30.709 align:start position:0%
something that our people can handle
easily

01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
easily
 
01:52:33.790 --> 01:52:33.800 align:start position:0%
uh but 15 of those uh inquiries are
 
01:52:35.870 --> 01:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
consumer potential consumer complaints
 
01:52:37.970 --> 01:52:37.980 align:start position:0%
and those all uh for 15 turn into
 
01:52:41.090 --> 01:52:41.100 align:start position:0%
consumer uh investigations uh which
 
01:52:43.910 --> 01:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
means that our uh our CSO team will
 
01:52:45.169 --> 01:52:45.179 align:start position:0%
request certain information from the
 
01:52:47.209 --> 01:52:47.219 align:start position:0%
company we'll investigate whether or not
 
01:52:50.209 --> 01:52:50.219 align:start position:0%
uh national law has been complied with
 
01:52:52.490 --> 01:52:52.500 align:start position:0%
um in many of those cases nearly half of
 
01:52:54.709 --> 01:52:54.719 align:start position:0%
them we were able to get a positive
 
01:52:57.490 --> 01:52:57.500 align:start position:0%
recovery for our New Hampshire consumer
 
01:53:00.410 --> 01:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
but most importantly what we end up with
 
01:53:02.270 --> 01:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
is 5 000 touches to New Hampshire
 
01:53:04.609 --> 01:53:04.619 align:start position:0%
consumers each year who prior to the
 
01:53:06.770 --> 01:53:06.780 align:start position:0%
call didn't know we existed and we do a
 
01:53:08.750 --> 01:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
lot of follow-up of those folks to find
 
01:53:10.729 --> 01:53:10.739 align:start position:0%
out how they're getting to us and how
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
happy they are with the results a DJ and
 
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
I take those calls uh very seriously in
 
01:53:18.169 --> 01:53:18.179 align:start position:0%
fact our team meets every week to go
 
01:53:19.729 --> 01:53:19.739 align:start position:0%
through every one of those consumer
 
01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
complaints before we close them to make
 
01:53:23.689 --> 01:53:23.699 align:start position:0%
sure we get the right result and he and
 
01:53:25.070 --> 01:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
I will sit in and go through each and
 
01:53:27.109 --> 01:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
every one of them so that we both want
 
01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
to understand what's happening in the
 
01:53:31.129 --> 01:53:31.139 align:start position:0%
field understand you know trends as
 
01:53:32.810 --> 01:53:32.820 align:start position:0%
they're coming and also make sure we're
 
01:53:35.870 --> 01:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:37.970 --> 01:53:37.980 align:start position:0%
through covet we saw something unique
 
01:53:40.010 --> 01:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
and the thing we saw is unique is that
 
01:53:42.050 --> 01:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
the number of New Hampshire producer
 
01:53:43.609 --> 01:53:43.619 align:start position:0%
licensees and the number of adjuster
 
01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
licensees kept growing record after
 
01:53:48.709 --> 01:53:48.719 align:start position:0%
record and what we've determined is
 
01:53:51.770 --> 01:53:51.780 align:start position:0%
these National Insurance companies uh
 
01:53:53.450 --> 01:53:53.460 align:start position:0%
during a time where their staffs and
 
01:53:55.010 --> 01:53:55.020 align:start position:0%
remote work have just licensed everybody
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
everywhere I don't think that's
 
01:53:59.689 --> 01:53:59.699 align:start position:0%
sustainable we we currently have 200 000
 
01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
producers or adjusters licensed here in
 
01:54:03.169 --> 01:54:03.179 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we don't need one for
 
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
every seven people that won't survive
 
01:54:08.209 --> 01:54:08.219 align:start position:0%
but that's where we are today
 
01:54:09.890 --> 01:54:09.900 align:start position:0%
I think when you look at our budget for
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 you'll see a five percent
 
01:54:13.370 --> 01:54:13.380 align:start position:0%
increase for 24 and a two percent
 
01:54:16.250 --> 01:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
increase for 25.
 
01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:17.709 align:start position:0%
increase for 25.
um

01:54:17.709 --> 01:54:17.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
you'll see some of that that is made up
 
01:54:23.330 --> 01:54:23.340 align:start position:0%
of increases to both of our uh
 
01:54:25.430 --> 01:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
contractor lines in last year's budget
 
01:54:28.250 --> 01:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
because of the uncertainty we cut some
 
01:54:29.870 --> 01:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
of our
 
01:54:32.450 --> 01:54:32.460 align:start position:0%
um some of our contractor potential uh
 
01:54:36.350 --> 01:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
spending uh those funds are used for uh
 
01:54:38.510 --> 01:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
requires for our annual hearing uh the
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
Consultants uh and the data that we need
 
01:54:44.030 --> 01:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
necessary to advise the marketplace on
 
01:54:45.770 --> 01:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
uh the stability of our health insurance
 
01:54:48.830 --> 01:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
Marketplace and most importantly uh the
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
the creation and maintenance of our New
 
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Health cost website and that's
 
01:54:54.770 --> 01:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
something we do in conjunction with DHHS
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
I was a first in the nation a
 
01:54:59.209 --> 01:54:59.219 align:start position:0%
transparency tool and it is safe New
 
01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire consumers Untold tens of
 
01:55:01.320 --> 01:55:02.270 align:start position:0%
Hampshire consumers Untold tens of
Millions

01:55:02.270 --> 01:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
Millions
 
01:55:06.050 --> 01:55:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:08.950 --> 01:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
thank you uh just a real quick question
 
01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh in in the budget you have uh lines
 
01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
for overtime and temporary employees if
 
01:55:20.209 --> 01:55:20.219 align:start position:0%
you were to get the additional uh
 
01:55:21.830 --> 01:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
employees that you you want brought
 
01:55:24.229 --> 01:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
online would that eliminate the need for
 
01:55:26.090 --> 01:55:26.100 align:start position:0%
the overtime and additional employees or
 
01:55:29.090 --> 01:55:29.100 align:start position:0%
is that in addition to I great questions
 
01:55:31.609 --> 01:55:31.619 align:start position:0%
um I think the overtime is a product of
 
01:55:33.830 --> 01:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
our flexibility during covet when we
 
01:55:35.590 --> 01:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
were asked to support
 
01:55:38.090 --> 01:55:38.100 align:start position:0%
services across the state we didn't have
 
01:55:40.250 --> 01:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
an overtime budget and so we had to we
 
01:55:43.609 --> 01:55:43.619 align:start position:0%
had to go to uh get permission to put it
 
01:55:46.070 --> 01:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
there so this overtime is literally just
 
01:55:48.290 --> 01:55:48.300 align:start position:0%
a belt and suspenders in case we're
 
01:55:50.090 --> 01:55:50.100 align:start position:0%
asked to support someone again and we
 
01:55:51.649 --> 01:55:51.659 align:start position:0%
have that ability to pay typically we
 
01:55:54.010 --> 01:55:54.020 align:start position:0%
don't pay overtime in our office
 
01:55:58.609 --> 01:55:58.619 align:start position:0%
the temporary part-time position is we
 
01:56:01.010 --> 01:56:01.020 align:start position:0%
we lost our director of Health uh our
 
01:56:04.430 --> 01:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
life in health this year uh with uh with
 
01:56:06.530 --> 01:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
some luck we were able to bring on our
 
01:56:08.570 --> 01:56:08.580 align:start position:0%
former Deputy Commissioner back to help
 
01:56:11.390 --> 01:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
train the new team and so these funds
 
01:56:14.390 --> 01:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
are to transition through 24 the team
 
01:56:16.010 --> 01:56:16.020 align:start position:0%
and bring them up to speed with that so
 
01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
these would stay here even with those
 
01:56:19.850 --> 01:56:19.860 align:start position:0%
Junior positions okay and with with the
 
01:56:22.729 --> 01:56:22.739 align:start position:0%
the 14 and 15 or so unfilled positions
 
01:56:25.129 --> 01:56:25.139 align:start position:0%
that you have uh how difficult has it
 
01:56:26.270 --> 01:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
been for you to recruit for those
 
01:56:28.910 --> 01:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
positions and do you expect to be able
 
01:56:30.350 --> 01:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
to fill them
 
01:56:32.930 --> 01:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
very difficult I I think you probably
 
01:56:35.330 --> 01:56:35.340 align:start position:0%
heard that from everybody so yeah
 
01:56:37.070 --> 01:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
um you know we're fortunate the
 
01:56:38.149 --> 01:56:38.159 align:start position:0%
department that we have because they're
 
01:56:39.470 --> 01:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
professional positions some of them pay
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate for that but still it's been
 
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
difficult uh our department uh
 
01:56:48.050 --> 01:56:48.060 align:start position:0%
or get more final we have a position
 
01:56:49.609 --> 01:56:49.619 align:start position:0%
that's been open for six months we have
 
01:56:50.810 --> 01:56:50.820 align:start position:0%
an interview for this week we're super
 
01:56:52.490 --> 01:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
excited about
 
01:56:54.890 --> 01:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
um and I think with the downturn the
 
01:56:56.209 --> 01:56:56.219 align:start position:0%
economy I'm hoping that it's a little
 
01:56:57.530 --> 01:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
easier to
 
01:57:05.149 --> 01:57:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:14.810 --> 01:57:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:16.910 --> 01:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
we'd like to invite the Department of

01:58:03.659 --> 01:58:12.109 align:start position:0%
 
moments

01:58:12.109 --> 01:58:12.119 align:start position:0%

answer
 
01:58:49.010 --> 01:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
so um I would uh kind of in the front of
 
01:58:51.649 --> 01:58:51.659 align:start position:0%
the handout that we have is a uh it's
 
01:58:53.149 --> 01:58:53.159 align:start position:0%
kind of a budget letter and I'm gonna
 
01:58:54.950 --> 01:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not gonna read the letter but I'll
 
01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
paraphrase some of the points that and
 
01:58:59.089 --> 01:58:59.099 align:start position:0%
kind of walk through but that's how
 
01:59:00.229 --> 01:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
we've kind of structured our
 
01:59:03.589 --> 01:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
introduction to the state's budget here
 
01:59:05.689 --> 01:59:05.699 align:start position:0%
um and and really this is to provide a
 
01:59:09.709 --> 01:59:09.719 align:start position:0%
high level uh summary of The Dot budget
 
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
um and clarify some clarify and explain
 
01:59:14.089 --> 01:59:14.099 align:start position:0%
some of the complexities of how the dot
 
01:59:15.470 --> 01:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
is um
 
01:59:17.510 --> 01:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
is funded
 
01:59:20.629 --> 01:59:20.639 align:start position:0%
um and at the very end as time permits
 
01:59:22.490 --> 01:59:22.500 align:start position:0%
would also just kind of summarize some
 
01:59:24.890 --> 01:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
of the challenges our agency is facing
 
01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
over the next several years so the
 
01:59:28.630 --> 01:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
handout you have
 
01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:28.910 align:start position:0%
handout you have
[Music]

01:59:28.910 --> 01:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:29.990 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:59:29.990 --> 01:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
provide a comprehensive overview of the
 
01:59:35.450 --> 01:59:35.460 align:start position:0%
department we we I know Charlie had made
 
01:59:37.550 --> 01:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
a con and we we do like this comic
 
01:59:39.890 --> 01:59:39.900 align:start position:0%
because it puts people to the to the to
 
01:59:42.169 --> 01:59:42.179 align:start position:0%
the to the organization and helps
 
01:59:43.250 --> 01:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
explain better some of the
 
01:59:45.050 --> 01:59:45.060 align:start position:0%
accomplishments and and what they did
 
01:59:48.109 --> 01:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
and you know and what what they do when
 
01:59:50.209 --> 01:59:50.219 align:start position:0%
um so we find it educational as well
 
01:59:52.010 --> 01:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh
 
01:59:55.729 --> 01:59:55.739 align:start position:0%
um engaging as well too but um
 
01:59:55.739 --> 01:59:56.629 align:start position:0%
um engaging as well too but um
um

01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:01.310 --> 02:00:01.320 align:start position:0%
we the very front part of the um of the
 
02:00:03.729 --> 02:00:03.739 align:start position:0%
handout what we call Citizens uh
 
02:00:06.050 --> 02:00:06.060 align:start position:0%
advisory guide we have the dot
 
02:00:08.810 --> 02:00:08.820 align:start position:0%
organizational structure
 
02:00:10.550 --> 02:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
um but then we talk about how we break
 
02:00:12.709 --> 02:00:12.719 align:start position:0%
up our budget so even though we have one
 
02:00:14.330 --> 02:00:14.340 align:start position:0%
big budget we we tend to think of our
 
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
budget in two two parts the operating
 
02:00:18.410 --> 02:00:18.420 align:start position:0%
budget which really is what we're here
 
02:00:20.750 --> 02:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
to talk about this time
 
02:00:23.089 --> 02:00:23.099 align:start position:0%
um for the budget process but also the
 
02:00:26.149 --> 02:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
municipal Aid and construction budget
 
02:00:27.649 --> 02:00:27.659 align:start position:0%
um the municipal Aid and the
 
02:00:30.109 --> 02:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
construction program we have a lot of
 
02:00:31.550 --> 02:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
discussion with that through the 10-year
 
02:00:35.089 --> 02:00:35.099 align:start position:0%
plan which was a house bill uh last time
 
02:00:37.790 --> 02:00:37.800 align:start position:0%
and stuff and all of that effort and our
 
02:00:39.709 --> 02:00:39.719 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway program
 
02:00:41.510 --> 02:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
um and the levels of funding and stuff
 
02:00:43.310 --> 02:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of discussion through the
 
02:00:45.050 --> 02:00:45.060 align:start position:0%
10-year plan process and that's all
 
02:00:45.060 --> 02:00:46.850 align:start position:0%
10-year plan process and that's all
Incorporated

02:00:46.850 --> 02:00:46.860 align:start position:0%
Incorporated
 
02:00:49.250 --> 02:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
um in the budget but in those levels of
 
02:00:51.890 --> 02:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
expenditures uh usually dictated by
 
02:00:53.149 --> 02:00:53.159 align:start position:0%
those discussions and program
 
02:00:55.189 --> 02:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
Investments that go on as part of the
 
02:00:57.169 --> 02:00:57.179 align:start position:0%
10-year plan
 
02:00:58.970 --> 02:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
um and about two-thirds of all of our
 
02:01:01.609 --> 02:01:01.619 align:start position:0%
expenditures in the states in our dots
 
02:01:03.709 --> 02:01:03.719 align:start position:0%
budget end up um you know either going
 
02:01:05.450 --> 02:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
you know the pass-through to the
 
02:01:06.890 --> 02:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
municipalities or the construction
 
02:01:10.250 --> 02:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
industry or things things like that so
 
02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
the operating budget that um is really a
 
02:01:15.709 --> 02:01:15.719 align:start position:0%
big focus of of our budget hearings is
 
02:01:18.050 --> 02:01:18.060 align:start position:0%
is primarily Highway funded so I just
 
02:01:20.450 --> 02:01:20.460 align:start position:0%
wanted to walk through a couple of
 
02:01:20.460 --> 02:01:23.030 align:start position:0%
wanted to walk through a couple of
um

02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:25.129 --> 02:01:25.139 align:start position:0%
points of interest about the about the
 
02:01:27.649 --> 02:01:27.659 align:start position:0%
highway fund so the highway fund is is
 
02:01:27.659 --> 02:01:29.149 align:start position:0%
highway fund so the highway fund is is
where

02:01:29.149 --> 02:01:29.159 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:01:30.770 --> 02:01:30.780 align:start position:0%
um unrestricted State of New Hampshire
 
02:01:32.689 --> 02:01:32.699 align:start position:0%
Revenue that's collected by the
 
02:01:34.490 --> 02:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
department of safety we don't collect it
 
02:01:36.229 --> 02:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
it's collected by Department of Safety
 
02:01:39.109 --> 02:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
and it's primarily the road toll I.E the
 
02:01:42.129 --> 02:01:42.139 align:start position:0%
gas tax and uh vehicle registration
 
02:01:44.270 --> 02:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
registration fees they flow into the
 
02:01:45.530 --> 02:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
highway fund and they're made available
 
02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
five corporations to various agencies
 
02:01:51.890 --> 02:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
primarily Dot and dos draw off the
 
02:01:56.510 --> 02:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
highway Fund in 2022 uh about 60 percent
 
02:01:59.689 --> 02:01:59.699 align:start position:0%
of the high OA fund uh came to the dot
 
02:02:01.970 --> 02:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
about 27 percent came to the Department
 
02:02:05.629 --> 02:02:05.639 align:start position:0%
of Safety the remaining 13 went to other
 
02:02:08.450 --> 02:02:08.460 align:start position:0%
agencies and municipalities so that's a
 
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
broad structure the highway fund is also
 
02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:12.050 align:start position:0%
broad structure the highway fund is also
where

02:02:12.050 --> 02:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:02:14.450 --> 02:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
um all of our federal funds flow into
 
02:02:15.729 --> 02:02:15.739 align:start position:0%
that's where we collect the
 
02:02:17.689 --> 02:02:17.699 align:start position:0%
reimbursements from the Federal Highway
 
02:02:17.699 --> 02:02:19.490 align:start position:0%
reimbursements from the Federal Highway
program

02:02:19.490 --> 02:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:02:21.649 --> 02:02:21.659 align:start position:0%
um and it's also the fund which Bond and
 
02:02:23.930 --> 02:02:23.940 align:start position:0%
load proceeds flow into in the past
 
02:02:26.450 --> 02:02:26.460 align:start position:0%
we've had Garvey bonds and other debt
 
02:02:28.850 --> 02:02:28.860 align:start position:0%
financing to help with the highway to
 
02:02:31.129 --> 02:02:31.139 align:start position:0%
help with the construction program and
 
02:02:32.570 --> 02:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
those are collected in the highway fund
 
02:02:34.250 --> 02:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:02:36.290 --> 02:02:36.300 align:start position:0%
um I we we always want to point this out
 
02:02:38.810 --> 02:02:38.820 align:start position:0%
because you know one thing the highway
 
02:02:41.089 --> 02:02:41.099 align:start position:0%
fund is not the dot we get associated
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
with it but uh it is not necessarily
 
02:02:46.490 --> 02:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
under our our full control and that's
 
02:02:48.950 --> 02:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
been a misconception in the past it's
 
02:02:50.930 --> 02:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
not exclusively
 
02:02:53.750 --> 02:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire taxes and fees a lot of
 
02:02:55.129 --> 02:02:55.139 align:start position:0%
federal funds also come through the
 
02:02:58.430 --> 02:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
highway fund one of the things we always
 
02:03:01.729 --> 02:03:01.739 align:start position:0%
have to explain about with uh it's it's
 
02:03:04.270 --> 02:03:04.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know a weekly kind of explanation
 
02:03:07.370 --> 02:03:07.380 align:start position:0%
is how the highway fund and the Turnpike
 
02:03:09.109 --> 02:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
fund are a different so the turnpike
 
02:03:09.119 --> 02:03:10.729 align:start position:0%
fund are a different so the turnpike
fund

02:03:10.729 --> 02:03:10.739 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:03:13.310 --> 02:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
um is even though the turnpike system is
 
02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
managed by the um by the dot the
 
02:03:18.169 --> 02:03:18.179 align:start position:0%
turnpike system is a separate Enterprise
 
02:03:21.890 --> 02:03:21.900 align:start position:0%
fund funded solely by the toll revenues
 
02:03:24.109 --> 02:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
that are collected there so
 
02:03:27.350 --> 02:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
um that specific 90 miles of road that
 
02:03:29.930 --> 02:03:29.940 align:start position:0%
uh make up the turnpike system are
 
02:03:32.330 --> 02:03:32.340 align:start position:0%
separate and apart from the highway Fund
 
02:03:34.010 --> 02:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
in the turnpike fund and the Turnpike
 
02:03:35.810 --> 02:03:35.820 align:start position:0%
funds can only be used on that but that
 
02:03:40.910 --> 02:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
is all Incorporated uh in our budget
 
02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:42.430 align:start position:0%
is all Incorporated uh in our budget
um

02:03:42.430 --> 02:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:46.129 --> 02:03:46.139 align:start position:0%
so on on page two a little bit of a
 
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
summary of the of of the dot budget and
 
02:03:52.010 --> 02:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
and some art of the the complexity so we
 
02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
have you know four primary funding
 
02:03:56.510 --> 02:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
sources within the the dot budget first
 
02:03:58.010 --> 02:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
of all we have the general funding we
 
02:03:59.570 --> 02:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
have a pretty small draw on the general
 
02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
fund about 1.6 million dollars in FY
 
02:04:05.810 --> 02:04:05.820 align:start position:0%
um in in the proposed budget for um FY
 
02:04:05.820 --> 02:04:07.850 align:start position:0%
um in in the proposed budget for um FY
24.

02:04:07.850 --> 02:04:07.860 align:start position:0%
24.
 
02:04:10.070 --> 02:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
um primarily that's our Aeronautics Rail
 
02:04:11.629 --> 02:04:11.639 align:start position:0%
and Transit group that's funded with the
 
02:04:13.250 --> 02:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
highway fund uh funded with the general
 
02:04:16.310 --> 02:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
fund the bulk of our budget as I said
 
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
here's the uh is the highway fund and
 
02:04:21.410 --> 02:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
the federal funds that go into the
 
02:04:23.209 --> 02:04:23.219 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
02:04:25.850 --> 02:04:25.860 align:start position:0%
um with that
 
02:04:25.860 --> 02:04:26.930 align:start position:0%
um with that
um

02:04:26.930 --> 02:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:28.729 --> 02:04:28.739 align:start position:0%
I had mentioned the turnpike fund the
 
02:04:31.250 --> 02:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
turnpike fund is about 125 million
 
02:04:36.169 --> 02:04:36.179 align:start position:0%
dollars in FY uh 24 and that funds the
 
02:04:38.089 --> 02:04:38.099 align:start position:0%
operations maintenance Debt Service and
 
02:04:40.629 --> 02:04:40.639 align:start position:0%
capital construction projects
 
02:04:44.030 --> 02:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
exclusively on that on those 90 miles of
 
02:04:46.729 --> 02:04:46.739 align:start position:0%
of Turnpike roads
 
02:04:49.129 --> 02:04:49.139 align:start position:0%
um I make mention uh in the final bullet
 
02:04:51.109 --> 02:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
about the capital fund primarily because
 
02:04:54.530 --> 02:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
uh uh in in our budget there's uh
 
02:04:56.510 --> 02:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
Federal Transit funds that go to some of
 
02:04:59.209 --> 02:04:59.219 align:start position:0%
the transit programs the capital budget
 
02:05:01.310 --> 02:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
funds helps fund some of the state match
 
02:05:03.169 --> 02:05:03.179 align:start position:0%
to those programs so there's there's a
 
02:05:05.689 --> 02:05:05.699 align:start position:0%
there's a link there
 
02:05:07.070 --> 02:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
um one of the things I didn't want to
 
02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
just kind of point out as we look to
 
02:05:10.910 --> 02:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
compare this bid budget to previous
 
02:05:14.270 --> 02:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
budgets has been the impact of of
 
02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:14.990 align:start position:0%
budgets has been the impact of of
um

02:05:14.990 --> 02:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:17.810 --> 02:05:17.820 align:start position:0%
of covid-19 pandemic and some of the
 
02:05:19.790 --> 02:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
emergency relief funding that has come
 
02:05:21.070 --> 02:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
to the department
 
02:05:23.990 --> 02:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic uh there were
 
02:05:27.790 --> 02:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
reductions in in all forms of of Revenue
 
02:05:31.010 --> 02:05:31.020 align:start position:0%
and uh recognizing this you know
 
02:05:33.470 --> 02:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
Congress had passed a number of
 
02:05:35.390 --> 02:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
um coveted relief measures from the
 
02:05:38.750 --> 02:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
cares act chrisa ARP
 
02:05:41.570 --> 02:05:41.580 align:start position:0%
um and those funds were used to
 
02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:43.679 align:start position:0%
um reduce the need for State funds and
 
02:05:47.089 --> 02:05:47.099 align:start position:0%
offset some of the operational losses
 
02:05:47.099 --> 02:05:47.750 align:start position:0%
offset some of the operational losses
um

02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:50.750 --> 02:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
so that was supplemental for example uh
 
02:05:52.729 --> 02:05:52.739 align:start position:0%
there were a number of funds that went
 
02:05:55.370 --> 02:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
to uh Transit agencies and supplemented
 
02:05:58.910 --> 02:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
or or supplanted some of those
 
02:06:01.129 --> 02:06:01.139 align:start position:0%
um funds there
 
02:06:03.589 --> 02:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
um over the past biennium we had 41
 
02:06:05.629 --> 02:06:05.639 align:start position:0%
million dollars that was provided to
 
02:06:09.169 --> 02:06:09.179 align:start position:0%
supplant Lost Highway fund revenues
 
02:06:12.169 --> 02:06:12.179 align:start position:0%
um and reduced and reduce that at the
 
02:06:13.790 --> 02:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
end of the last
 
02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:14.390 align:start position:0%
end of the last
um

02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:17.149 --> 02:06:17.159 align:start position:0%
at the end of last year at the end of FY
 
02:06:19.550 --> 02:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
at the end of calendar year 2021
 
02:06:21.470 --> 02:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
Congress had passed the investment in
 
02:06:24.830 --> 02:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
jobs act and that was a surface
 
02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:25.729 align:start position:0%
jobs act and that was a surface
um

02:06:25.729 --> 02:06:25.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:28.510 --> 02:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
Transportation reauthorization bill
 
02:06:32.089 --> 02:06:32.099 align:start position:0%
so the funding levels that were passed
 
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
in that in New Hampshire it means about
 
02:06:37.490 --> 02:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
an additional 20 to 25 percent higher
 
02:06:40.970 --> 02:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
level of core formula funding
 
02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
um those funding levels are are
 
02:06:46.910 --> 02:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
reflected in in this budget over and
 
02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:47.870 align:start position:0%
reflected in in this budget over and
above

02:06:47.870 --> 02:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
above
 
02:06:47.880 --> 02:06:48.709 align:start position:0%
above
um

02:06:48.709 --> 02:06:48.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:51.709 --> 02:06:51.719 align:start position:0%
previous years uh funding levels
 
02:06:53.689 --> 02:06:53.699 align:start position:0%
so the upshot of all this and why I'm
 
02:06:55.310 --> 02:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
bringing this up is that you know while
 
02:06:58.729 --> 02:06:58.739 align:start position:0%
the iija provided uh increased formula
 
02:07:02.810 --> 02:07:02.820 align:start position:0%
funding the foi 2425 budget in in this
 
02:07:06.410 --> 02:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
budget the use of federal funds due to
 
02:07:08.270 --> 02:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
both completion of some of the major
 
02:07:11.810 --> 02:07:11.820 align:start position:0%
projects as well as uh the depletion of
 
02:07:14.390 --> 02:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
covert relief funds
 
02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:15.649 align:start position:0%
covert relief funds
um

02:07:15.649 --> 02:07:15.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:17.330 --> 02:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
there will be a reduction in federal
 
02:07:19.970 --> 02:07:19.980 align:start position:0%
funds when you do that comparison
 
02:07:19.980 --> 02:07:21.229 align:start position:0%
funds when you do that comparison
so

02:07:21.229 --> 02:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:07:23.330 --> 02:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
um that's all kind of lead in some of
 
02:07:25.089 --> 02:07:25.099 align:start position:0%
the major components of the budget
 
02:07:28.129 --> 02:07:28.139 align:start position:0%
summarized on page three and I'll just
 
02:07:29.990 --> 02:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
hit some of those real quick you know
 
02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
our combined total efficiency budget is
 
02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:34.030 align:start position:0%
our combined total efficiency budget is
uh

02:07:34.030 --> 02:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:07:37.729 --> 02:07:37.739 align:start position:0%
752.7 million dollars for foi 24. that's
 
02:07:39.010 --> 02:07:39.020 align:start position:0%
comprised of about
 
02:07:43.070 --> 02:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
338 339 million dollars about 45 percent
 
02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
of that overall budget is what we would
 
02:07:47.709 --> 02:07:47.719 align:start position:0%
classify as our operating budget about
 
02:07:52.430 --> 02:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
414 million dollars or uh about 55 of
 
02:07:55.010 --> 02:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
our overall budget is toward that
 
02:07:57.350 --> 02:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
Municipal Aid and construction
 
02:07:57.360 --> 02:07:58.010 align:start position:0%
Municipal Aid and construction
um

02:07:58.010 --> 02:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:00.890 --> 02:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
projects within our budget so overall
 
02:08:03.950 --> 02:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
this is a three percent decrease over uh
 
02:08:05.990 --> 02:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
over our total adjusted authorized
 
02:08:08.629 --> 02:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
budget from fy23
 
02:08:08.639 --> 02:08:09.470 align:start position:0%
budget from fy23
um

02:08:09.470 --> 02:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:13.689 --> 02:08:13.699 align:start position:0%
the fy25 budget is about 770
 
02:08:16.669 --> 02:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
774 million dollars
 
02:08:18.589 --> 02:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
um that's about a point three percent
 
02:08:20.810 --> 02:08:20.820 align:start position:0%
decrease from adjusted authorized and FY
 
02:08:23.629 --> 02:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
23 and an increase of 2.8 percent and
 
02:08:26.629 --> 02:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
the total budget request from from 24.
 
02:08:29.770 --> 02:08:29.780 align:start position:0%
uh that total the federal funds
 
02:08:32.510 --> 02:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
decreased as I had mentioned too because
 
02:08:35.209 --> 02:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
of the impact of the covert relief
 
02:08:38.050 --> 02:08:38.060 align:start position:0%
funding our overall Federal fund
 
02:08:40.250 --> 02:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
expenditures decreased by about 3
 
02:08:42.490 --> 02:08:42.500 align:start position:0%
percent in FY
 
02:08:47.570 --> 02:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
2024 and 1.6 in fy25 that's as compared
 
02:08:51.050 --> 02:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
to the FY 23 adjusted authorized
 
02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:51.709 align:start position:0%
to the FY 23 adjusted authorized
um

02:08:51.709 --> 02:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:54.050 --> 02:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to you know note again
 
02:08:55.550 --> 02:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
that even though when you do that
 
02:08:57.550 --> 02:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
comparison it's showing a reduction
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh this budget does reflect the funding
 
02:09:02.870 --> 02:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
levels from the recently passed
 
02:09:05.330 --> 02:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
investment jobs act
 
02:09:06.589 --> 02:09:06.599 align:start position:0%
um and those
 
02:09:09.470 --> 02:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
um Federal funding levels
 
02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:14.810 align:start position:0%
um Federal funding levels
um

02:09:14.810 --> 02:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:16.970 --> 02:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
I had already mentioned about
 
02:09:17.990 --> 02:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
um how
 
02:09:20.390 --> 02:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
um code relief funds
 
02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:21.589 align:start position:0%
um code relief funds
um

02:09:21.589 --> 02:09:21.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:23.270 --> 02:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
have been used to supplement loss
 
02:09:25.669 --> 02:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
Highway funds so you know while our
 
02:09:28.010 --> 02:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
operating spending has been maintained
 
02:09:31.370 --> 02:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
at FY 23 levels our actual draw on the
 
02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
highway fund is an increase of about 3.1
 
02:09:37.790 --> 02:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
million a 3.1 percent
 
02:09:40.430 --> 02:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
um due to some of the supplanting of uh
 
02:09:42.770 --> 02:09:42.780 align:start position:0%
of some of those Highway funds
 
02:09:45.649 --> 02:09:45.659 align:start position:0%
if you if you're looking fund by fund
 
02:09:47.450 --> 02:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
the last bullet there talks about the
 
02:09:49.490 --> 02:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
turnpike funds which were reduced by
 
02:09:55.189 --> 02:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
about 21 in FY 20 and FY 24 and 8.7 in
 
02:09:58.430 --> 02:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
foi 25 is compared to Total authorized
 
02:10:02.510 --> 02:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
as a adjusted authorized foi 23 and this
 
02:10:04.430 --> 02:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
the the reduction in the turnpike funds
 
02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:05.570 align:start position:0%
the the reduction in the turnpike funds
is

02:10:05.570 --> 02:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:10:08.330 --> 02:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
um due to a reduction in Revenue
 
02:10:11.089 --> 02:10:11.099 align:start position:0%
um as as we continue to adjust to the
 
02:10:14.629 --> 02:10:14.639 align:start position:0%
post pandemic uh traffic patterns it's
 
02:10:17.810 --> 02:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
also it also has to do with some of the
 
02:10:19.010 --> 02:10:19.020 align:start position:0%
cash flow and some of the major
 
02:10:22.310 --> 02:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
construction projects that that um with
 
02:10:24.350 --> 02:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
that cash flow and the revenue situation
 
02:10:26.990 --> 02:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
some of those are being delayed and
 
02:10:28.669 --> 02:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
spread out a little bit longer so that
 
02:10:32.510 --> 02:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
is reflected in the budget as well
 
02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:33.229 align:start position:0%
is reflected in the budget as well
um

02:10:33.229 --> 02:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:35.209 --> 02:10:35.219 align:start position:0%
I want to be respectful of where we are
 
02:10:36.790 --> 02:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
for time so
 
02:10:36.800 --> 02:10:37.189 align:start position:0%
for time so

um
 
02:10:40.609 --> 02:10:40.619 align:start position:0%
this budget represents you know Dot's
 
02:10:42.350 --> 02:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
priorities given the target levels that
 
02:10:45.290 --> 02:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
were established which was level funding
 
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of challenges that
 
02:10:49.250 --> 02:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
I just want to talk about
 
02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
um and highlight here one of the biggest
 
02:10:53.890 --> 02:10:53.900 align:start position:0%
ones we've been facing has been the
 
02:10:56.510 --> 02:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
inflation particularly in the cost of
 
02:10:59.270 --> 02:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
Commodities and Manufacturing goods and
 
02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
they've had a big impact on on the
 
02:11:03.470 --> 02:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
department so I've got a couple of
 
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
examples there price of diesel has
 
02:11:08.209 --> 02:11:08.219 align:start position:0%
increased by about a more than 150
 
02:11:08.219 --> 02:11:09.010 align:start position:0%
increased by about a more than 150
percent

02:11:09.010 --> 02:11:09.020 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:11:12.050 --> 02:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
price of salt has increased by upwards
 
02:11:13.810 --> 02:11:13.820 align:start position:0%
of 54 percent
 
02:11:13.820 --> 02:11:14.209 align:start position:0%
of 54 percent
[Music]

02:11:14.209 --> 02:11:14.219 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:11:14.219 --> 02:11:14.990 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:11:14.990 --> 02:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:16.629 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:11:16.629 --> 02:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:11:19.669 --> 02:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
a number of those inflationary impacts
 
02:11:22.189 --> 02:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
we have reflected in our budget in the
 
02:11:24.229 --> 02:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
um additional needs and in Prime and
 
02:11:27.109 --> 02:11:27.119 align:start position:0%
primarily in the operations part of the
 
02:11:29.810 --> 02:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
of the budget so we have
 
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
um we show about 13.4 million dollars of
 
02:11:37.609 --> 02:11:37.619 align:start position:0%
additional uh needs in the operations
 
02:11:41.330 --> 02:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
budget in fy24 an additional 15 million
 
02:11:44.689 --> 02:11:44.699 align:start position:0%
additional needs in foi 25. the bulk of
 
02:11:46.609 --> 02:11:46.619 align:start position:0%
that is in Winter maintenance where we
 
02:11:48.890 --> 02:11:48.900 align:start position:0%
see you know those fuel increases and
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
those commodity and salt increases as
 
02:11:53.270 --> 02:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
well there
 
02:11:56.689 --> 02:11:56.699 align:start position:0%
we've also been impacted by supply chain
 
02:11:56.699 --> 02:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
we've also been impacted by supply chain
issues

02:11:57.680 --> 02:11:57.690 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:11:57.690 --> 02:11:59.689 align:start position:0%
issues
[Music]

02:11:59.689 --> 02:11:59.699 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
throughout and in past years
 
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
um you know we've had a lot of focus on
 
02:12:08.390 --> 02:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
on our Fleet and and sufficient funding
 
02:12:11.390 --> 02:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
to maintain the the fleet both in the
 
02:12:13.070 --> 02:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
operating budget as well as capital
 
02:12:15.229 --> 02:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
budget Appropriations
 
02:12:17.209 --> 02:12:17.219 align:start position:0%
um one of the issues we've been finding
 
02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
this year and one of the challenges is
 
02:12:21.109 --> 02:12:21.119 align:start position:0%
even though we have the budget Authority
 
02:12:23.629 --> 02:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
and we have encumbrances and purchase
 
02:12:25.970 --> 02:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
orders out there we can't get them we
 
02:12:29.270 --> 02:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
can't get them filled just with uh just
 
02:12:32.750 --> 02:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
with um the way things are in in in the
 
02:12:35.149 --> 02:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
manufacturing industry
 
02:12:36.709 --> 02:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
um so while we've had budget Authority
 
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
we've taken delivery of very few
 
02:12:41.870 --> 02:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
vehicles and pieces of equipment
 
02:12:43.910 --> 02:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
um and we've also been seeing some cost
 
02:12:46.310 --> 02:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
increases for the purchase orders that
 
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
aren't that aren't filled when we go to
 
02:12:50.030 --> 02:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
the be better you know we're seeing
 
02:12:53.089 --> 02:12:53.099 align:start position:0%
um you know 35 36 percent increases in
 
02:12:56.990 --> 02:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
in the secondary in the second um
 
02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:57.649 align:start position:0%
in the secondary in the second um
um

02:12:57.649 --> 02:12:57.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:59.870 --> 02:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
company to fulfill those purchase orders
 
02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:01.189 align:start position:0%
company to fulfill those purchase orders
so

02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:13:03.410 --> 02:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
one of the areas that we didn't want to
 
02:13:04.970 --> 02:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
just emphasize we continue to be
 
02:13:06.470 --> 02:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
concerned about the fleet and maintain
 
02:13:09.109 --> 02:13:09.119 align:start position:0%
an investment in in the fleet
 
02:13:10.790 --> 02:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
um again for the level spending in the
 
02:13:13.790 --> 02:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
budget we have set set some of the fleet
 
02:13:16.189 --> 02:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
levels but in the additional needs for
 
02:13:18.169 --> 02:13:18.179 align:start position:0%
the Mechanical Services budget we have
 
02:13:21.290 --> 02:13:21.300 align:start position:0%
identified uh 4.1 million dollars of
 
02:13:26.209 --> 02:13:26.219 align:start position:0%
needs in FY 24 and 6.7 and FY 25 you
 
02:13:29.089 --> 02:13:29.099 align:start position:0%
know primarily to keep up with our uh
 
02:13:30.589 --> 02:13:30.599 align:start position:0%
the level of investment that that's
 
02:13:35.510 --> 02:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
needed to uh maintain maintain the fleet
 
02:13:37.250 --> 02:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
I know there's been interest in the
 
02:13:39.109 --> 02:13:39.119 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates in the last bullet we
 
02:13:40.970 --> 02:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
could just pick on I want to just
 
02:13:43.550 --> 02:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
emphasize some of those numbers so
 
02:13:45.649 --> 02:13:45.659 align:start position:0%
um it has been an ongoing issue with the
 
02:13:48.109 --> 02:13:48.119 align:start position:0%
department and I think across and across
 
02:13:50.930 --> 02:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
the state and and elsewhere too as far
 
02:13:53.149 --> 02:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
as trying to meet Workforce needs so we
 
02:13:56.169 --> 02:13:56.179 align:start position:0%
currently have a vacancy rate of about
 
02:13:59.030 --> 02:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
22.7 percent
 
02:13:59.040 --> 02:13:59.930 align:start position:0%
22.7 percent
um

02:13:59.930 --> 02:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:02.450 --> 02:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
that's compared to you know in in March
 
02:14:05.390 --> 02:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
of 2020 we would historically had run
 
02:14:07.669 --> 02:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
you know between uh between an eight
 
02:14:09.890 --> 02:14:09.900 align:start position:0%
nine ten percent vacancy rate just with
 
02:14:12.050 --> 02:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
the churn of things but we've been
 
02:14:15.649 --> 02:14:15.659 align:start position:0%
seeing a historic high of about 22.7 uh
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
percent and that's currently as of the
 
02:14:21.350 --> 02:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
end of um as of the end of last week
 
02:14:24.310 --> 02:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
um but that means about 375
 
02:14:26.990 --> 02:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
373 through the exact uh vacant
 
02:14:30.530 --> 02:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
positions out of our total positions of
 
02:14:33.709 --> 02:14:33.719 align:start position:0%
about 16 150.
 
02:14:33.719 --> 02:14:35.450 align:start position:0%
about 16 150.
um

02:14:35.450 --> 02:14:35.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:38.030 --> 02:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's it's a it's a it's a
 
02:14:40.669 --> 02:14:40.679 align:start position:0%
concern this past um this past session
 
02:14:43.609 --> 02:14:43.619 align:start position:0%
this past uh um August and September
 
02:14:45.530 --> 02:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
there was um
 
02:14:47.569 --> 02:14:47.579 align:start position:0%
a winter maintenance retention policy
 
02:14:50.089 --> 02:14:50.099 align:start position:0%
and and bonus that was passed uh that
 
02:14:52.850 --> 02:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
seems to have been successful in
 
02:14:54.530 --> 02:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
retaining people
 
02:14:54.540 --> 02:14:55.609 align:start position:0%
retaining people
um

02:14:55.609 --> 02:14:55.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:58.729 --> 02:14:58.739 align:start position:0%
uh but you know exit interviews threw up
 
02:15:00.050 --> 02:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
people confirmed that you know the
 
02:15:02.270 --> 02:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
primary reason of of these uh
 
02:15:04.069 --> 02:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
separations and retirements have been
 
02:15:06.589 --> 02:15:06.599 align:start position:0%
the comparatively low wages so
 
02:15:08.149 --> 02:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
we're optimistic that through the
 
02:15:09.470 --> 02:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
bargaining that there will be a
 
02:15:11.209 --> 02:15:11.219 align:start position:0%
meaningful settlement that it will help
 
02:15:13.729 --> 02:15:13.739 align:start position:0%
stem some that time but the vacancy rate
 
02:15:16.490 --> 02:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
is is a continued concern and with that
 
02:15:18.050 --> 02:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate we have had some
 
02:15:18.060 --> 02:15:19.609 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate we have had some
productivity

02:15:19.609 --> 02:15:19.619 align:start position:0%
productivity
 
02:15:19.619 --> 02:15:20.390 align:start position:0%
productivity
um

02:15:20.390 --> 02:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:22.850 --> 02:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
uh challenges as well keeping up in with
 
02:15:26.089 --> 02:15:26.099 align:start position:0%
meeting our our Target needs and that's
 
02:15:28.010 --> 02:15:28.020 align:start position:0%
been exasperated a little bit as we've
 
02:15:32.450 --> 02:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
tried to cover life life safety needs so
 
02:15:33.890 --> 02:15:33.900 align:start position:0%
um certainly the winter maintenance we
 
02:15:35.689 --> 02:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
are pressing people from other bureaus
 
02:15:37.850 --> 02:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
uh into
 
02:15:41.030 --> 02:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
um into uh helping volunteer and
 
02:15:44.109 --> 02:15:44.119 align:start position:0%
maintain uh winter maintenance this year
 
02:15:47.030 --> 02:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
over the summer striping the lines we
 
02:15:48.470 --> 02:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
were pressing people from other
 
02:15:51.589 --> 02:15:51.599 align:start position:0%
districts into the line striping Crews
 
02:15:53.810 --> 02:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
to help keep up with those needs
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
but while they're doing that
 
02:15:57.169 --> 02:15:57.179 align:start position:0%
um they're not getting to other work
 
02:15:59.270 --> 02:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done
 
02:16:02.089 --> 02:16:02.099 align:start position:0%
um we have some facts and figures there
 
02:16:03.709 --> 02:16:03.719 align:start position:0%
you know Bridge maintenance for example
 
02:16:06.589 --> 02:16:06.599 align:start position:0%
where we had targeted to have
 
02:16:06.599 --> 02:16:07.490 align:start position:0%
where we had targeted to have
um

02:16:07.490 --> 02:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:09.770 --> 02:16:09.780 align:start position:0%
uh you know 12 bridges that they were
 
02:16:11.089 --> 02:16:11.099 align:start position:0%
going to be working on to remove from
 
02:16:12.890 --> 02:16:12.900 align:start position:0%
the Red List they were only able to get
 
02:16:14.209 --> 02:16:14.219 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
or an account the 22 that Target to
 
02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
remove Four Bridges they haven't been
 
02:16:21.890 --> 02:16:21.900 align:start position:0%
able to get to um any of them yet this
 
02:16:24.530 --> 02:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
year uh keeping up with uh some of the
 
02:16:26.270 --> 02:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
other just overall maintenance needs
 
02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
with a um with a lower Workforce
 
02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:32.209 align:start position:0%
with a um with a lower Workforce
um

02:16:32.209 --> 02:16:32.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:34.429 --> 02:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
so those are some of the challenges that
 
02:16:37.610 --> 02:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
that we're dealing with and um you know
 
02:16:39.950 --> 02:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
in the overall uh budget we've
 
02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:41.150 align:start position:0%
in the overall uh budget we've
identified

02:16:41.150 --> 02:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
identified
 
02:16:43.190 --> 02:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
um you know 20 million dollars of
 
02:16:45.709 --> 02:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
additional priority ties needs for 2024
 
02:16:49.190 --> 02:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
and 28.7 additional prioritized needs
 
02:16:52.429 --> 02:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
for fy25 primarily those are
 
02:16:54.530 --> 02:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
inflationary driven
 
02:16:58.910 --> 02:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
um driven needs in the FY 24 budget we
 
02:17:02.150 --> 02:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
did look to have some efficiencies and
 
02:17:04.669 --> 02:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
um look to address some needs with some
 
02:17:07.849 --> 02:17:07.859 align:start position:0%
positions added positions but kept the
 
02:17:10.429 --> 02:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
head count the Same by eliminating other
 
02:17:14.509 --> 02:17:14.519 align:start position:0%
positions in the additional needs uh
 
02:17:16.009 --> 02:17:16.019 align:start position:0%
with some of those efficiencies we have
 
02:17:16.019 --> 02:17:17.750 align:start position:0%
with some of those efficiencies we have
identified

02:17:17.750 --> 02:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
identified
 
02:17:19.190 --> 02:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
um I think about seven additional
 
02:17:21.950 --> 02:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
positions to help address some of those
 
02:17:25.250 --> 02:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
program areas that that need it
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
so probably about at the end of my 15
 
02:17:29.209 --> 02:17:29.219 align:start position:0%
minutes I will stop there to answer
 
02:17:32.389 --> 02:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
questions being respectful of time there
 
02:17:33.650 --> 02:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
are some other
 
02:17:33.660 --> 02:17:34.730 align:start position:0%
are some other
um

02:17:34.730 --> 02:17:34.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:37.129 --> 02:17:37.139 align:start position:0%
initiatives to improve efficiency at the
 
02:17:39.589 --> 02:17:39.599 align:start position:0%
end of our letter that that we uh that
 
02:17:42.110 --> 02:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
we emphasize but uh we'll take any
 
02:17:43.849 --> 02:17:43.859 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have okay thank
 
02:17:45.110 --> 02:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
02:17:47.750 --> 02:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
as we head into the winter probably
 
02:17:50.270 --> 02:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
uh there's not too much more importance
 
02:17:52.490 --> 02:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
in in the state than being able to
 
02:17:55.070 --> 02:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
adequately plow the roads uh I know
 
02:17:57.290 --> 02:17:57.300 align:start position:0%
that's been an emphasis of yours and you
 
02:17:59.270 --> 02:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
you did enact this program over the
 
02:18:01.429 --> 02:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
summer to to try and find more more
 
02:18:04.250 --> 02:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
drivers and you've had some success with
 
02:18:05.750 --> 02:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
that at least in retaining the drivers
 
02:18:06.730 --> 02:18:06.740 align:start position:0%
you have
 
02:18:10.849 --> 02:18:10.859 align:start position:0%
but do you is it just a matter of money
 
02:18:13.009 --> 02:18:13.019 align:start position:0%
or does
 
02:18:15.290 --> 02:18:15.300 align:start position:0%
a simple way to ask the question is does
 
02:18:16.490 --> 02:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have enough people with
 
02:18:18.589 --> 02:18:18.599 align:start position:0%
commercial driver's licenses to meet
 
02:18:21.169 --> 02:18:21.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:23.330 --> 02:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
if that's a challenging question I think
 
02:18:26.810 --> 02:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
across the country uh CDL drivers are in
 
02:18:28.549 --> 02:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
short supply we see it in the trucking
 
02:18:30.169 --> 02:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
industry and we see that in other
 
02:18:33.169 --> 02:18:33.179 align:start position:0%
Industries it's uh
 
02:18:36.290 --> 02:18:36.300 align:start position:0%
you know some of the uh auspices with
 
02:18:37.669 --> 02:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
with the
 
02:18:39.589 --> 02:18:39.599 align:start position:0%
drug testing and things like that that
 
02:18:42.650 --> 02:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
go along with the CDL certainly when
 
02:18:45.530 --> 02:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
they're comparing against uh Amazon and
 
02:18:47.629 --> 02:18:47.639 align:start position:0%
other uh trucking companies that that
 
02:18:50.990 --> 02:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
may not have the same level of of
 
02:18:53.570 --> 02:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
requirements and stuff and probably
 
02:18:55.730 --> 02:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
higher pay it becomes it becomes a
 
02:18:58.969 --> 02:18:58.979 align:start position:0%
challenge keeping keeping up with that
 
02:18:58.979 --> 02:18:59.810 align:start position:0%
challenge keeping keeping up with that
um

02:18:59.810 --> 02:18:59.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:02.750 --> 02:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
for numbers uh with the winter attention
 
02:19:04.669 --> 02:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
bonus and some of the other Outreach
 
02:19:07.669 --> 02:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
that we have done and we have about a
 
02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:11.519 align:start position:0%
hundred and roughly 180 uh vacant winter
 
02:19:13.790 --> 02:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
maintenance positions we've been able to
 
02:19:16.730 --> 02:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
fill about 85 to 90 of those through
 
02:19:18.770 --> 02:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
through volunteers from other
 
02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
um other parts of the department and
 
02:19:23.330 --> 02:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
from other agencies
 
02:19:27.290 --> 02:19:27.300 align:start position:0%
um so um and that's up so that's that's
 
02:19:29.570 --> 02:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
been successful
 
02:19:31.070 --> 02:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
um that's probably a little more than
 
02:19:33.370 --> 02:19:33.380 align:start position:0%
double than it was in previous years
 
02:19:35.750 --> 02:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
and uh you know a lot of that is
 
02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
attributed to the five thousand dollar
 
02:19:39.530 --> 02:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
retention bonus
 
02:19:42.169 --> 02:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
um we've also seen in the
 
02:19:45.530 --> 02:19:45.540 align:start position:0%
um as we track uh the vacancy rate
 
02:19:48.710 --> 02:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
um it had continued to climb the uh
 
02:19:51.050 --> 02:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
enaction of the retention bonus seems to
 
02:19:53.450 --> 02:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
have stem tied seem to have have have
 
02:19:55.910 --> 02:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
leveled off
 
02:19:55.920 --> 02:19:56.950 align:start position:0%
leveled off
um

02:19:56.950 --> 02:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:59.750 --> 02:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
where um where where you know kind of
 
02:20:01.849 --> 02:20:01.859 align:start position:0%
stem the bleeding so
 
02:20:01.859 --> 02:20:02.870 align:start position:0%
stem the bleeding so
um

02:20:02.870 --> 02:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:06.530 --> 02:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
I I I I I I take that as an indication
 
02:20:10.010 --> 02:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
that uh yes compensation
 
02:20:10.020 --> 02:20:10.790 align:start position:0%
that uh yes compensation
um

02:20:10.790 --> 02:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:13.370 --> 02:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
could be a big help in in filling those
 
02:20:16.250 --> 02:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
positions uh and and maintaining that we
 
02:20:19.190 --> 02:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
certainly are con competing with other
 
02:20:22.190 --> 02:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
um municipalities primarily and and that
 
02:20:23.690 --> 02:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
type of work
 
02:20:23.700 --> 02:20:24.469 align:start position:0%
type of work
um

02:20:24.469 --> 02:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:27.770 --> 02:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
but I'm optimistic that that would help
 
02:20:30.590 --> 02:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
fill out those I I
 
02:20:32.870 --> 02:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
but with the caveat that that CDL
 
02:20:34.730 --> 02:20:34.740 align:start position:0%
drivers are in short supply and it is
 
02:20:38.990 --> 02:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:41.750 --> 02:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the fleet and if you could
 
02:20:43.610 --> 02:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
just maybe enlighten me on a little bit
 
02:20:46.910 --> 02:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
how difficult it is to actually acquire
 
02:20:49.309 --> 02:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
Vehicles now what's sort of the backlog
 
02:20:52.969 --> 02:20:52.979 align:start position:0%
we've heard from uh Transportation uh
 
02:20:56.270 --> 02:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
not from from safety about their
 
02:20:58.969 --> 02:20:58.979 align:start position:0%
vehicles and how long they take
 
02:21:01.550 --> 02:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
for your department
 
02:21:04.070 --> 02:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
what's the backlog now in some of the
 
02:21:06.830 --> 02:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
vehicles that you use
 
02:21:08.809 --> 02:21:08.819 align:start position:0%
um most of our purchases most of the
 
02:21:11.090 --> 02:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
purchases in FY 22
 
02:21:12.770 --> 02:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
um I could I could pull out some some
 
02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
numbers I have but we've had very very
 
02:21:18.710 --> 02:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
few of the purchase orders fulfilled the
 
02:21:20.030 --> 02:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
number of them have been canceled
 
02:21:23.630 --> 02:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
because the um because the um
 
02:21:26.090 --> 02:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
because the manufacturing industry can't
 
02:21:27.830 --> 02:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
can't keep up
 
02:21:30.230 --> 02:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
um Andre I say you have some of the
 
02:21:31.610 --> 02:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
numbers there do you wanna
 
02:21:33.770 --> 02:21:33.780 align:start position:0%
also so
 
02:21:33.780 --> 02:21:36.670 align:start position:0%
also so
um

02:21:36.670 --> 02:21:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:39.469 --> 02:21:39.479 align:start position:0%
uh just for an example
 
02:21:41.630 --> 02:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
um as part of our capital budget
 
02:21:43.849 --> 02:21:43.859 align:start position:0%
appropriation and FY 2223 we had
 
02:21:46.130 --> 02:21:46.140 align:start position:0%
identified a quantity of about 42
 
02:21:50.510 --> 02:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
six-wheelers trucks um to to purchase
 
02:21:53.630 --> 02:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
um to date we've had 15 delivered
 
02:21:57.349 --> 02:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
um 27 are are outstanding
 
02:21:57.359 --> 02:21:58.370 align:start position:0%
um 27 are are outstanding
um

02:21:58.370 --> 02:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:03.410 --> 02:22:03.420 align:start position:0%
of the um of the and and
 
02:22:06.349 --> 02:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
the numbers are are pretty poor looking
 
02:22:08.690 --> 02:22:08.700 align:start position:0%
down down the line
 
02:22:11.330 --> 02:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
um you know we had uh identified two 10
 
02:22:14.929 --> 02:22:14.939 align:start position:0%
wheelers for um per purchase we've had
 
02:22:17.570 --> 02:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
one delivered one is outstanding we've
 
02:22:19.969 --> 02:22:19.979 align:start position:0%
had 38 three-quarter ton pickup trucks
 
02:22:21.650 --> 02:22:21.660 align:start position:0%
which are our
 
02:22:25.010 --> 02:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
Highway Patrol form and and um
 
02:22:27.050 --> 02:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
construction form in the winter
 
02:22:28.849 --> 02:22:28.859 align:start position:0%
Maintenance Night Riders they go out
 
02:22:31.309 --> 02:22:31.319 align:start position:0%
there and uh you know we had 38
 
02:22:33.469 --> 02:22:33.479 align:start position:0%
identified for purchase and 38 of them
 
02:22:35.809 --> 02:22:35.819 align:start position:0%
are still out outstanding I did see an
 
02:22:39.050 --> 02:22:39.060 align:start position:0%
email that had come by uh recently that
 
02:22:39.060 --> 02:22:40.010 align:start position:0%
email that had come by uh recently that
um

02:22:40.010 --> 02:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:41.990 --> 02:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know reported that uh I know
 
02:22:43.670 --> 02:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and they had they
 
02:22:46.190 --> 02:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
did have uh through the state contract
 
02:22:49.490 --> 02:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
they were able to get a delivery of of
 
02:22:49.500 --> 02:22:50.090 align:start position:0%
they were able to get a delivery of of
um

02:22:50.090 --> 02:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:52.250 --> 02:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
a number of the Dodge charges the number
 
02:22:56.030 --> 02:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
of the police vehicles but uh some of
 
02:23:01.010 --> 02:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:03.290 --> 02:23:03.300 align:start position:0%
heavy trucks and other other vehicles
 
02:23:07.790 --> 02:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
are are delayed in the purchasing
 
02:23:10.550 --> 02:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
and from what I saw it was it was a very
 
02:23:10.560 --> 02:23:12.469 align:start position:0%
and from what I saw it was it was a very
indeterminate

02:23:12.469 --> 02:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
indeterminate
 
02:23:12.479 --> 02:23:13.070 align:start position:0%
indeterminate
um

02:23:13.070 --> 02:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:14.690 --> 02:23:14.700 align:start position:0%
report of
 
02:23:16.490 --> 02:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
when or if
 
02:23:18.889 --> 02:23:18.899 align:start position:0%
they would be able to uh fill those
 
02:23:21.050 --> 02:23:21.060 align:start position:0%
purchase orders
 
02:23:24.110 --> 02:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
and for your estimates for costs for
 
02:23:26.570 --> 02:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
such as fuel and salt that you mentioned
 
02:23:29.150 --> 02:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
do you assume that they stay at current
 
02:23:31.130 --> 02:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
levels or go down a little bit or go up
 
02:23:33.170 --> 02:23:33.180 align:start position:0%
what were your assumptions for for your
 
02:23:35.570 --> 02:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
costs our assumptions were based on uh
 
02:23:37.790 --> 02:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
what we were seeing for bids
 
02:23:40.190 --> 02:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
um most recently so when we're comparing
 
02:23:41.929 --> 02:23:41.939 align:start position:0%
those costs we're talking about the 54
 
02:23:44.690 --> 02:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
increase of the of the diesel uh cost
 
02:23:44.700 --> 02:23:46.309 align:start position:0%
increase of the of the diesel uh cost
increase

02:23:46.309 --> 02:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
increase
 
02:23:48.710 --> 02:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
um we're using looking at what we are
 
02:23:51.170 --> 02:23:51.180 align:start position:0%
seeing for uh the current bids as
 
02:23:53.990 --> 02:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
composed as as compared to what the bids
 
02:23:57.290 --> 02:23:57.300 align:start position:0%
were in the in the last um pre-progenic
 
02:23:58.550 --> 02:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
pre-budget yeah
 
02:24:02.030 --> 02:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:05.030 --> 02:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
hi I had a couple of questions
 
02:24:05.040 --> 02:24:07.370 align:start position:0%
hi I had a couple of questions
um

02:24:07.370 --> 02:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:09.349 --> 02:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
trucks vehicles
 
02:24:09.359 --> 02:24:10.370 align:start position:0%
trucks vehicles
um

02:24:10.370 --> 02:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:13.190 --> 02:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
are any of your vehicles would they be
 
02:24:15.290 --> 02:24:15.300 align:start position:0%
eligible to use VW settlement money and
 
02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
is any of that money being used for DOT
 
02:24:21.290 --> 02:24:21.300 align:start position:0%
it has in the past
 
02:24:22.849 --> 02:24:22.859 align:start position:0%
um you were one of the first and I
 
02:24:24.590 --> 02:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
forget the numbers but we were we were
 
02:24:27.469 --> 02:24:27.479 align:start position:0%
when when the VW settlement
 
02:24:30.170 --> 02:24:30.180 align:start position:0%
um monies first came up I know we were
 
02:24:30.180 --> 02:24:31.010 align:start position:0%
um monies first came up I know we were
um

02:24:31.010 --> 02:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:33.110 --> 02:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
probably a little pushy and trying to
 
02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:34.070 align:start position:0%
probably a little pushy and trying to
get

02:24:34.070 --> 02:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
get
 
02:24:36.830 --> 02:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
um get some of those those funds so uh
 
02:24:38.630 --> 02:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
we're very successful in the first part
 
02:24:39.650 --> 02:24:39.660 align:start position:0%
of that
 
02:24:39.660 --> 02:24:40.389 align:start position:0%
of that
um

02:24:40.389 --> 02:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:43.910 --> 02:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
the requirements associated with that
 
02:24:48.349 --> 02:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the age and the um
 
02:24:51.889 --> 02:24:51.899 align:start position:0%
type of motors and and the air quality
 
02:24:54.290 --> 02:24:54.300 align:start position:0%
benefits that come from taking those off
 
02:24:56.389 --> 02:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
the off the road
 
02:24:59.210 --> 02:24:59.220 align:start position:0%
um we have taken we have addressed most
 
02:25:01.130 --> 02:25:01.140 align:start position:0%
of those older
 
02:25:04.849 --> 02:25:04.859 align:start position:0%
um vehicles in the fleet so that one of
 
02:25:06.770 --> 02:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
the things is we've looked at the
 
02:25:10.910 --> 02:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
remaining VW funds are Vehicles
 
02:25:13.190 --> 02:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
currently in the fleet
 
02:25:15.190 --> 02:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
don't you know they're they're
 
02:25:17.450 --> 02:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
relatively newer they're within 10 11
 
02:25:19.969 --> 02:25:19.979 align:start position:0%
years so they don't necessarily have the
 
02:25:19.979 --> 02:25:20.750 align:start position:0%
years so they don't necessarily have the
same

02:25:20.750 --> 02:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
same
 
02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:22.250 align:start position:0%
same
um

02:25:22.250 --> 02:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:25.910 --> 02:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
impact uh in in terms of qualifying for
 
02:25:28.070 --> 02:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
the air quality benefits and qualifying
 
02:25:30.830 --> 02:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
for the remaining VW funds
 
02:25:33.050 --> 02:25:33.060 align:start position:0%
and that's a sounds like a poorly
 
02:25:35.690 --> 02:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
written settlement to me I've seen some
 
02:25:36.889 --> 02:25:36.899 align:start position:0%
of your trucks and they ought to be
 
02:25:36.899 --> 02:25:38.630 align:start position:0%
of your trucks and they ought to be
eligible

02:25:38.630 --> 02:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:40.190 align:start position:0%
eligible
um

02:25:40.190 --> 02:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:42.710 --> 02:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
my next question Red List Bridges
 
02:25:44.030 --> 02:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
um we talked about how many we did or
 
02:25:46.010 --> 02:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
didn't get to this year what from a
 
02:25:49.389 --> 02:25:49.399 align:start position:0%
status standpoint how many uh
 
02:25:51.770 --> 02:25:51.780 align:start position:0%
what's been happening to the Red List
 
02:25:54.530 --> 02:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
over the last couple years
 
02:25:56.570 --> 02:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
my company are on it only I wanted two
 
02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
years ago yep
 
02:26:00.290 --> 02:26:00.300 align:start position:0%
um and they went on it how many came off
 
02:26:02.150 --> 02:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
so on the positive side on the
 
02:26:03.770 --> 02:26:03.780 align:start position:0%
construction program there has been an
 
02:26:05.870 --> 02:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
influx of federal funds um there's been
 
02:26:07.849 --> 02:26:07.859 align:start position:0%
a lot of attention on on bridge funds
 
02:26:10.790 --> 02:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
we've we have um through the iija had
 
02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:12.710 align:start position:0%
we've we have um through the iija had
received

02:26:12.710 --> 02:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
received
 
02:26:14.630 --> 02:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
um I think it was uh you know an
 
02:26:17.210 --> 02:26:17.220 align:start position:0%
additional 45 million dollars
 
02:26:19.730 --> 02:26:19.740 align:start position:0%
um a year for five years which we've put
 
02:26:21.950 --> 02:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
towards uh Bridge preservation and
 
02:26:25.550 --> 02:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
redless bridges so while uh you know but
 
02:26:27.230 --> 02:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
so the numbers I quoted were
 
02:26:28.730 --> 02:26:28.740 align:start position:0%
particularly Bridge maintenance and
 
02:26:30.650 --> 02:26:30.660 align:start position:0%
those are the smaller Bridges typically
 
02:26:32.330 --> 02:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
the bridges that aren't federal aid
 
02:26:32.340 --> 02:26:34.010 align:start position:0%
the bridges that aren't federal aid
eligible

02:26:34.010 --> 02:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
02:26:36.230 --> 02:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
um and we rely on bridge maintenance to
 
02:26:38.270 --> 02:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
you know work on those
 
02:26:40.370 --> 02:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
um you know and keep them either take
 
02:26:43.190 --> 02:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
them off the red list or keep or or keep
 
02:26:45.530 --> 02:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
them from coming on is that a size issue
 
02:26:47.690 --> 02:26:47.700 align:start position:0%
or a kind of Road issue it's generally a
 
02:26:49.010 --> 02:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
size issue
 
02:26:50.870 --> 02:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
um there wouldn't be you know the bridge
 
02:26:52.730 --> 02:26:52.740 align:start position:0%
maintenance the ones that we do with our
 
02:26:56.450 --> 02:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
own forces are not the larger Interstate
 
02:26:59.270 --> 02:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
Bridges they will do they will do joints
 
02:27:01.550 --> 02:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
or um
 
02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:02.450 align:start position:0%
or um
um

02:27:02.450 --> 02:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:06.050 --> 02:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
are are approach rail
 
02:27:08.590 --> 02:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
um patches and repairs things like that
 
02:27:10.670 --> 02:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
one of the bigger projects that bridge
 
02:27:12.170 --> 02:27:12.180 align:start position:0%
maintenance had done this year was a
 
02:27:14.570 --> 02:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
bridge on Route 2029 they did a deck
 
02:27:18.230 --> 02:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
replacement over the isenglass river in
 
02:27:20.150 --> 02:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
um I think it's Barnstead but it's that
 
02:27:23.210 --> 02:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
section of 2029 between
 
02:27:26.750 --> 02:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
um like Northwood and Rochester so
 
02:27:29.389 --> 02:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
um and that was that was probably the
 
02:27:33.710 --> 02:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
the you know full deck replacement is
 
02:27:35.389 --> 02:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
um you know probably a larger size
 
02:27:37.550 --> 02:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
project for them primarily because of
 
02:27:40.190 --> 02:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
the time that it takes so you know uh
 
02:27:42.230 --> 02:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
these these crews are are going about
 
02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of little repairs on a on a
 
02:27:47.510 --> 02:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
lot of bridges and washing them and
 
02:27:50.929 --> 02:27:50.939 align:start position:0%
keeping them up to take a crew and in
 
02:27:52.969 --> 02:27:52.979 align:start position:0%
particularly with the vacancy rate it's
 
02:27:55.550 --> 02:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
probably in a a conglomeration of of
 
02:27:57.950 --> 02:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
several Crews and putting them on a
 
02:27:59.929 --> 02:27:59.939 align:start position:0%
project that takes
 
02:28:03.290 --> 02:28:03.300 align:start position:0%
um six eight weeks there's a lot of
 
02:28:05.690 --> 02:28:05.700 align:start position:0%
other little Bridge work that they won't
 
02:28:09.170 --> 02:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
get to to do that I didn't I I strayed a
 
02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
little from here from your from your
 
02:28:12.349 --> 02:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
first question the overall red list
 
02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
because of the federal funds and because
 
02:28:16.370 --> 02:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
of I think the success of our program is
 
02:28:20.690 --> 02:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
is down currently it's a mop-off
 
02:28:20.700 --> 02:28:23.150 align:start position:0%
is down currently it's a mop-off
membership

02:28:23.150 --> 02:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:25.670 --> 02:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if it's in here I I know
 
02:28:27.410 --> 02:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
last year when we were out talking about
 
02:28:29.150 --> 02:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan I had those numbers
 
02:28:31.190 --> 02:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
right on the tip of my python but I
 
02:28:33.410 --> 02:28:33.420 align:start position:0%
think the current Red List is about 118
 
02:28:37.490 --> 02:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
and it is and it is and it is down
 
02:28:39.469 --> 02:28:39.479 align:start position:0%
um it is down from
 
02:28:41.870 --> 02:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
um a hundred and some odd and is that
 
02:28:43.969 --> 02:28:43.979 align:start position:0%
that state and Municipal combined no
 
02:28:45.830 --> 02:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
that is just State red list and is
 
02:28:48.650 --> 02:28:48.660 align:start position:0%
Municipal keeping up or going Municipal
 
02:28:51.050 --> 02:28:51.060 align:start position:0%
has historically been
 
02:28:53.809 --> 02:28:53.819 align:start position:0%
um running a little higher uh typical
 
02:28:55.910 --> 02:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
well quite a bit higher I I think and
 
02:28:57.530 --> 02:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
I'm and I can get you the actual numbers
 
02:29:00.110 --> 02:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
but I think it was in the 200 uh some
 
02:29:04.130 --> 02:29:04.140 align:start position:0%
odd range but again with the um
 
02:29:06.889 --> 02:29:06.899 align:start position:0%
with the iija and some of the additional
 
02:29:09.170 --> 02:29:09.180 align:start position:0%
federal funds through the 10-year plan
 
02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
last time we had flexed a lot of federal
 
02:29:11.520 --> 02:29:13.130 align:start position:0%
last time we had flexed a lot of federal
funds

02:29:13.130 --> 02:29:13.140 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:29:16.370 --> 02:29:16.380 align:start position:0%
um 15 of that 45 million dollars we had
 
02:29:19.070 --> 02:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
flexed or or targeted for what we call
 
02:29:22.309 --> 02:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
off system Bridges which are essentially
 
02:29:24.530 --> 02:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
the municipal Bridges
 
02:29:27.410 --> 02:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
um it's close to doubling the
 
02:29:29.330 --> 02:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
um the state funded state aid bridge
 
02:29:29.340 --> 02:29:30.590 align:start position:0%
um the state funded state aid bridge
program

02:29:30.590 --> 02:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:31.670 align:start position:0%
program
um

02:29:31.670 --> 02:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:34.849 --> 02:29:34.859 align:start position:0%
so doing a lot of effort to bring those
 
02:29:34.859 --> 02:29:36.230 align:start position:0%
so doing a lot of effort to bring those
um

02:29:36.230 --> 02:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:39.230 --> 02:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
um Municipal red list is down in the
 
02:29:40.790 --> 02:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
10-year plan last time just for instance
 
02:29:42.170 --> 02:29:42.180 align:start position:0%
we had
 
02:29:42.180 --> 02:29:42.889 align:start position:0%
we had
um

02:29:42.889 --> 02:29:42.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:45.410 --> 02:29:45.420 align:start position:0%
fully programmed 10-year plan so the
 
02:29:48.050 --> 02:29:48.060 align:start position:0%
municipal Bridges at you know seven and
 
02:29:49.670 --> 02:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
a half million dollars per year which
 
02:29:52.670 --> 02:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
did about three or four per year was
 
02:29:54.349 --> 02:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
programmed out
 
02:29:57.410 --> 02:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
um for for 10 years with the additional
 
02:30:00.050 --> 02:30:00.060 align:start position:0%
federal funds we were able to accelerate
 
02:30:01.730 --> 02:30:01.740 align:start position:0%
all of those and get done what had been
 
02:30:04.070 --> 02:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
previously programmed over 10 years in
 
02:30:06.889 --> 02:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
about five years leaving room
 
02:30:09.230 --> 02:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
to program more more bridges and we'll
 
02:30:10.490 --> 02:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
be going through that for the next
 
02:30:13.490 --> 02:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
10-year Plan update so
 
02:30:16.070 --> 02:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
um well um that's great and the
 
02:30:18.650 --> 02:30:18.660 align:start position:0%
am I right in terms of what we send to
 
02:30:20.870 --> 02:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
cities and towns there's apportionment
 
02:30:23.150 --> 02:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
Aid and municip Bridge Aid I think are
 
02:30:25.190 --> 02:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
the two biggest selling programs right
 
02:30:27.770 --> 02:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
right and how big are they they're both
 
02:30:30.290 --> 02:30:30.300 align:start position:0%
flattish but they're both flattest
 
02:30:32.450 --> 02:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
typically uh one of them 30 million
 
02:30:34.790 --> 02:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
dollars maybe it's around 30 wow and
 
02:30:39.349 --> 02:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
with the sp3 fortune of SB 367 also goes
 
02:30:40.849 --> 02:30:40.859 align:start position:0%
toward that so it's roughly I think
 
02:30:43.910 --> 02:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
around 34 million dollars a long Grant
 
02:30:45.849 --> 02:30:45.859 align:start position:0%
date that goes to city and towns
 
02:30:48.530 --> 02:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
and annually
 
02:30:48.540 --> 02:30:49.070 align:start position:0%
and annually
um

02:30:49.070 --> 02:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:52.360 --> 02:30:52.370 align:start position:0%
the state aid bridge program is about
 
02:30:52.370 --> 02:30:52.790 align:start position:0%
the state aid bridge program is about
[Music]

02:30:52.790 --> 02:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:30:52.800 --> 02:30:55.849 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:30:55.849 --> 02:30:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:58.130 --> 02:30:58.140 align:start position:0%
it's about it's about seven and a half
 
02:30:59.630 --> 02:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:31:01.550 --> 02:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
um and as I said with the federal funds
 
02:31:03.410 --> 02:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
we're looking at kind of doubling that
 
02:31:06.469 --> 02:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
in the ensuing use my last question is
 
02:31:10.250 --> 02:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
about Paving I have interest in Paving
 
02:31:12.590 --> 02:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
um I don't know why but I do
 
02:31:14.870 --> 02:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
um it feels like something that gets
 
02:31:16.250 --> 02:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
left behind and it seems like we ought
 
02:31:18.230 --> 02:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
to take care of the roads we have I know
 
02:31:21.530 --> 02:31:21.540 align:start position:0%
there are National statistics on that um
 
02:31:23.389 --> 02:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
presumably provide on
 
02:31:25.670 --> 02:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
you know good bad medium or whatever
 
02:31:29.510 --> 02:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
whatever the standards are and I want to
 
02:31:31.550 --> 02:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
say to keep up we should be Paving
 
02:31:34.190 --> 02:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
something like 500 miles a year right do
 
02:31:36.349 --> 02:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
we what do we have about 5 000 miles of
 
02:31:40.490 --> 02:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
Road yes ish yep about 4 600 miles okay
 
02:31:42.410 --> 02:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
State maintain garage let's call that
 
02:31:46.130 --> 02:31:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:47.809 --> 02:31:47.819 align:start position:0%
um do we keep up or are we following
 
02:31:47.819 --> 02:31:48.889 align:start position:0%
um do we keep up or are we following
behind

02:31:48.889 --> 02:31:48.899 align:start position:0%
behind
 
02:31:51.230 --> 02:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
what about overall quality yep overall
 
02:31:52.790 --> 02:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
quality we have been we have been
 
02:31:56.590 --> 02:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
keeping up um in 2014
 
02:31:59.510 --> 02:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
particularly with the passage of SB 367
 
02:32:03.530 --> 02:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
and the 4.2 gas tax that was
 
02:32:06.889 --> 02:32:06.899 align:start position:0%
um kind of pledged towards um rural
 
02:32:09.170 --> 02:32:09.180 align:start position:0%
um Paving and bridges
 
02:32:13.370 --> 02:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
um we have been able to uh really meet
 
02:32:15.469 --> 02:32:15.479 align:start position:0%
all of our Paving targets and meet all
 
02:32:17.570 --> 02:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
of our condition targets for for the
 
02:32:21.770 --> 02:32:21.780 align:start position:0%
paving system I think in the past years
 
02:32:24.889 --> 02:32:24.899 align:start position:0%
we you know I think we are we've kept
 
02:32:28.550 --> 02:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
the paving industry very very very busy
 
02:32:30.770 --> 02:32:30.780 align:start position:0%
um it's been a priority to keep up with
 
02:32:30.780 --> 02:32:31.870 align:start position:0%
um it's been a priority to keep up with
that

02:32:31.870 --> 02:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:32:35.090 --> 02:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
and and overcome some of the past
 
02:32:37.429 --> 02:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance so
 
02:32:39.830 --> 02:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
currently it's good and this is probably
 
02:32:41.690 --> 02:32:41.700 align:start position:0%
again more of a 10-year plan discussion
 
02:32:44.510 --> 02:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
we're fast approaching just for
 
02:32:46.610 --> 02:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
um your edification
 
02:32:50.090 --> 02:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
in 2025 the
 
02:32:53.809 --> 02:32:53.819 align:start position:0%
um that additional 4.2 cents of the gas
 
02:32:57.830 --> 02:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
tax goes to paying paying The Debt
 
02:32:59.450 --> 02:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
Service on the Tiffy alone that
 
02:33:01.969 --> 02:33:01.979 align:start position:0%
completed 93. so about 20 million
 
02:33:03.290 --> 02:33:03.300 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
02:33:09.410 --> 02:33:09.420 align:start position:0%
that since 2014 has gone to Paving roads
 
02:33:12.110 --> 02:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
and addressing some of the
 
02:33:15.770 --> 02:33:15.780 align:start position:0%
um again those auth system or rural
 
02:33:18.290 --> 02:33:18.300 align:start position:0%
loitier roads
 
02:33:20.870 --> 02:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
um at the 2025 that 20 million dollars
 
02:33:22.790 --> 02:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
is is is
 
02:33:24.469 --> 02:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
it's not going away it's going toward
 
02:33:26.270 --> 02:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
paying the debt surface on the tippy
 
02:33:29.510 --> 02:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
alone so it will be it you know our
 
02:33:31.490 --> 02:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
predictions are that we won't be keeping
 
02:33:34.010 --> 02:33:34.020 align:start position:0%
up to the level that we have since 2014
 
02:33:35.809 --> 02:33:35.819 align:start position:0%
because of that that's one of the
 
02:33:37.610 --> 02:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
reasons I ask is I know I knew that
 
02:33:39.410 --> 02:33:39.420 align:start position:0%
Tiffy and I on the tip of my tongue I
 
02:33:41.990 --> 02:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't remember the word tiffia yeah
 
02:33:44.929 --> 02:33:44.939 align:start position:0%
um but um I knew that eventually we ran
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
out in 2025 right and so
 
02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:50.210 align:start position:0%
out in 2025 right and so
um

02:33:50.210 --> 02:33:50.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:52.550 --> 02:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
that just immediately places a hole in
 
02:33:55.550 --> 02:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
what so the level of Paving we're doing
 
02:33:58.429 --> 02:33:58.439 align:start position:0%
today keeps up
 
02:34:00.530 --> 02:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
that is to say we we keep the condition
 
02:34:02.570 --> 02:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
current it doesn't get
 
02:34:05.270 --> 02:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't get worse we repair and 20
 
02:34:06.889 --> 02:34:06.899 align:start position:0%
million is going to go away so it will
 
02:34:08.750 --> 02:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
start getting it's not getting worse
 
02:34:11.270 --> 02:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
without declining if with with the
 
02:34:12.889 --> 02:34:12.899 align:start position:0%
caveat that if there isn't you know
 
02:34:14.510 --> 02:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
through the tenure plan process or other
 
02:34:16.969 --> 02:34:16.979 align:start position:0%
things some
 
02:34:19.309 --> 02:34:19.319 align:start position:0%
um some way to address that
 
02:34:25.130 --> 02:34:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:26.630 --> 02:34:26.640 align:start position:0%
and I know that we're a little bit over
 
02:34:28.370 --> 02:34:28.380 align:start position:0%
time so I'll try to ask a question yeah
 
02:34:30.650 --> 02:34:30.660 align:start position:0%
I'm apologizing yeah
 
02:34:33.170 --> 02:34:33.180 align:start position:0%
um I know in recent budget Cycles in
 
02:34:35.570 --> 02:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 House Bill 4 there's been
 
02:34:37.370 --> 02:34:37.380 align:start position:0%
an infusion of some general funds
 
02:34:40.130 --> 02:34:40.140 align:start position:0%
directly to Highway fund yes and I is in
 
02:34:42.650 --> 02:34:42.660 align:start position:0%
this budget um do you have any proposals
 
02:34:44.330 --> 02:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
or requests for a draw against the
 
02:34:45.650 --> 02:34:45.660 align:start position:0%
general fund either towards the highway
 
02:34:48.650 --> 02:34:48.660 align:start position:0%
fund or Turnpike funds
 
02:34:50.210 --> 02:34:50.220 align:start position:0%
can you repeat the question do we have
 
02:34:51.950 --> 02:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
any assumptions or yeah is there
 
02:34:53.450 --> 02:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
anything that's that you're proposing
 
02:34:55.250 --> 02:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
that you there's a need for General
 
02:34:57.170 --> 02:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
funds to be infused directly to the
 
02:34:59.690 --> 02:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
highway fund or the turnpike fund
 
02:35:03.290 --> 02:35:03.300 align:start position:0%
um in this 24-25 budget cycle
 
02:35:06.710 --> 02:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
no no there isn't but you you made
 
02:35:08.150 --> 02:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
reference to
 
02:35:09.950 --> 02:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
um in the past there's been fire
 
02:35:11.510 --> 02:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
infusion so at the end of the last
 
02:35:13.490 --> 02:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
budget cycle
 
02:35:14.809 --> 02:35:14.819 align:start position:0%
um there was 50 million dollars of
 
02:35:16.429 --> 02:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
General funds put into the highway
 
02:35:18.650 --> 02:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
funding which is kind of carrying us
 
02:35:20.870 --> 02:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
through this this biennium so very
 
02:35:23.450 --> 02:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
appreciative of that that was very it
 
02:35:25.969 --> 02:35:25.979 align:start position:0%
was a lot of foresight in in in in doing
 
02:35:25.979 --> 02:35:27.410 align:start position:0%
was a lot of foresight in in in in doing
that

02:35:27.410 --> 02:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:35:27.420 --> 02:35:28.610 align:start position:0%
that
um

02:35:28.610 --> 02:35:28.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:31.429 --> 02:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
one of the issues I didn't I didn't
 
02:35:33.830 --> 02:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
touch on but it is a long-term con
 
02:35:36.969 --> 02:35:36.979 align:start position:0%
concern is the um
 
02:35:39.469 --> 02:35:39.479 align:start position:0%
incremental slow erosion of the highway
 
02:35:43.010 --> 02:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
fund as as electric vehicles you know
 
02:35:44.790 --> 02:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
become more prevalent as
 
02:35:44.800 --> 02:35:45.290 align:start position:0%
become more prevalent as
[Music]

02:35:45.290 --> 02:35:45.300 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:35:45.300 --> 02:35:46.730 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:35:46.730 --> 02:35:46.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:49.490 --> 02:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
fuel efficiency goes up
 
02:35:49.500 --> 02:35:50.450 align:start position:0%
fuel efficiency goes up
um

02:35:50.450 --> 02:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:52.250 --> 02:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
some of the lasting impacts from
 
02:35:53.809 --> 02:35:53.819 align:start position:0%
commutative patterns from from the
 
02:35:57.309 --> 02:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
pandemic all of those do do impact
 
02:36:00.110 --> 02:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
revenues into both both the turnpike
 
02:36:02.809 --> 02:36:02.819 align:start position:0%
system and the highway fund
 
02:36:02.819 --> 02:36:03.590 align:start position:0%
system and the highway fund
um

02:36:03.590 --> 02:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:06.110 --> 02:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
so but so it is a long-term issue to
 
02:36:08.330 --> 02:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
watch and be aware of but as of now no
 
02:36:08.340 --> 02:36:09.710 align:start position:0%
watch and be aware of but as of now no
proposals

02:36:09.710 --> 02:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
proposals
 
02:36:11.450 --> 02:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
um for for example a house platoon
 
02:36:13.429 --> 02:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
proposal for any
 
02:36:15.469 --> 02:36:15.479 align:start position:0%
five million 50 million General funds or
 
02:36:17.450 --> 02:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
anything like that for us not in this
 
02:36:21.110 --> 02:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
budget all right thank you so far yeah
 
02:36:22.790 --> 02:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:36:31.070 --> 02:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:32.870 --> 02:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
like to invite the treasury Department
 
02:36:48.170 --> 02:36:48.180 align:start position:0%

02:37:35.210 --> 02:37:35.220 align:start position:0%
good morning um Monica say treasure
 
02:37:37.070 --> 02:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
um so I'm here to provide an overview of
 
02:37:40.670 --> 02:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
treasurer's budget and
 
02:37:42.650 --> 02:37:42.660 align:start position:0%
I will follow that
 
02:37:42.660 --> 02:37:43.910 align:start position:0%
I will follow that
um

02:37:43.910 --> 02:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:55.130 --> 02:37:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:59.150 --> 02:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
and so I will start with um
 
02:38:02.809 --> 02:38:02.819 align:start position:0%
our budget includes several components
 
02:38:06.530 --> 02:38:06.540 align:start position:0%
of state government so the core treasury
 
02:38:09.170 --> 02:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
operations included abandoned properties
 
02:38:12.349 --> 02:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
about two percent of our total budget so
 
02:38:14.510 --> 02:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
we we have other
 
02:38:17.150 --> 02:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
um pieces that we are responsible for as
 
02:38:19.309 --> 02:38:19.319 align:start position:0%
part of our operations
 
02:38:21.770 --> 02:38:21.780 align:start position:0%
um so um one of the um
 
02:38:25.010 --> 02:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
so I would like to highlight some of the
 
02:38:25.020 --> 02:38:26.330 align:start position:0%
so I would like to highlight some of the
um

02:38:26.330 --> 02:38:26.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:29.270 --> 02:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
components of this budget so I'll start
 
02:38:29.280 --> 02:38:30.410 align:start position:0%
components of this budget so I'll start
with

02:38:30.410 --> 02:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:38:32.690 --> 02:38:32.700 align:start position:0%
um in the beginning of this uh this year
 
02:38:35.929 --> 02:38:35.939 align:start position:0%
we made a three-year strategic plan and
 
02:38:37.969 --> 02:38:37.979 align:start position:0%
as part of that
 
02:38:40.130 --> 02:38:40.140 align:start position:0%
um the work that we did we test
 
02:38:43.250 --> 02:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
ourselves with review and certain areas
 
02:38:46.790 --> 02:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
of a certain functions of the treasury
 
02:38:50.990 --> 02:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
and from that work we um we recognized
 
02:38:54.830 --> 02:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to make a focus on on
 
02:38:57.170 --> 02:38:57.180 align:start position:0%
making a couple of changes uh we're
 
02:38:59.110 --> 02:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
including in this budget
 
02:39:02.050 --> 02:39:02.060 align:start position:0%
so when we were doing that work we were
 
02:39:05.990 --> 02:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
focusing on the tissue subjectives and
 
02:39:08.030 --> 02:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
treasures Mission
 
02:39:08.040 --> 02:39:08.929 align:start position:0%
treasures Mission
um

02:39:08.929 --> 02:39:08.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:11.210 --> 02:39:11.220 align:start position:0%
but keeping succession planning in mind
 
02:39:14.809 --> 02:39:14.819 align:start position:0%
so one of the um so I'll start with the
 
02:39:17.510 --> 02:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
structure of the the treasury we
 
02:39:20.090 --> 02:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
currently have uh 23
 
02:39:24.309 --> 02:39:24.319 align:start position:0%
um authorized positions and what we are
 
02:39:27.710 --> 02:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
proposing as part of this but it is also
 
02:39:31.070 --> 02:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
to uh create and this budget the office
 
02:39:33.770 --> 02:39:33.780 align:start position:0%
of investment and debt management so
 
02:39:33.780 --> 02:39:36.050 align:start position:0%
of investment and debt management so
previously

02:39:36.050 --> 02:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
previously
 
02:39:37.849 --> 02:39:37.859 align:start position:0%
um this function of investment that
 
02:39:39.650 --> 02:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
management was included in the treasury
 
02:39:43.070 --> 02:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
operations accounting unit and now we uh
 
02:39:45.610 --> 02:39:45.620 align:start position:0%
with this work that we did we are
 
02:39:49.309 --> 02:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
recognizing there are some areas that um
 
02:39:52.429 --> 02:39:52.439 align:start position:0%
just require a little more of alignment
 
02:39:55.550 --> 02:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
with what the law was describing and so
 
02:39:57.770 --> 02:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
we are also
 
02:39:59.809 --> 02:39:59.819 align:start position:0%
um redefining the roles and
 
02:40:02.030 --> 02:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of this position and
 
02:40:04.190 --> 02:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
the positions in charge of this function
 
02:40:06.530 --> 02:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
and so they're now included in this this
 
02:40:14.170 --> 02:40:14.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:14.180 --> 02:40:15.830 align:start position:0%
 
another

02:40:15.830 --> 02:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:40:17.030 --> 02:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
um another
 
02:40:17.040 --> 02:40:18.590 align:start position:0%
um another
um

02:40:18.590 --> 02:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:21.950 --> 02:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
change or or VISA we want to include in
 
02:40:24.170 --> 02:40:24.180 align:start position:0%
this budget that was a result of this
 
02:40:27.290 --> 02:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
work that we did early this year is that
 
02:40:28.490 --> 02:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
we would like to
 
02:40:31.010 --> 02:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
um migrate to
 
02:40:34.490 --> 02:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
um it RIT function to the office to the
 
02:40:37.309 --> 02:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology we
 
02:40:41.270 --> 02:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
currently have one it employee providing
 
02:40:44.330 --> 02:40:44.340 align:start position:0%
the I.T support for us we started with a
 
02:40:47.450 --> 02:40:47.460 align:start position:0%
three employee function we lost one
 
02:40:50.630 --> 02:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
position years ago and so right now we
 
02:40:52.790 --> 02:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
have a vacant position it has been
 
02:40:54.710 --> 02:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
practically impossible to fill that
 
02:40:57.590 --> 02:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
position so we
 
02:40:59.809 --> 02:40:59.819 align:start position:0%
again recognizing
 
02:41:01.610 --> 02:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
um you know the situation that we're in
 
02:41:04.429 --> 02:41:04.439 align:start position:0%
having one employee supporting uh the
 
02:41:06.590 --> 02:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
active function of the treasury and and
 
02:41:09.590 --> 02:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
how we support the state
 
02:41:11.750 --> 02:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
um we spoke with commissioner Goulet
 
02:41:14.210 --> 02:41:14.220 align:start position:0%
about our interests and transition and
 
02:41:16.969 --> 02:41:16.979 align:start position:0%
that function to doit uh commissioner
 
02:41:18.370 --> 02:41:18.380 align:start position:0%
Goulet was
 
02:41:21.710 --> 02:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
very helpful and provided on the process
 
02:41:24.230 --> 02:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
of how we can how we can do that and so
 
02:41:26.990 --> 02:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
he's staff and myself were to put the
 
02:41:29.210 --> 02:41:29.220 align:start position:0%
budget together and so we're including
 
02:41:31.849 --> 02:41:31.859 align:start position:0%
additional costs what it will take for
 
02:41:34.610 --> 02:41:34.620 align:start position:0%
the treasury to transition essential
 
02:41:37.309 --> 02:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
active functions to to be supported by
 
02:41:40.490 --> 02:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:42.170 --> 02:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
um those additional costs are being
 
02:41:44.570 --> 02:41:44.580 align:start position:0%
included under the prior to prioritize
 
02:41:46.849 --> 02:41:46.859 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs uh column
 
02:41:49.550 --> 02:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
just because it's a new a new cost
 
02:41:51.950 --> 02:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
um so what that's going to do is it's
 
02:41:53.929 --> 02:41:53.939 align:start position:0%
going to increase the cost and fiscal
 
02:41:56.210 --> 02:41:56.220 align:start position:0%
year 23 as we transition to that
 
02:41:58.070 --> 02:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
department we also going to have to
 
02:42:00.770 --> 02:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
incur certain costs internally in order
 
02:42:04.010 --> 02:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
to continue the operations as that
 
02:42:05.929 --> 02:42:05.939 align:start position:0%
transition occurs
 
02:42:08.510 --> 02:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
um but then if it's clear 25 those costs
 
02:42:11.389 --> 02:42:11.399 align:start position:0%
will will remain more constant and and
 
02:42:13.190 --> 02:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
again going forward that's that's what
 
02:42:17.330 --> 02:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:18.950 --> 02:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:42:20.570 --> 02:42:20.580 align:start position:0%
so that's those are the really
 
02:42:22.969 --> 02:42:22.979 align:start position:0%
highlights and changes of um the
 
02:42:25.429 --> 02:42:25.439 align:start position:0%
treasury operations accounting unit uh
 
02:42:27.889 --> 02:42:27.899 align:start position:0%
again that will impact also
 
02:42:30.490 --> 02:42:30.500 align:start position:0%
um the additional I.T cost will impact
 
02:42:32.889 --> 02:42:32.899 align:start position:0%
the accounting units where we have
 
02:42:36.710 --> 02:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
employees on the abandoned property
 
02:42:36.720 --> 02:42:38.389 align:start position:0%
employees on the abandoned property
operations

02:42:38.389 --> 02:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
operations
 
02:42:40.130 --> 02:42:40.140 align:start position:0%
um the new office that will create an
 
02:42:42.469 --> 02:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
investment in that management and
 
02:42:44.090 --> 02:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
there's another
 
02:42:44.100 --> 02:42:45.110 align:start position:0%
there's another
um

02:42:45.110 --> 02:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:47.330 --> 02:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
we have another employee and the
 
02:42:49.010 --> 02:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
governor scholarship program that I'll
 
02:42:51.469 --> 02:42:51.479 align:start position:0%
I'll describe a little more further in
 
02:42:53.330 --> 02:42:53.340 align:start position:0%
the presentation
 
02:42:57.410 --> 02:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
so moving on to the next um
 
02:43:00.349 --> 02:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
change that we're proposing is in the
 
02:43:01.910 --> 02:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
accounting unit relative to the return
 
02:43:05.090 --> 02:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
of general fund deposits this is where
 
02:43:06.530 --> 02:43:06.540 align:start position:0%
we record
 
02:43:09.230 --> 02:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
um the activity and the payments uh
 
02:43:12.290 --> 02:43:12.300 align:start position:0%
relative to abandoned property claims
 
02:43:15.110 --> 02:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
that are for property that has Venice
 
02:43:17.330 --> 02:43:17.340 align:start position:0%
cheated to the counties and the general
 
02:43:17.340 --> 02:43:18.889 align:start position:0%
cheated to the counties and the general
fund

02:43:18.889 --> 02:43:18.899 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:43:21.770 --> 02:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
so we would like to Budget on a month
 
02:43:24.590 --> 02:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
for the first time and these payments
 
02:43:26.389 --> 02:43:26.399 align:start position:0%
have been made without being budgeted
 
02:43:29.570 --> 02:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
before since 1985 and so the current
 
02:43:33.530 --> 02:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
process is that we attend the government
 
02:43:36.830 --> 02:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
council meeting every time they need to
 
02:43:39.230 --> 02:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
request that the controller issue a
 
02:43:42.469 --> 02:43:42.479 align:start position:0%
warrant to pay this make these payments
 
02:43:44.450 --> 02:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
um so over the last few years we have
 
02:43:44.460 --> 02:43:45.770 align:start position:0%
um so over the last few years we have
implemented

02:43:45.770 --> 02:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
02:43:48.110 --> 02:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
um we haven't
 
02:43:51.490 --> 02:43:51.500 align:start position:0%
um improve our technology and we
 
02:43:53.870 --> 02:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
introduce efficiencies in the event of
 
02:43:56.030 --> 02:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
property program and now we're able to
 
02:43:58.010 --> 02:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
pay claims
 
02:44:00.290 --> 02:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
um quicker you know we have an ability
 
02:44:03.530 --> 02:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
to submit claims electronically we have
 
02:44:06.349 --> 02:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
introduced a fast track uh component
 
02:44:06.359 --> 02:44:07.610 align:start position:0%
introduced a fast track uh component
that

02:44:07.610 --> 02:44:07.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:44:10.190 --> 02:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
um once the if if there's a claimant
 
02:44:13.969 --> 02:44:13.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:17.750 --> 02:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
it initiates the claim online and if you
 
02:44:19.670 --> 02:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
meet certain characteristics the system
 
02:44:22.429 --> 02:44:22.439 align:start position:0%
will automatically approve the claim so
 
02:44:24.530 --> 02:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
that works well for the regular claims
 
02:44:26.389 --> 02:44:26.399 align:start position:0%
meaning for property that has not been
 
02:44:29.090 --> 02:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
as cheated before property has been as
 
02:44:31.130 --> 02:44:31.140 align:start position:0%
cheetah we have to go through that
 
02:44:33.889 --> 02:44:33.899 align:start position:0%
process I just describe so um so by
 
02:44:36.050 --> 02:44:36.060 align:start position:0%
budgeting for the first time it will
 
02:44:37.309 --> 02:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
allow us to make those payments
 
02:44:38.990 --> 02:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
immediately as soon as those claims are
 
02:44:41.389 --> 02:44:41.399 align:start position:0%
validated so this will require that
 
02:44:44.750 --> 02:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
change and and an amendment to the law
 
02:44:48.650 --> 02:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
and on page two that that language is
 
02:44:51.950 --> 02:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
being included and what this will do is
 
02:44:51.960 --> 02:44:52.790 align:start position:0%
being included and what this will do is
um

02:44:52.790 --> 02:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:56.210 --> 02:44:56.220 align:start position:0%
so by having a budget an amount that we
 
02:44:59.030 --> 02:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
can use
 
02:45:01.370 --> 02:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
anytime we need the payments
 
02:45:03.830 --> 02:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
um this language really
 
02:45:03.840 --> 02:45:04.929 align:start position:0%
um this language really
um

02:45:04.929 --> 02:45:04.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:08.389 --> 02:45:08.399 align:start position:0%
clarifies that but also if there is a
 
02:45:11.270 --> 02:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
need to to have to request more funds
 
02:45:12.650 --> 02:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
because we really don't know how many
 
02:45:15.349 --> 02:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
clients we're going to receive he makes
 
02:45:17.570 --> 02:45:17.580 align:start position:0%
us go to to the regular process of going
 
02:45:20.270 --> 02:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal committee and the governor
 
02:45:24.230 --> 02:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:27.230 --> 02:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
so uh moving on to the distribution to
 
02:45:29.710 --> 02:45:29.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities the
 
02:45:32.450 --> 02:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
activity for
 
02:45:34.130 --> 02:45:34.140 align:start position:0%
the activity call relative to
 
02:45:35.690 --> 02:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
distribution to municipalities so we
 
02:45:38.870 --> 02:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
have the county unit that um
 
02:45:41.570 --> 02:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
that includes the meals and runs and tax
 
02:45:45.110 --> 02:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
distribution so during the last biennium
 
02:45:47.929 --> 02:45:47.939 align:start position:0%
the funding and the formula for this
 
02:45:51.950 --> 02:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
payments changed and so um we have an
 
02:45:51.960 --> 02:45:53.090 align:start position:0%
payments changed and so um we have an
increase

02:45:53.090 --> 02:45:53.100 align:start position:0%
increase
 
02:45:53.100 --> 02:45:54.530 align:start position:0%
increase
um

02:45:54.530 --> 02:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:56.690 --> 02:45:56.700 align:start position:0%
in those payments for this time around
 
02:45:59.210 --> 02:45:59.220 align:start position:0%
based on that new formula
 
02:45:59.220 --> 02:46:04.490 align:start position:0%
based on that new formula
um

02:46:04.490 --> 02:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:07.550 --> 02:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
so the the payment says 30 of the gross
 
02:46:10.250 --> 02:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
meals and room Stacks Revenue net of the
 
02:46:12.950 --> 02:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
education trust fund portion and also
 
02:46:16.670 --> 02:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
net of the DRS cost to administer this
 
02:46:20.210 --> 02:46:20.220 align:start position:0%
this program so um this this this these
 
02:46:22.010 --> 02:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
amounts are including uh two percent
 
02:46:24.950 --> 02:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
revenue and expenditure growth and those
 
02:46:27.710 --> 02:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
those assumptions were provided by the
 
02:46:29.570 --> 02:46:29.580 align:start position:0%
um by dra the permanent Revenue
 
02:46:29.580 --> 02:46:31.450 align:start position:0%
um by dra the permanent Revenue
Administration

02:46:31.450 --> 02:46:31.460 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
02:46:35.570 --> 02:46:35.580 align:start position:0%
uh so that so so this this um
 
02:46:37.730 --> 02:46:37.740 align:start position:0%
this famous to municipalities uh the
 
02:46:39.349 --> 02:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
meal syndrome stack distribution for the
 
02:46:40.790 --> 02:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
first time is being funded by a
 
02:46:44.450 --> 02:46:44.460 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund and not uh General funds
 
02:46:46.490 --> 02:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
uh so also in our budget we're including
 
02:46:49.190 --> 02:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
the state of Revenue share this this um
 
02:46:50.870 --> 02:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:46:53.210 --> 02:46:53.220 align:start position:0%
um this item remains on the book so we
 
02:46:55.610 --> 02:46:55.620 align:start position:0%
have to include it in our budget but the
 
02:46:57.290 --> 02:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
law has been suspended during the last
 
02:46:59.389 --> 02:46:59.399 align:start position:0%
biennia so um
 
02:47:01.370 --> 02:47:01.380 align:start position:0%
we included
 
02:47:04.010 --> 02:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
um the funding and the prioritize needs
 
02:47:04.020 --> 02:47:06.830 align:start position:0%
um the funding and the prioritize needs
column

02:47:06.830 --> 02:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:09.650 --> 02:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
so I will move on to
 
02:47:09.660 --> 02:47:10.190 align:start position:0%
so I will move on to
um

02:47:10.190 --> 02:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:11.929 --> 02:47:11.939 align:start position:0%
the office of investment in the
 
02:47:16.910 --> 02:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
management page 689 and so again this
 
02:47:18.530 --> 02:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
includes activity for the annual office
 
02:47:21.349 --> 02:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
and and and the expenses that
 
02:47:23.570 --> 02:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
um we we project that we're going to
 
02:47:25.429 --> 02:47:25.439 align:start position:0%
incur in that in in this in this
 
02:47:28.130 --> 02:47:28.140 align:start position:0%
accounting unit but also as part of the
 
02:47:29.990 --> 02:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
housekeeping that we did we're including
 
02:47:34.429 --> 02:47:34.439 align:start position:0%
that service uh in this new accounting
 
02:47:37.429 --> 02:47:37.439 align:start position:0%
um our activities our code
 
02:47:41.950 --> 02:47:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:45.770 --> 02:47:45.780 align:start position:0%
690 we have the debt service for that is
 
02:47:49.790 --> 02:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:52.130 --> 02:47:52.140 align:start position:0%
and for this um
 
02:47:54.230 --> 02:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
so that service has been has been
 
02:47:56.389 --> 02:47:56.399 align:start position:0%
reaching over over time has been
 
02:47:59.510 --> 02:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
decreasing and we have um
 
02:48:01.450 --> 02:48:01.460 align:start position:0%
there's a large
 
02:48:06.770 --> 02:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
variance or a decrease and between the
 
02:48:10.190 --> 02:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 adjuster authorized and
 
02:48:13.429 --> 02:48:13.439 align:start position:0%
the upcoming biennium and the reason for
 
02:48:15.889 --> 02:48:15.899 align:start position:0%
that is we've had
 
02:48:18.650 --> 02:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
um we had a refunding and first gear 21
 
02:48:20.389 --> 02:48:20.399 align:start position:0%
and we achieved significant significant
 
02:48:23.330 --> 02:48:23.340 align:start position:0%
savings then and those um those savings
 
02:48:25.730 --> 02:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
were applied in fiscal year 21 and
 
02:48:28.610 --> 02:48:28.620 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22. and so with that our
 
02:48:30.889 --> 02:48:30.899 align:start position:0%
debt structure also changed
 
02:48:32.210 --> 02:48:32.220 align:start position:0%
um the other
 
02:48:35.090 --> 02:48:35.100 align:start position:0%
um reason for the change is we also been
 
02:48:37.610 --> 02:48:37.620 align:start position:0%
because Capital spending has been has
 
02:48:42.770 --> 02:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
decreased we also been more or less so
 
02:48:45.530 --> 02:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
with that our projections on the
 
02:48:48.290 --> 02:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
previous and the prior biennium were
 
02:48:49.550 --> 02:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
higher than
 
02:48:49.560 --> 02:48:50.150 align:start position:0%
higher than
um

02:48:50.150 --> 02:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:52.670 --> 02:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
really what we ended up boring in issue
 
02:48:55.370 --> 02:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
for once so for new access for so that's
 
02:48:57.710 --> 02:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
for existing the efforts so for new um
 
02:49:01.070 --> 02:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
for new uh debt uh for new bonds whereas
 
02:49:03.710 --> 02:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
we are projecting that we send the
 
02:49:05.210 --> 02:49:05.220 align:start position:0%
assumption that we will you that they
 
02:49:07.309 --> 02:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
will issue about 16 million Indian
 
02:49:09.770 --> 02:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
obligation bonds uh that will be paid
 
02:49:11.690 --> 02:49:11.700 align:start position:0%
with General funds and another 10
 
02:49:14.690 --> 02:49:14.700 align:start position:0%
million uh for the uh to fund the
 
02:49:16.490 --> 02:49:16.500 align:start position:0%
projects of the University system of New
 
02:49:16.500 --> 02:49:17.710 align:start position:0%
projects of the University system of New
Hampshire

02:49:17.710 --> 02:49:17.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:49:21.650 --> 02:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
so the the reality of uh Eastern bonds
 
02:49:23.330 --> 02:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
is the cost of borrowing is going to
 
02:49:25.070 --> 02:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
increase so
 
02:49:27.170 --> 02:49:27.180 align:start position:0%
um it is
 
02:49:30.170 --> 02:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
when we put these assumptions together
 
02:49:30.180 --> 02:49:31.250 align:start position:0%
when we put these assumptions together
um

02:49:31.250 --> 02:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:32.870 --> 02:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
I actually changed my assumptions a
 
02:49:34.849 --> 02:49:34.859 align:start position:0%
couple of times but I went back to the
 
02:49:34.859 --> 02:49:36.349 align:start position:0%
couple of times but I went back to the
initial

02:49:36.349 --> 02:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
initial
 
02:49:39.830 --> 02:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
um what we prepare in in the summer and
 
02:49:41.570 --> 02:49:41.580 align:start position:0%
we feel comfortable these numbers are
 
02:49:43.670 --> 02:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
going to be good numbers for that
 
02:49:43.680 --> 02:49:45.050 align:start position:0%
going to be good numbers for that
service

02:49:45.050 --> 02:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
service
 
02:49:46.550 --> 02:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
um what's going to happen in the future
 
02:49:48.710 --> 02:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
is unclear whether we have to obviously
 
02:49:51.469 --> 02:49:51.479 align:start position:0%
we're going to pay higher blur on cost
 
02:49:53.570 --> 02:49:53.580 align:start position:0%
um but one of the factors again what I
 
02:49:55.429 --> 02:49:55.439 align:start position:0%
just mentioned is because of the
 
02:49:57.770 --> 02:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
spending and we we issue bonds based on
 
02:49:57.780 --> 02:49:59.389 align:start position:0%
spending and we we issue bonds based on
spending

02:49:59.389 --> 02:49:59.399 align:start position:0%
spending
 
02:50:01.610 --> 02:50:01.620 align:start position:0%
um you know perhaps we're gonna not
 
02:50:03.530 --> 02:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
gonna see a large increase in our debt
 
02:50:03.540 --> 02:50:05.210 align:start position:0%
gonna see a large increase in our debt
service

02:50:05.210 --> 02:50:05.220 align:start position:0%
service
 
02:50:07.190 --> 02:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
another item that I just want to
 
02:50:09.170 --> 02:50:09.180 align:start position:0%
highlight that is
 
02:50:11.510 --> 02:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
um begin with fiscal year 22 a portion
 
02:50:13.910 --> 02:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
of the debt service is going to be paid
 
02:50:16.969 --> 02:50:16.979 align:start position:0%
with a dedicated fund
 
02:50:19.070 --> 02:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
um that this is for the project this is
 
02:50:20.990 --> 02:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
for the Rams project the
 
02:50:23.630 --> 02:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
um for the Department of Revenue
 
02:50:26.929 --> 02:50:26.939 align:start position:0%
Administration and again for fiscal year
 
02:50:29.510 --> 02:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
20 to begin with fiscal year 22 that
 
02:50:31.849 --> 02:50:31.859 align:start position:0%
principle and answers of those bonds
 
02:50:33.290 --> 02:50:33.300 align:start position:0%
that were initially issued with General
 
02:50:36.170 --> 02:50:36.180 align:start position:0%
funds are not going to be repaid with
 
02:50:38.929 --> 02:50:38.939 align:start position:0%
the dedicated fund that was created for
 
02:50:41.330 --> 02:50:41.340 align:start position:0%
that purpose so that's the revenue
 
02:50:43.570 --> 02:50:43.580 align:start position:0%
information management system account
 
02:50:46.910 --> 02:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
pursuant to 21j
 
02:50:49.250 --> 02:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
and so our budget also includes that
 
02:50:52.010 --> 02:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
service for school building Aid and that
 
02:50:53.570 --> 02:50:53.580 align:start position:0%
service for the community college system
 
02:50:55.250 --> 02:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
02:50:58.190 --> 02:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
um the the Community College pays uh
 
02:51:00.349 --> 02:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
their Debt Service and
 
02:51:02.510 --> 02:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
um this could be building a on that
 
02:51:04.370 --> 02:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
service is funded from the meals and
 
02:51:09.530 --> 02:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:11.330 --> 02:51:11.340 align:start position:0%
so the last
 
02:51:11.340 --> 02:51:12.410 align:start position:0%
so the last
um

02:51:12.410 --> 02:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:14.870 --> 02:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
the next so abandon the the next one is
 
02:51:17.570 --> 02:51:17.580 align:start position:0%
the abandoned property uh division again
 
02:51:19.370 --> 02:51:19.380 align:start position:0%
no significant changes in this project
 
02:51:21.290 --> 02:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
except for the additional cost required
 
02:51:25.670 --> 02:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
to move transition to the doit supported
 
02:51:28.370 --> 02:51:28.380 align:start position:0%
and we also um
 
02:51:30.590 --> 02:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
our plan is to abolish the I.T position
 
02:51:32.150 --> 02:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
that is currently sitting in this
 
02:51:34.570 --> 02:51:34.580 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
02:51:36.830 --> 02:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
with regard to the college savings
 
02:51:38.389 --> 02:51:38.399 align:start position:0%
commission we did a little bit of a
 
02:51:40.910 --> 02:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
cleanup let's just renaming
 
02:51:43.969 --> 02:51:43.979 align:start position:0%
um those on that activity code and this
 
02:51:46.429 --> 02:51:46.439 align:start position:0%
activity code uh for the college savings
 
02:51:48.349 --> 02:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
says the
 
02:51:50.330 --> 02:51:50.340 align:start position:0%
um the work
 
02:51:52.309 --> 02:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
um related to the college tuition
 
02:51:55.070 --> 02:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
Savings Plan advisor commission they
 
02:51:57.650 --> 02:51:57.660 align:start position:0%
oversee two um two different programs
 
02:51:59.870 --> 02:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
the unique scholarship programs and the
 
02:52:02.330 --> 02:52:02.340 align:start position:0%
governor scholarship program the unique
 
02:52:04.490 --> 02:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
scholarship program is we use this
 
02:52:07.370 --> 02:52:07.380 align:start position:0%
accounting unit to make those payments
 
02:52:09.710 --> 02:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
for for the scholarships related to this
 
02:52:12.349 --> 02:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
program and the funding comes from the
 
02:52:14.090 --> 02:52:14.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Excellency higher
 
02:52:17.150 --> 02:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
education endowment trust fund
 
02:52:19.429 --> 02:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
for the um for the governor scholarship
 
02:52:19.439 --> 02:52:21.410 align:start position:0%
for the um for the governor scholarship
program

02:52:21.410 --> 02:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:52:21.420 --> 02:52:22.190 align:start position:0%
program
um

02:52:22.190 --> 02:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:25.309 --> 02:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
we are including the cost of this
 
02:52:25.319 --> 02:52:26.150 align:start position:0%
we are including the cost of this
um

02:52:26.150 --> 02:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:28.670 --> 02:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
this program and the prioritize needs
 
02:52:31.309 --> 02:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
because during the last biennium
 
02:52:34.010 --> 02:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
um there was no funding and and the
 
02:52:37.190 --> 02:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
operating budget however House Bill 2
 
02:52:41.750 --> 02:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
authorized uh six million dollars for a
 
02:52:44.150 --> 02:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
six million appropriation for fiscal
 
02:52:47.030 --> 02:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
year 21 and
 
02:52:47.040 --> 02:52:47.990 align:start position:0%
year 21 and
um

02:52:47.990 --> 02:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:50.750 --> 02:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
but the commission as part of when they
 
02:52:52.670 --> 02:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
approved these budgets
 
02:52:54.429 --> 02:52:54.439 align:start position:0%
um they are they decided to request
 
02:52:57.410 --> 02:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
additional 3 million for each fiscal
 
02:52:59.630 --> 02:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
year the same way they did it during the
 
02:53:01.190 --> 02:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
last biennium
 
02:53:03.290 --> 02:53:03.300 align:start position:0%
and I just want to mention that we do
 
02:53:05.030 --> 02:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
have a full-time position in this
 
02:53:06.650 --> 02:53:06.660 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
02:53:08.630 --> 02:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
so we also have the payments for the van
 
02:53:10.849 --> 02:53:10.859 align:start position:0%
Thompson trust fund and those are
 
02:53:13.309 --> 02:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
quarterly payments that we sent to the
 
02:53:16.070 --> 02:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
university system we have the FI also
 
02:53:18.230 --> 02:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
have the funding for the L2 program and
 
02:53:20.450 --> 02:53:20.460 align:start position:0%
the Community Development Finance
 
02:53:23.690 --> 02:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
Authority those are past programs housed
 
02:53:25.190 --> 02:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
in our budget
 
02:53:26.929 --> 02:53:26.939 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:53:29.929 --> 02:53:29.939 align:start position:0%
just quickly I'll I'll touch on the
 
02:53:32.630 --> 02:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
restrictive Revenue we also prepared our
 
02:53:35.690 --> 02:53:35.700 align:start position:0%
district the abandoned property
 
02:53:39.050 --> 02:53:39.060 align:start position:0%
um is treatment revenue and so that
 
02:53:41.269 --> 02:53:41.279 align:start position:0%
estimate is
 
02:53:44.210 --> 02:53:44.220 align:start position:0%
um based on a 10-year average and we
 
02:53:47.510 --> 02:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
included 19 million for secure 24 and 22
 
02:53:50.929 --> 02:53:50.939 align:start position:0%
million fifth year 25. and the last item
 
02:53:55.070 --> 02:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
I have is the interest on Surplus so we
 
02:53:57.769 --> 02:53:57.779 align:start position:0%
did not include anything in this in this
 
02:53:59.630 --> 02:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
line and the
 
02:54:02.750 --> 02:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
and similar to Prior years we we did not
 
02:54:06.050 --> 02:54:06.060 align:start position:0%
budget anything in the agency budget
 
02:54:07.870 --> 02:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
um the interest on Surplus has been
 
02:54:10.790 --> 02:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
relatively smaller the last couple of
 
02:54:12.830 --> 02:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
years due to the interest rate
 
02:54:16.849 --> 02:54:16.859 align:start position:0%
environment that's clearly changing and
 
02:54:16.859 --> 02:54:17.450 align:start position:0%
environment that's clearly changing and
um

02:54:17.450 --> 02:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:19.309 --> 02:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
we are expecting
 
02:54:19.319 --> 02:54:20.750 align:start position:0%
we are expecting
um

02:54:20.750 --> 02:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:23.750 --> 02:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
good earnings in this current fiscal
 
02:54:26.389 --> 02:54:26.399 align:start position:0%
year and upcoming biennium so we can
 
02:54:29.330 --> 02:54:29.340 align:start position:0%
work on preparing an estimate that could
 
02:54:31.730 --> 02:54:31.740 align:start position:0%
be included in the governor's budget
 
02:54:35.090 --> 02:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
um so that should be uh right now we're
 
02:54:36.349 --> 02:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
in a better position to provide that
 
02:54:38.450 --> 02:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
estimate that we did in the summer
 
02:54:40.250 --> 02:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
so that concludes my presentation I'll
 
02:54:42.410 --> 02:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions you may
 
02:54:45.050 --> 02:54:45.060 align:start position:0%
have thank you
 
02:54:48.170 --> 02:54:48.180 align:start position:0%
one question from me and that is in our
 
02:54:51.590 --> 02:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
along or in our debt uh do we have well
 
02:54:53.450 --> 02:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
what percentage of any do we have there
 
02:54:56.690 --> 02:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
are variable rate component or uh
 
02:54:58.130 --> 02:54:58.140 align:start position:0%
synthetic products like interest rate
 
02:54:58.140 --> 02:54:59.690 align:start position:0%
synthetic products like interest rate
swaps

02:54:59.690 --> 02:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
swaps
 
02:55:01.969 --> 02:55:01.979 align:start position:0%
we do not have any of that we don't have
 
02:55:04.610 --> 02:55:04.620 align:start position:0%
variable rates we've been issuing
 
02:55:07.790 --> 02:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
um debt with a fixed rate we pay
 
02:55:07.800 --> 02:55:08.950 align:start position:0%
um debt with a fixed rate we pay
interest

02:55:08.950 --> 02:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
interest
 
02:55:13.450 --> 02:55:13.460 align:start position:0%
we typically offer a five percent coupon
 
02:55:17.150 --> 02:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
and that has produced a large premium of
 
02:55:19.130 --> 02:55:19.140 align:start position:0%
the last few years so with the interest
 
02:55:23.690 --> 02:55:23.700 align:start position:0%
rates changing we anticipate as
 
02:55:25.910 --> 02:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
close to no premium
 
02:55:27.710 --> 02:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
um end up coming biennium so that those
 
02:55:29.389 --> 02:55:29.399 align:start position:0%
are the things that we need to see how
 
02:55:32.870 --> 02:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
how they change but thinking thinking
 
02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:34.130 align:start position:0%
how they change but thinking thinking
about

02:55:34.130 --> 02:55:34.140 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:55:34.140 --> 02:55:36.230 align:start position:0%
about
um

02:55:36.230 --> 02:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:40.070 --> 02:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
um so we're going back to um you know a
 
02:55:43.309 --> 02:55:43.319 align:start position:0%
situation we have prior to 2008 with the
 
02:55:46.010 --> 02:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
ball run costs were higher so but we do
 
02:55:48.110 --> 02:55:48.120 align:start position:0%
not ish we do not have any variables we
 
02:55:50.330 --> 02:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
do not have variable rate that's a great
 
02:55:54.309 --> 02:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:57.110 --> 02:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
hi hi
 
02:56:00.889 --> 02:56:00.899 align:start position:0%
um if I understand the way we do debt
 
02:56:03.830 --> 02:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
and I don't so let me see if this is
 
02:56:03.840 --> 02:56:05.210 align:start position:0%
and I don't so let me see if this is
right

02:56:05.210 --> 02:56:05.220 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:56:05.220 --> 02:56:06.830 align:start position:0%
right
um

02:56:06.830 --> 02:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:09.349 --> 02:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
we passed the capital budget
 
02:56:11.750 --> 02:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
agencies are authorized to spend
 
02:56:13.610 --> 02:56:13.620 align:start position:0%
theoretically that money
 
02:56:15.710 --> 02:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
that money is theoretically is typically
 
02:56:17.870 --> 02:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
spent over the course of the next two to
 
02:56:20.389 --> 02:56:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:24.530 --> 02:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
you don't issue debt that corresponds to
 
02:56:26.269 --> 02:56:26.279 align:start position:0%
that project let's just say for the sake
 
02:56:28.070 --> 02:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
of argument we build a building for 10
 
02:56:29.330 --> 02:56:29.340 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:56:31.490 --> 02:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
not a very big one
 
02:56:31.500 --> 02:56:33.170 align:start position:0%
not a very big one
um

02:56:33.170 --> 02:56:33.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:35.750 --> 02:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
you issued that when the project is
 
02:56:35.760 --> 02:56:37.849 align:start position:0%
you issued that when the project is
closed

02:56:37.849 --> 02:56:37.859 align:start position:0%
closed
 
02:56:44.330 --> 02:56:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:47.210 --> 02:56:47.220 align:start position:0%
of our the Arbitrage rules that we have
 
02:56:49.730 --> 02:56:49.740 align:start position:0%
to we have to follow and we have to make
 
02:56:53.570 --> 02:56:53.580 align:start position:0%
sure that we don't keep the proceeds for
 
02:56:56.630 --> 02:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
too long and so what we do at what we do
 
02:57:00.469 --> 02:57:00.479 align:start position:0%
is typically we borrow based on you know
 
02:57:02.269 --> 02:57:02.279 align:start position:0%
we're about to issue Bonds in March so
 
02:57:04.130 --> 02:57:04.140 align:start position:0%
we look at the spending for the fiscal
 
02:57:06.830 --> 02:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
year and we see how much has been spent
 
02:57:08.870 --> 02:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
and then we try to project for the rest
 
02:57:12.110 --> 02:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
of the you know what we may see for
 
02:57:15.710 --> 02:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
spend then and over the next six to
 
02:57:17.990 --> 02:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
eight months or nine months so and
 
02:57:21.349 --> 02:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
that's what we issue and so
 
02:57:23.150 --> 02:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
um just to give an example in fiscal
 
02:57:27.050 --> 02:57:27.060 align:start position:0%
year 21 we issued a very small amount of
 
02:57:29.389 --> 02:57:29.399 align:start position:0%
numeric bonds it was about
 
02:57:32.510 --> 02:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
39 million and I'm fiscal year and
 
02:57:34.250 --> 02:57:34.260 align:start position:0%
that's all of it including so funded
 
02:57:37.910 --> 02:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
that and fiscal year 22 we issued a
 
02:57:41.630 --> 02:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
total about 59 million and again total
 
02:57:44.389 --> 02:57:44.399 align:start position:0%
land that includes self-funded so about
 
02:57:47.809 --> 02:57:47.819 align:start position:0%
70 of that is General pay with General
 
02:57:52.429 --> 02:57:52.439 align:start position:0%
funds in and that's really how we how we
 
02:57:53.929 --> 02:57:53.939 align:start position:0%
borrow how that's based on our product
 
02:57:56.450 --> 02:57:56.460 align:start position:0%
that's how we borrow so if we
 
02:57:58.610 --> 02:57:58.620 align:start position:0%
um I guess what I'm getting at is so you
 
02:57:59.809 --> 02:57:59.819 align:start position:0%
would look at you know total Capital
 
02:58:02.929 --> 02:58:02.939 align:start position:0%
spending on a company
 
02:58:05.809 --> 02:58:05.819 align:start position:0%
30. thank you
 
02:58:08.570 --> 02:58:08.580 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
02:58:11.389 --> 02:58:11.399 align:start position:0%
but theoretically for example though you
 
02:58:12.950 --> 02:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
know we passed 125 million dollar
 
02:58:15.469 --> 02:58:15.479 align:start position:0%
whatever was capital budget and there's
 
02:58:17.809 --> 02:58:17.819 align:start position:0%
a Slowdown on it during covid
 
02:58:20.510 --> 02:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's not canceled it's just every
 
02:58:22.330 --> 02:58:22.340 align:start position:0%
project is put on hold
 
02:58:24.790 --> 02:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:58:29.450 --> 02:58:29.460 align:start position:0%
in normal times as if any time is normal
 
02:58:29.460 --> 02:58:30.290 align:start position:0%
in normal times as if any time is normal
um

02:58:30.290 --> 02:58:30.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:32.389 --> 02:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
you know the the spending just kind of
 
02:58:34.670 --> 02:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
rolls right and it and it's you know
 
02:58:37.130 --> 02:58:37.140 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of like this up and
 
02:58:39.230 --> 02:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
down but with covet there's a and
 
02:58:41.090 --> 02:58:41.100 align:start position:0%
there's a whole bunch of authorized
 
02:58:43.429 --> 02:58:43.439 align:start position:0%
expenditures out there that haven't been
 
02:58:44.870 --> 02:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
spent so they haven't been borrowed
 
02:58:47.450 --> 02:58:47.460 align:start position:0%
that's correct so there's a so in theory
 
02:58:49.730 --> 02:58:49.740 align:start position:0%
on some level there's a lag in debt
 
02:58:51.710 --> 02:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
service and uh you know let's say for
 
02:58:53.510 --> 02:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
the sake of argument that this year we
 
02:58:55.370 --> 02:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
decided not to have a capital budget
 
02:58:59.570 --> 02:58:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:02.450 --> 02:59:02.460 align:start position:0%
um but I didn't write it down thank you
 
02:59:04.910 --> 02:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that but let's say we you
 
02:59:07.309 --> 02:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
know we skip a biennium where you know
 
02:59:09.710 --> 02:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
we did 125 125 zero
 
02:59:11.510 --> 02:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
we don't see the effect of we wouldn't
 
02:59:13.429 --> 02:59:13.439 align:start position:0%
see the effect of the zero for a couple
 
02:59:15.110 --> 02:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
years probably that's correct so there's
 
02:59:17.150 --> 02:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
a lag so in normal times we will be
 
02:59:19.010 --> 02:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
probably more consistent you know we
 
02:59:20.389 --> 02:59:20.399 align:start position:0%
just borrow because the spending is
 
02:59:22.130 --> 02:59:22.140 align:start position:0%
occurring so we just keep borrowing and
 
02:59:24.469 --> 02:59:24.479 align:start position:0%
it's it's a pretty good um
 
02:59:26.870 --> 02:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
um it just it's just organic it works
 
02:59:29.510 --> 02:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
really well it is this very unusual
 
02:59:31.429 --> 02:59:31.439 align:start position:0%
times that we're living that we're
 
02:59:31.439 --> 02:59:32.450 align:start position:0%
times that we're living that we're
saying

02:59:32.450 --> 02:59:32.460 align:start position:0%
saying
 
02:59:35.030 --> 02:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
um we're seeing the impact so
 
02:59:36.710 --> 02:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
um if I recall correctly during the
 
02:59:39.050 --> 02:59:39.060 align:start position:0%
covet times the capital expenses were
 
02:59:42.170 --> 02:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
Capital expenditures was this
 
02:59:45.170 --> 02:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
um request to not spend
 
02:59:45.180 --> 02:59:45.910 align:start position:0%
um request to not spend
um

02:59:45.910 --> 02:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:48.530 --> 02:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
including Capital expenditures so that
 
02:59:50.510 --> 02:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
that you know even though the budget was
 
02:59:53.750 --> 02:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
authorized for 120 million 130 million
 
02:59:56.570 --> 02:59:56.580 align:start position:0%
for the biennium the spending did not
 
02:59:59.150 --> 02:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
occur so that's when things started and
 
03:00:00.769 --> 03:00:00.779 align:start position:0%
then with the problems now with
 
03:00:04.130 --> 03:00:04.140 align:start position:0%
inflation and Workforce so now that
 
03:00:05.990 --> 03:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
spending is not happening so yes so
 
03:00:09.670 --> 03:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
right now there is about 300 million in
 
03:00:12.710 --> 03:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
authorized Indonesian bonds
 
03:00:15.230 --> 03:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
oh okay and that's an and that's that
 
03:00:17.090 --> 03:00:17.100 align:start position:0%
that's the I can see that number in the
 
03:00:18.710 --> 03:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
bond statement every
 
03:00:20.690 --> 03:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
it should be there but it will also be
 
03:00:23.090 --> 03:00:23.100 align:start position:0%
in the ACT Fair okay oh that's right of
 
03:00:25.370 --> 03:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
course of one
 
03:00:25.380 --> 03:00:26.210 align:start position:0%
course of one
um

03:00:26.210 --> 03:00:26.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:28.429 --> 03:00:28.439 align:start position:0%
so the only other question I have is our
 
03:00:32.870 --> 03:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
total General obligation debt as a state
 
03:00:35.389 --> 03:00:35.399 align:start position:0%
peaked in
 
03:00:38.269 --> 03:00:38.279 align:start position:0%
what six seven eight years ago
 
03:00:40.370 --> 03:00:40.380 align:start position:0%
we've been in Decline for a while we
 
03:00:42.469 --> 03:00:42.479 align:start position:0%
have been yes is it eight years sound
 
03:00:42.479 --> 03:00:43.969 align:start position:0%
have been yes is it eight years sound
right

03:00:43.969 --> 03:00:43.979 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:00:46.010 --> 03:00:46.020 align:start position:0%
um we'll have to look at my chart but
 
03:00:47.929 --> 03:00:47.939 align:start position:0%
probably yes so it's been it's been
 
03:00:50.929 --> 03:00:50.939 align:start position:0%
trending down for some time now and you
 
03:00:52.730 --> 03:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
know in in total too just because
 
03:00:55.429 --> 03:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
Turnpike is not issuing anything they
 
03:00:57.469 --> 03:00:57.479 align:start position:0%
just refunded some bonds so they're and
 
03:00:59.090 --> 03:00:59.100 align:start position:0%
they don't have plans to to reach any
 
03:01:00.590 --> 03:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
new debt
 
03:01:02.630 --> 03:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
um again the general fund has a specific
 
03:01:06.170 --> 03:01:06.180 align:start position:0%
Trend because of what we just discussed
 
03:01:08.330 --> 03:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
um and again in general is just
 
03:01:09.590 --> 03:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
stranding down
 
03:01:13.790 --> 03:01:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:15.889 --> 03:01:15.899 align:start position:0%
this is a smaller in dollars in
 
03:01:17.630 --> 03:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
comparison to some of the discussion but
 
03:01:19.610 --> 03:01:19.620 align:start position:0%
I was just looking at your comment about
 
03:01:23.150 --> 03:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
the rims project and I believe that the
 
03:01:25.010 --> 03:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
the way that this the law the statute
 
03:01:26.929 --> 03:01:26.939 align:start position:0%
had read was that there's
 
03:01:28.429 --> 03:01:28.439 align:start position:0%
um the funding is coming from sort of
 
03:01:30.950 --> 03:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
savings from the rims project and I feel
 
03:01:33.530 --> 03:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
like there's a cap I don't maybe three
 
03:01:34.490 --> 03:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
million I don't remember if that's
 
03:01:37.190 --> 03:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
annually or over its life but once if
 
03:01:39.530 --> 03:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
there are no savings does the general
 
03:01:41.830 --> 03:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
fund sort of pay that that Debt Service
 
03:01:44.570 --> 03:01:44.580 align:start position:0%
the capital budget says that it needs to
 
03:01:46.969 --> 03:01:46.979 align:start position:0%
be paid with that dedicated fund so I
 
03:01:48.349 --> 03:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
think the language and the dedicated
 
03:01:50.630 --> 03:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
fund talks about that cap the 4 million
 
03:01:53.630 --> 03:01:53.640 align:start position:0%
but the capital budget is very specific
 
03:01:57.349 --> 03:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
that beginning with fiscal year 22 that
 
03:02:00.410 --> 03:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
those bonds need to be paid from that
 
03:02:02.929 --> 03:02:02.939 align:start position:0%
dedicated account so there isn't
 
03:02:05.750 --> 03:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
language currently that um
 
03:02:07.309 --> 03:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
for that funding to come from elsewhere
 
03:02:08.690 --> 03:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
so that's very specific to that room
 
03:02:11.450 --> 03:02:11.460 align:start position:0%
very specific in the Corporal budget and
 
03:02:14.030 --> 03:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
so for our purposes we will so before it
 
03:02:16.190 --> 03:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
was General funded now we need to really
 
03:02:18.349 --> 03:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
remove it from that bucket and put in
 
03:02:21.050 --> 03:02:21.060 align:start position:0%
that self-funded bucket okay
 
03:02:22.309 --> 03:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
um and then this is more uh just a
 
03:02:25.010 --> 03:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
different question is on the
 
03:02:27.530 --> 03:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund you said it was a house
 
03:02:29.510 --> 03:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
bill 2 that was passed that included 6
 
03:02:31.849 --> 03:02:31.859 align:start position:0%
million I guess retro to 21 and then
 
03:02:33.349 --> 03:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
that's been sort of carrying over do you
 
03:02:35.389 --> 03:02:35.399 align:start position:0%
know what the balance is in that right
 
03:02:35.399 --> 03:02:36.110 align:start position:0%
know what the balance is in that right
now

03:02:36.110 --> 03:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:02:38.630 --> 03:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
we have about 10 million in that okay
 
03:02:41.269 --> 03:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
balance but it's also because of the way
 
03:02:43.490 --> 03:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
the scholarships and this is the
 
03:02:45.170 --> 03:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
government scholarship program so this
 
03:02:47.210 --> 03:02:47.220 align:start position:0%
is because of the way how those how
 
03:02:49.790 --> 03:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
those how that program works it issues
 
03:02:49.800 --> 03:02:51.469 align:start position:0%
those how that program works it issues
grants

03:02:51.469 --> 03:02:51.479 align:start position:0%
grants
 
03:02:51.479 --> 03:02:52.429 align:start position:0%
grants
um

03:02:52.429 --> 03:02:52.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:55.429 --> 03:02:55.439 align:start position:0%
the schools issue grants
 
03:02:58.010 --> 03:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
um each year but they have four years to
 
03:03:00.349 --> 03:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
spend the money and so this program
 
03:03:05.690 --> 03:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
started in 2018 and so we have a large
 
03:03:08.510 --> 03:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
available balance because of that reason
 
03:03:10.849 --> 03:03:10.859 align:start position:0%
I don't have the um the numbers in front
 
03:03:12.769 --> 03:03:12.779 align:start position:0%
of me what was your prioritized needs
 
03:03:12.779 --> 03:03:14.030 align:start position:0%
of me what was your prioritized needs
request

03:03:14.030 --> 03:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
request
 
03:03:16.190 --> 03:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
three million for each fiscal year for
 
03:03:18.170 --> 03:03:18.180 align:start position:0%
that program okay and that has that's
 
03:03:21.110 --> 03:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
what was requested in the past okay
 
03:03:22.969 --> 03:03:22.979 align:start position:0%
and so with all of that if we don't
 
03:03:26.210 --> 03:03:26.220 align:start position:0%
include um excluding the uh Revenue
 
03:03:30.230 --> 03:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
sharing we were way under that you know
 
03:03:32.450 --> 03:03:32.460 align:start position:0%
fun targets okay
 
03:03:34.070 --> 03:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:03:39.950 --> 03:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:41.809 --> 03:03:41.819 align:start position:0%

03:03:44.269 --> 03:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
program elkship is up next for your

03:03:56.090 --> 03:03:56.100 align:start position:0%
good morning thanks Bert I feel a little
 
03:03:58.070 --> 03:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
bit like a palette cleanser we're a nice
 
03:04:00.230 --> 03:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
small little program we use no General
 
03:04:00.240 --> 03:04:01.610 align:start position:0%

03:04:03.349 --> 03:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
um but I am very happy to be here to

The Landing Community Heritage
 
03:04:10.550 --> 03:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
investment program known to locals as
 
03:04:13.550 --> 03:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
l-chip we are an independent state
 
03:04:16.250 --> 03:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
Authority that was created in 2000 and
 
03:04:18.230 --> 03:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
charged with ensuring that the state's
 
03:04:20.269 --> 03:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
most important natural cultural and
 
03:04:22.849 --> 03:04:22.859 align:start position:0%
historic resources forever contribute to
 
03:04:25.130 --> 03:04:25.140 align:start position:0%
our economy and quality of life
 
03:04:27.290 --> 03:04:27.300 align:start position:0%
when l-chip was first conceived and
 
03:04:30.530 --> 03:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
designed it was considered to operate in
 
03:04:32.150 --> 03:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire way meaning we are
 
03:04:34.490 --> 03:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
Community Based we are a voluntary
 
03:04:37.130 --> 03:04:37.140 align:start position:0%
initiative and we support public private
 
03:04:39.590 --> 03:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
Partnerships we do this by awarding
 
03:04:41.389 --> 03:04:41.399 align:start position:0%
matching grants to communities or
 
03:04:43.910 --> 03:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
non-profit organizations who are seeking
 
03:04:46.610 --> 03:04:46.620 align:start position:0%
to advance their local projects in land
 
03:04:49.550 --> 03:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
conservation and historic rehabilitation
 
03:04:51.710 --> 03:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
the grants we provide help these groups
 
03:04:54.230 --> 03:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
protect forests and Farms wildlife and
 
03:04:56.630 --> 03:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
water they help reintegrate historic
 
03:04:58.969 --> 03:04:58.979 align:start position:0%
buildings into community life they help
 
03:05:01.130 --> 03:05:01.140 align:start position:0%
preserve covered bridges and iconic view
 
03:05:03.710 --> 03:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
sheds and they help to protect Clean
 
03:05:05.990 --> 03:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
safe drinking water
 
03:05:09.050 --> 03:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
El chip has supported projects in 195
 
03:05:10.730 --> 03:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
communities across the state and we're
 
03:05:12.290 --> 03:05:12.300 align:start position:0%
working hard to hit every single one
 
03:05:15.230 --> 03:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
we're almost there we've invested 58
 
03:05:18.230 --> 03:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
million dollars since 2001 protecting
 
03:05:21.730 --> 03:05:21.740 align:start position:0%
236 000 Acres directly
 
03:05:25.130 --> 03:05:25.140 align:start position:0%
324 buildings have been rehabilitated
 
03:05:29.530 --> 03:05:29.540 align:start position:0%
and as I said 195 towns so it's roughly
 
03:05:32.510 --> 03:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
350 Community groups have benefited from
 
03:05:34.849 --> 03:05:34.859 align:start position:0%
a nail chip Grant
 
03:05:36.349 --> 03:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
um for the purposes of today's meeting
 
03:05:37.790 --> 03:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
out of respect for your time I could go
 
03:05:39.050 --> 03:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
on and tell you all about different
 
03:05:41.269 --> 03:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
projects but I will um focus mostly on
 
03:05:44.150 --> 03:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
our budget request l-chips funding for
 
03:05:44.160 --> 03:05:45.050 align:start position:0%
our budget request l-chips funding for
Grants

03:05:45.050 --> 03:05:45.060 align:start position:0%
Grants
 
03:05:46.790 --> 03:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
um is
 
03:05:49.429 --> 03:05:49.439 align:start position:0%
generated by a 25 surcharge that is
 
03:05:51.170 --> 03:05:51.180 align:start position:0%
assessed at the county Registries of
 
03:05:53.990 --> 03:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
Deeds when documents are recorded of the
 
03:05:56.570 --> 03:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
25 surcharge one dollar is retained by
 
03:05:58.910 --> 03:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
the county and the other 24 is deposited
 
03:06:01.130 --> 03:06:01.140 align:start position:0%
into an account held and maintained by
 
03:06:02.690 --> 03:06:02.700 align:start position:0%
the Department of Treasury
 
03:06:06.650 --> 03:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
I am enormously proud that nearly 96 of
 
03:06:08.150 --> 03:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
the funding that is generated by that
 
03:06:09.889 --> 03:06:09.899 align:start position:0%
surcharge goes directly back to
 
03:06:12.590 --> 03:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
communities in the form of Grants or is
 
03:06:14.510 --> 03:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
invested in our community conservation
 
03:06:16.730 --> 03:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
endowment which supports annual
 
03:06:19.429 --> 03:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
monitoring right now of close to 400
 
03:06:21.830 --> 03:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
properties that received LG funding in
 
03:06:22.969 --> 03:06:22.979 align:start position:0%
the past
 
03:06:25.490 --> 03:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
the small remainder is allocated to
 
03:06:27.349 --> 03:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
program Administration
 
03:06:29.630 --> 03:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
l-chip is an impressively lean and
 
03:06:31.130 --> 03:06:31.140 align:start position:0%
efficient machine that's something I'm
 
03:06:33.349 --> 03:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
very very proud of we have only four
 
03:06:35.510 --> 03:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
full-time employees and two seasonal
 
03:06:37.250 --> 03:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
part-time employees
 
03:06:39.410 --> 03:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
in order to maintain that low Staffing
 
03:06:41.570 --> 03:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
level in fiscal year 22 we did something
 
03:06:43.070 --> 03:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
I think you're hearing a lot about in
 
03:06:44.570 --> 03:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
these hearings which is we launched a
 
03:06:47.030 --> 03:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
new Grant management system which allows
 
03:06:47.040 --> 03:06:48.070 align:start position:0%
new Grant management system which allows
online

03:06:48.070 --> 03:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
online
 
03:06:50.750 --> 03:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
processing of applications evaluation
 
03:06:53.870 --> 03:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
and management of funded projects this
 
03:06:56.450 --> 03:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
has been received with rave reviews but
 
03:06:57.950 --> 03:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
more importantly has dramatically
 
03:07:00.230 --> 03:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
increased staff productivity eliminating
 
03:07:02.510 --> 03:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
the need for us to add a position we
 
03:07:04.070 --> 03:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
thought we were going to need to add in
 
03:07:06.650 --> 03:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
the next fiscal year we're hopeful as we
 
03:07:08.450 --> 03:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
move out of the implementation phase
 
03:07:10.370 --> 03:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
with this project that that only will
 
03:07:10.380 --> 03:07:11.690 align:start position:0%
with this project that that only will
continue

03:07:11.690 --> 03:07:11.700 align:start position:0%
continue
 
03:07:14.630 --> 03:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
so to summarize if I have one takeaway
 
03:07:16.130 --> 03:07:16.140 align:start position:0%
I'd like you to have for my presentation
 
03:07:19.070 --> 03:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
it is that each investment l-chip makes
 
03:07:20.990 --> 03:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
in a town or community group supports
 
03:07:23.750 --> 03:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
local jobs enhances the local tax base
 
03:07:26.630 --> 03:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
promotes tourism preserves traditional
 
03:07:29.570 --> 03:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
craftsmanship and help those jobs to
 
03:07:31.849 --> 03:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
maintained and improves the quality of
 
03:07:33.530 --> 03:07:33.540 align:start position:0%
life for the folks who live and visit
 
03:07:35.809 --> 03:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
here all without the use of General
 
03:07:35.819 --> 03:07:37.250 align:start position:0%
here all without the use of General
funds

03:07:37.250 --> 03:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
funds
 
03:07:39.530 --> 03:07:39.540 align:start position:0%
for the reason we are requesting the
 
03:07:42.650 --> 03:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
l-chip appropriation be set at 5 million
 
03:07:46.550 --> 03:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
as it has for the past two biennia and I
 
03:07:48.230 --> 03:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and happy to
 
03:07:50.450 --> 03:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
answer any questions about the program
 
03:07:52.250 --> 03:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:07:55.429 --> 03:07:55.439 align:start position:0%
um I want to commend you for the job you
 
03:07:59.269 --> 03:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
do and uh I grew up in Massachusetts but
 
03:08:00.950 --> 03:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
every two weeks of every August would go
 
03:08:02.330 --> 03:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
up to New Hampshire for vacation with
 
03:08:04.790 --> 03:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
the family and I think it's for lack of
 
03:08:06.590 --> 03:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
a better word where it's really cool
 
03:08:09.050 --> 03:08:09.060 align:start position:0%
that I can now take my son and give him
 
03:08:11.150 --> 03:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
the same experience I had as a kid
 
03:08:13.010 --> 03:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
because that's not true for many parts
 
03:08:15.950 --> 03:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
of this country so so thank you
 
03:08:18.710 --> 03:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
um my only question really is what what
 
03:08:21.050 --> 03:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
challenges do you face is it is it the
 
03:08:23.809 --> 03:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
need for development or or maybe even
 
03:08:25.370 --> 03:08:25.380 align:start position:0%
your own words what what are your
 
03:08:26.990 --> 03:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
challenges as a program the biggest
 
03:08:29.269 --> 03:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
challenge we face is one that many
 
03:08:32.150 --> 03:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
resource agencies face which is that we
 
03:08:34.070 --> 03:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the state do take a
 
03:08:36.110 --> 03:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
protective interest in properties that
 
03:08:38.269 --> 03:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
we fund which means we have an ongoing
 
03:08:40.550 --> 03:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
and often Perpetual obligation to
 
03:08:42.950 --> 03:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
oversee those annual monitoring and
 
03:08:44.330 --> 03:08:44.340 align:start position:0%
enforcement of conservation of
 
03:08:46.370 --> 03:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
preservation restrictions is complicated
 
03:08:49.309 --> 03:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
and it can be expensive so that's that's
 
03:08:51.230 --> 03:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
what I'm looking at in next five years
 
03:08:53.269 --> 03:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
is the biggest challenge El Chapo faced
 
03:08:55.250 --> 03:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
and we're working with doj with cord
 
03:08:57.469 --> 03:08:57.479 align:start position:0%
with the conservation land stewardship
 
03:08:59.269 --> 03:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
program in division of historical
 
03:09:02.469 --> 03:09:02.479 align:start position:0%
resources to find a way to very
 
03:09:05.030 --> 03:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
effectively but also efficiently and
 
03:09:07.550 --> 03:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
consistently Implement those types of
 
03:09:09.710 --> 03:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
restrictions across not just l-chip but
 
03:09:11.330 --> 03:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
the other agencies that are also doing
 
03:09:13.969 --> 03:09:13.979 align:start position:0%
similar work like Des or dncr fishing
 
03:09:16.309 --> 03:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
game so that's I would say that is our
 
03:09:18.590 --> 03:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
our number one challenge in terms of our
 
03:09:21.710 --> 03:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
grant recipients they are extremely
 
03:09:24.469 --> 03:09:24.479 align:start position:0%
challenged by Staffing it is difficult
 
03:09:28.309 --> 03:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
to to find the people to run the
 
03:09:30.170 --> 03:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
projects so towns are working with
 
03:09:33.050 --> 03:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
volunteers a lot of the community groups
 
03:09:34.910 --> 03:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
we work with are all volunteers so we're
 
03:09:36.830 --> 03:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
finding we need to offer more technical
 
03:09:39.130 --> 03:09:39.140 align:start position:0%
assistance these can be very complicated
 
03:09:41.809 --> 03:09:41.819 align:start position:0%
real estate transactions or you know
 
03:09:43.730 --> 03:09:43.740 align:start position:0%
rehabilitating the Colonial Theater in
 
03:09:45.710 --> 03:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
Laconia for example some of these
 
03:09:47.809 --> 03:09:47.819 align:start position:0%
projects are quite complicated and so
 
03:09:51.530 --> 03:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
the um the professional capacity issues
 
03:09:55.130 --> 03:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
can be challenging thank you
 
03:09:56.870 --> 03:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
my only question is about the five
 
03:09:59.630 --> 03:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
million appropriation if that
 
03:10:01.490 --> 03:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
and that's based on how much how many
 
03:10:03.889 --> 03:10:03.899 align:start position:0%
Deeds we expect to be filed right where
 
03:10:06.349 --> 03:10:06.359 align:start position:0%
Deeds plans mortgage mortgage surcharges
 
03:10:08.510 --> 03:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
and yeah yeah
 
03:10:12.349 --> 03:10:12.359 align:start position:0%
um if it if they don't come in right
 
03:10:13.670 --> 03:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
there's a general fund make up the
 
03:10:16.910 --> 03:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
difference or do you get less so I from
 
03:10:18.769 --> 03:10:18.779 align:start position:0%
a technical perspective I can't answer
 
03:10:20.450 --> 03:10:20.460 align:start position:0%
that what I can tell you is we have
 
03:10:22.610 --> 03:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
never we have never exceeded we only
 
03:10:24.950 --> 03:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
award the funds based on receipts that
 
03:10:26.210 --> 03:10:26.220 align:start position:0%
come in
 
03:10:28.730 --> 03:10:28.740 align:start position:0%
um and so we typically we we don't give
 
03:10:28.740 --> 03:10:29.809 align:start position:0%
um and so we typically we we don't give
you

03:10:29.809 --> 03:10:29.819 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:10:33.290 --> 03:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
more than comes in right okay if you go
 
03:10:35.210 --> 03:10:35.220 align:start position:0%
way back to when the surcharge was first
 
03:10:37.370 --> 03:10:37.380 align:start position:0%
created in 2009
 
03:10:39.170 --> 03:10:39.180 align:start position:0%
um The Chipettes warding funds in
 
03:10:41.210 --> 03:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
December there was some forecasting of
 
03:10:42.830 --> 03:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
future Revenue so we're rewarding a
 
03:10:45.590 --> 03:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
little ahead as the market grew we're
 
03:10:47.389 --> 03:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
tied to number of transactions so as the
 
03:10:49.910 --> 03:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
market grew over the past few years
 
03:10:52.550 --> 03:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
um we cut that amount that we had
 
03:10:54.469 --> 03:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
already awarded that hadn't returned so
 
03:10:56.269 --> 03:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
now we've gotten ourselves to zero so
 
03:10:58.490 --> 03:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
now because we're in a falling Market we
 
03:11:01.090 --> 03:11:01.100 align:start position:0%
certainly don't want to be
 
03:11:03.830 --> 03:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
right so now we're at zero so now we
 
03:11:05.630 --> 03:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
award cash in hand
 
03:11:09.530 --> 03:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:11.690 --> 03:11:11.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much

units and provided technical assistance
 
03:13:16.250 --> 03:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
to nearly 900 small businesses I'd love
 
03:13:17.929 --> 03:13:17.939 align:start position:0%
to provide just a couple of examples of
 
03:13:20.330 --> 03:13:20.340 align:start position:0%
how that touches down in communities
 
03:13:23.090 --> 03:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
Public Service funds were provided to
 
03:13:25.670 --> 03:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
the sunshine soup kitchen they were
 
03:13:27.590 --> 03:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
awarded sixty thousand dollars and that
 
03:13:28.969 --> 03:13:28.979 align:start position:0%
was during the pandemic particularly
 
03:13:30.650 --> 03:13:30.660 align:start position:0%
because they lost the volunteers that
 
03:13:32.030 --> 03:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
were so critical for their food
 
03:13:32.040 --> 03:13:33.590 align:start position:0%
were so critical for their food
distribution

03:13:33.590 --> 03:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
03:13:35.990 --> 03:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
they to date with these funds have sort
 
03:13:37.269 --> 03:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
of served
 
03:13:42.290 --> 03:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
9811 seniors adults and children 908 and
 
03:13:45.110 --> 03:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
812 meals they've also given out
 
03:13:47.150 --> 03:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
blizzard bags and breakfast bags which
 
03:13:49.550 --> 03:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
are essential to people in storms and
 
03:13:51.710 --> 03:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
other disasters
 
03:13:53.630 --> 03:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
they said to us recently that receiving
 
03:13:55.490 --> 03:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
this grant helped their organization get
 
03:13:56.750 --> 03:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
through the last two years and keep
 
03:13:58.429 --> 03:13:58.439 align:start position:0%
their doors open allowing them to really
 
03:14:01.610 --> 03:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
adapt their programs and and continue to
 
03:14:03.410 --> 03:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
serve people in their community
 
03:14:05.389 --> 03:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
you'll also see in the materials that I
 
03:14:07.190 --> 03:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
handed an example which is the 100 night
 
03:14:10.250 --> 03:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
shelter in Keene this shelter previously
 
03:14:11.929 --> 03:14:11.939 align:start position:0%
had a very inadequate number of
 
03:14:14.630 --> 03:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
transitional and and
 
03:14:14.640 --> 03:14:15.830 align:start position:0%
transitional and and
um

03:14:15.830 --> 03:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:18.769 --> 03:14:18.779 align:start position:0%
evening housing units so it's a both
 
03:14:20.950 --> 03:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
emergency shelter as well as
 
03:14:23.330 --> 03:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
transitional housing they needed to
 
03:14:25.070 --> 03:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
rebuild their facility because it was
 
03:14:28.130 --> 03:14:28.140 align:start position:0%
not safe and cdb Gene funds were
 
03:14:30.429 --> 03:14:30.439 align:start position:0%
invested to help with that rebuilding
 
03:14:33.530 --> 03:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
in addition you'll see Mid-State Health
 
03:14:36.349 --> 03:14:36.359 align:start position:0%
Mid-State Health Center had previously
 
03:14:37.849 --> 03:14:37.859 align:start position:0%
had a child care center which helped
 
03:14:39.590 --> 03:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
them to retain employees and also
 
03:14:42.349 --> 03:14:42.359 align:start position:0%
provide really necessary community-based
 
03:14:44.389 --> 03:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
child care to people that they serve
 
03:14:47.389 --> 03:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
they served about 16 families in their
 
03:14:48.830 --> 03:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
child care facility which is in the
 
03:14:50.809 --> 03:14:50.819 align:start position:0%
basement of a church the church needed
 
03:14:52.610 --> 03:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
that space and so they came to the block
 
03:14:54.650 --> 03:14:54.660 align:start position:0%
grant program to provide the grant
 
03:14:56.389 --> 03:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
funding that allowed them to leverage
 
03:14:59.690 --> 03:14:59.700 align:start position:0%
other resources and build a 60 student
 
03:15:01.910 --> 03:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
Child Care Center that's in a former
 
03:15:04.130 --> 03:15:04.140 align:start position:0%
Sears building in Plymouth this not only
 
03:15:06.050 --> 03:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
allows them to retain employees but it's
 
03:15:08.690 --> 03:15:08.700 align:start position:0%
also provided a much greater need to
 
03:15:10.550 --> 03:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
families across the region
 
03:15:12.530 --> 03:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
and then finally The Business technical
 
03:15:14.510 --> 03:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
assistance so those nearly 700
 
03:15:16.730 --> 03:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
businesses that were served over the
 
03:15:18.950 --> 03:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
last year when they come for Business
 
03:15:20.809 --> 03:15:20.819 align:start position:0%
technical assistance which is supported
 
03:15:22.730 --> 03:15:22.740 align:start position:0%
by the cdbg program they have to be low
 
03:15:24.290 --> 03:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
income so the business owner themselves
 
03:15:27.230 --> 03:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
has to have very low income after three
 
03:15:29.630 --> 03:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
years of assistance which is the maximum
 
03:15:33.230 --> 03:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
amount available we did a survey and
 
03:15:35.630 --> 03:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
nearly 95 percent of those businesses
 
03:15:37.190 --> 03:15:37.200 align:start position:0%
that were receiving that technical
 
03:15:39.710 --> 03:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
assistance were no longer low income so
 
03:15:41.570 --> 03:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
they had with this technical assistance
 
03:15:44.389 --> 03:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
actually grown uh the wages that they
 
03:15:46.250 --> 03:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
could receive from their business and
 
03:15:48.710 --> 03:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
been able to in many cases employ others
 
03:15:49.969 --> 03:15:49.979 align:start position:0%
in their community
 
03:15:52.130 --> 03:15:52.140 align:start position:0%
so we really see that these Investments
 
03:15:54.530 --> 03:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
over the last 20 years
 
03:15:54.540 --> 03:15:55.130 align:start position:0%
over the last 20 years
um

03:15:55.130 --> 03:15:55.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:58.610 --> 03:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
help communities cdfa provides this
 
03:16:00.469 --> 03:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
Administration into exceptionally cost
 
03:16:02.150 --> 03:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
efficient system for the State of New
 
03:16:04.490 --> 03:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all eligible New Hampshire
 
03:16:06.469 --> 03:16:06.479 align:start position:0%
municipalities and Counties have the
 
03:16:09.590 --> 03:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to access the total of 1.5
 
03:16:11.889 --> 03:16:11.899 align:start position:0%
million dollars annually
 
03:16:14.389 --> 03:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
they can use those resources to support
 
03:16:16.610 --> 03:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
affordable housing public facility
 
03:16:18.170 --> 03:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
improvements and economic development
 
03:16:20.330 --> 03:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
projects in addition there's emergency
 
03:16:22.610 --> 03:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
resources and planning resources to help
 
03:16:24.889 --> 03:16:24.899 align:start position:0%
communities to meet those needs the
 
03:16:26.570 --> 03:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
projects that are awarded are Community
 
03:16:28.910 --> 03:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
Driven they're driven by local leaders
 
03:16:30.710 --> 03:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
and community members that say they're
 
03:16:33.469 --> 03:16:33.479 align:start position:0%
necessary in their municipality
 
03:16:35.630 --> 03:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
we administer a competitive grant
 
03:16:37.370 --> 03:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
program that's how the the awards are
 
03:16:39.830 --> 03:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
made our staff conducts extensive
 
03:16:42.170 --> 03:16:42.180 align:start position:0%
programmatic and the financial review of
 
03:16:44.809 --> 03:16:44.819 align:start position:0%
each application in addition projects
 
03:16:47.090 --> 03:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
that meet all necessary criteria are
 
03:16:49.429 --> 03:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
invoted on by an independent 11-member
 
03:16:51.290 --> 03:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
Community Development advisory committee
 
03:16:53.090 --> 03:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
and finally then brought to our board of
 
03:16:55.190 --> 03:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
directors our board of directors is
 
03:16:57.230 --> 03:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor and approved
 
03:17:00.050 --> 03:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
by the governor and Council
 
03:17:01.910 --> 03:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
federal funds come with significant
 
03:17:03.950 --> 03:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
requirements to ensure these projects
 
03:17:06.469 --> 03:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
are successful cdfa's professional staff
 
03:17:08.870 --> 03:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
provide technical assistance and
 
03:17:10.849 --> 03:17:10.859 align:start position:0%
training to grantees throughout each
 
03:17:13.790 --> 03:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
phase of the project we also provide
 
03:17:16.670 --> 03:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
assistance through implementation both
 
03:17:18.410 --> 03:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
through direct technical assistance
 
03:17:20.630 --> 03:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
training and access to significant
 
03:17:22.429 --> 03:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
resources on our grants management
 
03:17:25.070 --> 03:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
system we work closely with Partners to
 
03:17:26.630 --> 03:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
find Creative Solutions and offer
 
03:17:28.730 --> 03:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
guidance to project development as well
 
03:17:30.469 --> 03:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
as to ease the burden of compliance
 
03:17:32.630 --> 03:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
protect the investment of these taxpayer
 
03:17:34.370 --> 03:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
funds as you can imagine these
 
03:17:36.410 --> 03:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
communities range from communities that
 
03:17:37.969 --> 03:17:37.979 align:start position:0%
have professional staff that help them
 
03:17:40.429 --> 03:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
to apply for and Advance these projects
 
03:17:42.349 --> 03:17:42.359 align:start position:0%
along with the project Administration
 
03:17:45.650 --> 03:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
that's provided by cdfa funds and then
 
03:17:48.230 --> 03:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
also communities that have a part-time
 
03:17:50.269 --> 03:17:50.279 align:start position:0%
person who's taking on many roles they
 
03:17:52.010 --> 03:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
can often be the welfare director as
 
03:17:53.570 --> 03:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
well as putting in these Community
 
03:17:55.790 --> 03:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
Development blocker and applications and
 
03:17:57.349 --> 03:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
we really want to assist all communities
 
03:17:59.389 --> 03:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
with these resources and ensure that
 
03:18:01.130 --> 03:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
their distributed attributed across the
 
03:18:01.140 --> 03:18:01.849 align:start position:0%
their distributed attributed across the
state

03:18:01.849 --> 03:18:01.859 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:18:03.950 --> 03:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
it's no it's worth noting that the
 
03:18:05.269 --> 03:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
carries act as state of New Hampshire
 
03:18:07.849 --> 03:18:07.859 align:start position:0%
was allocated an additional 14.3 million
 
03:18:10.910 --> 03:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
dollars to be deployed by cdsa to
 
03:18:13.610 --> 03:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
respond to the covid-19 pandemic These
 
03:18:15.230 --> 03:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
funds were used specifically for the
 
03:18:18.889 --> 03:18:18.899 align:start position:0%
prevention of the preparation for and
 
03:18:21.110 --> 03:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
the response to coven 19. these
 
03:18:22.969 --> 03:18:22.979 align:start position:0%
additional resources we did a few things
 
03:18:24.830 --> 03:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
we developed that public service program
 
03:18:27.530 --> 03:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
which the Sunshine Food Pantry was a
 
03:18:29.570 --> 03:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
part of and we also made it necessary
 
03:18:32.210 --> 03:18:32.220 align:start position:0%
public facility improvements to air
 
03:18:34.070 --> 03:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
quality in things like Child Care
 
03:18:35.929 --> 03:18:35.939 align:start position:0%
Facilities community centers food
 
03:18:38.510 --> 03:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
pantries and homeless shelters
 
03:18:40.969 --> 03:18:40.979 align:start position:0%
cares act resources were administered by
 
03:18:40.979 --> 03:18:43.130 align:start position:0%
cares act resources were administered by
cdfa

03:18:43.130 --> 03:18:43.140 align:start position:0%
cdfa
 
03:18:45.230 --> 03:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
and we have expended them in a very
 
03:18:47.269 --> 03:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
efficient way maybe that's actually one
 
03:18:48.950 --> 03:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
of the the first states in the country
 
03:18:52.269 --> 03:18:52.279 align:start position:0%
to meet Our obligation deadline
 
03:18:55.670 --> 03:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
cdfa's request is an increase from prior
 
03:18:58.010 --> 03:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
budget years and will enable cdfa to
 
03:18:59.570 --> 03:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
best meet the needs of New Hampshire's
 
03:19:01.910 --> 03:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
communities meeting those increased
 
03:19:03.469 --> 03:19:03.479 align:start position:0%
needs for technical assistance and
 
03:19:05.150 --> 03:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
training and providing leverage
 
03:19:07.610 --> 03:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
resources to this Federal program and
 
03:19:09.349 --> 03:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
covering the cost of the project
 
03:19:11.450 --> 03:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
Administration meeting that minimum
 
03:19:13.670 --> 03:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
State match requirement the requested
 
03:19:15.650 --> 03:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
support will ensure New Hampshire has
 
03:19:17.389 --> 03:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
continued access to millions of federal
 
03:19:19.790 --> 03:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
dollars that are meeting the needs of
 
03:19:22.550 --> 03:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
critical Economic Development projects
 
03:19:25.070 --> 03:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
across the state the U.S Department of
 
03:19:26.809 --> 03:19:26.819 align:start position:0%
Housing and Urban Development also known
 
03:19:29.870 --> 03:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
as HUD uses a formula to allocate its
 
03:19:31.969 --> 03:19:31.979 align:start position:0%
resources we anticipate that New
 
03:19:33.830 --> 03:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's total cdbg allocation will
 
03:19:35.990 --> 03:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
be nearly 21 million dollars over the
 
03:19:37.670 --> 03:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
next biennium
 
03:19:40.309 --> 03:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
cdfa respectfully requests the state of
 
03:19:42.110 --> 03:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire continue to provide the
 
03:19:43.610 --> 03:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
federally required match funding
 
03:19:47.650 --> 03:19:47.660 align:start position:0%
totaling 540 thousand dollars for the
 
03:19:50.630 --> 03:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
2024-2025 state fiscal years your
 
03:19:52.429 --> 03:19:52.439 align:start position:0%
support ensures the continued deployment
 
03:19:55.070 --> 03:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
of nearly 20 million one million dollars
 
03:19:57.769 --> 03:19:57.779 align:start position:0%
of resources thank you for considering
 
03:19:59.269 --> 03:19:59.279 align:start position:0%
our request and I'd be happy to answer
 
03:20:02.030 --> 03:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you
 
03:20:02.040 --> 03:20:04.010 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you
between

03:20:04.010 --> 03:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
between
 
03:20:05.750 --> 03:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
being responsible for help providing
 
03:20:08.030 --> 03:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
housing and child care you probably uh
 
03:20:10.790 --> 03:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
don't have much else to do do you
 
03:20:12.889 --> 03:20:12.899 align:start position:0%
uh my question really goes around the
 
03:20:14.630 --> 03:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
federal reporting
 
03:20:17.330 --> 03:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
um I realize that is very burdensome and
 
03:20:20.030 --> 03:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
for other agencies that have or
 
03:20:22.730 --> 03:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
departments that have had to that have
 
03:20:23.990 --> 03:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
03:20:25.670 --> 03:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
um you know they've run into problems
 
03:20:27.769 --> 03:20:27.779 align:start position:0%
and need additional staff and it takes
 
03:20:31.130 --> 03:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
long hours in overtime are you properly
 
03:20:34.309 --> 03:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
situated to be able to to continue to
 
03:20:36.530 --> 03:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
meet the federal reporting requirements
 
03:20:39.410 --> 03:20:39.420 align:start position:0%
yes yep so we've made continued
 
03:20:41.150 --> 03:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
investment in our staff and our systems
 
03:20:43.070 --> 03:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
to be sure that we're sort of catching
 
03:20:44.690 --> 03:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
up with staying
 
03:20:44.700 --> 03:20:45.550 align:start position:0%
up with staying
um

03:20:45.550 --> 03:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:48.650 --> 03:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
staying up to the requirements we do
 
03:20:50.210 --> 03:20:50.220 align:start position:0%
have some additional requirements this
 
03:20:52.309 --> 03:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
year a specific HUD requirement called
 
03:20:53.870 --> 03:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
section three which is quite
 
03:20:55.670 --> 03:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
unapplicable to New Hampshire but it's
 
03:20:57.170 --> 03:20:57.180 align:start position:0%
something we actually have to have our
 
03:20:59.150 --> 03:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
grantees understand for Port toss and we
 
03:21:01.309 --> 03:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
have to report but we're constantly
 
03:21:01.319 --> 03:21:02.750 align:start position:0%
have to report but we're constantly
really

03:21:02.750 --> 03:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:21:05.030 --> 03:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
staying on top of what will be upcoming
 
03:21:06.650 --> 03:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
in terms of additional reporting and
 
03:21:08.030 --> 03:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
ensuring that we're building that into
 
03:21:09.769 --> 03:21:09.779 align:start position:0%
our training and our systems and that we
 
03:21:12.170 --> 03:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
have staff capacity to do so okay do you
 
03:21:13.849 --> 03:21:13.859 align:start position:0%
have any unfront not on front but have
 
03:21:18.110 --> 03:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
any vacant funded positions currently we
 
03:21:20.510 --> 03:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
have a planned position that our
 
03:21:22.010 --> 03:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
director of Economic Development who's
 
03:21:24.590 --> 03:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
retiring who are planning to hire and
 
03:21:26.570 --> 03:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
we're hiring another position but
 
03:21:28.190 --> 03:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
they're but they're both anticipated
 
03:21:31.849 --> 03:21:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:33.830 --> 03:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh the only thing I want to say is that
 
03:21:36.830 --> 03:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
less people think that we um
 
03:21:39.650 --> 03:21:39.660 align:start position:0%
give half a million dollars uh by the
 
03:21:41.030 --> 03:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
way half a million dollars which is
 
03:21:43.670 --> 03:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
matched 42-1 or something like that
 
03:21:46.010 --> 03:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
which isn't bad
 
03:21:48.170 --> 03:21:48.180 align:start position:0%
um unless anybody think we just pass out
 
03:21:51.290 --> 03:21:51.300 align:start position:0%
and hope for the best from from uncdbg I
 
03:21:53.510 --> 03:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
would just note for people watching at
 
03:21:53.520 --> 03:21:54.650 align:start position:0%
would just note for people watching at
home

03:21:54.650 --> 03:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
home
 
03:21:54.660 --> 03:21:55.910 align:start position:0%
home
um

03:21:55.910 --> 03:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:57.769 --> 03:21:57.779 align:start position:0%
like you're more disappointed by the
 
03:22:00.110 --> 03:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
government Council uh and the advisory
 
03:22:02.210 --> 03:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
committee I think has at least a handful
 
03:22:03.950 --> 03:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
of State officials or gubernatorial
 
03:22:06.290 --> 03:22:06.300 align:start position:0%
appointees on it so that there's a lot
 
03:22:08.450 --> 03:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
of oversight yeah it has both Municipal
 
03:22:10.190 --> 03:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
and state officials
 
03:22:12.290 --> 03:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
um and they are all also appointed by
 
03:22:14.330 --> 03:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
the governor and Council
 
03:22:15.650 --> 03:22:15.660 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that question and we
 
03:22:17.389 --> 03:22:17.399 align:start position:0%
also provided today and is available on
 
03:22:19.190 --> 03:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
our website an annual report which
 
03:22:20.690 --> 03:22:20.700 align:start position:0%
specifically speaks to each of the
 
03:22:23.450 --> 03:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
Investments that are made each each year
 
03:22:26.389 --> 03:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
with the cdbg funds and other resources
 
03:22:29.950 --> 03:22:29.960 align:start position:0%
each of the cdbg
 
03:22:32.210 --> 03:22:32.220 align:start position:0%
allocations the recommendations actually
 
03:22:34.250 --> 03:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
from the cdac and then the board of
 
03:22:35.510 --> 03:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
directors also have to go to the
 
03:22:37.010 --> 03:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
governor and Council for approval so
 
03:22:38.929 --> 03:22:38.939 align:start position:0%
there to to your question there's
 
03:22:41.210 --> 03:22:41.220 align:start position:0%
significant oversight to these resources
 
03:22:43.250 --> 03:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
so we want to ensure that they can be
 
03:22:46.130 --> 03:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
widely access access by communities who
 
03:22:47.809 --> 03:22:47.819 align:start position:0%
really need them and then that we really
 
03:22:49.910 --> 03:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
are meeting those obligations on the
 
03:22:52.429 --> 03:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
federal side and there is a great level
 
03:22:55.309 --> 03:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
of uh input and oversight to the funding
 
03:22:58.550 --> 03:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
I I have a vague recollection and it's
 
03:22:59.990 --> 03:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
vague so
 
03:23:04.429 --> 03:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
um at one point cdfa employees or state
 
03:23:07.490 --> 03:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
employees then they transitioned and
 
03:23:09.710 --> 03:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
probably and so there are probably
 
03:23:11.870 --> 03:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
people a little bit like at peas who
 
03:23:13.729 --> 03:23:13.739 align:start position:0%
were in a transition period you don't
 
03:23:16.070 --> 03:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
have anybody left like that do you we do
 
03:23:19.429 --> 03:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
so our longest tenured employee 17 years
 
03:23:22.429 --> 03:23:22.439 align:start position:0%
with the organization is is retiring in
 
03:23:23.870 --> 03:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
the next number of years that's the
 
03:23:25.370 --> 03:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
position that we are recruiting for
 
03:23:26.750 --> 03:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
currently because we'll have a nice
 
03:23:29.150 --> 03:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
training overlap there he's the last
 
03:23:30.769 --> 03:23:30.779 align:start position:0%
person that was previously a state
 
03:23:36.170 --> 03:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:37.910 --> 03:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much thank you

03:24:14.100 --> 03:24:15.590 align:start position:0%
Information Technology also known as
doit

03:24:15.590 --> 03:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
doit
 
03:24:18.830 --> 03:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
ing me today is Ken Dunn Deputy
 
03:24:21.650 --> 03:24:21.660 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of doit Rose Curry Director
 
03:24:24.370 --> 03:24:24.380 align:start position:0%
of Finance and Megan Weber business
 
03:24:29.090 --> 03:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:31.010 --> 03:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
the department of Information Technology
 
03:24:33.110 --> 03:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is a centralized
 
03:24:35.090 --> 03:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
organization that's responsible for the
 
03:24:37.130 --> 03:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
I.T function of the executive branch of
 
03:24:39.590 --> 03:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
government in New Hampshire we're
 
03:24:41.389 --> 03:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
somewhat unique in the country and in
 
03:24:43.610 --> 03:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
the states and territories in that we've
 
03:24:45.710 --> 03:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
been centralized fully centralized for
 
03:24:46.929 --> 03:24:46.939 align:start position:0%
over a decade
 
03:24:50.150 --> 03:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh my peers around the country many of
 
03:24:51.410 --> 03:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
them are still focused on that
 
03:24:53.210 --> 03:24:53.220 align:start position:0%
centralization effort in their states
 
03:24:55.550 --> 03:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
and their territories so it's it's a
 
03:24:56.990 --> 03:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
real Advantage for New Hampshire for us
 
03:24:58.429 --> 03:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
to be in this position
 
03:25:01.070 --> 03:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
our responsibilities are outlined in RSA
 
03:25:01.080 --> 03:25:03.170 align:start position:0%
our responsibilities are outlined in RSA
21r

03:25:03.170 --> 03:25:03.180 align:start position:0%
21r
 
03:25:05.570 --> 03:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
um this budget is a collaborative effort
 
03:25:08.809 --> 03:25:08.819 align:start position:0%
between the folks in doit both in our
 
03:25:10.429 --> 03:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
centralized organization as well as in
 
03:25:12.769 --> 03:25:12.779 align:start position:0%
the agencies as well as agency agency
 
03:25:15.290 --> 03:25:15.300 align:start position:0%
personnel and of course the governor's
 
03:25:17.330 --> 03:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
budget director giving advice along the
 
03:25:17.340 --> 03:25:18.410 align:start position:0%
budget director giving advice along the
way

03:25:18.410 --> 03:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
way
 
03:25:20.630 --> 03:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go through I've you've got
 
03:25:22.309 --> 03:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
a pretty lengthy presentation here don't
 
03:25:24.290 --> 03:25:24.300 align:start position:0%
worry I'm not gonna I'm not going to
 
03:25:26.150 --> 03:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
take you through every detail here but
 
03:25:28.070 --> 03:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
we thought we have a reasonably complex
 
03:25:29.690 --> 03:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
budget we thought it important to supply
 
03:25:32.030 --> 03:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
this amount of transparency so for your
 
03:25:32.040 --> 03:25:33.290 align:start position:0%
this amount of transparency so for your
analysis

03:25:33.290 --> 03:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
03:25:36.650 --> 03:25:36.660 align:start position:0%
uh moving to page two uh we feel it's
 
03:25:38.929 --> 03:25:38.939 align:start position:0%
important to have a strategic plan
 
03:25:42.469 --> 03:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
um the uh the Strategic themes in our
 
03:25:45.290 --> 03:25:45.300 align:start position:0%
plan are there in that graphic
 
03:25:49.130 --> 03:25:49.140 align:start position:0%
um and uh the uh all of them are very
 
03:25:50.450 --> 03:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
important all of those themes are
 
03:25:51.650 --> 03:25:51.660 align:start position:0%
important we don't weigh one more
 
03:25:54.170 --> 03:25:54.180 align:start position:0%
importantly than the other but recently
 
03:25:55.729 --> 03:25:55.739 align:start position:0%
the effective Resource Management
 
03:25:58.370 --> 03:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
category has really risen to the top for
 
03:26:01.010 --> 03:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
us in that you know with the challenges
 
03:26:03.410 --> 03:26:03.420 align:start position:0%
we're seeing on the workforce side using
 
03:26:05.630 --> 03:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
technology to make these the folks that
 
03:26:07.610 --> 03:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
we can recruit and retain more effective
 
03:26:09.710 --> 03:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
is really important so a lot of focus
 
03:26:11.269 --> 03:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that reflected in our
 
03:26:13.010 --> 03:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
APNs today
 
03:26:16.190 --> 03:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
moving on to page three in the major
 
03:26:18.950 --> 03:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
program change space
 
03:26:20.630 --> 03:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
um without going through those first
 
03:26:23.210 --> 03:26:23.220 align:start position:0%
three paragraphs the the net of that
 
03:26:26.630 --> 03:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
there is expectations for us to improve
 
03:26:29.750 --> 03:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh productivity and access to data
 
03:26:32.870 --> 03:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
um that came about during covet have not
 
03:26:35.690 --> 03:26:35.700 align:start position:0%
diminished they've increased and so
 
03:26:37.550 --> 03:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
we're we're focused on
 
03:26:39.170 --> 03:26:39.180 align:start position:0%
um you know delivering what's expected
 
03:26:41.030 --> 03:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
of us in that area
 
03:26:43.570 --> 03:26:43.580 align:start position:0%
moving on to cyber security
 
03:26:46.370 --> 03:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
criminals and foreign actors continue to
 
03:26:48.910 --> 03:26:48.920 align:start position:0%
increase their capabilities
 
03:26:52.670 --> 03:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
that puts us in a position of adapting
 
03:26:55.070 --> 03:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
almost on a weekly basis to new things
 
03:26:56.929 --> 03:26:56.939 align:start position:0%
that we're learning in the market and
 
03:26:58.790 --> 03:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
that has implications on the budget
 
03:27:02.229 --> 03:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
which which we we continue to adapt to
 
03:27:05.929 --> 03:27:05.939 align:start position:0%
moving on to page four there's a lot of
 
03:27:07.969 --> 03:27:07.979 align:start position:0%
detail in this in the cyberspace but
 
03:27:09.950 --> 03:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
what I want to want you to to know is
 
03:27:13.010 --> 03:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
that we're focused on external self-eval
 
03:27:15.349 --> 03:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
external independent evaluation of our
 
03:27:17.210 --> 03:27:17.220 align:start position:0%
capabilities so that we don't miss
 
03:27:20.630 --> 03:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
things and continually adapting
 
03:27:23.750 --> 03:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
why is that so important that over the
 
03:27:28.190 --> 03:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
past five years or so the uh cyber
 
03:27:30.050 --> 03:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
threat landscape has
 
03:27:32.690 --> 03:27:32.700 align:start position:0%
um transitioned from a a theoretical
 
03:27:32.700 --> 03:27:33.830 align:start position:0%
um transitioned from a a theoretical
threat

03:27:33.830 --> 03:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
threat
 
03:27:38.570 --> 03:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
um you know to uh existential threats so
 
03:27:40.490 --> 03:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
with the Advent of ransomware where you
 
03:27:42.710 --> 03:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
see in organizations completely taken
 
03:27:45.830 --> 03:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
out of business and you've seen uh the
 
03:27:49.130 --> 03:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
impact of disinformation on the
 
03:27:50.870 --> 03:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
operation of government both in the
 
03:27:53.690 --> 03:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
state and the federal level so that that
 
03:27:56.330 --> 03:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
focus is really important for us
 
03:27:59.990 --> 03:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
moving on to page five again I will
 
03:28:02.630 --> 03:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
emphasize that the uh the operating
 
03:28:04.490 --> 03:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
budget was established collaboratively
 
03:28:06.530 --> 03:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
we try to communicate as much as
 
03:28:08.630 --> 03:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
possible with agencies we're not perfect
 
03:28:10.490 --> 03:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
at it and sometimes we have misses and
 
03:28:12.410 --> 03:28:12.420 align:start position:0%
we'll be I'm sure we'll be talking to
 
03:28:14.510 --> 03:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget director about you
 
03:28:16.130 --> 03:28:16.140 align:start position:0%
know those areas where we we have to
 
03:28:18.950 --> 03:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
work on as we go forward but it is our
 
03:28:20.809 --> 03:28:20.819 align:start position:0%
intent to be fully transparent to you
 
03:28:22.670 --> 03:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
and to the agencies as we develop the
 
03:28:22.680 --> 03:28:23.750 align:start position:0%
and to the agencies as we develop the
process

03:28:23.750 --> 03:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:28:26.570 --> 03:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
uh moving to the bottom half of page
 
03:28:28.849 --> 03:28:28.859 align:start position:0%
five these these what I call Cost
 
03:28:30.410 --> 03:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
drivers are really important I'm going
 
03:28:33.429 --> 03:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
to go through each one really quickly
 
03:28:36.110 --> 03:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
agencies are increasing their technology
 
03:28:38.750 --> 03:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
density they they were before covet it's
 
03:28:40.790 --> 03:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
accelerated and you'll you see that in
 
03:28:43.550 --> 03:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
reflected in the APNs
 
03:28:45.290 --> 03:28:45.300 align:start position:0%
um these resource needs in the second
 
03:28:46.809 --> 03:28:46.819 align:start position:0%
major bullet
 
03:28:49.790 --> 03:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
are increasing for a couple reasons one
 
03:28:53.030 --> 03:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
is there's new skills required to to
 
03:28:54.229 --> 03:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
implement a lot of these new
 
03:28:57.410 --> 03:28:57.420 align:start position:0%
technologies and and additionally
 
03:29:02.090 --> 03:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
um the uh the types of skills are ones
 
03:29:04.389 --> 03:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
that were less effective at of
 
03:29:07.190 --> 03:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
recruiting into state government because
 
03:29:10.429 --> 03:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
the wage inflation in those spaces has
 
03:29:12.469 --> 03:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
accelerated faster than the overall I.T
 
03:29:13.790 --> 03:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
wage inflation
 
03:29:16.690 --> 03:29:16.700 align:start position:0%
in the in the General market
 
03:29:20.210 --> 03:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
there's always some shift of from
 
03:29:22.429 --> 03:29:22.439 align:start position:0%
one-time expense to operating expense
 
03:29:26.110 --> 03:29:26.120 align:start position:0%
you'll see that reflected in the APNs
 
03:29:28.670 --> 03:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
the hardware and software vendors are
 
03:29:31.429 --> 03:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
now shifting away from the old school uh
 
03:29:33.830 --> 03:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
Capital intensive way of funding
 
03:29:36.889 --> 03:29:36.899 align:start position:0%
projects to a more operating expensive
 
03:29:40.190 --> 03:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
tense intensive that that's good for
 
03:29:42.469 --> 03:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
them in the sense that they have a
 
03:29:44.210 --> 03:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
they're able to be predictable on their
 
03:29:47.510 --> 03:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
financials as a company it's it's good
 
03:29:49.010 --> 03:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
for us in the long run because it makes
 
03:29:51.590 --> 03:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
us more transparent I.E we're reflecting
 
03:29:53.210 --> 03:29:53.220 align:start position:0%
what the actual spend is on an annual
 
03:29:56.389 --> 03:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
basis versus not but there's an
 
03:29:57.950 --> 03:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
adjustment period during that and we're
 
03:30:00.650 --> 03:30:00.660 align:start position:0%
in that adjustment period so you see you
 
03:30:01.790 --> 03:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
know instead of seeing the big Capital
 
03:30:03.769 --> 03:30:03.779 align:start position:0%
expense bump and then a you know a
 
03:30:05.630 --> 03:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
relatively low operating expense you
 
03:30:07.429 --> 03:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
might see a higher operating expense for
 
03:30:10.309 --> 03:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
some of these items over time
 
03:30:12.550 --> 03:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
um we're seeing pretty large
 
03:30:15.410 --> 03:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
inflation in the technology space for
 
03:30:18.769 --> 03:30:18.779 align:start position:0%
acquisition and life cycle of products
 
03:30:21.050 --> 03:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
is shortening going back to the cyber
 
03:30:22.849 --> 03:30:22.859 align:start position:0%
security threats
 
03:30:26.090 --> 03:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
um the fact that the threat landscape is
 
03:30:28.250 --> 03:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
changing more quickly our vendors have
 
03:30:30.290 --> 03:30:30.300 align:start position:0%
to change more quickly to protect data
 
03:30:33.710 --> 03:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
and and that is driving uh shortened
 
03:30:35.450 --> 03:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
life cycles
 
03:30:37.250 --> 03:30:37.260 align:start position:0%
Page Six
 
03:30:40.130 --> 03:30:40.140 align:start position:0%
the very top of the page we we look at
 
03:30:42.410 --> 03:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs in three
 
03:30:45.170 --> 03:30:45.180 align:start position:0%
different areas the first is what we
 
03:30:47.330 --> 03:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
call the you know one-time funding that
 
03:30:49.190 --> 03:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
is now generating
 
03:30:52.490 --> 03:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
um operating expense and in the future
 
03:30:54.950 --> 03:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
we'll probably add arpa funding to that
 
03:30:56.030 --> 03:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
although we're trying to be really
 
03:30:59.210 --> 03:30:59.220 align:start position:0%
careful not to you know do too much arpa
 
03:31:00.590 --> 03:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
funding that's generating that's going
 
03:31:02.389 --> 03:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
to generate long-term operating expense
 
03:31:05.870 --> 03:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
after the period of the the grant
 
03:31:08.809 --> 03:31:08.819 align:start position:0%
um the second type is structural or uh
 
03:31:10.370 --> 03:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
changes and we're seeing a lot of those
 
03:31:12.769 --> 03:31:12.779 align:start position:0%
because the inflation's driving you know
 
03:31:14.990 --> 03:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
contracts up
 
03:31:17.150 --> 03:31:17.160 align:start position:0%
um and then in the third category those
 
03:31:19.429 --> 03:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
are the initiatives that are truly new
 
03:31:22.370 --> 03:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
uh that they didn't have any previous
 
03:31:25.010 --> 03:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
impact on budgets
 
03:31:26.929 --> 03:31:26.939 align:start position:0%
um our accounting units are reflected in
 
03:31:29.330 --> 03:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
that table I'm going to go through them
 
03:31:31.010 --> 03:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
quickly there's more detail in the
 
03:31:33.290 --> 03:31:33.300 align:start position:0%
presentation that we'll get to
 
03:31:35.210 --> 03:31:35.220 align:start position:0%
now the first one is a bunch of
 
03:31:37.610 --> 03:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
different accounting units that are rep
 
03:31:39.650 --> 03:31:39.660 align:start position:0%
represent our direct agency budget
 
03:31:41.389 --> 03:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
that's for things that are agency
 
03:31:41.399 --> 03:31:42.710 align:start position:0%
that's for things that are agency
specific

03:31:42.710 --> 03:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
specific
 
03:31:44.990 --> 03:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
and so an agency's
 
03:31:47.330 --> 03:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
um direct budget is stuff for just them
 
03:31:49.849 --> 03:31:49.859 align:start position:0%
and them only
 
03:31:53.690 --> 03:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
um Central I.T Services is for stuff
 
03:31:56.030 --> 03:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
that's shared across the executive
 
03:31:58.849 --> 03:31:58.859 align:start position:0%
branch and those costs are allocated out
 
03:32:01.849 --> 03:32:01.859 align:start position:0%
to the agencies based on a formula
 
03:32:04.130 --> 03:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
yeah you usually the formula is is
 
03:32:06.530 --> 03:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
aligned to something that we think is
 
03:32:09.410 --> 03:32:09.420 align:start position:0%
common sense like uh usages if it's an
 
03:32:11.090 --> 03:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
application it's usage of that
 
03:32:14.210 --> 03:32:14.220 align:start position:0%
application by the by agencies one
 
03:32:16.790 --> 03:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
example is licensing where oplc has the
 
03:32:18.469 --> 03:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
Lion's Share of the licensing so for
 
03:32:20.990 --> 03:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
that that shared application they use
 
03:32:22.969 --> 03:32:22.979 align:start position:0%
they are actually build the Lion's Share
 
03:32:25.070 --> 03:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
of the cost for that application
 
03:32:28.070 --> 03:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
I.T salaries and benefits this is
 
03:32:30.830 --> 03:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
actually the staff the state workers who
 
03:32:32.929 --> 03:32:32.939 align:start position:0%
support executive branch agencies
 
03:32:35.990 --> 03:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
roughly half of them are dedicated
 
03:32:38.630 --> 03:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
directly to an agency and actually in
 
03:32:41.389 --> 03:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
most cases sit inside that agency and
 
03:32:44.389 --> 03:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
then the other half is shared resources
 
03:32:47.889 --> 03:32:47.899 align:start position:0%
like myself and and the folks here today
 
03:32:50.570 --> 03:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
we are our cost to the shared costs are
 
03:32:54.469 --> 03:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
allocated via a formula for that as well
 
03:32:56.090 --> 03:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
and then finally Statewide
 
03:32:59.389 --> 03:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
telecommunications which is a dedicated
 
03:33:02.650 --> 03:33:02.660 align:start position:0%
fund a non-lapsing fund which does
 
03:33:05.389 --> 03:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
telecommunications functions for the for
 
03:33:07.010 --> 03:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
the executive branch
 
03:33:09.229 --> 03:33:09.239 align:start position:0%
without going into too much detail it's
 
03:33:11.570 --> 03:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
really around on connectivity of all of
 
03:33:13.969 --> 03:33:13.979 align:start position:0%
our remote sites we have over 400 remote
 
03:33:16.190 --> 03:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
sites that we connect to what I call the
 
03:33:18.229 --> 03:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
mothership which is the central data
 
03:33:21.170 --> 03:33:21.180 align:start position:0%
center in Concord and additionally for
 
03:33:24.590 --> 03:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh the phones that might be on your desk
 
03:33:28.969 --> 03:33:28.979 align:start position:0%
and though that that funds is designed
 
03:33:32.510 --> 03:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
around the the premise of keeping a flat
 
03:33:36.050 --> 03:33:36.060 align:start position:0%
expense rate year over year and
 
03:33:39.769 --> 03:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
accumulating enough to not go back to
 
03:33:41.990 --> 03:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
the agencies during you know the every
 
03:33:43.610 --> 03:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
fifth or sixth year when we have to buy
 
03:33:46.969 --> 03:33:46.979 align:start position:0%
stuff so we over collect just enough
 
03:33:49.550 --> 03:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're buying that
 
03:33:52.070 --> 03:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
centralized equipment that we need so so
 
03:33:53.210 --> 03:33:53.220 align:start position:0%
that we're not
 
03:33:55.070 --> 03:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
um you know having a bumpy expense curve
 
03:33:57.530 --> 03:33:57.540 align:start position:0%
is what I call it
 
03:33:57.540 --> 03:33:59.510 align:start position:0%
is what I call it
um

03:33:59.510 --> 03:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:02.330 --> 03:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
so when you look at the um the totals
 
03:34:04.190 --> 03:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
there um you can see that there's a very
 
03:34:06.290 --> 03:34:06.300 align:start position:0%
significant amount of additional
 
03:34:08.990 --> 03:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs uh relative compared
 
03:34:11.210 --> 03:34:11.220 align:start position:0%
to previous budgets and we'll take you
 
03:34:14.389 --> 03:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
through those details as we go
 
03:34:17.030 --> 03:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
um let's move on to page seven if we
 
03:34:17.040 --> 03:34:18.530 align:start position:0%
um let's move on to page seven if we
could

03:34:18.530 --> 03:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:34:21.110 --> 03:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
um without going into any detail here um
 
03:34:23.330 --> 03:34:23.340 align:start position:0%
that the main point of this is you can
 
03:34:26.929 --> 03:34:26.939 align:start position:0%
see the breakdowns by class line there's
 
03:34:28.849 --> 03:34:28.859 align:start position:0%
no no drama there at all it's pretty
 
03:34:30.889 --> 03:34:30.899 align:start position:0%
straightforward and the efficiency
 
03:34:33.950 --> 03:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
targets have essentially been met
 
03:34:36.530 --> 03:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
page eight
 
03:34:38.769 --> 03:34:38.779 align:start position:0%
um top of the page that table
 
03:34:41.870 --> 03:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
goes over additional prioritized needs
 
03:34:43.969 --> 03:34:43.979 align:start position:0%
by category
 
03:34:46.210 --> 03:34:46.220 align:start position:0%
um and and it it shows the percent
 
03:34:49.570 --> 03:34:49.580 align:start position:0%
contribution from the various categories
 
03:34:53.389 --> 03:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
fairly small on Telecom
 
03:34:56.990 --> 03:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
the I.T salaries and benefits has an
 
03:34:59.809 --> 03:34:59.819 align:start position:0%
impact there Central Services relates
 
03:35:02.330 --> 03:35:02.340 align:start position:0%
back to that efficiency of or
 
03:35:03.830 --> 03:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of employees and we'll
 
03:35:07.250 --> 03:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
talk more about that and then the agency
 
03:35:09.349 --> 03:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
direct is the Lion's Share of the
 
03:35:12.889 --> 03:35:12.899 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs and there
 
03:35:18.110 --> 03:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
is a appendix that's that goes with this
 
03:35:21.110 --> 03:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
presentation attachment a has a full
 
03:35:23.269 --> 03:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
detail of all the agency additional
 
03:35:25.670 --> 03:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs it describes so I
 
03:35:29.150 --> 03:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
encourage you to read every line of that
 
03:35:32.950 --> 03:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
the um moving down to
 
03:35:36.410 --> 03:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
the second table on page eight that
 
03:35:38.929 --> 03:35:38.939 align:start position:0%
really details out these additional
 
03:35:40.910 --> 03:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs by classline so you
 
03:35:42.910 --> 03:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
can really see where the impacts are
 
03:35:46.910 --> 03:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
software and Consultants so that's
 
03:35:49.849 --> 03:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
really the big the big item there and
 
03:35:49.859 --> 03:35:51.290 align:start position:0%
really the big the big item there and
again

03:35:51.290 --> 03:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:35:55.490 --> 03:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:58.610 --> 03:35:58.620 align:start position:0%
let's go on to page nine now and we'll
 
03:36:00.410 --> 03:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
start to get a little more detail on
 
03:36:03.309 --> 03:36:03.319 align:start position:0%
these accounting units on the direct
 
03:36:05.630 --> 03:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
accounting units as I described before
 
03:36:08.750 --> 03:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
those are agency specific
 
03:36:10.790 --> 03:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
um you see that there's almost 18
 
03:36:11.990 --> 03:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars of additional
 
03:36:14.210 --> 03:36:14.220 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs there out of a total
 
03:36:16.969 --> 03:36:16.979 align:start position:0%
of 20 about 24 so pretty significant
 
03:36:19.130 --> 03:36:19.140 align:start position:0%
contribution there and that's stuff that
 
03:36:21.469 --> 03:36:21.479 align:start position:0%
the agencies themselves prioritized for
 
03:36:24.050 --> 03:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
for consideration in the in the budget
 
03:36:24.060 --> 03:36:25.790 align:start position:0%
for consideration in the in the budget
process

03:36:25.790 --> 03:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:36:28.130 --> 03:36:28.140 align:start position:0%
we like to do a little bit of analysis
 
03:36:31.010 --> 03:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
of on on things and when we look at the
 
03:36:32.870 --> 03:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
direct budget you can see on the the
 
03:36:35.210 --> 03:36:35.220 align:start position:0%
second table that
 
03:36:37.910 --> 03:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
um you know over 92 percent of the
 
03:36:40.849 --> 03:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
agency efficiency budget is represented
 
03:36:44.389 --> 03:36:44.399 align:start position:0%
by six agencies so you can kind of get a
 
03:36:46.250 --> 03:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
sense for the impact there and then then
 
03:36:47.929 --> 03:36:47.939 align:start position:0%
there's a whole bunch of other agencies
 
03:36:49.729 --> 03:36:49.739 align:start position:0%
that that are the remaining eight
 
03:36:53.690 --> 03:36:53.700 align:start position:0%
percent and then moving on to page 10
 
03:36:56.090 --> 03:36:56.100 align:start position:0%
we can see that there are five agencies
 
03:36:58.370 --> 03:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
that are accounting for the Lion's Share
 
03:37:01.849 --> 03:37:01.859 align:start position:0%
of 90 of the agency additional
 
03:37:06.290 --> 03:37:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:09.650 --> 03:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
moving on to page 11 we will look at
 
03:37:12.710 --> 03:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
Central Services and operations again
 
03:37:16.250 --> 03:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
the efficiency budget hit targets a
 
03:37:19.130 --> 03:37:19.140 align:start position:0%
little under actually uh there were some
 
03:37:20.750 --> 03:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
structural things there you you would
 
03:37:23.690 --> 03:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
notice that in the in the agency budget
 
03:37:25.969 --> 03:37:25.979 align:start position:0%
it was a little the efficiency looked a
 
03:37:27.050 --> 03:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
little higher
 
03:37:29.030 --> 03:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
this one looks a little lower because we
 
03:37:30.650 --> 03:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
actually moved
 
03:37:33.349 --> 03:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
um some money from one category to the
 
03:37:35.809 --> 03:37:35.819 align:start position:0%
other so the net was really this there's
 
03:37:37.610 --> 03:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
no impact that's why we're stating even
 
03:37:39.170 --> 03:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
though you might have seen in the agency
 
03:37:41.750 --> 03:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
direct us a little high in the shared
 
03:37:44.570 --> 03:37:44.580 align:start position:0%
services a little low from a from agency
 
03:37:46.370 --> 03:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
efficiency perspective but really if you
 
03:37:48.170 --> 03:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
net that out it's it's right there and
 
03:37:51.050 --> 03:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
you can see that in the total
 
03:37:51.060 --> 03:37:51.769 align:start position:0%
you can see that in the total
um

03:37:51.769 --> 03:37:51.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:54.830 --> 03:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
so the agency additional prioritized
 
03:37:57.469 --> 03:37:57.479 align:start position:0%
needs again are significant relative to
 
03:37:59.690 --> 03:37:59.700 align:start position:0%
the efficiency requests and we'll we'll
 
03:38:02.090 --> 03:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit more about those on
 
03:38:05.090 --> 03:38:05.100 align:start position:0%
page 12.
 
03:38:07.910 --> 03:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
um I want to call attention to the first
 
03:38:10.190 --> 03:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
four items on there there's there's
 
03:38:13.610 --> 03:38:13.620 align:start position:0%
quite a few items as you can see
 
03:38:16.309 --> 03:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
um the first four really focused on
 
03:38:17.990 --> 03:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
those the areas I was talking about
 
03:38:22.849 --> 03:38:22.859 align:start position:0%
earlier which is the what we found is a
 
03:38:25.849 --> 03:38:25.859 align:start position:0%
you know the implementation of new
 
03:38:28.790 --> 03:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
software during covet and now in an
 
03:38:31.190 --> 03:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
ongoing basis has really had an impact
 
03:38:34.370 --> 03:38:34.380 align:start position:0%
on effectiveness of existing employees
 
03:38:37.429 --> 03:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
that were able to recruit and retain and
 
03:38:40.130 --> 03:38:40.140 align:start position:0%
there's the fact that agencies are
 
03:38:42.950 --> 03:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
seeing this has created a real strong
 
03:38:44.990 --> 03:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
desire to keep going on that to continue
 
03:38:47.389 --> 03:38:47.399 align:start position:0%
to invest in that space so I would look
 
03:38:50.710 --> 03:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
at those Investments as investments in
 
03:38:54.290 --> 03:38:54.300 align:start position:0%
continuing to make help the existing
 
03:38:54.300 --> 03:38:55.429 align:start position:0%
continuing to make help the existing
employees

03:38:55.429 --> 03:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
employees
 
03:38:58.190 --> 03:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
in the executive branch more effective
 
03:39:00.229 --> 03:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
in their jobs as we go forward
 
03:39:01.729 --> 03:39:01.739 align:start position:0%
the others there's a whole bunch of
 
03:39:03.530 --> 03:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
detail there I could go through each one
 
03:39:05.570 --> 03:39:05.580 align:start position:0%
of them but I'm not going to because I
 
03:39:07.610 --> 03:39:07.620 align:start position:0%
know I'm between you and lunch but if
 
03:39:10.010 --> 03:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
anybody has any questions you know after
 
03:39:12.229 --> 03:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
we terminate the presentation I'd be
 
03:39:14.210 --> 03:39:14.220 align:start position:0%
happy to answer details on any one of
 
03:39:16.070 --> 03:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
those I actually have a pretty good idea
 
03:39:17.830 --> 03:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
of what they all are
 
03:39:20.929 --> 03:39:20.939 align:start position:0%
moving on to page 13 salaries and
 
03:39:22.849 --> 03:39:22.859 align:start position:0%
benefits again pretty straightforward
 
03:39:25.870 --> 03:39:25.880 align:start position:0%
there's some there's some
 
03:39:28.370 --> 03:39:28.380 align:start position:0%
notable additional prioritized needs
 
03:39:29.690 --> 03:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
there which I'm going to take you
 
03:39:32.210 --> 03:39:32.220 align:start position:0%
through but I want to call attention to
 
03:39:34.250 --> 03:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
the bottom proposed House Bill 2
 
03:39:34.260 --> 03:39:35.349 align:start position:0%
the bottom proposed House Bill 2
language

03:39:35.349 --> 03:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:39:41.269 --> 03:39:41.279 align:start position:0%
in 21r today my four appointed directors
 
03:39:44.630 --> 03:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
are kind of generic in there and so
 
03:39:47.269 --> 03:39:47.279 align:start position:0%
we're addressing that by we are
 
03:39:49.729 --> 03:39:49.739 align:start position:0%
requesting that we specifically name
 
03:39:52.550 --> 03:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
those those functions it puts having
 
03:39:54.290 --> 03:39:54.300 align:start position:0%
them generic gives us more flexibility
 
03:39:57.590 --> 03:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
and but having them named is easier to
 
03:39:59.750 --> 03:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
administer because when if we're asking
 
03:40:02.210 --> 03:40:02.220 align:start position:0%
to nominate somebody for example the
 
03:40:03.349 --> 03:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
administrative services and the
 
03:40:05.389 --> 03:40:05.399 align:start position:0%
executive Council and and anybody can
 
03:40:07.070 --> 03:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
kind of see where that's pointed so
 
03:40:09.590 --> 03:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
we'll basically should we change the
 
03:40:11.690 --> 03:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
name or function of these divisions in
 
03:40:14.210 --> 03:40:14.220 align:start position:0%
the future we would have to come back on
 
03:40:16.610 --> 03:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
a biennial budget cycle and change them
 
03:40:19.550 --> 03:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
or even on an annual legislative cycle
 
03:40:21.969 --> 03:40:21.979 align:start position:0%
through through
 
03:40:24.590 --> 03:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation
 
03:40:28.550 --> 03:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
moving on to page 14
 
03:40:32.030 --> 03:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
um talking about the what drove the
 
03:40:34.250 --> 03:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs related to
 
03:40:35.809 --> 03:40:35.819 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits and there's a
 
03:40:38.269 --> 03:40:38.279 align:start position:0%
there's a few areas there I'll go
 
03:40:39.610 --> 03:40:39.620 align:start position:0%
through really quickly
 
03:40:43.010 --> 03:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
there's two what I call Strategic 7D
 
03:40:45.170 --> 03:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
positions that is the chief what I'm
 
03:40:46.849 --> 03:40:46.859 align:start position:0%
calling the Chief privacy officer
 
03:40:49.010 --> 03:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
function kind of a big deal for New
 
03:40:51.830 --> 03:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what we're seeing is at this
 
03:40:54.710 --> 03:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
date I believe there are seven states
 
03:40:57.410 --> 03:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
that have Chief priority uh privacy
 
03:41:00.410 --> 03:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
officers it's growing number and
 
03:41:03.530 --> 03:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
um and the reason is uh you know privacy
 
03:41:05.929 --> 03:41:05.939 align:start position:0%
uh is becoming an issue internationally
 
03:41:07.670 --> 03:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
and nationally
 
03:41:09.710 --> 03:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
as well as in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:41:12.410 --> 03:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
and we don't have a function that
 
03:41:15.530 --> 03:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
manages that in a coordinated way so
 
03:41:17.090 --> 03:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
when when something comes up for example
 
03:41:18.590 --> 03:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
from a cyber security perspective
 
03:41:20.990 --> 03:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's in the legislature or an
 
03:41:23.150 --> 03:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
inquiry we have a function we have a
 
03:41:25.910 --> 03:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
strategic plan we have policies all of
 
03:41:27.410 --> 03:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
that in place that people can look at
 
03:41:29.330 --> 03:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
and they can evaluate whether it's good
 
03:41:31.429 --> 03:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
or not we don't have that for New
 
03:41:33.769 --> 03:41:33.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so it's always a a question
 
03:41:35.809 --> 03:41:35.819 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about privacy whether
 
03:41:38.330 --> 03:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
it's it's in legislation proposed
 
03:41:41.030 --> 03:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
legislation or whether it's in inquiry
 
03:41:42.469 --> 03:41:42.479 align:start position:0%
so I think that's important for New
 
03:41:45.229 --> 03:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to do this now it's in as a
 
03:41:48.410 --> 03:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
shared proposal here in shared budget
 
03:41:51.650 --> 03:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
but from a purity perspective I would I
 
03:41:54.650 --> 03:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
would prefer that it show up as a a
 
03:41:57.650 --> 03:41:57.660 align:start position:0%
general funded non-aligned I.E not paid
 
03:42:00.590 --> 03:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
for by agencies because what we would
 
03:42:02.870 --> 03:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
want to do is should these two positions
 
03:42:05.389 --> 03:42:05.399 align:start position:0%
get funded we would also want companion
 
03:42:08.929 --> 03:42:08.939 align:start position:0%
legislation that gets added in to 21r
 
03:42:12.349 --> 03:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
that establishes the uh the duties and
 
03:42:14.809 --> 03:42:14.819 align:start position:0%
authority of the Chief privacy officer
 
03:42:14.819 --> 03:42:15.769 align:start position:0%
authority of the Chief privacy officer
function

03:42:15.769 --> 03:42:15.779 align:start position:0%
function
 
03:42:18.830 --> 03:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
looking at the some of these other I'll
 
03:42:23.150 --> 03:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
just jump to liquor those are two 7ds
 
03:42:25.969 --> 03:42:25.979 align:start position:0%
that were um that liquor asked for to
 
03:42:29.389 --> 03:42:29.399 align:start position:0%
help out with their um their new finance
 
03:42:31.910 --> 03:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
and point of sale system and there's a
 
03:42:34.250 --> 03:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
number of others you heard Monica talk
 
03:42:36.309 --> 03:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
about the treasury part-time
 
03:42:39.650 --> 03:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
safety Revenue both have some
 
03:42:41.210 --> 03:42:41.220 align:start position:0%
requirements there that they want and
 
03:42:43.010 --> 03:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
the details in the additional
 
03:42:47.450 --> 03:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs list and um HHS is
 
03:42:50.290 --> 03:42:50.300 align:start position:0%
kind of self-explanatory the the
 
03:42:52.670 --> 03:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
ones on the bottom the three positions
 
03:42:54.349 --> 03:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
on the bottom were really focused on
 
03:42:56.870 --> 03:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
there's a LBA audit finding that was
 
03:42:59.330 --> 03:42:59.340 align:start position:0%
around the kind of the fairness of the
 
03:43:02.150 --> 03:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
I.T lead function or the distribution of
 
03:43:05.269 --> 03:43:05.279 align:start position:0%
it leads we've been slowly uh biennium
 
03:43:07.250 --> 03:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
after biennium trying to chip away at
 
03:43:10.250 --> 03:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
that to make you know the allocation of
 
03:43:12.889 --> 03:43:12.899 align:start position:0%
resources more more fair and Equitable
 
03:43:14.389 --> 03:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
across the way we you know if we either
 
03:43:15.889 --> 03:43:15.899 align:start position:0%
try to fix it all at once it would have
 
03:43:18.170 --> 03:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
been too big of an impact so we're
 
03:43:21.410 --> 03:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
asking for consideration on that
 
03:43:23.269 --> 03:43:23.279 align:start position:0%
um and then finally at the bottom of
 
03:43:26.750 --> 03:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
this page we have uh House Bill 2
 
03:43:28.969 --> 03:43:28.979 align:start position:0%
language this language was in is in this
 
03:43:28.979 --> 03:43:30.650 align:start position:0%
language this language was in is in this
biennium

03:43:30.650 --> 03:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
03:43:32.510 --> 03:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
um it's really helpful for our
 
03:43:33.950 --> 03:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness because what what
 
03:43:36.050 --> 03:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
basically what it says is where you know
 
03:43:37.729 --> 03:43:37.739 align:start position:0%
we can't over expend our our
 
03:43:40.190 --> 03:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation obviously but what we
 
03:43:42.410 --> 03:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
could do is of those I believe it's
 
03:43:44.210 --> 03:43:44.220 align:start position:0%
seven unfunded positions say somebody
 
03:43:46.610 --> 03:43:46.620 align:start position:0%
leaves and we see an unfunded position
 
03:43:49.010 --> 03:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
that's more appropriate for what the
 
03:43:50.510 --> 03:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
challenges are of the state at that time
 
03:43:53.269 --> 03:43:53.279 align:start position:0%
we could fund that one and unfund the
 
03:43:56.210 --> 03:43:56.220 align:start position:0%
other one and and not and not as long as
 
03:43:58.190 --> 03:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
we don't go over the appropriation
 
03:43:58.200 --> 03:43:59.450 align:start position:0%
we don't go over the appropriation
um

03:43:59.450 --> 03:43:59.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:01.010 --> 03:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
we're not likely to go over the
 
03:44:02.929 --> 03:44:02.939 align:start position:0%
appropriation given the vacancy rate
 
03:44:04.670 --> 03:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
we're running so it's it's not a
 
03:44:06.410 --> 03:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
challenge there
 
03:44:08.650 --> 03:44:08.660 align:start position:0%
um and and I think we're at uh was it
 
03:44:12.530 --> 03:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
12.7 right now I think percent yeah so
 
03:44:14.570 --> 03:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
we were relatively no low compared to
 
03:44:16.130 --> 03:44:16.140 align:start position:0%
some but still higher than historical
 
03:44:17.929 --> 03:44:17.939 align:start position:0%
for us
 
03:44:22.490 --> 03:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
um so moving on to page 15 this is just
 
03:44:23.809 --> 03:44:23.819 align:start position:0%
not going to say anything other than
 
03:44:25.429 --> 03:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
these are adjustments that were
 
03:44:27.410 --> 03:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
requested since we've initially
 
03:44:30.110 --> 03:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
submitted the budget
 
03:44:32.750 --> 03:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
page 16 is an org chart where you can
 
03:44:36.290 --> 03:44:36.300 align:start position:0%
see how the the author uh proposed
 
03:44:37.670 --> 03:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
authorized positions would be
 
03:44:39.830 --> 03:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
distributed in our organization and
 
03:44:42.229 --> 03:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
you'll see the the bottom
 
03:44:44.510 --> 03:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
um we didn't want to be presumptuous so
 
03:44:48.130 --> 03:44:48.140 align:start position:0%
the bottom um boxes are the appointed
 
03:44:50.809 --> 03:44:50.819 align:start position:0%
appointed individuals that we mentioned
 
03:44:52.849 --> 03:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
earlier but we're keeping the old names
 
03:44:55.190 --> 03:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
that they currently have now and that we
 
03:44:57.590 --> 03:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
would change the org chart if the if the
 
03:44:59.690 --> 03:44:59.700 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 language were to be signed
 
03:45:01.070 --> 03:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
into law
 
03:45:04.550 --> 03:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
and then finally on page 17 Statewide
 
03:45:08.090 --> 03:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
telecommunications again this is this is
 
03:45:11.570 --> 03:45:11.580 align:start position:0%
um primarily we over collect
 
03:45:13.849 --> 03:45:13.859 align:start position:0%
to fund the purchase of core Network
 
03:45:17.769 --> 03:45:17.779 align:start position:0%
equipment every five to six years
 
03:45:22.490 --> 03:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
we we over collect a little bit to fund
 
03:45:27.429 --> 03:45:27.439 align:start position:0%
the staff that supports those 400 plus
 
03:45:30.229 --> 03:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
remote locations connectivity back to
 
03:45:32.389 --> 03:45:32.399 align:start position:0%
the Mothership and other network
 
03:45:36.110 --> 03:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
functions inside the state and the last
 
03:45:37.849 --> 03:45:37.859 align:start position:0%
time we went before the Joint Committee
 
03:45:39.950 --> 03:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
for dedicated funds we were able to show
 
03:45:43.490 --> 03:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
that we were almost exactly collecting
 
03:45:45.410 --> 03:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
what we needed to keep that running so
 
03:45:47.210 --> 03:45:47.220 align:start position:0%
we're doing a d I think we're doing a
 
03:45:49.190 --> 03:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
decent job of not over collecting which
 
03:45:50.870 --> 03:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
is always a concern with a dedicated
 
03:45:53.630 --> 03:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
fund that concludes my formal testimony
 
03:45:56.389 --> 03:45:56.399 align:start position:0%
and I'm ready for questions
 
03:45:59.690 --> 03:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:01.309 --> 03:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
I know
 
03:46:03.530 --> 03:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
um recruiting new employees has been
 
03:46:05.990 --> 03:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
been difficult uh I don't know if you
 
03:46:07.309 --> 03:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
could if you have it off the top of your
 
03:46:09.610 --> 03:46:09.620 align:start position:0%
head what your vacancy rate is
 
03:46:18.290 --> 03:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:19.969 --> 03:46:19.979 align:start position:0%
how difficult has it been to find
 
03:46:19.979 --> 03:46:21.469 align:start position:0%
how difficult has it been to find
Consultants

03:46:21.469 --> 03:46:21.479 align:start position:0%
Consultants
 
03:46:23.690 --> 03:46:23.700 align:start position:0%
Consultants or state employees okay
 
03:46:27.170 --> 03:46:27.180 align:start position:0%
Consultants Consultants um well when we
 
03:46:28.809 --> 03:46:28.819 align:start position:0%
talk about wages
 
03:46:30.950 --> 03:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
given an unlimited budget it's probably
 
03:46:32.870 --> 03:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
easy but given the constraints you have
 
03:46:35.330 --> 03:46:35.340 align:start position:0%
so Consultants well it's really an
 
03:46:36.950 --> 03:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
interesting phenomenon because all
 
03:46:36.960 --> 03:46:38.389 align:start position:0%
interesting phenomenon because all
entities

03:46:38.389 --> 03:46:38.399 align:start position:0%
entities
 
03:46:40.250 --> 03:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
in in the country or having trouble
 
03:46:43.250 --> 03:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
recruiting technical Talent so every all
 
03:46:45.170 --> 03:46:45.180 align:start position:0%
states all private sector are competing
 
03:46:47.809 --> 03:46:47.819 align:start position:0%
for the same set of Consulting resources
 
03:46:50.210 --> 03:46:50.220 align:start position:0%
so what has that done it's driven the
 
03:46:53.330 --> 03:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
cost up very significantly it's also
 
03:46:55.729 --> 03:46:55.739 align:start position:0%
driven in the availability down of
 
03:46:57.830 --> 03:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
certain particularly high demand
 
03:47:00.590 --> 03:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
resources most particularly cyber
 
03:47:03.469 --> 03:47:03.479 align:start position:0%
security and some of the major platforms
 
03:47:06.349 --> 03:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
that are that are expanding quickly in
 
03:47:08.990 --> 03:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
around the world like salesforce.com and
 
03:47:12.110 --> 03:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
Microsoft Dynamics 365 and we have both
 
03:47:14.570 --> 03:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
those platforms in our state
 
03:47:14.580 --> 03:47:16.030 align:start position:0%
those platforms in our state
okay

03:47:16.030 --> 03:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:47:18.530 --> 03:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
uh most change with state government
 
03:47:20.929 --> 03:47:20.939 align:start position:0%
moves sort of at glacial speeds I mean
 
03:47:23.510 --> 03:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
change does not come quickly to state
 
03:47:25.610 --> 03:47:25.620 align:start position:0%
government I think that really changed
 
03:47:27.889 --> 03:47:27.899 align:start position:0%
dramatically with with the covet
 
03:47:27.899 --> 03:47:29.030 align:start position:0%
dramatically with with the covet
pandemic

03:47:29.030 --> 03:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
03:47:31.790 --> 03:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
and now we we don't do business the way
 
03:47:34.370 --> 03:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
we used to I think from a budgetary
 
03:47:36.590 --> 03:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
standpoint what I would hope would be
 
03:47:39.110 --> 03:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
that was a blip that we had expenses
 
03:47:41.090 --> 03:47:41.100 align:start position:0%
coming in for the fear you know for a
 
03:47:43.010 --> 03:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
few years and now we can go more to the
 
03:47:45.349 --> 03:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
the old Baseline that doesn't seem to be
 
03:47:47.389 --> 03:47:47.399 align:start position:0%
the case it seems that that the current
 
03:47:49.370 --> 03:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
for a variety of reasons including
 
03:47:51.830 --> 03:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
people liking working at home for both
 
03:47:54.769 --> 03:47:54.779 align:start position:0%
recruiting of of employees and other
 
03:47:59.929 --> 03:47:59.939 align:start position:0%
reasons uh that that's that's the case
 
03:48:01.849 --> 03:48:01.859 align:start position:0%
um do you agree with that that we now
 
03:48:04.130 --> 03:48:04.140 align:start position:0%
had a new Baseline and
 
03:48:06.290 --> 03:48:06.300 align:start position:0%
do you have sort of a back of the
 
03:48:06.300 --> 03:48:07.490 align:start position:0%
do you have sort of a back of the
envelope

03:48:07.490 --> 03:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
envelope
 
03:48:10.910 --> 03:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
projection is what covet cost us because
 
03:48:12.710 --> 03:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
most people think working from home is
 
03:48:15.229 --> 03:48:15.239 align:start position:0%
is a cost saving measure and that's true
 
03:48:17.330 --> 03:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
for many years but not I.T because you
 
03:48:19.849 --> 03:48:19.859 align:start position:0%
have to provide not only the the laptops
 
03:48:22.190 --> 03:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
but the cameras the microphones the
 
03:48:23.929 --> 03:48:23.939 align:start position:0%
security to
 
03:48:27.110 --> 03:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
secure all those and that seems to be
 
03:48:29.690 --> 03:48:29.700 align:start position:0%
like it's that's going forward well yeah
 
03:48:32.510 --> 03:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
really good really good question
 
03:48:36.050 --> 03:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
um so the so the impacts of the telework
 
03:48:40.070 --> 03:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh or I call the DS diaspora of uh I was
 
03:48:41.870 --> 03:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
just State offices and then back into it
 
03:48:44.630 --> 03:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
to a great extent that that's reflected
 
03:48:47.210 --> 03:48:47.220 align:start position:0%
in the budget we're now in so you don't
 
03:48:49.729 --> 03:48:49.739 align:start position:0%
see any of that in the uh you know
 
03:48:51.349 --> 03:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
that's sitting in the efficiency budget
 
03:48:54.410 --> 03:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
now for this this efficiency budget what
 
03:48:58.010 --> 03:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
what you're seeing is I believe is this
 
03:49:00.650 --> 03:49:00.660 align:start position:0%
you know a couple of things one from an
 
03:49:02.210 --> 03:49:02.220 align:start position:0%
agency perspective there's a lot of
 
03:49:05.150 --> 03:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
pretty old applications out there that
 
03:49:07.010 --> 03:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
need to be modernized and so that's
 
03:49:08.750 --> 03:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
driving things and then there's that
 
03:49:11.870 --> 03:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
need to get things done with fewer
 
03:49:14.929 --> 03:49:14.939 align:start position:0%
employees and so you're seeing that both
 
03:49:16.790 --> 03:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
in this budget as well as you know some
 
03:49:18.410 --> 03:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
of the requests the Harper requests that
 
03:49:21.229 --> 03:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
have been that have been funded in in
 
03:49:22.910 --> 03:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
the state that we're that we're
 
03:49:25.190 --> 03:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
operationalizing now so I think the big
 
03:49:26.769 --> 03:49:26.779 align:start position:0%
thing really is
 
03:49:29.929 --> 03:49:29.939 align:start position:0%
the impacts we're seeing on from a large
 
03:49:32.630 --> 03:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
perspective are the impacts of of that
 
03:49:35.090 --> 03:49:35.100 align:start position:0%
shifting to an operating expense model
 
03:49:38.090 --> 03:49:38.100 align:start position:0%
from a capital model for just about
 
03:49:40.849 --> 03:49:40.859 align:start position:0%
everything we buy and
 
03:49:44.990 --> 03:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
um and also the the huge demand for
 
03:49:48.229 --> 03:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
technology to help survive the fact that
 
03:49:51.229 --> 03:49:51.239 align:start position:0%
every agency has fewer people but the
 
03:49:53.330 --> 03:49:53.340 align:start position:0%
job they need to get done is the same
 
03:49:57.710 --> 03:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
job from a citizen service perspective
 
03:50:01.010 --> 03:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
and just one one last question for me is
 
03:50:03.650 --> 03:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
uh through the The Sweep
 
03:50:06.889 --> 03:50:06.899 align:start position:0%
program and uh given the
 
03:50:09.769 --> 03:50:09.779 align:start position:0%
uh lack of resources we have on the the
 
03:50:12.650 --> 03:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
employee side not being able to recruit
 
03:50:15.110 --> 03:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
sufficient number of employees
 
03:50:17.269 --> 03:50:17.279 align:start position:0%
it's often thought that technology can
 
03:50:20.510 --> 03:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
help supplement that uh
 
03:50:22.550 --> 03:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
how do you think New Hampshire does as
 
03:50:27.309 --> 03:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
far as utilizing technology to uh
 
03:50:31.550 --> 03:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
supplement the lack of Workforce that we
 
03:50:33.830 --> 03:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
currently are experiencing and what can
 
03:50:35.090 --> 03:50:35.100 align:start position:0%
we do better
 
03:50:38.870 --> 03:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure that happens well well it
 
03:50:41.870 --> 03:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
it really varies by agency
 
03:50:44.809 --> 03:50:44.819 align:start position:0%
um and it goes to I think it goes
 
03:50:47.090 --> 03:50:47.100 align:start position:0%
largely to agency culture and their
 
03:50:49.190 --> 03:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
ability to understand what I call the
 
03:50:51.170 --> 03:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
business value of I.T because technology
 
03:50:54.530 --> 03:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
is not worth anything unless unless you
 
03:50:56.510 --> 03:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
understand how to leverage it for
 
03:50:58.969 --> 03:50:58.979 align:start position:0%
business value so
 
03:51:01.010 --> 03:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
um and I'm seeing you know overall I've
 
03:51:02.990 --> 03:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
been here I'm thinking around seven and
 
03:51:04.309 --> 03:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
a half years I've seen a huge
 
03:51:08.410 --> 03:51:08.420 align:start position:0%
Improvement overall in in every agency
 
03:51:10.729 --> 03:51:10.739 align:start position:0%
there's always room to improve and I
 
03:51:13.790 --> 03:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
think what we continue to do is
 
03:51:17.330 --> 03:51:17.340 align:start position:0%
um keep working on our agency
 
03:51:19.429 --> 03:51:19.439 align:start position:0%
um so our we talked about our overall
 
03:51:21.050 --> 03:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
strategic plan we have Agency
 
03:51:22.910 --> 03:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
information technology plans which are
 
03:51:25.370 --> 03:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
really the agency strategic plans those
 
03:51:28.190 --> 03:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
should align with their their business
 
03:51:30.769 --> 03:51:30.779 align:start position:0%
values and then we should focus on it
 
03:51:32.750 --> 03:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
and on proper execution
 
03:51:33.889 --> 03:51:33.899 align:start position:0%
um you know so there's some really good
 
03:51:35.870 --> 03:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
examples of projects where that was done
 
03:51:38.630 --> 03:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
over the past three to five years and
 
03:51:40.610 --> 03:51:40.620 align:start position:0%
that have have generated those
 
03:51:42.530 --> 03:51:42.540 align:start position:0%
efficiencies and that Effectiveness that
 
03:51:45.950 --> 03:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
that we've needed and one of them is is
 
03:51:48.250 --> 03:51:48.260 align:start position:0%
right there is reflected in this
 
03:51:50.809 --> 03:51:50.819 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget which is the move over
 
03:51:54.349 --> 03:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
to the Microsoft 365 platform which
 
03:51:56.809 --> 03:51:56.819 align:start position:0%
created some pretty large Effectiveness
 
03:51:56.819 --> 03:51:58.670 align:start position:0%
created some pretty large Effectiveness
increases

03:51:58.670 --> 03:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
increases
 
03:51:58.680 --> 03:51:59.690 align:start position:0%
increases
um

03:51:59.690 --> 03:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:02.269 --> 03:52:02.279 align:start position:0%
we're continuing to look at that and
 
03:52:04.969 --> 03:52:04.979 align:start position:0%
that's where the blind share of the APNs
 
03:52:08.030 --> 03:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
are for for doit the non-personnel-based
 
03:52:10.790 --> 03:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
APNs are for to continue that
 
03:52:12.469 --> 03:52:12.479 align:start position:0%
um so I'd say we're getting better but
 
03:52:14.870 --> 03:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
we've still got a ways to go and one of
 
03:52:17.990 --> 03:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
my our focuses has been lately is to
 
03:52:20.210 --> 03:52:20.220 align:start position:0%
look at and I think the sweet project
 
03:52:22.370 --> 03:52:22.380 align:start position:0%
did a great job of helping people think
 
03:52:25.990 --> 03:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
of that is you know can you legitimately
 
03:52:29.450 --> 03:52:29.460 align:start position:0%
improve productivity or or even you know
 
03:52:31.490 --> 03:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
in some cases survive right and we were
 
03:52:33.530 --> 03:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
looking at a couple of those they were
 
03:52:35.690 --> 03:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
about okay how can we keep this running
 
03:52:38.210 --> 03:52:38.220 align:start position:0%
and using technology and I think we did
 
03:52:41.389 --> 03:52:41.399 align:start position:0%
made the governors uh made some smart
 
03:52:43.550 --> 03:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
decisions on what got funded there so
 
03:52:45.969 --> 03:52:45.979 align:start position:0%
and and now we're we're focused on
 
03:52:48.110 --> 03:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
operationalizing all of those with the
 
03:52:50.330 --> 03:52:50.340 align:start position:0%
the same staff we had before those were
 
03:52:52.610 --> 03:52:52.620 align:start position:0%
approved so a little challenge there but
 
03:52:56.769 --> 03:52:56.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:58.670 --> 03:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
hey hi
 
03:53:02.210 --> 03:53:02.220 align:start position:0%
um I have a couple of I want to I want
 
03:53:04.370 --> 03:53:04.380 align:start position:0%
to play off of that and I
 
03:53:06.469 --> 03:53:06.479 align:start position:0%
from a technology standpoint it seems to
 
03:53:08.450 --> 03:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
me the biggest thing is that
 
03:53:10.610 --> 03:53:10.620 align:start position:0%
in your five-year replacement plan for
 
03:53:13.429 --> 03:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
laptops let's say or for for desktops
 
03:53:15.349 --> 03:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
for PCs
 
03:53:18.170 --> 03:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
um you buy laptops instead of desktops
 
03:53:21.290 --> 03:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
and that seems to me like that's ninety
 
03:53:23.030 --> 03:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
percent of the uh
 
03:53:25.190 --> 03:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
ninety percent of the cost of telework
 
03:53:26.630 --> 03:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
right is just making sure everybody's
 
03:53:28.370 --> 03:53:28.380 align:start position:0%
got a laptop
 
03:53:30.290 --> 03:53:30.300 align:start position:0%
um and I say that as an agency where we
 
03:53:32.150 --> 03:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
didn't have a lot of laptops and which
 
03:53:33.590 --> 03:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
kind of heard us during covet a little
 
03:53:36.130 --> 03:53:36.140 align:start position:0%
bit I'm like can I take a monitor home
 
03:53:38.750 --> 03:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
yes you can during covet and then people
 
03:53:40.610 --> 03:53:40.620 align:start position:0%
are now like how come I can't take our
 
03:53:42.229 --> 03:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
monitor home I'm like it's not a state
 
03:53:43.910 --> 03:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
of emergency anymore
 
03:53:45.349 --> 03:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
that's not how we're doing things
 
03:53:45.359 --> 03:53:46.309 align:start position:0%
that's not how we're doing things
anymore

03:53:46.309 --> 03:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
03:53:48.530 --> 03:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
you can take a laptop home to some of
 
03:53:48.540 --> 03:53:49.550 align:start position:0%
you can take a laptop home to some of
that

03:53:49.550 --> 03:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:53:49.560 --> 03:53:50.570 align:start position:0%
that
um

03:53:50.570 --> 03:53:50.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:53.090 --> 03:53:53.100 align:start position:0%
their efficiency gains and losses I
 
03:53:54.650 --> 03:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
think maybe
 
03:53:56.030 --> 03:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
um I wonder if you could talk about this
 
03:53:59.510 --> 03:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
I from this couple standpoints right and
 
03:54:01.670 --> 03:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
let me use two points of reference one
 
03:54:03.950 --> 03:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
is this hearing
 
03:54:03.960 --> 03:54:04.610 align:start position:0%
is this hearing
um

03:54:04.610 --> 03:54:04.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:06.830 --> 03:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm old enough to remember when these
 
03:54:08.450 --> 03:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
were kind of a big deal
 
03:54:10.130 --> 03:54:10.140 align:start position:0%
like people actually came to these
 
03:54:12.530 --> 03:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
hearings and I look around the room and
 
03:54:14.570 --> 03:54:14.580 align:start position:0%
there's like you know there's perhaps
 
03:54:16.670 --> 03:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
one reporter and one lobbyist in the
 
03:54:19.570 --> 03:54:19.580 align:start position:0%
room not not singling anybody out
 
03:54:22.849 --> 03:54:22.859 align:start position:0%
there you go and and you know the
 
03:54:24.830 --> 03:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
governor talked uh at the opening
 
03:54:26.269 --> 03:54:26.279 align:start position:0%
session and you know back in the day
 
03:54:28.610 --> 03:54:28.620 align:start position:0%
this room wouldn't fit this would be a
 
03:54:30.229 --> 03:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
ridiculous room to have this hearing in
 
03:54:32.510 --> 03:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
because there'd be 80 90 people filling
 
03:54:34.969 --> 03:54:34.979 align:start position:0%
the room and uh you know and I'm you
 
03:54:37.429 --> 03:54:37.439 align:start position:0%
know I'm remembering like the when there
 
03:54:38.870 --> 03:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
were two right the outgoing governor and
 
03:54:40.550 --> 03:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
the incoming Governor which always a
 
03:54:43.189 --> 03:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
little bit different too but uh nowadays
 
03:54:45.170 --> 03:54:45.180 align:start position:0%
you know I ran into somebody and who I
 
03:54:46.550 --> 03:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
thought was showing up to listen to me
 
03:54:48.469 --> 03:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
give my presentation
 
03:54:50.210 --> 03:54:50.220 align:start position:0%
um which annoyed me and I'm like look
 
03:54:51.410 --> 03:54:51.420 align:start position:0%
you're only coming for mine he goes no
 
03:54:52.849 --> 03:54:52.859 align:start position:0%
I'm not even coming for yours I'm
 
03:54:54.229 --> 03:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
grabbing a handout and I'm watching the
 
03:54:56.750 --> 03:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
whole thing online and I get occasional
 
03:54:59.450 --> 03:54:59.460 align:start position:0%
texts from somebody who said did he just
 
03:55:02.809 --> 03:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
say and that kind of thing and so I
 
03:55:04.550 --> 03:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
think that's probably a productivity
 
03:55:06.349 --> 03:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
game where I don't have to go find
 
03:55:08.330 --> 03:55:08.340 align:start position:0%
parking get to the state house and
 
03:55:10.070 --> 03:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
figure out how to get there I can just
 
03:55:11.750 --> 03:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
tune in to like oh I'm gonna listen to
 
03:55:13.309 --> 03:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
doit because I'm really interested in
 
03:55:15.469 --> 03:55:15.479 align:start position:0%
that and I'm gonna not pay any attention
 
03:55:19.189 --> 03:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
to you know Das let's say
 
03:55:22.309 --> 03:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
um and then the team's phenomenon and I
 
03:55:24.889 --> 03:55:24.899 align:start position:0%
you may notice about me that I the test
 
03:55:28.969 --> 03:55:28.979 align:start position:0%
more than life itself uh teams meetings
 
03:55:31.429 --> 03:55:31.439 align:start position:0%
um and like I literally I don't respond
 
03:55:33.170 --> 03:55:33.180 align:start position:0%
to teams chat because I I don't think
 
03:55:36.050 --> 03:55:36.060 align:start position:0%
that's a real communication and I don't
 
03:55:37.550 --> 03:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
um and I try and have to have teams
 
03:55:40.010 --> 03:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
meetings because I because you're not
 
03:55:42.110 --> 03:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
listening to me when I'm talking to you
 
03:55:44.389 --> 03:55:44.399 align:start position:0%
on teams I can tell that you're
 
03:55:46.550 --> 03:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
completely distracted by the by the
 
03:55:48.170 --> 03:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
puppy are you looking at me when you say
 
03:55:51.290 --> 03:55:51.300 align:start position:0%
that I'm not but
 
03:55:52.969 --> 03:55:52.979 align:start position:0%
um on the other hand for some people
 
03:55:55.490 --> 03:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
they're very efficient right people who
 
03:55:56.990 --> 03:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
are who are
 
03:55:57.000 --> 03:55:57.950 align:start position:0%
are who are
um

03:55:57.950 --> 03:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:02.330 --> 03:56:02.340 align:start position:0%
less luggite let's say than I am and and
 
03:56:04.910 --> 03:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
so those meanings are both
 
03:56:09.290 --> 03:56:09.300 align:start position:0%
kind of okay except nobody feels any
 
03:56:11.510 --> 03:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know I if I accepted every meeting
 
03:56:14.410 --> 03:56:14.420 align:start position:0%
invite I'd be booked for 72 hours a week
 
03:56:16.790 --> 03:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
and uh because they're like well it's
 
03:56:18.110 --> 03:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
just a teams meeting I'm gonna invite
 
03:56:20.030 --> 03:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
him and you don't know what to do
 
03:56:21.710 --> 03:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
anymore was if I was going to make you
 
03:56:23.689 --> 03:56:23.699 align:start position:0%
drive across town I'd be like well I'm
 
03:56:24.769 --> 03:56:24.779 align:start position:0%
not don't know if we really need to have
 
03:56:28.010 --> 03:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
a meeting so how do you balance so I
 
03:56:30.290 --> 03:56:30.300 align:start position:0%
think it efficiency well I'll start with
 
03:56:32.689 --> 03:56:32.699 align:start position:0%
the I'll I'll start like kind of in the
 
03:56:34.670 --> 03:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
ease and work my way out on layers of
 
03:56:36.530 --> 03:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
abstraction on that but you know when
 
03:56:37.790 --> 03:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
you talk about your laptop versus
 
03:56:39.889 --> 03:56:39.899 align:start position:0%
desktop thing it's really interesting
 
03:56:39.899 --> 03:56:40.910 align:start position:0%
desktop thing it's really interesting
because

03:56:40.910 --> 03:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:56:42.349 --> 03:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
um you know I think this is would be
 
03:56:44.349 --> 03:56:44.359 align:start position:0%
probably more impactful for
 
03:56:47.530 --> 03:56:47.540 align:start position:0%
non-classified employees but I was
 
03:56:49.969 --> 03:56:49.979 align:start position:0%
surprised many many years ago in the
 
03:56:52.309 --> 03:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
private sector when you know they most
 
03:56:54.710 --> 03:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
of the companies I worked for we didn't
 
03:56:56.990 --> 03:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
buy desktops you know we there was this
 
03:56:58.610 --> 03:56:58.620 align:start position:0%
transition in the private sector the
 
03:57:00.290 --> 03:57:00.300 align:start position:0%
laptops and the reason they did that is
 
03:57:00.300 --> 03:57:01.130 align:start position:0%
laptops and the reason they did that is
because

03:57:01.130 --> 03:57:01.140 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:57:02.990 --> 03:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
figured out you're going to get a lot
 
03:57:04.610 --> 03:57:04.620 align:start position:0%
more work out of people
 
03:57:06.469 --> 03:57:06.479 align:start position:0%
by virtue of that because there's so
 
03:57:07.849 --> 03:57:07.859 align:start position:0%
many different places where they're able
 
03:57:10.370 --> 03:57:10.380 align:start position:0%
to provide to do work and this thing
 
03:57:13.130 --> 03:57:13.140 align:start position:0%
comes with me everywhere and I do work
 
03:57:16.010 --> 03:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
everywhere just about and
 
03:57:18.710 --> 03:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
so there's that but you know there is a
 
03:57:21.590 --> 03:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
cost thing and and again it's about you
 
03:57:24.229 --> 03:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
know who are the people what's the job
 
03:57:27.349 --> 03:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
functions you know is it is it conducive
 
03:57:30.710 --> 03:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
to having productivity
 
03:57:30.720 --> 03:57:32.030 align:start position:0%
to having productivity
actually

03:57:32.030 --> 03:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:57:35.450 --> 03:57:35.460 align:start position:0%
happen in a telework context and I think
 
03:57:37.250 --> 03:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
the industry is a little different too
 
03:57:39.530 --> 03:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
so for doit and now I'm going to blow up
 
03:57:41.210 --> 03:57:41.220 align:start position:0%
a layer of abstraction
 
03:57:43.790 --> 03:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
the you know there's a trade-off between
 
03:57:45.710 --> 03:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
you know what you what you call
 
03:57:48.590 --> 03:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
efficiency so if I I get my all doit
 
03:57:51.710 --> 03:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
meetings on teams they are I don't have
 
03:57:55.189 --> 03:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
to drag people across the city and bring
 
03:57:57.889 --> 03:57:57.899 align:start position:0%
them into an auditorium and you know
 
03:57:59.990 --> 03:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
waste that you know 30 minutes on either
 
03:58:02.570 --> 03:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
end of of doing that that's a that's a
 
03:58:05.990 --> 03:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
huge huge Improvement for the state
 
03:58:08.330 --> 03:58:08.340 align:start position:0%
um and and actually because I T people
 
03:58:10.790 --> 03:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
are Geeks they like it better because
 
03:58:12.170 --> 03:58:12.180 align:start position:0%
they can they get you know those
 
03:58:13.670 --> 03:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
difficult questions you always want to
 
03:58:15.830 --> 03:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
ask the commissioner but you might not
 
03:58:18.050 --> 03:58:18.060 align:start position:0%
dare to well they actually dare to on
 
03:58:19.969 --> 03:58:19.979 align:start position:0%
chat sometimes when they wouldn't stand
 
03:58:22.490 --> 03:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
up in the middle of a crowd and do it so
 
03:58:24.469 --> 03:58:24.479 align:start position:0%
I think there's a an improvement there
 
03:58:28.010 --> 03:58:28.020 align:start position:0%
but but what I feel with telework and is
 
03:58:30.469 --> 03:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
is that there's a loss of culture
 
03:58:32.210 --> 03:58:32.220 align:start position:0%
potentially if you're not careful right
 
03:58:33.590 --> 03:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
because you're not getting together with
 
03:58:34.610 --> 03:58:34.620 align:start position:0%
each other
 
03:58:37.130 --> 03:58:37.140 align:start position:0%
you're not spending time you know
 
03:58:39.170 --> 03:58:39.180 align:start position:0%
talking at the water cooler hopefully
 
03:58:41.450 --> 03:58:41.460 align:start position:0%
good things
 
03:58:43.969 --> 03:58:43.979 align:start position:0%
um you know that kind of stuff so and I
 
03:58:46.309 --> 03:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
I personally believe that you know human
 
03:58:47.750 --> 03:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
nature is
 
03:58:50.929 --> 03:58:50.939 align:start position:0%
sway swings right so we swung
 
03:58:52.790 --> 03:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
particularly in the tech sector over to
 
03:58:55.070 --> 03:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
you know all telework and then that was
 
03:58:57.170 --> 03:58:57.180 align:start position:0%
the employee's expectation coming out of
 
03:59:00.889 --> 03:59:00.899 align:start position:0%
covid the state of emergency and
 
03:59:03.650 --> 03:59:03.660 align:start position:0%
um and it's you know for for people in
 
03:59:06.469 --> 03:59:06.479 align:start position:0%
the in the tech sector
 
03:59:09.410 --> 03:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
um they they hold the cards right now
 
03:59:10.910 --> 03:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
the employees hold the cards so they're
 
03:59:13.370 --> 03:59:13.380 align:start position:0%
able to say look you know I expect to be
 
03:59:14.870 --> 03:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
able to do a lot of telework and that's
 
03:59:16.610 --> 03:59:16.620 align:start position:0%
going to be a term of employment for me
 
03:59:18.769 --> 03:59:18.779 align:start position:0%
as an individual
 
03:59:20.570 --> 03:59:20.580 align:start position:0%
um that's over time that'll probably
 
03:59:23.150 --> 03:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
swing slowly back although you know my
 
03:59:25.790 --> 03:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
last couple of jobs we we worked
 
03:59:27.590 --> 03:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
wherever we were and it didn't matter so
 
03:59:29.389 --> 03:59:29.399 align:start position:0%
we never really talked about telework
 
03:59:31.969 --> 03:59:31.979 align:start position:0%
it's just I think more in the uh but you
 
03:59:34.130 --> 03:59:34.140 align:start position:0%
can even see that the thrash like the in
 
03:59:36.349 --> 03:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
in the private sector there with um you
 
03:59:37.490 --> 03:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
know some of these large companies
 
03:59:39.170 --> 03:59:39.180 align:start position:0%
saying everybody needs to come back
 
03:59:40.610 --> 03:59:40.620 align:start position:0%
right now because I want you in the
 
03:59:42.710 --> 03:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
office and and what the impact of that
 
03:59:45.170 --> 03:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
is on on turnover
 
03:59:47.750 --> 03:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
um and things like that so I personally
 
03:59:49.610 --> 03:59:49.620 align:start position:0%
think we're you know over time we'll
 
03:59:51.349 --> 03:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
swing back
 
03:59:53.330 --> 03:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
um and it's really important I think for
 
03:59:55.550 --> 03:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
leaders who are using technology
 
03:59:58.550 --> 03:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
to you know when we're all in the office
 
04:00:00.290 --> 04:00:00.300 align:start position:0%
for example a lot of us are in the
 
04:00:02.630 --> 04:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
office every day we're still using those
 
04:00:05.269 --> 04:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
these tools particularly the stuff
 
04:00:07.250 --> 04:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
that's moving out now which is actually
 
04:00:08.990 --> 04:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
going to be another Quantum Leap like
 
04:00:11.389 --> 04:00:11.399 align:start position:0%
using a TL having a team chat going on
 
04:00:14.210 --> 04:00:14.220 align:start position:0%
where you know a particular project is
 
04:00:16.130 --> 04:00:16.140 align:start position:0%
focused on that that's super efficient
 
04:00:17.630 --> 04:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
everybody in the project knows what's
 
04:00:19.969 --> 04:00:19.979 align:start position:0%
going on at all times people can comment
 
04:00:21.769 --> 04:00:21.779 align:start position:0%
on things we can react more quickly to
 
04:00:23.809 --> 04:00:23.819 align:start position:0%
one bumps in the night occur so
 
04:00:27.410 --> 04:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
balancing that against the culture and
 
04:00:29.389 --> 04:00:29.399 align:start position:0%
the and creating organizations that
 
04:00:30.950 --> 04:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
people want to work in and feel like
 
04:00:32.389 --> 04:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
they're part of I think that's the
 
04:00:34.189 --> 04:00:34.199 align:start position:0%
challenge for us leaders in in this
 
04:00:35.510 --> 04:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
space now
 
04:00:39.410 --> 04:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
let me um go into my lesson I'm aware of
 
04:00:41.630 --> 04:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
what time it is let me go to my last
 
04:00:44.269 --> 04:00:44.279 align:start position:0%
thought page 14. your proposed House
 
04:00:46.610 --> 04:00:46.620 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 language notwithstanding you can
 
04:00:49.070 --> 04:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
fill positions unfunded positions
 
04:00:51.769 --> 04:00:51.779 align:start position:0%
so historically Governors and
 
04:00:54.650 --> 04:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
legislatures have looked a scans at this
 
04:00:57.469 --> 04:00:57.479 align:start position:0%
sort of a request dramatically so and
 
04:00:59.990 --> 04:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
and the the number of departments in
 
04:01:02.870 --> 04:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
which was allowed were always zero or
 
04:01:02.880 --> 04:01:04.250 align:start position:0%
which was allowed were always zero or
one

04:01:04.250 --> 04:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:01:06.950 --> 04:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
um or typically one I think
 
04:01:09.469 --> 04:01:09.479 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
04:01:11.030 --> 04:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
because it's a little too much
 
04:01:13.189 --> 04:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
flexibility on the other hand we seem to
 
04:01:15.530 --> 04:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
be entering into a different
 
04:01:17.689 --> 04:01:17.699 align:start position:0%
climate where
 
04:01:19.610 --> 04:01:19.620 align:start position:0%
you know every commissioner has talked
 
04:01:21.769 --> 04:01:21.779 align:start position:0%
about you know if if we if we get some
 
04:01:23.510 --> 04:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
help on wages I might be able to hire a
 
04:01:26.389 --> 04:01:26.399 align:start position:0%
few more people and the the dollar
 
04:01:28.250 --> 04:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
figure of the kind of help they want is
 
04:01:28.260 --> 04:01:29.809 align:start position:0%
figure of the kind of help they want is
probably

04:01:29.809 --> 04:01:29.819 align:start position:0%
probably
 
04:01:31.250 --> 04:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
um beyond what they're expecting it's
 
04:01:32.510 --> 04:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
probably not going to reach their
 
04:01:35.229 --> 04:01:35.239 align:start position:0%
expectation but I think there's some
 
04:01:39.290 --> 04:01:39.300 align:start position:0%
some thought I I'm noting to myself and
 
04:01:41.210 --> 04:01:41.220 align:start position:0%
trying to predict the future that James
 
04:01:42.830 --> 04:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
keeps asking people what their vacancy
 
04:01:44.269 --> 04:01:44.279 align:start position:0%
rate is
 
04:01:46.370 --> 04:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
um and it makes me think
 
04:01:48.830 --> 04:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know but in a you seem to
 
04:01:50.510 --> 04:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
be trying to provide some certainty to
 
04:01:53.389 --> 04:01:53.399 align:start position:0%
policy makers that what I'm asking for
 
04:01:56.809 --> 04:01:56.819 align:start position:0%
is flexibility within reason and and how
 
04:01:59.150 --> 04:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
do we you know just thoughtfully balance
 
04:02:00.950 --> 04:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
that I mean I I really do think that we
 
04:02:04.130 --> 04:02:04.140 align:start position:0%
could we could um Pitch legislators and
 
04:02:07.450 --> 04:02:07.460 align:start position:0%
governors on on sensible ideas
 
04:02:09.889 --> 04:02:09.899 align:start position:0%
presuming they felt that we were
 
04:02:12.590 --> 04:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
sufficiently restrained and um can you
 
04:02:14.510 --> 04:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about
 
04:02:16.490 --> 04:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
how this both provides you flexibility
 
04:02:18.590 --> 04:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
and restraint at the same time well we
 
04:02:20.689 --> 04:02:20.699 align:start position:0%
we we're operating under this language
 
04:02:25.070 --> 04:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
now in this budget so it was passed
 
04:02:27.229 --> 04:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
um in and for for this budget that we're
 
04:02:29.929 --> 04:02:29.939 align:start position:0%
running in now and it was theoretical
 
04:02:32.570 --> 04:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
when we asked for it we found it very
 
04:02:35.210 --> 04:02:35.220 align:start position:0%
helpful in in if I'd say what a half a
 
04:02:37.849 --> 04:02:37.859 align:start position:0%
dozen maybe cases in the you know in the
 
04:02:40.610 --> 04:02:40.620 align:start position:0%
last year and a half
 
04:02:43.429 --> 04:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
um where and what's happening is we
 
04:02:44.809 --> 04:02:44.819 align:start position:0%
always like to look at we're not into
 
04:02:47.689 --> 04:02:47.699 align:start position:0%
big reorgs in what we always want to be
 
04:02:49.490 --> 04:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
self-adjusting so if somebody leaves
 
04:02:51.950 --> 04:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
it's not knee-jerk
 
04:02:53.870 --> 04:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
that that we would automatically replace
 
04:02:55.729 --> 04:02:55.739 align:start position:0%
that position we'd look at the overall
 
04:02:57.469 --> 04:02:57.479 align:start position:0%
needs of the organization and say what's
 
04:02:58.969 --> 04:02:58.979 align:start position:0%
our highest need
 
04:03:00.790 --> 04:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
and then and
 
04:03:04.729 --> 04:03:04.739 align:start position:0%
focus on that and this has really helped
 
04:03:06.410 --> 04:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
on that because I might you know does
 
04:03:09.769 --> 04:03:09.779 align:start position:0%
somebody retires or leaves I I and I
 
04:03:11.929 --> 04:03:11.939 align:start position:0%
look at the total picture of doit and
 
04:03:13.610 --> 04:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
our priorities I might say oh you know
 
04:03:16.189 --> 04:03:16.199 align:start position:0%
we really need that kind of person more
 
04:03:17.870 --> 04:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
than this kind of person when you say
 
04:03:20.269 --> 04:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
let's unfund that position and let's
 
04:03:22.729 --> 04:03:22.739 align:start position:0%
fund this one that's unfunded position
 
04:03:24.469 --> 04:03:24.479 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:03:26.990 --> 04:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
in in reality it often requires a
 
04:03:29.030 --> 04:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
reclass of the vacant position
 
04:03:31.189 --> 04:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
and we haven't found it oh I'm going to
 
04:03:33.469 --> 04:03:33.479 align:start position:0%
use this to pay people more that hasn't
 
04:03:35.269 --> 04:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
been at all what we've been doing what
 
04:03:37.490 --> 04:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
we've been doing is let's hire this I'll
 
04:03:40.550 --> 04:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
say oh developer left and I need a
 
04:03:42.229 --> 04:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
business analyst or something like that
 
04:03:44.809 --> 04:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
so I will not fund a developer but I
 
04:03:46.370 --> 04:03:46.380 align:start position:0%
will hire a business analyst and we're
 
04:03:48.650 --> 04:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
seeing that kind of thing go on so I I
 
04:03:50.630 --> 04:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
think it's really smart for the state
 
04:03:53.570 --> 04:03:53.580 align:start position:0%
and to do that because we're not we're
 
04:03:55.070 --> 04:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
not going to spend more money it's the
 
04:03:56.870 --> 04:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
intent is to not spend more money the
 
04:03:59.630 --> 04:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
intent is to be more effective with the
 
04:04:01.429 --> 04:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
money that were appropriated and be
 
04:04:04.309 --> 04:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
better better stewards of that money how
 
04:04:06.349 --> 04:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
do you assure policy makers that you're
 
04:04:08.210 --> 04:04:08.220 align:start position:0%
not going to substitute your priorities
 
04:04:10.849 --> 04:04:10.859 align:start position:0%
for theirs I mean it's it's winded in
 
04:04:12.889 --> 04:04:12.899 align:start position:0%
departments on some level that gets at
 
04:04:15.889 --> 04:04:15.899 align:start position:0%
that a little bit but I think in in some
 
04:04:17.750 --> 04:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know you you know let's just say an
 
04:04:20.269 --> 04:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
agency of like 23 people versus an
 
04:04:22.929 --> 04:04:22.939 align:start position:0%
agency of 300 people they're sometimes
 
04:04:25.490 --> 04:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
uh lawmakers will fund certain things
 
04:04:29.090 --> 04:04:29.100 align:start position:0%
and not others and well
 
04:04:30.889 --> 04:04:30.899 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:04:34.370 --> 04:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
we involve uh the legislature there's uh
 
04:04:36.050 --> 04:04:36.060 align:start position:0%
in the development of our strategic plan
 
04:04:38.229 --> 04:04:38.239 align:start position:0%
through the I.T Council which has
 
04:04:42.050 --> 04:04:42.060 align:start position:0%
representation on the I.T Council and
 
04:04:44.450 --> 04:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
you know we look at that strategic plan
 
04:04:46.550 --> 04:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's not just a theoretical document
 
04:04:49.790 --> 04:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
for us so so I would say that that
 
04:04:51.889 --> 04:04:51.899 align:start position:0%
if I don't do that you should get rid of
 
04:04:51.899 --> 04:04:53.229 align:start position:0%
if I don't do that you should get rid of
me

04:04:53.229 --> 04:04:53.239 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:04:56.150 --> 04:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
I should be a good Steward I should
 
04:04:57.530 --> 04:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
understand what the legislative
 
04:05:00.590 --> 04:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
priorities are and and follow them and
 
04:05:03.650 --> 04:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
and and I'm assuming from uh from uh if
 
04:05:05.689 --> 04:05:05.699 align:start position:0%
I haven't approved
 
04:05:07.429 --> 04:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
um and well thought of strategic plan
 
04:05:08.870 --> 04:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're using as our
 
04:05:10.729 --> 04:05:10.739 align:start position:0%
guidance then then
 
04:05:10.739 --> 04:05:11.689 align:start position:0%
guidance then then
um

04:05:11.689 --> 04:05:11.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:14.269 --> 04:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
then that's pretty good long-term check
 
04:05:15.469 --> 04:05:15.479 align:start position:0%
and balance
 
04:05:18.050 --> 04:05:18.060 align:start position:0%
do you think I should ask for this too
 
04:05:19.969 --> 04:05:19.979 align:start position:0%
pardon me you think I should ask for
 
04:05:24.550 --> 04:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:24.560 --> 04:05:26.389 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:05:26.389 --> 04:05:26.399 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:05:27.740 --> 04:05:27.750 align:start position:0%
I guess now it's good afternoon
 
04:05:27.750 --> 04:05:29.349 align:start position:0%
I guess now it's good afternoon
[Laughter]

04:05:29.349 --> 04:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:05:32.330 --> 04:05:32.340 align:start position:0%
this is in regards to prioritized needs
 
04:05:35.090 --> 04:05:35.100 align:start position:0%
and I like the the buckets that you have
 
04:05:36.469 --> 04:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
they're the categories in terms of your
 
04:05:38.330 --> 04:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
one two and three
 
04:05:40.750 --> 04:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
um what I'm curious on is with
 
04:05:42.830 --> 04:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs and this is just a
 
04:05:44.689 --> 04:05:44.699 align:start position:0%
I'll say agency direct area I was
 
04:05:48.050 --> 04:05:48.060 align:start position:0%
looking at it's around 17 18 million
 
04:05:49.849 --> 04:05:49.859 align:start position:0%
is do you have any sense and it can just
 
04:05:52.490 --> 04:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
be an estimate of how much of that is
 
04:05:55.910 --> 04:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
I'll say your priority APN one category
 
04:05:58.490 --> 04:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
which is you know Capital budgets Grant
 
04:05:59.870 --> 04:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
you know things that were more I'll say
 
04:06:01.849 --> 04:06:01.859 align:start position:0%
Capital related building infrastructure
 
04:06:05.809 --> 04:06:05.819 align:start position:0%
that's now become operations yeah so so
 
04:06:08.750 --> 04:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
in that from an agency perspective of
 
04:06:11.689 --> 04:06:11.699 align:start position:0%
the total there's 9.4 million is it's
 
04:06:13.330 --> 04:06:13.340 align:start position:0%
APN one
 
04:06:17.450 --> 04:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
3.7 million APN 2 and 4.5 million I'll
 
04:06:20.570 --> 04:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
give you this so you don't have to
 
04:06:22.070 --> 04:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
04:06:26.210 --> 04:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
um in from a doit apn's perspective it's
 
04:06:29.090 --> 04:06:29.100 align:start position:0%
it's flipped it's it's almost a million
 
04:06:30.290 --> 04:06:30.300 align:start position:0%
in one
 
04:06:33.590 --> 04:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
4 million and two and a half a million
 
04:06:37.189 --> 04:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
in three and overall we're at about
 
04:06:38.870 --> 04:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know when you put those all together
 
04:06:41.450 --> 04:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
it averages out to like 33 and 42
 
04:06:44.150 --> 04:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
percent yeah for one and then this is
 
04:06:47.929 --> 04:06:47.939 align:start position:0%
for each fiscal of year 32 and 31 and 2
 
04:06:54.170 --> 04:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:57.050 --> 04:06:57.060 align:start position:0%
you know new initiatives or or
 
04:06:58.550 --> 04:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
expanding a little bit you know of
 
04:07:00.410 --> 04:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
existing the isn't goals but not
 
04:07:01.790 --> 04:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
saying that they're not important but I
 
04:07:03.650 --> 04:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
feel like the the critical is if we
 
04:07:05.750 --> 04:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
spent the money already in the capital
 
04:07:07.670 --> 04:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
or other from other funding sources to
 
04:07:11.210 --> 04:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
not fund the now ongoing operating seems
 
04:07:12.590 --> 04:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
to me a definitely a higher priority
 
04:07:13.969 --> 04:07:13.979 align:start position:0%
than something new even though I know
 
04:07:15.889 --> 04:07:15.899 align:start position:0%
the new is is important and I just
 
04:07:17.150 --> 04:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
that's what I learned to get a sense for
 
04:07:19.729 --> 04:07:19.739 align:start position:0%
yeah and I we did that very consciously
 
04:07:21.110 --> 04:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
because we wanted people to understand
 
04:07:23.389 --> 04:07:23.399 align:start position:0%
what they were looking at
 
04:07:25.969 --> 04:07:25.979 align:start position:0%
um and and know that you know in some
 
04:07:29.150 --> 04:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
cases if you say if it's an APN you know
 
04:07:31.849 --> 04:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
if it's an APN two or one and you say no
 
04:07:33.410 --> 04:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to fund that that may have
 
04:07:37.070 --> 04:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
implications on ongoing operations okay
 
04:07:39.830 --> 04:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
04:07:43.550 --> 04:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
04:07:47.269 --> 04:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
enjoy your luncheon thank you
 
04:36:53.269 --> 04:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:53.279 --> 04:36:55.010 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:36:55.010 --> 04:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:36:56.631 --> 04:36:56.641 align:start position:0%
good afternoon if I could get everyone
 
04:37:06.890 --> 04:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:09.769 --> 04:37:09.779 align:start position:0%
I'd like to reconvene the governor's
 
04:37:11.570 --> 04:37:11.580 align:start position:0%
budget hearing and invite the public
 
04:37:13.131 --> 04:37:13.141 align:start position:0%
employees labor relation board up to
 
04:37:36.709 --> 04:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:39.109 --> 04:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
could I could I ask you to turn on the
 
04:37:41.510 --> 04:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
microphone which is we're being that
 
04:37:43.609 --> 04:37:43.619 align:start position:0%
this helps with the uh so now it's red
 
04:37:45.529 --> 04:37:45.539 align:start position:0%
is that on now it's on it's on now yeah
 
04:37:47.631 --> 04:37:47.641 align:start position:0%
I'm going to start over uh you're you're
 
04:37:47.641 --> 04:37:50.631 align:start position:0%
I'm going to start over uh you're you're
good

04:37:50.631 --> 04:37:50.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:50.641 --> 04:37:52.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:37:52.189 --> 04:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:53.929 --> 04:37:53.939 align:start position:0%
so the Public Employee Labor Relations
 
04:37:56.689 --> 04:37:56.699 align:start position:0%
Board currently has uh six board members
 
04:37:59.990 --> 04:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh three vacancies all alternate
 
04:38:02.750 --> 04:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
positions and they're supported by four
 
04:38:05.150 --> 04:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
full-time authorized positions myself
 
04:38:08.150 --> 04:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
included the board is an administrative
 
04:38:10.849 --> 04:38:10.859 align:start position:0%
tribunal charged with administering the
 
04:38:10.859 --> 04:38:11.929 align:start position:0%
tribunal charged with administering the
state's

04:38:11.929 --> 04:38:11.939 align:start position:0%
state's
 
04:38:13.970 --> 04:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
public sector collective bargaining law
 
04:38:16.730 --> 04:38:16.740 align:start position:0%
which touches upon public employers at
 
04:38:17.949 --> 04:38:17.959 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:38:22.010 --> 04:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
City municipal and county level there
 
04:38:23.750 --> 04:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
are currently
 
04:38:27.590 --> 04:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
approximately 649 bargaining units which
 
04:38:31.429 --> 04:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
translates to about 610 collective
 
04:38:33.230 --> 04:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements because a number
 
04:38:35.810 --> 04:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
of State bargaining units are covered by
 
04:38:39.170 --> 04:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
one master contract
 
04:38:41.869 --> 04:38:41.879 align:start position:0%
um I did provide a handout which is a
 
04:38:44.869 --> 04:38:44.879 align:start position:0%
high level overview of the various
 
04:38:46.789 --> 04:38:46.799 align:start position:0%
activities of the Public Employee Labor
 
04:38:48.590 --> 04:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
Relations Board and I'm not going to go
 
04:38:51.109 --> 04:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
through each one in any detail but if
 
04:38:53.150 --> 04:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
you have any questions about them
 
04:38:56.869 --> 04:38:56.879 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to respond after I touch upon
 
04:38:58.689 --> 04:38:58.699 align:start position:0%
some of the numbers
 
04:39:01.429 --> 04:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
as to the numbers
 
04:39:01.439 --> 04:39:02.869 align:start position:0%
as to the numbers
um

04:39:02.869 --> 04:39:02.879 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:05.869 --> 04:39:05.879 align:start position:0%
our budget requests year to year tend to
 
04:39:07.789 --> 04:39:07.799 align:start position:0%
be very consistent
 
04:39:11.990 --> 04:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh this year the overall request for
 
04:39:16.010 --> 04:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 is approximately 539 000
 
04:39:19.551 --> 04:39:19.561 align:start position:0%
most of which is General funds and in
 
04:39:23.090 --> 04:39:23.100 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 532 thousand dollars
 
04:39:26.689 --> 04:39:26.699 align:start position:0%
about 89 percent of our budget is class
 
04:39:30.289 --> 04:39:30.299 align:start position:0%
10 personnel class 60 benefits and class
 
04:39:30.299 --> 04:39:32.109 align:start position:0%
10 personnel class 60 benefits and class
22

04:39:32.109 --> 04:39:32.119 align:start position:0%
22
 
04:39:36.170 --> 04:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
rents and leases and we are in year one
 
04:39:40.010 --> 04:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
of our most recent five-year lease in
 
04:39:41.570 --> 04:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
the same building that we've been in
 
04:39:45.410 --> 04:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:47.990 --> 04:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
um as to the efficiency budget I just
 
04:39:49.430 --> 04:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to highlight a couple of things
 
04:39:51.530 --> 04:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
and again I understand these are small
 
04:39:53.030 --> 04:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
numbers compared to some of the things
 
04:39:54.650 --> 04:39:54.660 align:start position:0%
that are being discussed here the last
 
04:39:56.510 --> 04:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
two days
 
04:39:56.520 --> 04:39:57.708 align:start position:0%
two days
um

04:39:57.708 --> 04:39:57.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:01.970 --> 04:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
our our class 22 rent is increasing by 9
 
04:40:05.448 --> 04:40:05.458 align:start position:0%
700 a year which
 
04:40:07.550 --> 04:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
translates over the five-year terminal
 
04:40:10.310 --> 04:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
leads to about 19 a square foot we have
 
04:40:13.510 --> 04:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
about 2 300 square feet of space
 
04:40:17.090 --> 04:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
we have a one-time item in class 30 7
 
04:40:20.330 --> 04:40:20.340 align:start position:0%
500 for equipment mainly for replacing
 
04:40:23.090 --> 04:40:23.100 align:start position:0%
the tables we use in the hearing room uh
 
04:40:25.368 --> 04:40:25.378 align:start position:0%
and in aging and somewhat dangerous
 
04:40:27.230 --> 04:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
partition we use in one of our office
 
04:40:27.240 --> 04:40:28.690 align:start position:0%
partition we use in one of our office
spaces

04:40:28.690 --> 04:40:28.700 align:start position:0%
spaces
 
04:40:32.090 --> 04:40:32.100 align:start position:0%
uh for transfers to other agencies we
 
04:40:34.550 --> 04:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
have a new item uh we are enrolled in
 
04:40:36.970 --> 04:40:36.980 align:start position:0%
the Human Resources support unit program
 
04:40:39.770 --> 04:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
uh this is our second quarter we've been
 
04:40:42.470 --> 04:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh very happy with the services they've
 
04:40:45.410 --> 04:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
provided and the responses that we get
 
04:40:47.990 --> 04:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
to our questions uh so there is a new
 
04:40:50.270 --> 04:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
item of thirty eight hundred dollars
 
04:40:53.630 --> 04:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
per year more or less for each fiscal
 
04:40:53.640 --> 04:40:54.850 align:start position:0%
per year more or less for each fiscal
year

04:40:54.850 --> 04:40:54.860 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:40:59.030 --> 04:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
doit class 27 increases forty seven
 
04:41:00.530 --> 04:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars and five thousand
 
04:41:02.930 --> 04:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
dollars years one and two
 
04:41:05.330 --> 04:41:05.340 align:start position:0%
um those are figures that doit provides
 
04:41:07.730 --> 04:41:07.740 align:start position:0%
I really can't break down those figures
 
04:41:10.490 --> 04:41:10.500 align:start position:0%
so the total increases for year one is
 
04:41:13.850 --> 04:41:13.860 align:start position:0%
about 28 000 year to about 21
 
04:41:13.860 --> 04:41:15.288 align:start position:0%
about 28 000 year to about 21
000.

04:41:15.288 --> 04:41:15.298 align:start position:0%
000.
 
04:41:17.750 --> 04:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
um the more interesting uh part of the
 
04:41:19.310 --> 04:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
budget and something that we're excited
 
04:41:21.470 --> 04:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
about is in the additional prioritized
 
04:41:24.770 --> 04:41:24.780 align:start position:0%
needs we've been looking on and off with
 
04:41:28.150 --> 04:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
doit and coming up with some sort of
 
04:41:30.230 --> 04:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
economically feasible case management
 
04:41:33.350 --> 04:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
system we reviewed the options again
 
04:41:35.628 --> 04:41:35.638 align:start position:0%
this past spring and we identified legal
 
04:41:38.510 --> 04:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
files which has been in use at the board
 
04:41:40.368 --> 04:41:40.378 align:start position:0%
of tax and land appeals for probably
 
04:41:42.190 --> 04:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
close to 20 years
 
04:41:46.490 --> 04:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
uh they're in in fiscal year one there
 
04:41:49.910 --> 04:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
was a one-time uh startup cost of about
 
04:41:51.708 --> 04:41:51.718 align:start position:0%
eleven thousand dollars and the
 
04:41:53.930 --> 04:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
licensing of the software in year one is
 
04:41:58.128 --> 04:41:58.138 align:start position:0%
about six thousand uh in year two uh the
 
04:42:00.770 --> 04:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
consultant fees to help maintain the
 
04:42:03.890 --> 04:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
system is five thousand I'm not sure if
 
04:42:05.628 --> 04:42:05.638 align:start position:0%
that's those are additional services
 
04:42:08.030 --> 04:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
that doit will provide or if that's
 
04:42:10.310 --> 04:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
outside Consultants probably provided
 
04:42:13.550 --> 04:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
through legal files and the licenses for
 
04:42:16.070 --> 04:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
year two are in that uh seven thousand
 
04:42:18.948 --> 04:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
dollar plus or minus range this would be
 
04:42:23.270 --> 04:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
a a a huge step forward for uh our board
 
04:42:26.690 --> 04:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
in terms of modernizing uh our case
 
04:42:31.128 --> 04:42:31.138 align:start position:0%
management systems currently uh we rely
 
04:42:33.410 --> 04:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
on a cobble together system consisting
 
04:42:35.230 --> 04:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
of excel sheets
 
04:42:35.240 --> 04:42:37.750 align:start position:0%
of excel sheets
folders

04:42:37.750 --> 04:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
folders
 
04:42:41.208 --> 04:42:41.218 align:start position:0%
using the Outlook calendars uh in
 
04:42:44.150 --> 04:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
theoretically I'm the only one who who
 
04:42:45.708 --> 04:42:45.718 align:start position:0%
is familiar with all the moving parts
 
04:42:48.590 --> 04:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
and that's not always true so we do have
 
04:42:50.750 --> 04:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
system breakdowns we do have concerns
 
04:42:54.850 --> 04:42:54.860 align:start position:0%
about data management and and data loss
 
04:42:57.288 --> 04:42:57.298 align:start position:0%
based on the experience of the board and
 
04:43:00.170 --> 04:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
tax of land appeals and the um
 
04:43:03.050 --> 04:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
preview of the software that we had with
 
04:43:05.330 --> 04:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
legal files we feel that would be an
 
04:43:09.530 --> 04:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
excellent fit and I think the costs make
 
04:43:11.990 --> 04:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense and should be included as
 
04:43:13.570 --> 04:43:13.580 align:start position:0%
part of our budget
 
04:43:16.550 --> 04:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
a couple of additional items and the
 
04:43:18.410 --> 04:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs there's an
 
04:43:20.930 --> 04:43:20.940 align:start position:0%
entry for cabling fiber capital S
 
04:43:24.410 --> 04:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
capital W defined Network Dash e n h
 
04:43:24.420 --> 04:43:25.788 align:start position:0%
capital W defined Network Dash e n h
hands

04:43:25.788 --> 04:43:25.798 align:start position:0%
hands
 
04:43:29.510 --> 04:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh year one seven thousand dollars only
 
04:43:31.970 --> 04:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
I can't break that item uh down for you
 
04:43:36.050 --> 04:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
but periodically uh doit does uh as it
 
04:43:37.610 --> 04:43:37.620 align:start position:0%
does throughout the state have to make
 
04:43:39.708 --> 04:43:39.718 align:start position:0%
certain upward adjustments and Equipment
 
04:43:43.070 --> 04:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
replacement uh and this is obviously a
 
04:43:45.830 --> 04:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
one-time cost to do that
 
04:43:48.288 --> 04:43:48.298 align:start position:0%
um not clear to me if it's a cost that's
 
04:43:52.128 --> 04:43:52.138 align:start position:0%
uh required because of legal files or if
 
04:43:54.410 --> 04:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
it's a cost that we would incur
 
04:43:54.420 --> 04:43:56.868 align:start position:0%
it's a cost that we would incur
otherwise

04:43:56.868 --> 04:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
04:44:00.230 --> 04:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
um and then in this cycle uh I think
 
04:44:03.708 --> 04:44:03.718 align:start position:0%
laptops are being listed in as APNs I
 
04:44:05.628 --> 04:44:05.638 align:start position:0%
think in the past they were included in
 
04:44:08.570 --> 04:44:08.580 align:start position:0%
the maintenance budget but there is a in
 
04:44:10.250 --> 04:44:10.260 align:start position:0%
year two two thousand dollars for
 
04:44:13.250 --> 04:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
laptops and software year one and year
 
04:44:15.050 --> 04:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
two about fourteen hundred dollars in
 
04:44:16.368 --> 04:44:16.378 align:start position:0%
each year
 
04:44:19.070 --> 04:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
so that is the quick overview and
 
04:44:20.750 --> 04:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
highlights and I'm happy to answer any
 
04:44:24.890 --> 04:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
questions and sure thank you
 
04:44:28.670 --> 04:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
other than technological uh changes or
 
04:44:31.550 --> 04:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
technical additions to to your to your
 
04:44:33.708 --> 04:44:33.718 align:start position:0%
agency what are the major challenges
 
04:44:35.628 --> 04:44:35.638 align:start position:0%
you're facing if they're any beyond that
 
04:44:38.690 --> 04:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
well no challenges that are unique I
 
04:44:41.030 --> 04:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
mean the challenges are driven by the
 
04:44:43.070 --> 04:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
types of cases that we get filed so
 
04:44:45.590 --> 04:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
obviously as as was the case in many
 
04:44:47.690 --> 04:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
workplaces private and public sector
 
04:44:50.330 --> 04:44:50.340 align:start position:0%
throughout the state we saw a lot of
 
04:44:52.730 --> 04:44:52.740 align:start position:0%
covert related cases come in dealing
 
04:44:55.550 --> 04:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
with various issues
 
04:44:58.070 --> 04:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
um there are cases driven by
 
04:45:00.410 --> 04:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
technological things so for example we
 
04:45:02.270 --> 04:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
had a case come in recently where a
 
04:45:04.150 --> 04:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
question has been raised about the state
 
04:45:07.730 --> 04:45:07.740 align:start position:0%
telework policy and and there's language
 
04:45:10.550 --> 04:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
I think in the policy that addresses
 
04:45:12.770 --> 04:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
the availability of that program for
 
04:45:15.470 --> 04:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
employees who reside out of state so
 
04:45:18.470 --> 04:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
there are novel issues that come up that
 
04:45:20.390 --> 04:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
are driven by circumstances that none of
 
04:45:23.448 --> 04:45:23.458 align:start position:0%
us ever anticipated and then there are
 
04:45:26.150 --> 04:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
more routine issues that come up that
 
04:45:28.730 --> 04:45:28.740 align:start position:0%
are generated by bargaining friction and
 
04:45:28.740 --> 04:45:30.010 align:start position:0%
are generated by bargaining friction and
issues

04:45:30.010 --> 04:45:30.020 align:start position:0%
issues
 
04:45:32.150 --> 04:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
the bargaining unit formation
 
04:45:34.970 --> 04:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
representation of unions
 
04:45:36.948 --> 04:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
things like that without going into the
 
04:45:41.330 --> 04:45:41.340 align:start position:0%
detail of cases but otherwise I I feel
 
04:45:44.208 --> 04:45:44.218 align:start position:0%
we're well positioned uh to do the job
 
04:45:45.650 --> 04:45:45.660 align:start position:0%
that we're charged with under the
 
04:45:47.570 --> 04:45:47.580 align:start position:0%
statute I feel like we're getting the
 
04:45:52.010 --> 04:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
support we need uh from the oit side of
 
04:45:53.810 --> 04:45:53.820 align:start position:0%
the state services and from the
 
04:45:55.190 --> 04:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
Personnel side of the state Services
 
04:45:58.970 --> 04:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
through the hrsu group
 
04:46:01.010 --> 04:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
and the the laptops you're requesting
 
04:46:02.810 --> 04:46:02.820 align:start position:0%
are they additional or replacement
 
04:46:05.270 --> 04:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
laptops are they are they new for for
 
04:46:07.490 --> 04:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
somebody or just see replacement and
 
04:46:10.550 --> 04:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
they're typically scheduled by doit as
 
04:46:12.530 --> 04:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
part of our budget because if it's not
 
04:46:14.990 --> 04:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
in there and it turns out a laptop has
 
04:46:17.750 --> 04:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
reached its end life then there's a
 
04:46:19.070 --> 04:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
scramble we don't have a lot of extra
 
04:46:21.530 --> 04:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
money that we can shift
 
04:46:23.990 --> 04:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
from one class to another to cover in
 
04:46:26.208 --> 04:46:26.218 align:start position:0%
unanticipated expenses like that so it's
 
04:46:28.610 --> 04:46:28.620 align:start position:0%
not an unusual item I'm not sure why it
 
04:46:31.730 --> 04:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
was entered as an APN but that's how it
 
04:46:33.650 --> 04:46:33.660 align:start position:0%
was presented
 
04:46:36.708 --> 04:46:36.718 align:start position:0%
um from doit so that's how it appears in
 
04:46:39.948 --> 04:46:39.958 align:start position:0%
our budget okay thank you
 
04:46:44.090 --> 04:46:44.100 align:start position:0%
hi sorry I was late I apologize for that
 
04:46:44.100 --> 04:46:45.050 align:start position:0%
hi sorry I was late I apologize for that
um

04:46:45.050 --> 04:46:45.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:47.150 --> 04:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
I have a good excuse but I can't explain
 
04:46:48.590 --> 04:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
it in public
 
04:46:52.128 --> 04:46:52.138 align:start position:0%
kidding um the um how much do your board
 
04:46:55.128 --> 04:46:55.138 align:start position:0%
members make how much do they make so
 
04:46:58.970 --> 04:46:58.980 align:start position:0%
our board members are paid a 50 per diem
 
04:47:00.948 --> 04:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars per diem
 
04:47:03.230 --> 04:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
um do they write their own decisions
 
04:47:04.550 --> 04:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
do they write do they write the
 
04:47:08.330 --> 04:47:08.340 align:start position:0%
decisions or do you write them yes
 
04:47:08.340 --> 04:47:10.788 align:start position:0%
decisions or do you write them yes
okay

04:47:10.788 --> 04:47:10.798 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:47:13.490 --> 04:47:13.500 align:start position:0%
um I just in a just so it doesn't seem
 
04:47:16.368 --> 04:47:16.378 align:start position:0%
cryptic I'm uh compiling a list of how
 
04:47:16.378 --> 04:47:17.150 align:start position:0%
cryptic I'm uh compiling a list of how
much

04:47:17.150 --> 04:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:47:19.010 --> 04:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
the way the state pays adjudicative
 
04:47:22.550 --> 04:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
boards is enormously inconsistent
 
04:47:25.010 --> 04:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
and and I'm trying to find Rhyme or
 
04:47:26.628 --> 04:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
Reason in it and there doesn't so far
 
04:47:31.690 --> 04:47:31.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:39.170 --> 04:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:40.550 --> 04:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
you'd like to invite the governor's
 
04:47:42.770 --> 04:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
Commission on disabilities do you give
 
04:48:09.670 --> 04:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:12.770 --> 04:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
yeah good afternoon good afternoon uh
 
04:48:14.628 --> 04:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
commissioner Allen house and other
 
04:48:17.270 --> 04:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
members of this panel I am Chuck Sayer
 
04:48:19.670 --> 04:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the governor's
 
04:48:22.128 --> 04:48:22.138 align:start position:0%
Commission on disability and to my left
 
04:48:24.890 --> 04:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
is that business administrator Ms Stacy
 
04:48:26.750 --> 04:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
dubia who put all the figures together
 
04:48:29.150 --> 04:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
for this honorable panel today so again
 
04:48:30.830 --> 04:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so much uh for this
 
04:48:30.840 --> 04:48:32.330 align:start position:0%
thank you so much uh for this
opportunity

04:48:32.330 --> 04:48:32.340 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
04:48:34.430 --> 04:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
um we do have handouts and which really
 
04:48:37.070 --> 04:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
go over at a very high level what we
 
04:48:40.310 --> 04:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
refer to as what the gcd does
 
04:48:42.948 --> 04:48:42.958 align:start position:0%
um on a regular basis on a daily basis
 
04:48:45.110 --> 04:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
so when we look at the governance
 
04:48:47.208 --> 04:48:47.218 align:start position:0%
Commission on disability there is one
 
04:48:50.150 --> 04:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
driving federal law that we adhere to
 
04:48:51.650 --> 04:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
which is embedded within our mission
 
04:48:53.030 --> 04:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's the Americans with Disabilities
 
04:48:53.040 --> 04:48:54.350 align:start position:0%
that's the Americans with Disabilities
Act

04:48:54.350 --> 04:48:54.360 align:start position:0%
Act
 
04:48:57.350 --> 04:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
um at a very high level an instrumental
 
04:48:59.510 --> 04:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
piece of federal legislation which
 
04:49:01.190 --> 04:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
ensures that individuals with
 
04:49:03.650 --> 04:49:03.660 align:start position:0%
disabilities cannot be discriminated
 
04:49:07.270 --> 04:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
against because of their disability
 
04:49:10.310 --> 04:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
we are the office itself the agency is
 
04:49:12.708 --> 04:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
located at 54 Regional drive with some
 
04:49:15.410 --> 04:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
tenants of division of personnel so we
 
04:49:16.730 --> 04:49:16.740 align:start position:0%
were originally a couple of years ago
 
04:49:18.350 --> 04:49:18.360 align:start position:0%
over at the Philbrook building when
 
04:49:21.050 --> 04:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
Philbrook was repurposed commissioner
 
04:49:23.270 --> 04:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
Allen House off in a space and the rent
 
04:49:25.730 --> 04:49:25.740 align:start position:0%
was right and we and we decided to uh
 
04:49:27.708 --> 04:49:27.718 align:start position:0%
move in and it's actually been a very
 
04:49:30.050 --> 04:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
very good relationship because there is
 
04:49:32.090 --> 04:49:32.100 align:start position:0%
a there is an intersection when we look
 
04:49:33.590 --> 04:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
at individuals with disabilities and
 
04:49:35.750 --> 04:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
employment and obviously division of
 
04:49:37.868 --> 04:49:37.878 align:start position:0%
personnel which which I will talk again
 
04:49:41.810 --> 04:49:41.820 align:start position:0%
later as a results to the uh additional
 
04:49:45.110 --> 04:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs request so again when
 
04:49:46.970 --> 04:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
we look at the gcd and within the
 
04:49:49.190 --> 04:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
confines of the Ada we're primarily
 
04:49:51.050 --> 04:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
focused on employment of individuals
 
04:49:52.850 --> 04:49:52.860 align:start position:0%
with disabilities and necessary
 
04:49:54.708 --> 04:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
accommodations that an individual may
 
04:49:57.470 --> 04:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
need either obtaining employment or when
 
04:50:00.350 --> 04:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
they're employed we have a position that
 
04:50:02.628 --> 04:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
also looks at the physical accessibility
 
04:50:04.670 --> 04:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
of what we refer to as the built
 
04:50:07.970 --> 04:50:07.980 align:start position:0%
environment so for example if a state
 
04:50:10.610 --> 04:50:10.620 align:start position:0%
agency is going to enter into a third
 
04:50:12.368 --> 04:50:12.378 align:start position:0%
party lease
 
04:50:15.230 --> 04:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
and that lease obviously is negotiated
 
04:50:17.270 --> 04:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
in order for it to proceed before
 
04:50:19.190 --> 04:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
governor and Council there has to be a
 
04:50:21.590 --> 04:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
letter of opinion that emanates from our
 
04:50:23.390 --> 04:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
statutory committee known as the
 
04:50:24.770 --> 04:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
architecture barrier-free design
 
04:50:27.770 --> 04:50:27.780 align:start position:0%
committee which is supported by the gcd
 
04:50:29.708 --> 04:50:29.718 align:start position:0%
and that's the accessibility specialist
 
04:50:32.270 --> 04:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
and we also look at what's referred to
 
04:50:35.750 --> 04:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
as title III issues under the Ada which
 
04:50:38.150 --> 04:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
deals with private businesses that are
 
04:50:40.610 --> 04:50:40.620 align:start position:0%
open to the public who again have to um
 
04:50:45.890 --> 04:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
abide by the mandates of the Ada
 
04:50:47.390 --> 04:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
um some of the other issues we deal with
 
04:50:49.910 --> 04:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis deal with housing as
 
04:50:51.350 --> 04:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
it pertains individuals with
 
04:50:53.150 --> 04:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
disabilities service animals and what is
 
04:50:54.708 --> 04:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
a service animal
 
04:50:56.390 --> 04:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
um and just general
 
04:50:58.250 --> 04:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
um information regarding
 
04:50:59.810 --> 04:50:59.820 align:start position:0%
um the Ada
 
04:51:01.788 --> 04:51:01.798 align:start position:0%
from an administrative standpoint we
 
04:51:04.850 --> 04:51:04.860 align:start position:0%
have six full-time employees including
 
04:51:07.550 --> 04:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
myself one part-time employee there is
 
04:51:10.970 --> 04:51:10.980 align:start position:0%
currently one vacancy at the gcd for for
 
04:51:13.310 --> 04:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
a full-time employee that is the
 
04:51:15.110 --> 04:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
accessibility specialist that's been
 
04:51:18.890 --> 04:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
vacant since September we expect to post
 
04:51:20.330 --> 04:51:20.340 align:start position:0%
that sjd
 
04:51:23.090 --> 04:51:23.100 align:start position:0%
um soon we have to make some changes to
 
04:51:25.128 --> 04:51:25.138 align:start position:0%
it and where it we're working with
 
04:51:27.910 --> 04:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
personnel there are three major
 
04:51:31.550 --> 04:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
organizational units at the gcd or au's
 
04:51:34.730 --> 04:51:34.740 align:start position:0%
accounting units one zero zero four one
 
04:51:38.448 --> 04:51:38.458 align:start position:0%
zero zero six and one zero zero seven so
 
04:51:40.310 --> 04:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
one zero zero four is the commission on
 
04:51:43.368 --> 04:51:43.378 align:start position:0%
disability which is a mixture of other
 
04:51:46.190 --> 04:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
funds and also General funds the other
 
04:51:48.890 --> 04:51:48.900 align:start position:0%
fun other funds being predominantly from
 
04:51:49.990 --> 04:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire
 
04:51:53.150 --> 04:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Employment excuse me
 
04:51:55.490 --> 04:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
Department of Education excuse me
 
04:51:58.250 --> 04:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
um who who supports a the part-time
 
04:52:01.330 --> 04:52:01.340 align:start position:0%
individual who was at the G CD
 
04:52:04.910 --> 04:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
1006 is 100 federal funds and one zero
 
04:52:07.368 --> 04:52:07.378 align:start position:0%
zero seven are other funds that come
 
04:52:11.510 --> 04:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
from the Public Utilities Commission so
 
04:52:14.448 --> 04:52:14.458 align:start position:0%
um if we were to focus on one zero zero
 
04:52:14.458 --> 04:52:15.650 align:start position:0%
um if we were to focus on one zero zero
four

04:52:15.650 --> 04:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:52:18.350 --> 04:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
um our efficiency budget did come in
 
04:52:21.170 --> 04:52:21.180 align:start position:0%
well within the target as was requested
 
04:52:24.230 --> 04:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
by the governor I believe when we built
 
04:52:26.750 --> 04:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
the efficiency budget we looked at an
 
04:52:28.368 --> 04:52:28.378 align:start position:0%
increase of about sixteen thousand
 
04:52:31.670 --> 04:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
dollars from the actuals of 22 and about
 
04:52:33.410 --> 04:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
twelve thousand more
 
04:52:36.010 --> 04:52:36.020 align:start position:0%
um in FY 25
 
04:52:38.330 --> 04:52:38.340 align:start position:0%
within the um there are a couple of
 
04:52:40.730 --> 04:52:40.740 align:start position:0%
addition prioritized needs
 
04:52:44.330 --> 04:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
we are on a regular basis what we try to
 
04:52:46.430 --> 04:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
do is obviously look at our our
 
04:52:49.490 --> 04:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
operating software as in in laptops so
 
04:52:52.788 --> 04:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
we've um we've requested doit for the
 
04:52:55.010 --> 04:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
replacement of one laptop laptop in each
 
04:52:57.410 --> 04:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
year of the biennium in one printer and
 
04:52:59.448 --> 04:52:59.458 align:start position:0%
we typically do that Mr Gary
 
04:53:00.948 --> 04:53:00.958 align:start position:0%
um every two years so that we ensure
 
04:53:04.190 --> 04:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
that we're up to date on our needs uh
 
04:53:07.128 --> 04:53:07.138 align:start position:0%
within the it we've um we're almost
 
04:53:09.590 --> 04:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
there with as a result of covid we're
 
04:53:11.750 --> 04:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
switching over to everyone having a
 
04:53:14.570 --> 04:53:14.580 align:start position:0%
laptop and in case uh you know we need
 
04:53:16.730 --> 04:53:16.740 align:start position:0%
that accessibility and ability to move
 
04:53:18.890 --> 04:53:18.900 align:start position:0%
around we we do have that prior to that
 
04:53:20.990 --> 04:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
we didn't there was a we didn't have too
 
04:53:22.970 --> 04:53:22.980 align:start position:0%
many laptops we were taking the monitors
 
04:53:24.948 --> 04:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
and the hard drives out and we learned
 
04:53:27.110 --> 04:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
our lesson which is a good thing
 
04:53:28.970 --> 04:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
um to learn
 
04:53:30.770 --> 04:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
um other than that if it's it's subject
 
04:53:32.448 --> 04:53:32.458 align:start position:0%
to your approval I can go on to the
 
04:53:34.250 --> 04:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs request
 
04:53:37.310 --> 04:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
again so we do have um there is an
 
04:53:39.170 --> 04:53:39.180 align:start position:0%
audition prioritized needs as it deals
 
04:53:42.170 --> 04:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
with doit as a result of the numbers
 
04:53:44.030 --> 04:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
that were originally given to us that we
 
04:53:47.030 --> 04:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
had to build into our existing budget
 
04:53:49.670 --> 04:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
and there is also a request for a
 
04:53:52.788 --> 04:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
part-time position at the gcd what we
 
04:53:55.490 --> 04:53:55.500 align:start position:0%
are looking at Mr Gary is a request for
 
04:53:59.090 --> 04:53:59.100 align:start position:0%
a what we we have termed undubbed in Ada
 
04:54:01.670 --> 04:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
coordinated position
 
04:54:04.310 --> 04:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
a few years back the gcd organized
 
04:54:06.230 --> 04:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
itself into a work group known as the
 
04:54:08.570 --> 04:54:08.580 align:start position:0%
workforce focus group and what we did
 
04:54:10.730 --> 04:54:10.740 align:start position:0%
was working very closely with personnel
 
04:54:12.410 --> 04:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
and working closely with other
 
04:54:14.868 --> 04:54:14.878 align:start position:0%
stakeholders from state government and
 
04:54:17.510 --> 04:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
from the community we wanted to look at
 
04:54:20.150 --> 04:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
the um the ability of an individual with
 
04:54:22.250 --> 04:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
a disability to apply for a job in the
 
04:54:25.250 --> 04:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
state and to obtain and retain what is
 
04:54:26.570 --> 04:54:26.580 align:start position:0%
known in the industry or in the
 
04:54:28.070 --> 04:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
community as competitive integrated
 
04:54:30.650 --> 04:54:30.660 align:start position:0%
employment one of the findings was in
 
04:54:32.868 --> 04:54:32.878 align:start position:0%
and this is not endemic to New Hampshire
 
04:54:36.350 --> 04:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
alone is there are many individuals that
 
04:54:38.390 --> 04:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
service and within HR responsibilities
 
04:54:41.510 --> 04:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
or HR positions when an individual from
 
04:54:44.030 --> 04:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
another agency is dealing with a
 
04:54:46.910 --> 04:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
question as it pertains to the Ada they
 
04:54:49.788 --> 04:54:49.798 align:start position:0%
may not have that background that that a
 
04:54:52.430 --> 04:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
more robust person may have so one of
 
04:54:54.890 --> 04:54:54.900 align:start position:0%
the concepts that came out of the work
 
04:54:57.708 --> 04:54:57.718 align:start position:0%
group was it was to have a position
 
04:55:00.288 --> 04:55:00.298 align:start position:0%
house at the gcd
 
04:55:02.510 --> 04:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
hope and I've been in constant
 
04:55:03.890 --> 04:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
communication with the division of
 
04:55:05.750 --> 04:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
personnel perhaps enter into an
 
04:55:07.610 --> 04:55:07.620 align:start position:0%
agreement with dop
 
04:55:10.128 --> 04:55:10.138 align:start position:0%
to work together to act as a resource
 
04:55:11.510 --> 04:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
for the entire State of New Hampshire
 
04:55:14.510 --> 04:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
when an individual is attempting with an
 
04:55:15.890 --> 04:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
individual with a disability is
 
04:55:18.230 --> 04:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
attempting to gain employment or is or
 
04:55:20.330 --> 04:55:20.340 align:start position:0%
is already employed so again to have
 
04:55:23.628 --> 04:55:23.638 align:start position:0%
those Ada resources um available
 
04:55:26.208 --> 04:55:26.218 align:start position:0%
um a part-time position would uh in the
 
04:55:27.830 --> 04:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
first year of the biennium would come to
 
04:55:31.310 --> 04:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
31 427 in in the second year of the
 
04:55:33.788 --> 04:55:33.798 align:start position:0%
biennium it's right in there at that
 
04:55:36.470 --> 04:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
right in that amount coupled with that
 
04:55:39.410 --> 04:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
as a as the benefits of class 60 as well
 
04:55:42.770 --> 04:55:42.780 align:start position:0%
as a laptop for that individual so that
 
04:55:45.410 --> 04:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
is probably and again thankfully when we
 
04:55:47.810 --> 04:55:47.820 align:start position:0%
look at because we came well within the
 
04:55:49.430 --> 04:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
target I'm looking over at our business
 
04:55:52.670 --> 04:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
supervisor Steve McLaughlin thankfully
 
04:55:55.128 --> 04:55:55.138 align:start position:0%
um and and I do agree it should be in
 
04:55:56.930 --> 04:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
the prioritized needs request so that we
 
04:55:58.910 --> 04:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
can really vet this out and see how this
 
04:56:01.128 --> 04:56:01.138 align:start position:0%
is going to work in state government but
 
04:56:01.138 --> 04:56:02.570 align:start position:0%
is going to work in state government but
thankfully

04:56:02.570 --> 04:56:02.580 align:start position:0%
thankfully
 
04:56:04.368 --> 04:56:04.378 align:start position:0%
um if if this were in the efficiency
 
04:56:07.550 --> 04:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
budget we would be over but not by now
 
04:56:10.070 --> 04:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
much money we talk in you know not a
 
04:56:11.050 --> 04:56:11.060 align:start position:0%
great amount
 
04:56:14.330 --> 04:56:14.340 align:start position:0%
so with that you know respectfully i i a
 
04:56:16.250 --> 04:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
request for us to you know I'm more than
 
04:56:18.050 --> 04:56:18.060 align:start position:0%
happy to speak about the position or
 
04:56:20.030 --> 04:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
have further Communications about it but
 
04:56:22.010 --> 04:56:22.020 align:start position:0%
I do think you know there's a concept in
 
04:56:24.230 --> 04:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
the country known as uh same the state
 
04:56:26.390 --> 04:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
as the model employer and I have to tell
 
04:56:28.550 --> 04:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
you the uh the state of New Hampshire is
 
04:56:31.610 --> 04:56:31.620 align:start position:0%
is truly Stellar when it comes to its
 
04:56:32.990 --> 04:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
division of personnel and the
 
04:56:34.970 --> 04:56:34.980 align:start position:0%
collaboration among all agencies to
 
04:56:37.850 --> 04:56:37.860 align:start position:0%
ensure that we're hiring
 
04:56:40.190 --> 04:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
um all individuals and to really make it
 
04:56:43.250 --> 04:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
in in an inviting environment
 
04:56:45.470 --> 04:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
um to have an ADA coordinated position
 
04:56:47.930 --> 04:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
at the gcd to work closely and to be a
 
04:56:50.990 --> 04:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
resource for other states excuse me for
 
04:56:53.270 --> 04:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
other state agencies
 
04:56:54.590 --> 04:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
um I think as they step in the right
 
04:56:56.150 --> 04:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
direction we've seen that with the
 
04:56:58.190 --> 04:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
governor's recovery friendly workplace
 
04:57:01.190 --> 04:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
initiative which again I have tipped my
 
04:57:03.230 --> 04:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
hats many times to the governor because
 
04:57:05.030 --> 04:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
it is it's Innovative and it's really
 
04:57:07.670 --> 04:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
looking at individuals with a disability
 
04:57:09.770 --> 04:57:09.780 align:start position:0%
in the workforce and and giving
 
04:57:12.350 --> 04:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
employers the tools they need to ensure
 
04:57:13.970 --> 04:57:13.980 align:start position:0%
that that individual
 
04:57:15.410 --> 04:57:15.420 align:start position:0%
um who is regarded is having a
 
04:57:17.570 --> 04:57:17.580 align:start position:0%
disability when you're in recovery to to
 
04:57:19.128 --> 04:57:19.138 align:start position:0%
have that competitive integrated
 
04:57:19.138 --> 04:57:20.690 align:start position:0%
have that competitive integrated
employment

04:57:20.690 --> 04:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
employment
 
04:57:23.050 --> 04:57:23.060 align:start position:0%
um I look at EAP again another
 
04:57:25.128 --> 04:57:25.138 align:start position:0%
incredible program
 
04:57:26.570 --> 04:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
um in the state of New Hampshire as
 
04:57:28.010 --> 04:57:28.020 align:start position:0%
another collaborator when we're looking
 
04:57:29.868 --> 04:57:29.878 align:start position:0%
at Ada coordination when we're looking
 
04:57:31.970 --> 04:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
at recovery friendly
 
04:57:34.190 --> 04:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
um just across the Spectrum either if
 
04:57:35.750 --> 04:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's a physical disability or mental
 
04:57:35.760 --> 04:57:36.650 align:start position:0%
it's a physical disability or mental
health

04:57:36.650 --> 04:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
health
 
04:57:39.110 --> 04:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
um disability uh the Ada has come so far
 
04:57:41.868 --> 04:57:41.878 align:start position:0%
in in the 32 years since uh it's been
 
04:57:41.878 --> 04:57:43.310 align:start position:0%
in in the 32 years since uh it's been
enacted

04:57:43.310 --> 04:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
enacted
 
04:57:45.230 --> 04:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
um so that's the additional prioritized
 
04:57:47.628 --> 04:57:47.638 align:start position:0%
needs requests and then moving on
 
04:57:49.970 --> 04:57:49.980 align:start position:0%
um there although not written within the
 
04:57:53.930 --> 04:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
handout respectfully I would also ask
 
04:57:55.730 --> 04:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
that we consider or that you consider
 
04:57:59.750 --> 04:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
the hrsu for the gcd the human resources
 
04:58:01.610 --> 04:58:01.620 align:start position:0%
support unit
 
04:58:04.368 --> 04:58:04.378 align:start position:0%
um I think that again in I think just
 
04:58:06.470 --> 04:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
another Innovative concept that
 
04:58:08.930 --> 04:58:08.940 align:start position:0%
obviously the uh division of personnel
 
04:58:10.970 --> 04:58:10.980 align:start position:0%
has come up with and I um we do have
 
04:58:13.250 --> 04:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
figures from the division of personnel
 
04:58:15.410 --> 04:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
that would run to the um in the amount
 
04:58:15.420 --> 04:58:16.090 align:start position:0%
that would run to the um in the amount
of

04:58:16.090 --> 04:58:16.100 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:58:19.868 --> 04:58:19.878 align:start position:0%
5292 for FY 24 and
 
04:58:23.448 --> 04:58:23.458 align:start position:0%
5502 for FY 25.
 
04:58:25.670 --> 04:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
um we are a small agency but I but I
 
04:58:26.750 --> 04:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
have to tell you from what I see about
 
04:58:29.690 --> 04:58:29.700 align:start position:0%
HR SEO it really benefits both lodgy and
 
04:58:29.700 --> 04:58:30.890 align:start position:0%
HR SEO it really benefits both lodgy and
small

04:58:30.890 --> 04:58:30.900 align:start position:0%
small
 
04:58:33.110 --> 04:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
um from what I can speak to is and you
 
04:58:34.970 --> 04:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
know Stacy does an incredible job when
 
04:58:36.890 --> 04:58:36.900 align:start position:0%
it comes to the finances
 
04:58:38.628 --> 04:58:38.638 align:start position:0%
um and she really does what she can to
 
04:58:41.030 --> 04:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
get up to speed on the HR protocols as
 
04:58:43.430 --> 04:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
it applies to
 
04:58:46.430 --> 04:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
um payroll and any other human resource
 
04:58:48.170 --> 04:58:48.180 align:start position:0%
but again what we see with the business
 
04:58:50.868 --> 04:58:50.878 align:start position:0%
administrators their Forte are the
 
04:58:53.030 --> 04:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
numbers they sit in and they can work
 
04:58:55.730 --> 04:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
through on the human resources
 
04:58:57.708 --> 04:58:57.718 align:start position:0%
um but again to have that support of the
 
04:59:00.470 --> 04:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
hrsu who then will deal with Stacy
 
04:59:03.110 --> 04:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
directly in my opinion would be an
 
04:59:05.390 --> 04:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
advantage not only to the gcd but even
 
04:59:08.570 --> 04:59:08.580 align:start position:0%
to the state as a whole so with that I
 
04:59:10.368 --> 04:59:10.378 align:start position:0%
will I can keep going but I will keep it
 
04:59:11.990 --> 04:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
limited because I know you have a busy
 
04:59:13.788 --> 04:59:13.798 align:start position:0%
schedule so thank you for your time
 
04:59:17.510 --> 04:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and this was a a wonderful
 
04:59:19.190 --> 04:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
presentation to dovetail off of your
 
04:59:21.410 --> 04:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
presentation to the executive Council
 
04:59:24.170 --> 04:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
well thank you which uh it was widely
 
04:59:26.390 --> 04:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
well received and thank you very much we
 
04:59:27.890 --> 04:59:27.900 align:start position:0%
don't usually get they don't usually let
 
04:59:30.230 --> 04:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
me attend the breakfast meetings but
 
04:59:32.090 --> 04:59:32.100 align:start position:0%
because it was a home court advantage I
 
04:59:33.830 --> 04:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
got to go to that we lucked up with the
 
04:59:35.690 --> 04:59:35.700 align:start position:0%
location it was very very worth my time
 
04:59:38.810 --> 04:59:38.820 align:start position:0%
so thank you so much just a a question
 
04:59:42.590 --> 04:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
on how the pandemic has impacted you
 
04:59:44.690 --> 04:59:44.700 align:start position:0%
especially I mean we we've heard we hear
 
04:59:46.250 --> 04:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
so many stories from other agencies
 
04:59:48.770 --> 04:59:48.780 align:start position:0%
about procurement and being able to find
 
04:59:50.448 --> 04:59:50.458 align:start position:0%
contractors and materials and everything
 
04:59:52.550 --> 04:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
I imagine that would be especially true
 
04:59:53.750 --> 04:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about trying to make
 
04:59:55.670 --> 04:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
a home ADA Compliant home or a business
 
04:59:58.490 --> 04:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
ADA Compliant is that something you've
 
05:00:01.430 --> 05:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
run into and if you could just uh maybe
 
05:00:02.868 --> 05:00:02.878 align:start position:0%
enlighten me a little bit about the
 
05:00:05.810 --> 05:00:05.820 align:start position:0%
challenges that that's remain now
 
05:00:08.810 --> 05:00:08.820 align:start position:0%
sure it's a um it's a great question you
 
05:00:11.868 --> 05:00:11.878 align:start position:0%
know obviously the pandemic was uh you
 
05:00:13.190 --> 05:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
know new to all of us and there were
 
05:00:15.470 --> 05:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
there were many many issues that in
 
05:00:17.208 --> 05:00:17.218 align:start position:0%
calls and emails that were coming into
 
05:00:20.208 --> 05:00:20.218 align:start position:0%
the Ada excuse me into the gcd
 
05:00:22.250 --> 05:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
um and we were learning as we go
 
05:00:23.270 --> 05:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
um essentially
 
05:00:25.250 --> 05:00:25.260 align:start position:0%
um do I uh there issues were there
 
05:00:27.110 --> 05:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
issues with supply chain issues and
 
05:00:29.690 --> 05:00:29.700 align:start position:0%
whether or not contract is could make
 
05:00:33.650 --> 05:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
what we see even a residential home
 
05:00:37.070 --> 05:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
um uh ADA Compliant or even just to put
 
05:00:38.390 --> 05:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
in a ramp for an individual because
 
05:00:40.010 --> 05:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
technically when you're looking at a
 
05:00:42.708 --> 05:00:42.718 align:start position:0%
single family residence it's not under
 
05:00:45.410 --> 05:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
the same building code requirements per
 
05:00:46.970 --> 05:00:46.980 align:start position:0%
se as a commercial building would be
 
05:00:48.470 --> 05:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
because it's your own residence but if
 
05:00:50.690 --> 05:00:50.700 align:start position:0%
an individual needed a ramp to get it to
 
05:00:53.208 --> 05:00:53.218 align:start position:0%
get a contractor in there was difficult
 
05:00:55.128 --> 05:00:55.138 align:start position:0%
and and we were Fielding those calls
 
05:00:56.868 --> 05:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
doing the best we could working with
 
05:00:58.970 --> 05:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
various um agencies you know the nice
 
05:01:00.890 --> 05:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
thing about the gcd you know sitting
 
05:01:02.448 --> 05:01:02.458 align:start position:0%
what right within the state government
 
05:01:04.550 --> 05:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
in the governor's office I've always
 
05:01:06.288 --> 05:01:06.298 align:start position:0%
looked at that from the day I started my
 
05:01:09.350 --> 05:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
tenure is an incredible
 
05:01:09.360 --> 05:01:10.448 align:start position:0%
tenure is an incredible
um

05:01:10.448 --> 05:01:10.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:13.430 --> 05:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
Advantage for the gcd we're not an
 
05:01:15.350 --> 05:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency and and I say that
 
05:01:17.930 --> 05:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
openly but what we are we're an agency
 
05:01:20.448 --> 05:01:20.458 align:start position:0%
that's willing to collaborate so at the
 
05:01:23.208 --> 05:01:23.218 align:start position:0%
end of the day when when I'm dealing
 
05:01:25.850 --> 05:01:25.860 align:start position:0%
with a with a constituent are as
 
05:01:28.250 --> 05:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
importantly someone who is working with
 
05:01:30.890 --> 05:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
a constituent who feels agreed for us to
 
05:01:33.170 --> 05:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
have the governor's office behind us we
 
05:01:34.430 --> 05:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
work very closely with governance
 
05:01:36.890 --> 05:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
constituent services on times
 
05:01:38.930 --> 05:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
um ends up being you know a definite
 
05:01:42.350 --> 05:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
Advantage for the GCT so again we were
 
05:01:45.470 --> 05:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
filled in many calls as it related to
 
05:01:48.050 --> 05:01:48.060 align:start position:0%
um compliance I'm getting contract as
 
05:01:50.390 --> 05:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
I'm into a building and and truthfully
 
05:01:52.788 --> 05:01:52.798 align:start position:0%
it it just comes down to it and you know
 
05:01:54.890 --> 05:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
we have a great website it's it we're
 
05:01:56.930 --> 05:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
undergoing um changes now to bring it up
 
05:01:58.670 --> 05:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
to the most current
 
05:02:00.530 --> 05:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
it's one thing to tell a person to fill
 
05:02:02.208 --> 05:02:02.218 align:start position:0%
out an ADA assistance form and that's
 
05:02:03.770 --> 05:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
great they should fill out the form get
 
05:02:05.810 --> 05:02:05.820 align:start position:0%
back to us but what I owe what's most
 
05:02:07.788 --> 05:02:07.798 align:start position:0%
important for our office is to speak to
 
05:02:08.990 --> 05:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
the person because that's what the
 
05:02:10.850 --> 05:02:10.860 align:start position:0%
person wants to hear
 
05:02:13.730 --> 05:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
um and I know some agencies it it varies
 
05:02:15.530 --> 05:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
but we we do the best we can to have
 
05:02:18.170 --> 05:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
that one-on-one and to collaborate and
 
05:02:20.150 --> 05:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
to mediate to bring the parties together
 
05:02:22.190 --> 05:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
and truthfully I think that that even
 
05:02:24.288 --> 05:02:24.298 align:start position:0%
you know pans out in state government I
 
05:02:26.150 --> 05:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
there are times when I may call
 
05:02:28.550 --> 05:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner Allen house or even any it
 
05:02:29.930 --> 05:02:29.940 align:start position:0%
might be commissioner still it was in
 
05:02:32.448 --> 05:02:32.458 align:start position:0%
the role model or uh you know direct the
 
05:02:34.490 --> 05:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
Mason just to you know to really just
 
05:02:37.730 --> 05:02:37.740 align:start position:0%
collaborate to resolve an issue
 
05:02:44.350 --> 05:02:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:46.550 --> 05:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much thank you
 
05:02:50.330 --> 05:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:51.470 --> 05:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
I'd like to invite the New Hampshire
 
05:02:56.030 --> 05:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:05.830 --> 05:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:07.610 --> 05:03:07.620 align:start position:0%
are you going to talk about the highway
 
05:03:09.288 --> 05:03:09.298 align:start position:0%
from the doll
 
05:03:14.628 --> 05:03:14.638 align:start position:0%

although today's presenters are new in
 
05:03:36.410 --> 05:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
this capacity
 
05:03:39.170 --> 05:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
and hrs's message is the same we still
 
05:03:41.448 --> 05:03:41.458 align:start position:0%
have some challenges in front of us and
 
05:03:43.730 --> 05:03:43.740 align:start position:0%
we are pleased with a positive progress
 
05:03:45.288 --> 05:03:45.298 align:start position:0%
we have made and the significant
 
05:03:47.208 --> 05:03:47.218 align:start position:0%
operational improvements which have been
 
05:03:50.030 --> 05:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
implemented over the past decade
 
05:03:53.390 --> 05:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
Our member level has remained steady and
 
05:03:55.250 --> 05:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
the number of our retirees and
 
05:03:57.890 --> 05:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries continues to increase as
 
05:03:57.900 --> 05:03:59.510 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries continues to increase as
expected

05:03:59.510 --> 05:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
expected
 
05:04:03.170 --> 05:04:03.180 align:start position:0%
let me go over some brief highlights
 
05:04:05.510 --> 05:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
our statutory administrative budget
 
05:04:08.570 --> 05:04:08.580 align:start position:0%
before you today encompasses all the
 
05:04:10.788 --> 05:04:10.798 align:start position:0%
internal non-investment related
 
05:04:13.788 --> 05:04:13.798 align:start position:0%
Administration costs including projected
 
05:04:16.750 --> 05:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
I.T costs at full value
 
05:04:19.730 --> 05:04:19.740 align:start position:0%
nhrs's Board of Trustees reviews and
 
05:04:21.708 --> 05:04:21.718 align:start position:0%
approves the statutory administrative
 
05:04:23.628 --> 05:04:23.638 align:start position:0%
budget biennially
 
05:04:27.590 --> 05:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
the budget for fiscal year 23 is 12.1
 
05:04:30.288 --> 05:04:30.298 align:start position:0%
million and our proposed budgets for the
 
05:04:33.110 --> 05:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
next two years are slightly higher at 13
 
05:04:36.948 --> 05:04:36.958 align:start position:0%
million for a fiscal of year 24 and 13.7
 
05:04:39.948 --> 05:04:39.958 align:start position:0%
million for fiscal year 25. and that's
 
05:04:42.288 --> 05:04:42.298 align:start position:0%
based on fully Staffing all authorized
 
05:04:44.868 --> 05:04:44.878 align:start position:0%
positions and completion of our pension
 
05:04:49.128 --> 05:04:49.138 align:start position:0%
system administrative software upgrade
 
05:04:52.310 --> 05:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
as you well know nhrs is not an
 
05:04:55.250 --> 05:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
executive agency and does not rely on
 
05:04:58.010 --> 05:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
General funds for its funding
 
05:05:01.310 --> 05:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
and caught our contributions come from
 
05:05:03.288 --> 05:05:03.298 align:start position:0%
employers and members and investment
 
05:05:03.298 --> 05:05:05.868 align:start position:0%
employers and members and investment
returns

05:05:05.868 --> 05:05:05.878 align:start position:0%
returns
 
05:05:07.850 --> 05:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to review some key facts
 
05:05:11.150 --> 05:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
about nhrs with you and HRS provides a
 
05:05:13.250 --> 05:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
modest pension benefit the average
 
05:05:16.208 --> 05:05:16.218 align:start position:0%
annual pension benefit is just over 21
 
05:05:19.010 --> 05:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
800 dollars
 
05:05:21.410 --> 05:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
the nhrs benefits that are paid help
 
05:05:24.110 --> 05:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
support the New Hampshire economy in the
 
05:05:26.810 --> 05:05:26.820 align:start position:0%
last fiscal year and HRS paid out more
 
05:05:30.230 --> 05:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
than 900 million in pensions and 45
 
05:05:32.750 --> 05:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
million in medical subsidy benefits
 
05:05:35.750 --> 05:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
almost 80 percent of retirees live here
 
05:05:37.910 --> 05:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and spend their money
 
05:05:41.930 --> 05:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
here supporting many jobs Statewide
 
05:05:44.390 --> 05:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
and fortunately we have a plan in place
 
05:05:47.208 --> 05:05:47.218 align:start position:0%
to pay down the nhrs unfunded liability
 
05:05:51.350 --> 05:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
and we continue to execute on this plan
 
05:05:53.570 --> 05:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
There are 16 years remaining on the
 
05:05:55.490 --> 05:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
payoff of the original unfunded
 
05:06:00.830 --> 05:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
liability which existed back in 2007.
 
05:06:03.470 --> 05:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
the employer contribution rates for the
 
05:06:06.050 --> 05:06:06.060 align:start position:0%
four membership classifications employee
 
05:06:09.890 --> 05:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
teacher police and fire will decrease in
 
05:06:13.930 --> 05:06:13.940 align:start position:0%
fiscal years 24-25 from
 
05:06:17.270 --> 05:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
3.75 percent to eight percent depending
 
05:06:19.970 --> 05:06:19.980 align:start position:0%
upon the member group and setting these
 
05:06:21.948 --> 05:06:21.958 align:start position:0%
employer contribution rates is one of
 
05:06:23.810 --> 05:06:23.820 align:start position:0%
the key responsibilities for our
 
05:06:27.368 --> 05:06:27.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:30.470 --> 05:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
our 13 trustees continue to strengthen
 
05:06:33.110 --> 05:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
the plan by adopting sound and realistic
 
05:06:36.350 --> 05:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
Actuarial assumptions recommended by our
 
05:06:36.360 --> 05:06:38.750 align:start position:0%
Actuarial assumptions recommended by our
actuaries

05:06:38.750 --> 05:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
actuaries
 
05:06:41.208 --> 05:06:41.218 align:start position:0%
because of its strong constitutional and
 
05:06:44.270 --> 05:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
statutory Foundation nhrs is on the path
 
05:06:46.910 --> 05:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
to full funding the retirement system is
 
05:06:49.330 --> 05:06:49.340 align:start position:0%
making good progress on paying down its
 
05:06:52.490 --> 05:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability
 
05:06:56.030 --> 05:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
and our unfunded liability I'm sorry our
 
05:07:01.090 --> 05:07:01.100 align:start position:0%
funded ratio increased to 65.6 points
 
05:07:05.410 --> 05:07:05.420 align:start position:0%
0.6 percent in fiscal year 22 up from
 
05:07:09.530 --> 05:07:09.540 align:start position:0%
64.2 percent in fiscal year 21.
 
05:07:11.570 --> 05:07:11.580 align:start position:0%
now I'll review some of the highlights
 
05:07:14.868 --> 05:07:14.878 align:start position:0%
which are on pages four and five
 
05:07:16.970 --> 05:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
we remain on schedule with our
 
05:07:19.368 --> 05:07:19.378 align:start position:0%
multi-year project to upgrade our core
 
05:07:19.378 --> 05:07:20.570 align:start position:0%
multi-year project to upgrade our core
pension

05:07:20.570 --> 05:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
pension
 
05:07:23.868 --> 05:07:23.878 align:start position:0%
application from the 22 year old version
 
05:07:25.550 --> 05:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
to the new
 
05:07:28.010 --> 05:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
version version three and that project
 
05:07:31.310 --> 05:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
is now at 67 percent complete
 
05:07:34.070 --> 05:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
we've implemented the statutory changes
 
05:07:37.670 --> 05:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
enacted in 2022 these seven bills as a
 
05:07:39.650 --> 05:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
group were the most sweeping statutory
 
05:07:44.390 --> 05:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
changes that affected nhrs since 2011.
 
05:07:47.030 --> 05:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
you can see on page four the chart that
 
05:07:49.250 --> 05:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
illustrates how our funded ratio has
 
05:07:52.490 --> 05:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
been improving over the past few years
 
05:07:54.890 --> 05:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
although we realize the negative six
 
05:07:57.890 --> 05:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
point a negative 6.1 percent return on
 
05:07:59.930 --> 05:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
investments in the fiscal year ended
 
05:08:02.810 --> 05:08:02.820 align:start position:0%
June 30 2022.
 
05:08:06.590 --> 05:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
however we did over the longer term have
 
05:08:09.170 --> 05:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
returns that exceeded our assumed rate
 
05:08:10.250 --> 05:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
of return
 
05:08:12.890 --> 05:08:12.900 align:start position:0%
in addition our return exceeded our
 
05:08:15.948 --> 05:08:15.958 align:start position:0%
Benchmark and nhrs did perform better
 
05:08:18.530 --> 05:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
than two-thirds of its peers in fiscal
 
05:08:20.930 --> 05:08:20.940 align:start position:0%
year 22 and we were in the top 20
 
05:08:23.930 --> 05:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
percent over the past decade compared to
 
05:08:26.090 --> 05:08:26.100 align:start position:0%
other pension public pension plans of
 
05:08:32.510 --> 05:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:35.090 --> 05:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
we continue to look for ways to improve
 
05:08:37.250 --> 05:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
efficiency at nhrs
 
05:08:40.190 --> 05:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
we maintained and expanded various cyber
 
05:08:41.990 --> 05:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
security enhancements designed to
 
05:08:44.628 --> 05:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
protect the security of our system and
 
05:08:45.890 --> 05:08:45.900 align:start position:0%
our members
 
05:08:47.930 --> 05:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
personal information
 
05:08:50.150 --> 05:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
we stopped accepting unencrypted email
 
05:08:51.590 --> 05:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
attachments sent to the general
 
05:08:54.590 --> 05:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
information mailbox which has been a
 
05:08:57.948 --> 05:08:57.958 align:start position:0%
huge help for us for securing our system
 
05:08:59.810 --> 05:08:59.820 align:start position:0%
however we do have significant
 
05:09:02.510 --> 05:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
challenges and opportunities we continue
 
05:09:05.330 --> 05:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
to review and adjust as needed the
 
05:09:07.970 --> 05:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
Investment Portfolio to meet or exceed
 
05:09:10.750 --> 05:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
the system's assumed rate of return of
 
05:09:14.270 --> 05:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
6.75 percent over the long term while
 
05:09:18.050 --> 05:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
managing risk return and liquidity
 
05:09:20.270 --> 05:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
an Actuarial experience will be
 
05:09:21.948 --> 05:09:21.958 align:start position:0%
conducted for the four-year period
 
05:09:25.430 --> 05:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
ending June 30 2023 the study will
 
05:09:27.530 --> 05:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
further the process of assuring that the
 
05:09:29.448 --> 05:09:29.458 align:start position:0%
funding of the system is in alignment
 
05:09:31.730 --> 05:09:31.740 align:start position:0%
with anticipated costs for providing
 
05:09:31.740 --> 05:09:36.530 align:start position:0%
with anticipated costs for providing
benefits

05:09:36.530 --> 05:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:40.090 --> 05:09:40.100 align:start position:0%
and now I will turn the table over to
 
05:09:43.128 --> 05:09:43.138 align:start position:0%
Marie Mullen to review and detail our
 
05:09:47.750 --> 05:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:49.550 --> 05:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
hi good afternoon
 
05:09:51.770 --> 05:09:51.780 align:start position:0%
uh so the Retirement Systems uh
 
05:09:54.410 --> 05:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
administrative budget for fiscal year
 
05:09:57.948 --> 05:09:57.958 align:start position:0%
2024 we are proposing a 7.1 percent
 
05:10:01.128 --> 05:10:01.138 align:start position:0%
increase over fiscal year 23's budget
 
05:10:05.690 --> 05:10:05.700 align:start position:0%
and for fiscal year 2025 it fi it's a
 
05:10:07.610 --> 05:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
five percent increase and that's that
 
05:10:09.288 --> 05:10:09.298 align:start position:0%
five percent is compared to the fiscal
 
05:10:11.690 --> 05:10:11.700 align:start position:0%
year 2024 budget
 
05:10:13.610 --> 05:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
um the the primary increases in our
 
05:10:13.620 --> 05:10:14.570 align:start position:0%
um the the primary increases in our
budget

05:10:14.570 --> 05:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
budget
 
05:10:16.430 --> 05:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
um first and foremost are salaries and
 
05:10:20.090 --> 05:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
benefits uh the retirement system has um
 
05:10:22.128 --> 05:10:22.138 align:start position:0%
already negotiated a three-year contract
 
05:10:24.770 --> 05:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
with employees so we already know what
 
05:10:28.010 --> 05:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
our 24 and 25 salary projections are so
 
05:10:29.750 --> 05:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
benefits are in there as well
 
05:10:32.090 --> 05:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
we have increases in our technology
 
05:10:34.490 --> 05:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
software and Hardware Hardware related
 
05:10:37.490 --> 05:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
to cyber security and a significant
 
05:10:39.050 --> 05:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
server replacement that will occur
 
05:10:41.570 --> 05:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
during that time frame as well
 
05:10:43.910 --> 05:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
and then the the other major area of
 
05:10:46.550 --> 05:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
increases are related to the our pension
 
05:10:49.070 --> 05:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
gold software implementation
 
05:10:51.650 --> 05:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
um so we have the that software upgrade
 
05:10:53.810 --> 05:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
and so we have increases related to that
 
05:10:56.810 --> 05:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
during that time frame as we move into
 
05:10:58.970 --> 05:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
completion of that over this time over
 
05:11:01.500 --> 05:11:01.510 align:start position:0%
that over the next biennium
 
05:11:01.510 --> 05:11:01.788 align:start position:0%
that over the next biennium
[Music]

05:11:01.788 --> 05:11:01.798 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:11:01.798 --> 05:11:03.350 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

05:11:03.350 --> 05:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:06.170 --> 05:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
any ques we're open to any questions and
 
05:11:07.788 --> 05:11:07.798 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions on the budget
 
05:11:07.798 --> 05:11:09.010 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions on the budget
or

05:11:09.010 --> 05:11:09.020 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:11:13.368 --> 05:11:13.378 align:start position:0%
sure just uh question about the unfunded
 
05:11:15.350 --> 05:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
pension liability
 
05:11:17.330 --> 05:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
how does New Hampshire's unfunded
 
05:11:20.090 --> 05:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
pension liability compare with other
 
05:11:22.070 --> 05:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
states both regionally say New England
 
05:11:23.930 --> 05:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
and then in the country as a whole
 
05:11:25.910 --> 05:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
anyway has typically been I'm not sure I
 
05:11:27.770 --> 05:11:27.780 align:start position:0%
might be out of date but it's always or
 
05:11:29.330 --> 05:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
at least recently Wisconsin has always
 
05:11:31.190 --> 05:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
been the model of having the lowest
 
05:11:32.990 --> 05:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
unfunded pension liability and I think
 
05:11:34.510 --> 05:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
maybe like New Jersey is always
 
05:11:37.670 --> 05:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
typically one of the worst but Illinois
 
05:11:39.590 --> 05:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
is another one yeah
 
05:11:42.708 --> 05:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
where do where do we stand well it's
 
05:11:45.470 --> 05:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
hard to State it in terms of the
 
05:11:47.448 --> 05:11:47.458 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability because that is also
 
05:11:49.670 --> 05:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
such a function of the size of the state
 
05:11:53.208 --> 05:11:53.218 align:start position:0%
and the size of the total
 
05:11:56.690 --> 05:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
employment of public employees and the
 
05:11:58.970 --> 05:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
different investment portfolios uh maybe
 
05:12:02.150 --> 05:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
a better way to compare them is in terms
 
05:12:04.010 --> 05:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
of funded ratio
 
05:12:07.010 --> 05:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
so in terms of funded ratio we are a bit
 
05:12:11.150 --> 05:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
below our peers but we are solidly on a
 
05:12:13.850 --> 05:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
trajectory of getting to 100 funding
 
05:12:16.250 --> 05:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
we're very fortunate
 
05:12:17.868 --> 05:12:17.878 align:start position:0%
um that a number of years ago the
 
05:12:20.330 --> 05:12:20.340 align:start position:0%
legislature took important steps to
 
05:12:22.670 --> 05:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
ensure that we will be
 
05:12:24.650 --> 05:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
that we will continue to direct
 
05:12:28.490 --> 05:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
trajectory to 100 funding and as I noted
 
05:12:31.128 --> 05:12:31.138 align:start position:0%
earlier we did increase our funded ratio
 
05:12:33.770 --> 05:12:33.780 align:start position:0%
from last year to this year one
 
05:12:36.110 --> 05:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
interesting thing to compare it us with
 
05:12:37.850 --> 05:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
is the state of Maine
 
05:12:40.070 --> 05:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
they were basically in the same
 
05:12:43.610 --> 05:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
situation we were but 10 years ago
 
05:12:45.948 --> 05:12:45.958 align:start position:0%
before we started our Improvement they
 
05:12:47.990 --> 05:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
started their own set of improvements
 
05:12:50.510 --> 05:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
and right now their funded ratio is in
 
05:12:52.910 --> 05:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
the 80s and in the next few years they
 
05:12:55.670 --> 05:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
will be fully funded so we are hoping
 
05:12:55.680 --> 05:12:57.288 align:start position:0%
will be fully funded so we are hoping
that

05:12:57.288 --> 05:12:57.298 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:12:59.208 --> 05:12:59.218 align:start position:0%
um consistent with them that we continue
 
05:13:01.368 --> 05:13:01.378 align:start position:0%
to stay on this good path that we are on
 
05:13:04.610 --> 05:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
and we have turned the corner as far as
 
05:13:06.890 --> 05:13:06.900 align:start position:0%
our unfunded liability is it is now
 
05:13:09.170 --> 05:13:09.180 align:start position:0%
starting to decrease rather than
 
05:13:11.930 --> 05:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
increase and that's because the
 
05:13:14.390 --> 05:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
legislature made the commitment to
 
05:13:17.868 --> 05:13:17.878 align:start position:0%
ensuring that nhrs gets its full
 
05:13:20.330 --> 05:13:20.340 align:start position:0%
employer contributions every year
 
05:13:23.170 --> 05:13:23.180 align:start position:0%
because it's having the contributions
 
05:13:25.910 --> 05:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
received so they can earn investment
 
05:13:28.990 --> 05:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
income that's the key to getting to 100
 
05:13:32.330 --> 05:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
funding yeah how does your investment
 
05:13:34.550 --> 05:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
guidelines differ from those of the
 
05:13:37.070 --> 05:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
state as a whole then the treasury is
 
05:13:38.690 --> 05:13:38.700 align:start position:0%
very limited in what they can invest in
 
05:13:40.310 --> 05:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
it's basically U.S treasuries or some
 
05:13:43.128 --> 05:13:43.138 align:start position:0%
derivative thereof uh I would imagine
 
05:13:45.830 --> 05:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
yours vary from that
 
05:13:48.410 --> 05:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
yes hours are very different from that
 
05:13:50.570 --> 05:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
because unlike the state which is
 
05:13:53.948 --> 05:13:53.958 align:start position:0%
typically a very short-term investor and
 
05:13:58.270 --> 05:13:58.280 align:start position:0%
liquidity is the primary concern
 
05:14:01.850 --> 05:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
nhrs has the luxury of being a long-term
 
05:14:04.610 --> 05:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
investor so we are always looking for
 
05:14:07.310 --> 05:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
the best risk adjusted return that we
 
05:14:08.390 --> 05:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
can get
 
05:14:12.708 --> 05:14:12.718 align:start position:0%
and because of that we are looking at
 
05:14:15.110 --> 05:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
and invest in very different types of
 
05:14:17.390 --> 05:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
investments in the state does which is a
 
05:14:19.670 --> 05:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
short-term investor as a long-term
 
05:14:22.610 --> 05:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
investor it's appropriate for us to
 
05:14:25.690 --> 05:14:25.700 align:start position:0%
purchase stocks and bonds as well as
 
05:14:28.730 --> 05:14:28.740 align:start position:0%
alternative Investments such as real
 
05:14:31.610 --> 05:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
estate and private equity
 
05:14:31.620 --> 05:14:32.690 align:start position:0%
estate and private equity
okay

05:14:32.690 --> 05:14:32.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:14:35.230 --> 05:14:35.240 align:start position:0%
do you have any uh exposure to
 
05:14:35.240 --> 05:14:37.090 align:start position:0%
do you have any uh exposure to
cryptocurrency

05:14:37.090 --> 05:14:37.100 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency
 
05:14:40.368 --> 05:14:40.378 align:start position:0%
we have been reviewing our portfolio and
 
05:14:43.070 --> 05:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
it found minimal if no investments in
 
05:14:47.208 --> 05:14:47.218 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency okay great thank you
 
05:14:47.218 --> 05:14:49.490 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency okay great thank you
hi

05:14:49.490 --> 05:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
hi
 
05:14:49.500 --> 05:14:51.470 align:start position:0%
hi
um

05:14:51.470 --> 05:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:53.030 --> 05:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
I have a couple questions one I
 
05:14:55.850 --> 05:14:55.860 align:start position:0%
appreciate the the comparison to your
 
05:14:57.590 --> 05:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
performance of the to the peer group and
 
05:15:00.288 --> 05:15:00.298 align:start position:0%
and just note that we're doing
 
05:15:03.550 --> 05:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
uh in the top two-thirds I think it said
 
05:15:05.628 --> 05:15:05.638 align:start position:0%
compared to a peer group on investments
 
05:15:07.430 --> 05:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
which is terrific
 
05:15:08.390 --> 05:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned the collective
 
05:15:10.368 --> 05:15:10.378 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement
 
05:15:12.288 --> 05:15:12.298 align:start position:0%
um I presume your numbers are relatively
 
05:15:15.948 --> 05:15:15.958 align:start position:0%
public and I ask what they settled at
 
05:15:18.050 --> 05:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
what kind of race did you give for
 
05:15:22.730 --> 05:15:22.740 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 it was 4.75 and fiscal
 
05:15:27.230 --> 05:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:29.570 --> 05:15:29.580 align:start position:0%
um thanks I just I suspect that will
 
05:15:32.448 --> 05:15:32.458 align:start position:0%
inform the pressure that we have
 
05:15:33.890 --> 05:15:33.900 align:start position:0%
um I have a question on the unfunded
 
05:15:33.900 --> 05:15:34.850 align:start position:0%
um I have a question on the unfunded
liability

05:15:34.850 --> 05:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
liability
 
05:15:37.368 --> 05:15:37.378 align:start position:0%
um 80 of it 80 of our employer
 
05:15:40.128 --> 05:15:40.138 align:start position:0%
contribution is going toward paying
 
05:15:42.948 --> 05:15:42.958 align:start position:0%
off the original
 
05:15:45.110 --> 05:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
no 80 is going to have to pay the whole
 
05:15:45.120 --> 05:15:47.330 align:start position:0%
no 80 is going to have to pay the whole
uaal

05:15:47.330 --> 05:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
uaal
 
05:15:49.730 --> 05:15:49.740 align:start position:0%
um and it it sounds like
 
05:15:51.230 --> 05:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
um the bulk of that has 16 years
 
05:15:54.708 --> 05:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
remaining uh but there are portions of
 
05:15:56.030 --> 05:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
that that have more than 16 years
 
05:15:57.890 --> 05:15:57.900 align:start position:0%
remaining is that right how does that
 
05:16:01.550 --> 05:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:03.708 --> 05:16:03.718 align:start position:0%
the majority of the unfunded liability
 
05:16:07.690 --> 05:16:07.700 align:start position:0%
at this point was attributable to
 
05:16:12.230 --> 05:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
pre-2017 so it's been paid off now the
 
05:16:14.410 --> 05:16:14.420 align:start position:0%
future amounts of
 
05:16:17.270 --> 05:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
liability that are incurred after 2017
 
05:16:19.850 --> 05:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
will be amortized over a new 20-year
 
05:16:19.860 --> 05:16:21.110 align:start position:0%
will be amortized over a new 20-year
periods

05:16:21.110 --> 05:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
periods
 
05:16:22.788 --> 05:16:22.798 align:start position:0%
and you have a sense of how much that is
 
05:16:24.830 --> 05:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
like are we are we keeping up are we
 
05:16:24.840 --> 05:16:26.150 align:start position:0%
like are we are we keeping up are we
following

05:16:26.150 --> 05:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
following
 
05:16:29.390 --> 05:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
we keep not quite keeping up no we are
 
05:16:31.670 --> 05:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
keeping up um the the amount since then
 
05:16:33.470 --> 05:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
are much smaller
 
05:16:46.570 --> 05:16:46.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:49.190 --> 05:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you that's exactly what I was
 
05:16:51.470 --> 05:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
asking that's very helpful
 
05:16:54.170 --> 05:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
um my next question is about
 
05:16:56.208 --> 05:16:56.218 align:start position:0%
so the four subgroups my understanding
 
05:16:58.490 --> 05:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
is have different different ratios of
 
05:16:59.628 --> 05:16:59.638 align:start position:0%
funding and are we paying them
 
05:17:02.810 --> 05:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
differently yes each subgroup has its
 
05:17:04.970 --> 05:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
own employer and member contribution
 
05:17:08.150 --> 05:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
rates and do we feel like we're
 
05:17:09.770 --> 05:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
um with each of the four different
 
05:17:09.780 --> 05:17:12.110 align:start position:0%
um with each of the four different
subgroups

05:17:12.110 --> 05:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
subgroups
 
05:17:15.470 --> 05:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
um is the current structure so I'm going
 
05:17:18.890 --> 05:17:18.900 align:start position:0%
to think of the current structure as
 
05:17:21.288 --> 05:17:21.298 align:start position:0%
um are we taking enough out absence of
 
05:17:23.330 --> 05:17:23.340 align:start position:0%
money we're amortizing are we taking
 
05:17:24.948 --> 05:17:24.958 align:start position:0%
enough out between the employee
 
05:17:26.708 --> 05:17:26.718 align:start position:0%
contribution the employer contribution
 
05:17:29.390 --> 05:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
and investment income to keep up to be
 
05:17:29.400 --> 05:17:31.250 align:start position:0%
and investment income to keep up to be
solvent

05:17:31.250 --> 05:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
solvent
 
05:17:33.110 --> 05:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
um and then then there's an extra that
 
05:17:34.970 --> 05:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
we're paying on top of that
 
05:17:38.030 --> 05:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
um so the extras you know 16 years 20
 
05:17:40.250 --> 05:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
years whatever is being paid in the 5.6
 
05:17:42.410 --> 05:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
but for each of those four subgroups
 
05:17:44.090 --> 05:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
there's a question about whether we're
 
05:17:46.910 --> 05:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
charging the right number or we're
 
05:17:49.550 --> 05:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
falling further behind further behind
 
05:17:51.830 --> 05:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
and accruing new liabilities and are
 
05:17:53.690 --> 05:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
they are they different because I I
 
05:17:55.310 --> 05:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
think they're probably
 
05:17:57.590 --> 05:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
varying levels of
 
05:17:57.600 --> 05:18:01.190 align:start position:0%
varying levels of
solvency

05:18:01.190 --> 05:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:03.410 --> 05:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
all of our funds are solvent
 
05:18:07.070 --> 05:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
um our actuaries every year check to see
 
05:18:07.080 --> 05:18:08.288 align:start position:0%
um our actuaries every year check to see
that

05:18:08.288 --> 05:18:08.298 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:18:11.628 --> 05:18:11.638 align:start position:0%
we have sufficient funds
 
05:18:14.570 --> 05:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
that are currently on hand and who
 
05:18:16.490 --> 05:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
expected to come in in the future to
 
05:18:18.948 --> 05:18:18.958 align:start position:0%
ensure that we can pay all the benefits
 
05:18:20.868 --> 05:18:20.878 align:start position:0%
in the future that's part of the the gas
 
05:18:23.330 --> 05:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
b68 country
 
05:18:25.910 --> 05:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
um reporting that has to be done and
 
05:18:28.910 --> 05:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
they because we have sufficient Assets
 
05:18:31.190 --> 05:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
Now we do not
 
05:18:33.410 --> 05:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
have to use the Blended rate for
 
05:18:35.868 --> 05:18:35.878 align:start position:0%
calculating our net pension liability so
 
05:18:38.208 --> 05:18:38.218 align:start position:0%
we do not have a solvency issue
 
05:18:41.770 --> 05:18:41.780 align:start position:0%
and every two years the actuaries review
 
05:18:45.590 --> 05:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
what the contribution rates need to be
 
05:18:47.810 --> 05:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we stay on this
 
05:18:50.510 --> 05:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
trajectory to 100 funding so we are not
 
05:18:53.448 --> 05:18:53.458 align:start position:0%
falling behind for any on any of the
 
05:18:55.788 --> 05:18:55.798 align:start position:0%
groups because they set each group rate
 
05:18:58.070 --> 05:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
independently of each other
 
05:18:59.868 --> 05:18:59.878 align:start position:0%
and is it fair to say there's no
 
05:18:59.878 --> 05:19:03.110 align:start position:0%
and is it fair to say there's no
cross-subsidization

05:19:03.110 --> 05:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:05.208 --> 05:19:05.218 align:start position:0%
that we're not overcharging teachers to
 
05:19:08.110 --> 05:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
fund employees or Etc
 
05:19:11.448 --> 05:19:11.458 align:start position:0%
the actuaries look at each group as a
 
05:19:13.788 --> 05:19:13.798 align:start position:0%
separate entity to arrive at their
 
05:19:16.910 --> 05:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
contribution rates great thank you
 
05:19:16.920 --> 05:19:26.150 align:start position:0%

and how much square footage do you have
 
05:19:29.400 --> 05:19:30.770 align:start position:0%
and how much square footage do you have
I

05:19:30.770 --> 05:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:19:33.708 --> 05:19:33.718 align:start position:0%
it runs through 2035 I'm not sure on the
 
05:19:36.650 --> 05:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
Square never mind 2020.
 
05:19:37.910 --> 05:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
everything else is going to ask is
 
05:19:39.708 --> 05:19:39.718 align:start position:0%
irrelevant after that I'm sorry
 
05:19:40.850 --> 05:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
everything else I was going to ask is
 
05:19:46.250 --> 05:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:48.368 --> 05:19:48.378 align:start position:0%
yeah just be honest
 
05:19:51.830 --> 05:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
yes I we extend every five years so we
 
05:19:53.690 --> 05:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
have we have the ability to extend out
 
05:19:56.270 --> 05:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
to 2035 that's why okay that's right it
 
05:19:58.310 --> 05:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
goes through this biennium yes okay

05:25:58.368 --> 05:25:58.378 align:start position:0%
financial analyst specializing in
 
05:26:00.708 --> 05:26:00.718 align:start position:0%
Federal grant Administration from the
 
05:26:02.448 --> 05:26:02.458 align:start position:0%
land and water conservation fund to the
 
05:26:04.010 --> 05:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
National Endowment for the Arts and the
 
05:26:05.868 --> 05:26:05.878 align:start position:0%
U.S forest Service are five divisions
 
05:26:08.510 --> 05:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
administer millions of Federal grant
 
05:26:10.368 --> 05:26:10.378 align:start position:0%
funds annually
 
05:26:12.830 --> 05:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
rather than continue to oversee a very
 
05:26:14.810 --> 05:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
siled attempt to pull this off each
 
05:26:17.570 --> 05:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
Grant season each Grant round our staff
 
05:26:19.190 --> 05:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
would benefit from the support of a
 
05:26:20.930 --> 05:26:20.940 align:start position:0%
centralized service position and I
 
05:26:22.670 --> 05:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
suspect the team at Das would also
 
05:26:24.110 --> 05:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate the efficiency of working
 
05:26:26.510 --> 05:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
with a central point person rather than
 
05:26:28.190 --> 05:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
many individual Grant administrators
 
05:26:30.708 --> 05:26:30.718 align:start position:0%
sprinkled throughout our agency
 
05:26:33.288 --> 05:26:33.298 align:start position:0%
finally a position I have advocated for
 
05:26:35.510 --> 05:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
in the past and truly believe will be a
 
05:26:38.448 --> 05:26:38.458 align:start position:0%
game changer for us is to have a dncr
 
05:26:38.458 --> 05:26:39.890 align:start position:0%
game changer for us is to have a dncr
curator

05:26:39.890 --> 05:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
curator
 
05:26:41.930 --> 05:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
as part of our mission we are to provide
 
05:26:43.730 --> 05:26:43.740 align:start position:0%
access to the many Treasures that we
 
05:26:46.250 --> 05:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
manage this includes artwork historic
 
05:26:49.010 --> 05:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
items archaeological finds collections
 
05:26:50.510 --> 05:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
that have been donated to us and much
 
05:26:50.520 --> 05:26:51.770 align:start position:0%
that have been donated to us and much
more

05:26:51.770 --> 05:26:51.780 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:26:53.690 --> 05:26:53.700 align:start position:0%
my vision is to hire someone who can
 
05:26:55.430 --> 05:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
help us organize our treasures and then
 
05:26:57.830 --> 05:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
help to develop public-facing exhibits
 
05:27:00.110 --> 05:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
and programs at our State library at our
 
05:27:01.550 --> 05:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
parks and historic sites and even
 
05:27:03.770 --> 05:27:03.780 align:start position:0%
traveling exhibits to schools local
 
05:27:05.150 --> 05:27:05.160 align:start position:0%
public libraries and other community
 
05:27:05.160 --> 05:27:06.650 align:start position:0%
public libraries and other community
centers

05:27:06.650 --> 05:27:06.660 align:start position:0%
centers
 
05:27:08.448 --> 05:27:08.458 align:start position:0%
we are currently seeking a consultant
 
05:27:11.030 --> 05:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
through the RFQ process to assess the
 
05:27:12.650 --> 05:27:12.660 align:start position:0%
state library's current space and
 
05:27:14.628 --> 05:27:14.638 align:start position:0%
provide us with a plan to store much of
 
05:27:16.190 --> 05:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
the stacks in a climate-controlled
 
05:27:18.470 --> 05:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
storage facility freeing a valuable
 
05:27:19.850 --> 05:27:19.860 align:start position:0%
space for exciting and endless
 
05:27:23.270 --> 05:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
opportunities to engage the public
 
05:27:25.190 --> 05:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
other considerations in this budget
 
05:27:27.708 --> 05:27:27.718 align:start position:0%
request include accounting for dramatic
 
05:27:30.590 --> 05:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
increases in our utility expenses and
 
05:27:33.110 --> 05:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
inter-agency transfers
 
05:27:34.670 --> 05:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
something I would like to point out for
 
05:27:37.368 --> 05:27:37.378 align:start position:0%
discussion is the fact that since 2007
 
05:27:39.288 --> 05:27:39.298 align:start position:0%
when the Bureau of historic sites was
 
05:27:41.030 --> 05:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
created it was generally fund General
 
05:27:41.040 --> 05:27:42.170 align:start position:0%
created it was generally fund General
funded

05:27:42.170 --> 05:27:42.180 align:start position:0%
funded
 
05:27:44.390 --> 05:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
this was done on purpose in order to
 
05:27:46.850 --> 05:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
dedicate funds to the stewardship and
 
05:27:48.708 --> 05:27:48.718 align:start position:0%
management of our designated historic
 
05:27:50.990 --> 05:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
sites separating them from Parks funding
 
05:27:52.850 --> 05:27:52.860 align:start position:0%
which has ebbed and flowed over the
 
05:27:52.860 --> 05:27:54.170 align:start position:0%
which has ebbed and flowed over the
years

05:27:54.170 --> 05:27:54.180 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:27:56.208 --> 05:27:56.218 align:start position:0%
historic sites also have a separate
 
05:27:58.010 --> 05:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
Mission from Parks which is telling the
 
05:27:59.690 --> 05:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
stories of who we are through our
 
05:28:01.550 --> 05:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
buildings Landscapes Collections and
 
05:28:01.560 --> 05:28:03.470 align:start position:0%
buildings Landscapes Collections and
Exhibits

05:28:03.470 --> 05:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
Exhibits
 
05:28:05.330 --> 05:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
two years ago when we were asked to cut
 
05:28:07.610 --> 05:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
our overall general fund budget we did
 
05:28:09.350 --> 05:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
so without compromising our commitment
 
05:28:11.750 --> 05:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
to the Bureau of historic sites instead
 
05:28:14.990 --> 05:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
we shifted part Revenue over which you
 
05:28:17.690 --> 05:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
will see is what we did again this year
 
05:28:19.250 --> 05:28:19.260 align:start position:0%
shifting back to General funds is
 
05:28:20.570 --> 05:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
something that we would like to discuss
 
05:28:20.580 --> 05:28:22.330 align:start position:0%
something that we would like to discuss
further

05:28:22.330 --> 05:28:22.340 align:start position:0%
further
 
05:28:25.730 --> 05:28:25.740 align:start position:0%
looking at our prioritized needs we are
 
05:28:27.590 --> 05:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
making these requests consistent with
 
05:28:29.628 --> 05:28:29.638 align:start position:0%
our theme of growth and demand
 
05:28:31.610 --> 05:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's artists cultural
 
05:28:33.890 --> 05:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
organizations and for-profit venues were
 
05:28:36.050 --> 05:28:36.060 align:start position:0%
hit very hard during the pandemic and
 
05:28:38.990 --> 05:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
have not fully recovered a recent survey
 
05:28:41.510 --> 05:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
of 53 non-profit grantees
 
05:28:43.788 --> 05:28:43.798 align:start position:0%
most of which receive Arts Council
 
05:28:47.208 --> 05:28:47.218 align:start position:0%
operating support showed 2022 earned
 
05:28:51.110 --> 05:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
Revenue to date at 78 of at only 78 of
 
05:28:53.208 --> 05:28:53.218 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic levels and this is
 
05:28:55.128 --> 05:28:55.138 align:start position:0%
consistent with national Trends and is
 
05:28:55.138 --> 05:28:56.150 align:start position:0%
consistent with national Trends and is
troubling

05:28:56.150 --> 05:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
troubling
 
05:28:58.550 --> 05:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
additional state of assistance will be
 
05:29:01.670 --> 05:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
needed in the fiscal year 24 25 biennium
 
05:29:04.070 --> 05:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
as they reoriented their business models
 
05:29:07.070 --> 05:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
to what may be the new normal
 
05:29:09.050 --> 05:29:09.060 align:start position:0%
we are also seeing an opportunity to
 
05:29:10.550 --> 05:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
push Beyond critical needs to support
 
05:29:12.708 --> 05:29:12.718 align:start position:0%
the state's cultural Assets in a way
 
05:29:14.150 --> 05:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
that fulfills The increased demand from
 
05:29:16.550 --> 05:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
the public throughout the sector
 
05:29:19.430 --> 05:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
specifically requests for operating
 
05:29:21.770 --> 05:29:21.780 align:start position:0%
support have increased significantly as
 
05:29:23.810 --> 05:29:23.820 align:start position:0%
organizations mature and become eligible
 
05:29:26.330 --> 05:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
for Grants applications to this two-year
 
05:29:30.128 --> 05:29:30.138 align:start position:0%
program increase 30 percent in FY 22 23
 
05:29:33.770 --> 05:29:33.780 align:start position:0%
more than fiscal year 2021.
 
05:29:36.350 --> 05:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
requests to the Arts and health grant
 
05:29:38.510 --> 05:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
program have also increased a 33 percent
 
05:29:42.230 --> 05:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
increase in fiscal year 23 over 22 we
 
05:29:43.910 --> 05:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
project continued growth in this program
 
05:29:46.010 --> 05:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
as pandemic recovery continues
 
05:29:48.410 --> 05:29:48.420 align:start position:0%
particularly in the area of behavioral
 
05:29:51.650 --> 05:29:51.660 align:start position:0%
health and substance misuse services and
 
05:29:53.510 --> 05:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
due to this growth we are requesting a
 
05:29:55.128 --> 05:29:55.138 align:start position:0%
new grants coordinator position to lead
 
05:29:57.310 --> 05:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
this program
 
05:30:00.050 --> 05:30:00.060 align:start position:0%
I did speak with commissioner shibanet
 
05:30:02.150 --> 05:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
recently about this and she will be
 
05:30:04.310 --> 05:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
willing to um share her thoughts and
 
05:30:06.948 --> 05:30:06.958 align:start position:0%
support for this idea as well
 
05:30:09.350 --> 05:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh the artist entrepreneurial grant
 
05:30:11.270 --> 05:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
program continues to grow as artists
 
05:30:12.890 --> 05:30:12.900 align:start position:0%
build and diversify their careers in
 
05:30:15.650 --> 05:30:15.660 align:start position:0%
small businesses and there's a need for
 
05:30:17.570 --> 05:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
capacity building support for emerging
 
05:30:19.670 --> 05:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
Arts organizations particularly in the
 
05:30:21.890 --> 05:30:21.900 align:start position:0%
areas of financial management and fund
 
05:30:21.900 --> 05:30:23.030 align:start position:0%
areas of financial management and fund
development

05:30:23.030 --> 05:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
development
 
05:30:25.070 --> 05:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
so much as the state allocated funds to
 
05:30:27.050 --> 05:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
boost outdoor recreation to meet the
 
05:30:28.430 --> 05:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
needs of the public we see similar
 
05:30:31.970 --> 05:30:31.980 align:start position:0%
demand and opportunity with the Arts
 
05:30:34.490 --> 05:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
you will also see a request to support
 
05:30:36.590 --> 05:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire public television
 
05:30:39.650 --> 05:30:39.660 align:start position:0%
historically nhpbs was supported by the
 
05:30:42.530 --> 05:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
state through UNH 2.7 million annually
 
05:30:46.070 --> 05:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
but funding was eliminated in 2011.
 
05:30:48.230 --> 05:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire PBS will utilize the
 
05:30:50.270 --> 05:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
requested funds to provide the state and
 
05:30:52.368 --> 05:30:52.378 align:start position:0%
the country with engaging local content
 
05:30:54.708 --> 05:30:54.718 align:start position:0%
that showcases the state's Rich natural
 
05:30:56.690 --> 05:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
cultural historical and environmental
 
05:30:56.700 --> 05:30:58.190 align:start position:0%
cultural historical and environmental
resources

05:30:58.190 --> 05:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
resources
 
05:31:01.070 --> 05:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
some of the programming nhpbs will
 
05:31:03.288 --> 05:31:03.298 align:start position:0%
produce include our Music Arts Heritage
 
05:31:04.550 --> 05:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
and how it impacts the New Hampshire
 
05:31:07.010 --> 05:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
economy documentaries about New
 
05:31:09.350 --> 05:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's hidden history our diverse
 
05:31:11.390 --> 05:31:11.400 align:start position:0%
new populations the vibrant Farm to
 
05:31:13.250 --> 05:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
Table movement and much more
 
05:31:15.410 --> 05:31:15.420 align:start position:0%
the amount requested will simply pass
 
05:31:17.628 --> 05:31:17.638 align:start position:0%
through our agency to New Hampshire
 
05:31:19.070 --> 05:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
public television
 
05:31:21.770 --> 05:31:21.780 align:start position:0%
but by allocating it to the Arts Council
 
05:31:23.690 --> 05:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
we can count this money toward our
 
05:31:25.970 --> 05:31:25.980 align:start position:0%
federal match and this is a strategic
 
05:31:27.890 --> 05:31:27.900 align:start position:0%
way to make sure that every dollar works
 
05:31:29.628 --> 05:31:29.638 align:start position:0%
hard for New Hampshire
 
05:31:32.570 --> 05:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
in conclusion the dncr has sustained
 
05:31:34.310 --> 05:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
substantial growth over the past few
 
05:31:36.530 --> 05:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
years and in order to move ahead on this
 
05:31:38.750 --> 05:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
trajectory we have identified specific
 
05:31:40.610 --> 05:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
opportunities to put the pedal to the
 
05:31:42.470 --> 05:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
metal while staying within the three
 
05:31:44.510 --> 05:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
percent general fund growth limitation
 
05:31:47.090 --> 05:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
and by offsetting new positions we need
 
05:31:48.708 --> 05:31:48.718 align:start position:0%
with several vacant positions that we
 
05:31:49.850 --> 05:31:49.860 align:start position:0%
can abolish
 
05:31:52.670 --> 05:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
we are here to answer your questions
 
05:31:55.070 --> 05:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner
 
05:31:58.128 --> 05:31:58.138 align:start position:0%
uh sort of the the question of of the
 
05:32:00.708 --> 05:32:00.718 align:start position:0%
the this this three days revolves around
 
05:32:03.110 --> 05:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
challenges and Workforce challenges and
 
05:32:07.430 --> 05:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
I know from my old job at the dra uh
 
05:32:09.170 --> 05:32:09.180 align:start position:0%
that that at least at one point you were
 
05:32:11.330 --> 05:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
having Workforce challenges especially
 
05:32:15.110 --> 05:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
in the forest ranger area uh has that
 
05:32:16.970 --> 05:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
subsided have you had any success in
 
05:32:18.830 --> 05:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
that and overall what's your vacancy
 
05:32:21.770 --> 05:32:21.780 align:start position:0%
rate and what your work for what's your
 
05:32:23.448 --> 05:32:23.458 align:start position:0%
Workforce looking like now
 
05:32:26.570 --> 05:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
okay over overall with the agency I feel
 
05:32:30.410 --> 05:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
knock on wood pretty good about
 
05:32:34.070 --> 05:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
um fulfilling the jobs we need to um to
 
05:32:36.890 --> 05:32:36.900 align:start position:0%
adequately maintain our mission uh of
 
05:32:38.030 --> 05:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
course we have a lot of seasonal
 
05:32:40.010 --> 05:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
employees and so we get very nervous
 
05:32:41.750 --> 05:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
heading into a summer season to make
 
05:32:43.250 --> 05:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
sure we have enough lifeguards heading
 
05:32:44.990 --> 05:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
into the ski season to make sure we have
 
05:32:47.690 --> 05:32:47.700 align:start position:0%
have enough folks at Cannon Mountain but
 
05:32:50.448 --> 05:32:50.458 align:start position:0%
we've managed to uh to really be
 
05:32:52.670 --> 05:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
creative we're investing in social media
 
05:32:55.430 --> 05:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
advertising and um and we have a lot of
 
05:32:57.470 --> 05:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
folks that are seasonal that come back
 
05:32:59.330 --> 05:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
year after year because they just love
 
05:33:03.590 --> 05:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
working for the park system specific to
 
05:33:06.830 --> 05:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
the division of forests and lands I've
 
05:33:08.810 --> 05:33:08.820 align:start position:0%
I've been making this presentation now
 
05:33:10.690 --> 05:33:10.700 align:start position:0%
three times I think and we're always
 
05:33:14.030 --> 05:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
including for a stranger position in our
 
05:33:17.170 --> 05:33:17.180 align:start position:0%
request because we are not at the at the
 
05:33:20.868 --> 05:33:20.878 align:start position:0%
level we we really should be to cover
 
05:33:23.030 --> 05:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
the state and with the increased outdoor
 
05:33:23.040 --> 05:33:24.890 align:start position:0%
the state and with the increased outdoor
recreation

05:33:24.890 --> 05:33:24.900 align:start position:0%
recreation
 
05:33:27.230 --> 05:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
um you know our forest rangers are
 
05:33:28.970 --> 05:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
pulled in many directions uh
 
05:33:31.550 --> 05:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
coordinating with fish and game who also
 
05:33:33.050 --> 05:33:33.060 align:start position:0%
need a lot of people outside at this
 
05:33:35.690 --> 05:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
time so with that I'm turning to our
 
05:33:38.090 --> 05:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
director of force and lands to see if he
 
05:33:41.510 --> 05:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
wants to best specify any other talking
 
05:33:41.520 --> 05:33:43.730 align:start position:0%
wants to best specify any other talking
point

05:33:43.730 --> 05:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
point
 
05:33:46.070 --> 05:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
all right how are you very well thank
 
05:33:48.770 --> 05:33:48.780 align:start position:0%
you good to see you
 
05:33:51.590 --> 05:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
um so we have a requests for one Ranger
 
05:33:55.490 --> 05:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
in this budget but to your point we have
 
05:33:57.470 --> 05:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
10 Rangers right now the entire State
 
05:33:59.990 --> 05:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
and that includes the machine and two
 
05:34:02.448 --> 05:34:02.458 align:start position:0%
benefits who are largely administrative
 
05:34:08.930 --> 05:34:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:10.788 --> 05:34:10.798 align:start position:0%
full of men and bigger but we still need
 
05:34:12.650 --> 05:34:12.660 align:start position:0%
to replenish the banks we're looking at
 
05:34:15.110 --> 05:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
one more into this hearing much great
 
05:34:17.030 --> 05:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:34:19.970 --> 05:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
um as far as other positions
 
05:34:22.368 --> 05:34:22.378 align:start position:0%
um you know we're being as creative as
 
05:34:24.770 --> 05:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
possible with Parks we went through the
 
05:34:27.110 --> 05:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
the Contracting and approval process to
 
05:34:28.610 --> 05:34:28.620 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
05:34:29.990 --> 05:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
um we could contract out bathroom
 
05:34:32.690 --> 05:34:32.700 align:start position:0%
cleaning for example at Hampton Beach so
 
05:34:34.610 --> 05:34:34.620 align:start position:0%
that we could hire people
 
05:34:36.770 --> 05:34:36.780 align:start position:0%
um to do other things and and make sure
 
05:34:38.990 --> 05:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
we weren't slipping in that area
 
05:34:42.110 --> 05:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
um we we have moved one of our
 
05:34:44.868 --> 05:34:44.878 align:start position:0%
lifeguards into a full-time position
 
05:34:47.570 --> 05:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
over the past year so that he can help
 
05:34:49.910 --> 05:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
recruiting earlier so we're very aware
 
05:34:52.190 --> 05:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
of the challenges with hiring
 
05:34:54.770 --> 05:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
um but we're determined not to have to
 
05:34:55.970 --> 05:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
shut something down we're very public
 
05:34:57.590 --> 05:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
facing so
 
05:34:59.330 --> 05:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
um we're trying to be as creative and
 
05:35:01.250 --> 05:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
Nimble as possible to to make sure we
 
05:35:02.990 --> 05:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
have at least the minimum amount to keep
 
05:35:05.390 --> 05:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
things moving okay uh you you mentioned
 
05:35:08.330 --> 05:35:08.340 align:start position:0%
increased fuel costs and I know that uh
 
05:35:11.270 --> 05:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
at least I've heard that making snow is
 
05:35:15.230 --> 05:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
not cheap it's not and uh with with this
 
05:35:18.410 --> 05:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
lovely warm whether we've been having it
 
05:35:20.030 --> 05:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
seems that you'll be making a lot of
 
05:35:22.610 --> 05:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
snow and is that are those assuming this
 
05:35:25.910 --> 05:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
continues you know for a significant
 
05:35:29.270 --> 05:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
time uh are those increased costs
 
05:35:31.390 --> 05:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
reflected in this budget
 
05:35:31.400 --> 05:35:32.990 align:start position:0%
reflected in this budget
yes

05:35:32.990 --> 05:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:35:36.470 --> 05:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
um uh going back a few years uh Canon
 
05:35:38.750 --> 05:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
well the state invested in Canon doing a
 
05:35:40.970 --> 05:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
lot of Energy Efficiency work
 
05:35:43.910 --> 05:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
um Canon has received Awards through
 
05:35:45.670 --> 05:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
from the state on their Energy
 
05:35:48.110 --> 05:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
Efficiency so that was great it doesn't
 
05:35:50.990 --> 05:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
get us all the way when we're faced with
 
05:35:54.050 --> 05:35:54.060 align:start position:0%
warm weather and electricity costs up so
 
05:35:56.208 --> 05:35:56.218 align:start position:0%
we are always strategic with our snow
 
05:35:58.448 --> 05:35:58.458 align:start position:0%
blowing or even more so this this year
 
05:36:01.190 --> 05:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
but we have accounted for that in our in
 
05:36:04.910 --> 05:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
our projections and um and we'll
 
05:36:08.448 --> 05:36:08.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:11.150 --> 05:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
um just to clarify uh yeah absolutely
 
05:36:12.770 --> 05:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
it's been built in
 
05:36:14.628 --> 05:36:14.638 align:start position:0%
um even in this fiscal year we actually
 
05:36:17.270 --> 05:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
just recently uh drafted a budget and
 
05:36:18.590 --> 05:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
expend request
 
05:36:20.510 --> 05:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
for about eight hundred thousand dollars
 
05:36:23.510 --> 05:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
in anticipation of this fiscal year
 
05:36:25.788 --> 05:36:25.798 align:start position:0%
um you know these prices for electricity
 
05:36:27.830 --> 05:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
went from seven cents a kilowatt to 21
 
05:36:30.050 --> 05:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
about 20 cents a kilowatt so it's a
 
05:36:32.270 --> 05:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
significant increase so
 
05:36:35.090 --> 05:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
through a combination of management of
 
05:36:38.330 --> 05:36:38.340 align:start position:0%
snow making which nojd is very keen on
 
05:36:41.448 --> 05:36:41.458 align:start position:0%
um and the hope of of Mother Nature
 
05:36:43.490 --> 05:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
working we can hopefully come in
 
05:36:45.650 --> 05:36:45.660 align:start position:0%
somewhere at a level that we can cover
 
05:36:48.890 --> 05:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
with that draw going into 24 25 we've
 
05:36:50.150 --> 05:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
built an approximately we've essentially
 
05:36:53.090 --> 05:36:53.100 align:start position:0%
doubled our our budget for for energy
 
05:36:53.100 --> 05:36:54.230 align:start position:0%
doubled our our budget for for energy
costs

05:36:54.230 --> 05:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
costs
 
05:36:55.610 --> 05:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
um particularly at Cannon Mountain for
 
05:36:58.070 --> 05:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 so we anticipate a significant
 
05:36:59.708 --> 05:36:59.718 align:start position:0%
increase and we have accounted for that
 
05:37:01.670 --> 05:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
do you think you have the ability to
 
05:37:04.788 --> 05:37:04.798 align:start position:0%
increase rates and what you charge so we
 
05:37:08.270 --> 05:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
went well I know and the first time we
 
05:37:11.110 --> 05:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
presented our fee package it was tabled
 
05:37:13.910 --> 05:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
we went back with a just a couple
 
05:37:17.090 --> 05:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
adjustments um and it did pass so there
 
05:37:19.550 --> 05:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
are some ticket prices that we'll see a
 
05:37:22.730 --> 05:37:22.740 align:start position:0%
five dollar increase which is not a lot
 
05:37:24.890 --> 05:37:24.900 align:start position:0%
um it we have a very good relationship
 
05:37:24.900 --> 05:37:26.150 align:start position:0%
um it we have a very good relationship
with

05:37:26.150 --> 05:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:37:27.470 --> 05:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
um our colleagues around the state in
 
05:37:30.050 --> 05:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
the ski industry we part are active
 
05:37:32.810 --> 05:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
participants at ski and H and so we
 
05:37:32.820 --> 05:37:33.590 align:start position:0%
participants at ski and H and so we
um

05:37:33.590 --> 05:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:36.650 --> 05:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
we're in the same boat as everybody else
 
05:37:38.810 --> 05:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
um tickets will reflect that across the
 
05:37:41.150 --> 05:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
board I'm proud that you know we can
 
05:37:41.160 --> 05:37:42.830 align:start position:0%
board I'm proud that you know we can
maintain

05:37:42.830 --> 05:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
05:37:45.110 --> 05:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
um still a for you know affordable we
 
05:37:46.788 --> 05:37:46.798 align:start position:0%
didn't have to Sky you know
 
05:37:48.948 --> 05:37:48.958 align:start position:0%
jump really high with our prices this
 
05:37:48.958 --> 05:37:49.970 align:start position:0%
jump really high with our prices this
year

05:37:49.970 --> 05:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:37:52.390 --> 05:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
um the luxury of being Cannon Mountain
 
05:37:55.490 --> 05:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
is that uh we're not making money to
 
05:37:57.590 --> 05:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
make money we're making enough to
 
05:37:59.810 --> 05:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
provide wonderful skiing experience and
 
05:38:02.270 --> 05:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
so keeping ticket prices manageable is
 
05:38:05.570 --> 05:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
is a priority great thank you good
 
05:38:09.110 --> 05:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:10.850 --> 05:38:10.860 align:start position:0%
um I noticed a lot of stuff is up since
 
05:38:10.860 --> 05:38:12.530 align:start position:0%
um I noticed a lot of stuff is up since
2018.

05:38:12.530 --> 05:38:12.540 align:start position:0%
2018.
 
05:38:15.530 --> 05:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
is anything down down
 
05:38:19.788 --> 05:38:19.798 align:start position:0%
in terms of Revenue and so with oh this
 
05:38:21.650 --> 05:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
was uh this was uh I was treating you
 
05:38:23.448 --> 05:38:23.458 align:start position:0%
along and you could say unhappiness is
 
05:38:23.458 --> 05:38:25.448 align:start position:0%
along and you could say unhappiness is
down

05:38:25.448 --> 05:38:25.458 align:start position:0%
down
 
05:38:28.368 --> 05:38:28.378 align:start position:0%
unhappiness is down Charlie of course
 
05:38:30.890 --> 05:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
um I I think we're we're in a position
 
05:38:30.900 --> 05:38:32.750 align:start position:0%
um I I think we're we're in a position
that

05:38:32.750 --> 05:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:38:34.788 --> 05:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
um that all of our Enterprise systems
 
05:38:37.128 --> 05:38:37.138 align:start position:0%
are doing very very well
 
05:38:40.550 --> 05:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
um my fear is that we don't have the
 
05:38:40.560 --> 05:38:42.410 align:start position:0%
um my fear is that we don't have the
staff

05:38:42.410 --> 05:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
staff
 
05:38:45.530 --> 05:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
um critical needs staff support to take
 
05:38:47.810 --> 05:38:47.820 align:start position:0%
advantage of this moment and to make
 
05:38:50.150 --> 05:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
sure that we're on setting a cell
 
05:38:52.190 --> 05:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
ourselves up for sustainability going in
 
05:38:54.590 --> 05:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
that direction it'll let it levels off a
 
05:38:56.150 --> 05:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
little bit but I don't want to go back
 
05:38:59.090 --> 05:38:59.100 align:start position:0%
backwards when we don't have to
 
05:39:00.890 --> 05:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
um so a couple of these positions we've
 
05:39:02.690 --> 05:39:02.700 align:start position:0%
collaborated as a group saying what can
 
05:39:04.550 --> 05:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
the department as a whole benefit from
 
05:39:07.970 --> 05:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
and these are the positions we chose
 
05:39:07.980 --> 05:39:09.410 align:start position:0%
and these are the positions we chose
great

05:39:09.410 --> 05:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
great
 
05:39:11.628 --> 05:39:11.638 align:start position:0%
um you're it looks like you're to Me
 
05:39:12.708 --> 05:39:12.718 align:start position:0%
Maybe I'm Wrong about this you're
 
05:39:14.330 --> 05:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
projecting a fairly substantial increase
 
05:39:16.368 --> 05:39:16.378 align:start position:0%
in Parks Revenue
 
05:39:18.830 --> 05:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
I think you're budgeting something like
 
05:39:22.310 --> 05:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
36 million becomes 41 and it's not just
 
05:39:22.320 --> 05:39:23.090 align:start position:0%
36 million becomes 41 and it's not just
a

05:39:23.090 --> 05:39:23.100 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:39:24.890 --> 05:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
um continuation of what's going on or is
 
05:39:27.770 --> 05:39:27.780 align:start position:0%
something big happening
 
05:39:27.780 --> 05:39:31.250 align:start position:0%
something big happening
um

05:39:31.250 --> 05:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:32.570 --> 05:39:32.580 align:start position:0%
predicting the
 
05:39:35.990 --> 05:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
continuing along we we are benefiting
 
05:39:38.030 --> 05:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
from some arpa funds that we're going to
 
05:39:40.310 --> 05:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
invest in some expansion of campgrounds
 
05:39:42.170 --> 05:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
for example that's where our Revenue can
 
05:39:44.810 --> 05:39:44.820 align:start position:0%
grow we're investing a lot more in our
 
05:39:47.510 --> 05:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
creative online opportunity shopping
 
05:39:50.270 --> 05:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
opportunities and our stores at
 
05:39:51.948 --> 05:39:51.958 align:start position:0%
um at sites when that's where you know
 
05:39:53.990 --> 05:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
The Flume our sales are going up that
 
05:39:55.670 --> 05:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
Mount Washington our sales are going up
 
05:39:58.490 --> 05:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
so we see where we can continue to to
 
05:40:00.410 --> 05:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
buff some of those numbers
 
05:40:03.410 --> 05:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
um and I think it's a combination of
 
05:40:05.868 --> 05:40:05.878 align:start position:0%
where where our revenue is hitting 100
 
05:40:08.750 --> 05:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
new capacity for parts at camping on
 
05:40:10.850 --> 05:40:10.860 align:start position:0%
weekends is 100 so we have room to grow
 
05:40:13.128 --> 05:40:13.138 align:start position:0%
so we're on to miss cautiously
 
05:40:15.530 --> 05:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
optimistic that those projections are
 
05:40:19.250 --> 05:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
accurate in terms of anything like big
 
05:40:19.260 --> 05:40:20.090 align:start position:0%
accurate in terms of anything like big
um

05:40:20.090 --> 05:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:21.830 --> 05:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
when we do a ribbon cutting for a new
 
05:40:24.350 --> 05:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
tram that will give everyone a jolt of
 
05:40:26.448 --> 05:40:26.458 align:start position:0%
Pride and excitement and everyone will
 
05:40:29.330 --> 05:40:29.340 align:start position:0%
want to go up the tram again
 
05:40:29.340 --> 05:40:30.670 align:start position:0%
want to go up the tram again
yes

05:40:30.670 --> 05:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:40:35.030 --> 05:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
why it makes me nervous I'm just saying
 
05:40:35.040 --> 05:40:36.010 align:start position:0%
why it makes me nervous I'm just saying
um

05:40:36.010 --> 05:40:36.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:39.230 --> 05:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
just just to clarify that increase
 
05:40:40.788 --> 05:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
um one thing I did want to point out the
 
05:40:43.610 --> 05:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
overall increase is in that five million
 
05:40:45.650 --> 05:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
dollar range um just a couple of things
 
05:40:48.288 --> 05:40:48.298 align:start position:0%
Financial items um that's a cumulative
 
05:40:50.030 --> 05:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
figure for the entire division which is
 
05:40:51.470 --> 05:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
not just service Parks includes the
 
05:40:54.230 --> 05:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
trails Bureau for example okay we
 
05:40:55.670 --> 05:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
actually increased the budget in the
 
05:40:58.070 --> 05:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
trails Bureau by almost a little over
 
05:41:00.110 --> 05:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
two million dollars and it wasn't
 
05:41:01.970 --> 05:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
because we're anticipating more Revenue
 
05:41:04.128 --> 05:41:04.138 align:start position:0%
because we're changing the model by
 
05:41:06.050 --> 05:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
which we budget we used to budget very
 
05:41:09.288 --> 05:41:09.298 align:start position:0%
conservatively and typically the fee
 
05:41:10.788 --> 05:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
Revenue that would come in ultimately
 
05:41:12.830 --> 05:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
would get transferred to us because we'd
 
05:41:14.030 --> 05:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
have to go to fiscal at the end of the
 
05:41:16.190 --> 05:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal year work with Fish and Game to
 
05:41:17.930 --> 05:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
have that transferred to us in this
 
05:41:20.030 --> 05:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
budget we've decided let's just build
 
05:41:21.830 --> 05:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
that total amount into the budget from
 
05:41:23.930 --> 05:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
the outset it is consistent at this
 
05:41:25.430 --> 05:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
point to be somewhere in the six million
 
05:41:26.690 --> 05:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
dollar range
 
05:41:29.208 --> 05:41:29.218 align:start position:0%
so we've laid that out so that that is a
 
05:41:30.770 --> 05:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
substantial chunk of that increase right
 
05:41:30.780 --> 05:41:31.970 align:start position:0%
substantial chunk of that increase right
there

05:41:31.970 --> 05:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:41:34.550 --> 05:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
um and same thing with uh one of the um
 
05:41:36.650 --> 05:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
Rector Trail programs uh that's those
 
05:41:37.850 --> 05:41:37.860 align:start position:0%
are figures coming from New Hampshire
 
05:41:39.530 --> 05:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
D.O.T that went up about a half a
 
05:41:41.330 --> 05:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
05:41:43.970 --> 05:41:43.980 align:start position:0%
um and then the only other significant
 
05:41:46.010 --> 05:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
increases of course we'd have to
 
05:41:47.690 --> 05:41:47.700 align:start position:0%
accommodate the expected increases
 
05:41:49.610 --> 05:41:49.620 align:start position:0%
energy costs but we are also very
 
05:41:50.990 --> 05:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
optimistic as the Commissioners
 
05:41:53.510 --> 05:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
explained we've posted million dollar
 
05:41:56.570 --> 05:41:56.580 align:start position:0%
balances to the Canon on two years in a
 
05:42:00.410 --> 05:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
row and our Revenue has gone from
 
05:42:05.810 --> 05:42:05.820 align:start position:0%
15 million dollars in 2019 to 17 million
 
05:42:08.208 --> 05:42:08.218 align:start position:0%
dollars in the last two years so the
 
05:42:10.550 --> 05:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
trajectory has gone up very steep um and
 
05:42:11.868 --> 05:42:11.878 align:start position:0%
we're hoping that that is going to
 
05:42:11.878 --> 05:42:12.610 align:start position:0%
we're hoping that that is going to
continue

05:42:12.610 --> 05:42:12.620 align:start position:0%
continue
 
05:42:15.650 --> 05:42:15.660 align:start position:0%
as long as we continue to cultivate the
 
05:42:17.570 --> 05:42:17.580 align:start position:0%
system that we have and leverage the
 
05:42:20.390 --> 05:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
value that we have along those lines I
 
05:42:23.628 --> 05:42:23.638 align:start position:0%
feel like with Parks there's um I mean
 
05:42:25.250 --> 05:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
that's obviously some things that that
 
05:42:25.260 --> 05:42:26.390 align:start position:0%
that's obviously some things that that
are

05:42:26.390 --> 05:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:42:28.430 --> 05:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better word net profit
 
05:42:29.810 --> 05:42:29.820 align:start position:0%
centers I know we don't think of parks
 
05:42:31.490 --> 05:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
that way but and some things that are
 
05:42:32.990 --> 05:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
not right that you're not charging for
 
05:42:35.690 --> 05:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make sense or that
 
05:42:37.610 --> 05:42:37.620 align:start position:0%
um and I think some of that's location
 
05:42:39.650 --> 05:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
right you know Canada or Hampton Beach
 
05:42:41.868 --> 05:42:41.878 align:start position:0%
or whatever is some of it also activity
 
05:42:45.470 --> 05:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
like our to what extent so coupling what
 
05:42:47.030 --> 05:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
are your biggest
 
05:42:51.650 --> 05:42:51.660 align:start position:0%
uh Revenue producing locations and that
 
05:42:53.390 --> 05:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
were your biggest Revenue producing
 
05:42:56.230 --> 05:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
activities I'm hearing campgrounds
 
05:42:59.270 --> 05:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
like net I want to make sure that we
 
05:43:00.948 --> 05:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
produce our new parks director Brian
 
05:43:04.550 --> 05:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
Wilson in here I was hoping it would yes
 
05:43:06.650 --> 05:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
05:43:08.750 --> 05:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
I know Brian has been doing some
 
05:43:10.670 --> 05:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
studying and stuff like that but I don't
 
05:43:11.810 --> 05:43:11.820 align:start position:0%
I hate to put them on the spot because
 
05:43:14.990 --> 05:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
he really is about a week into this job
 
05:43:18.230 --> 05:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
um so I'm making testify what
 
05:43:21.590 --> 05:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
um so The Flume at Franconia state park
 
05:43:24.350 --> 05:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
for example really supports
 
05:43:26.448 --> 05:43:26.458 align:start position:0%
much of the state park system there's
 
05:43:29.570 --> 05:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
nine there's 93 state parks
 
05:43:31.070 --> 05:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
um which includes some you know very
 
05:43:33.590 --> 05:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
small ones but as director Phil Bryce
 
05:43:37.970 --> 05:43:37.980 align:start position:0%
would explain of the pie of 93 half we
 
05:43:40.970 --> 05:43:40.980 align:start position:0%
charge at and at a quarter of that a
 
05:43:42.350 --> 05:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
quarter of the pie half of the half is
 
05:43:44.150 --> 05:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
where we make Revenue so you're right
 
05:43:47.270 --> 05:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
there are very strategic places where we
 
05:43:47.280 --> 05:43:48.590 align:start position:0%
there are very strategic places where we
can

05:43:48.590 --> 05:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
can
 
05:43:51.770 --> 05:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
um we can try to try to sustain our
 
05:43:54.048 --> 05:43:54.058 align:start position:0%
Revenue Hampton Beach is another one
 
05:43:57.708 --> 05:43:57.718 align:start position:0%
where we are reinvesting in our meters
 
05:44:00.288 --> 05:44:00.298 align:start position:0%
so we're taking out all the old ones
 
05:44:01.910 --> 05:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
putting in new ones
 
05:44:03.530 --> 05:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
um which I think is going to help us a
 
05:44:05.390 --> 05:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
lot there's a the old ones are a little
 
05:44:07.250 --> 05:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
bit getting clunky and weren't speaking
 
05:44:09.230 --> 05:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
directly to the credit card machine so
 
05:44:10.788 --> 05:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
this is another area where I think we're
 
05:44:12.048 --> 05:44:12.058 align:start position:0%
going to pick up a little bit of Revenue
 
05:44:14.030 --> 05:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
because of the ease of using it you can
 
05:44:15.948 --> 05:44:15.958 align:start position:0%
stay on your on your towel on the beach
 
05:44:18.530 --> 05:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
and just use your phone to add some more
 
05:44:22.510 --> 05:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:24.890 --> 05:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
Campground expansion where we can use
 
05:44:27.350 --> 05:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
the arpa funding um so little places
 
05:44:29.510 --> 05:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
where we you know talk about where we
 
05:44:32.690 --> 05:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
can make investments uh to yield more I
 
05:44:35.150 --> 05:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
would say uh we're doing that another
 
05:44:39.110 --> 05:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
activity uh is boat rentals so our Fleet
 
05:44:41.868 --> 05:44:41.878 align:start position:0%
of paddle boats for example and kayaks
 
05:44:45.048 --> 05:44:45.058 align:start position:0%
um have increased and uh you'll see them
 
05:44:47.090 --> 05:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
driving through the notch on at Echo
 
05:44:51.590 --> 05:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
Lake and a lot of our Inland beaches now
 
05:44:54.288 --> 05:44:54.298 align:start position:0%
you can rent boats which has become a
 
05:44:56.628 --> 05:44:56.638 align:start position:0%
very lucrative business
 
05:44:58.970 --> 05:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
yeah that's kind of exciting and in
 
05:45:00.650 --> 05:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
terms of campgrounds
 
05:45:03.110 --> 05:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
um you know we're full and all that
 
05:45:05.690 --> 05:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
um is there and you're going to expand
 
05:45:09.048 --> 05:45:09.058 align:start position:0%
campgrounds but is there
 
05:45:11.208 --> 05:45:11.218 align:start position:0%
you're limited right capital investment
 
05:45:12.350 --> 05:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
and all that
 
05:45:12.360 --> 05:45:13.250 align:start position:0%
and all that
um

05:45:13.250 --> 05:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:15.530 --> 05:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
are you building as many
 
05:45:17.208 --> 05:45:17.218 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know what's right from his
 
05:45:19.430 --> 05:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
beds as you could fill
 
05:45:22.548 --> 05:45:22.558 align:start position:0%
no the honest answer I think I think
 
05:45:24.230 --> 05:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
that we could
 
05:45:26.650 --> 05:45:26.660 align:start position:0%
turn a lot of our state land into
 
05:45:28.970 --> 05:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
back-to-back campsites and keep them
 
05:45:30.890 --> 05:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
full but that's not well the experience
 
05:45:32.868 --> 05:45:32.878 align:start position:0%
we're going for
 
05:45:36.170 --> 05:45:36.180 align:start position:0%
um so we have using the arpa funds we
 
05:45:38.868 --> 05:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
have hired a Consulting Group SE group
 
05:45:40.910 --> 05:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
um there this is their business and they
 
05:45:43.250 --> 05:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
did a full assessment of sort of our top
 
05:45:45.830 --> 05:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
priority Parts
 
05:45:47.270 --> 05:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
um and we can't hit them all at once
 
05:45:48.590 --> 05:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
with this Arbor funds but now we have a
 
05:45:52.010 --> 05:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
portfolio of plans that over the next
 
05:45:54.288 --> 05:45:54.298 align:start position:0%
couple years we can pull out a map of
 
05:45:56.208 --> 05:45:56.218 align:start position:0%
you know Bear Brook and see oh they did
 
05:45:58.490 --> 05:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
the same we can do 15 a pot of 15 new
 
05:46:02.090 --> 05:46:02.100 align:start position:0%
campsites here let's go for it so not
 
05:46:04.070 --> 05:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
only is the arpa money actually allowing
 
05:46:06.350 --> 05:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
us to in real time build more
 
05:46:08.330 --> 05:46:08.340 align:start position:0%
campgrounds but it's also given us this
 
05:46:11.448 --> 05:46:11.458 align:start position:0%
portfolio of of site plans so that we
 
05:46:13.250 --> 05:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
can tackle them over the next couple
 
05:46:16.368 --> 05:46:16.378 align:start position:0%
years to to try to continue expanding
 
05:46:18.288 --> 05:46:18.298 align:start position:0%
not just capacity but experience so
 
05:46:20.150 --> 05:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
we'll have some campgrounds where there
 
05:46:22.250 --> 05:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
is no bathroom building or shower and
 
05:46:23.990 --> 05:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
you bring a tent and we have campgrounds
 
05:46:27.110 --> 05:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
where or we need to invest more now in
 
05:46:30.470 --> 05:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
the amphiage of you know the the really
 
05:46:33.650 --> 05:46:33.660 align:start position:0%
expensive RVs that go from I'm speaking
 
05:46:35.770 --> 05:46:35.780 align:start position:0%
that way out of my language I know 30
 
05:46:39.288 --> 05:46:39.298 align:start position:0%
amps sure to to accommodate a different
 
05:46:40.730 --> 05:46:40.740 align:start position:0%
type of camper with their air
 
05:46:40.740 --> 05:46:42.048 align:start position:0%
type of camper with their air
conditioning

05:46:42.048 --> 05:46:42.058 align:start position:0%
conditioning
 
05:46:43.850 --> 05:46:43.860 align:start position:0%
um so we want we have Yurts we have
 
05:46:43.860 --> 05:46:45.048 align:start position:0%
um so we want we have Yurts we have
cabins

05:46:45.048 --> 05:46:45.058 align:start position:0%
cabins
 
05:46:45.058 --> 05:46:45.910 align:start position:0%
cabins
um

05:46:45.910 --> 05:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:48.590 --> 05:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
Yurts oh Yurts I've heard that word yes
 
05:46:50.628 --> 05:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
and Kevin some of them so part of the
 
05:46:53.150 --> 05:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
the goal here is to also offer an array
 
05:46:54.830 --> 05:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
of unique experiences throughout our
 
05:46:56.448 --> 05:46:56.458 align:start position:0%
campsite and not just pack them in like
 
05:46:56.458 --> 05:46:57.530 align:start position:0%
campsite and not just pack them in like
sardines

05:46:57.530 --> 05:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
sardines
 
05:47:00.410 --> 05:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
no I don't I I love I mean sardines are
 
05:47:01.850 --> 05:47:01.860 align:start position:0%
lovely but we don't write back then like
 
05:47:04.310 --> 05:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
them has there ever been an unconscious
 
05:47:05.690 --> 05:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
of getting the evil eye I'm going to
 
05:47:07.250 --> 05:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
shut up after this
 
05:47:07.260 --> 05:47:07.970 align:start position:0%
shut up after this
um

05:47:07.970 --> 05:47:07.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:11.930 --> 05:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
has there ever been any ex um looking at
 
05:47:14.390 --> 05:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
funding capital investment and campsites
 
05:47:16.670 --> 05:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
out of Revenue where's the revenue not
 
05:47:20.090 --> 05:47:20.100 align:start position:0%
big enough to sustain Revenue well like
 
05:47:21.530 --> 05:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
um you know occasionally a project is
 
05:47:22.850 --> 05:47:22.860 align:start position:0%
funded because it's going to generate
 
05:47:24.470 --> 05:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
revenue and the revenue will pay for The
 
05:47:25.970 --> 05:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
Debt Service
 
05:47:28.850 --> 05:47:28.860 align:start position:0%
or do we not have that kind of Revenue
 
05:47:31.910 --> 05:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
speak yeah I mean that that mechanism is
 
05:47:34.490 --> 05:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
built into to the to the funds the setup
 
05:47:37.190 --> 05:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
that we have so the park uh the park
 
05:47:38.990 --> 05:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
system there's a state park account
 
05:47:41.090 --> 05:47:41.100 align:start position:0%
there's a park account well you do that
 
05:47:43.128 --> 05:47:43.138 align:start position:0%
and so your investment other than the
 
05:47:43.138 --> 05:47:44.170 align:start position:0%
and so your investment other than the
airport

05:47:44.170 --> 05:47:44.180 align:start position:0%
airport
 
05:47:46.368 --> 05:47:46.378 align:start position:0%
the balance currently stands around
 
05:47:48.350 --> 05:47:48.360 align:start position:0%
seven million dollars
 
05:47:51.110 --> 05:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
um in past bienniums we have invested
 
05:47:52.610 --> 05:47:52.620 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to commit a million
 
05:47:54.410 --> 05:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
dollars a year to that kind of
 
05:47:56.270 --> 05:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
investment growth but it's measured
 
05:47:58.070 --> 05:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
because we do have situations for
 
05:48:01.368 --> 05:48:01.378 align:start position:0%
example when the pandemic hit that fund
 
05:48:03.890 --> 05:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
helped sustain us for a little tune of a
 
05:48:05.708 --> 05:48:05.718 align:start position:0%
couple million dollars as well
 
05:48:09.048 --> 05:48:09.058 align:start position:0%
right we want to push in there so we
 
05:48:10.610 --> 05:48:10.620 align:start position:0%
manage it but there is that opportunity
 
05:48:13.970 --> 05:48:13.980 align:start position:0%
and we do a lot of Patchwork funding
 
05:48:16.730 --> 05:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
um lwcf fund is available to us to a
 
05:48:18.110 --> 05:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
certain extent
 
05:48:19.670 --> 05:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
um moose plate fund for some of our
 
05:48:21.830 --> 05:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
historic sites is available
 
05:48:24.230 --> 05:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
um for us as well as our own Revenue so
 
05:48:27.288 --> 05:48:27.298 align:start position:0%
yeah we are willing to sort of figure
 
05:48:29.330 --> 05:48:29.340 align:start position:0%
out where we can make the dollar market
 
05:48:32.690 --> 05:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
thank you how much is the coffee
 
05:48:35.360 --> 05:48:35.370 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:35.370 --> 05:48:36.830 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:48:36.830 --> 05:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:48:39.170 --> 05:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
you really don't have a career on QVC
 
05:48:40.910 --> 05:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
set out for you
 
05:48:43.070 --> 05:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
would you like to be the taste tester
 
05:48:45.708 --> 05:48:45.718 align:start position:0%
I'm good
 
05:48:48.230 --> 05:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
so I just had two quick ones one is um
 
05:48:50.390 --> 05:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
you mentioned your some of the projects
 
05:48:51.830 --> 05:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
with the arpa
 
05:48:53.750 --> 05:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
um the answers are pull out a portfolio
 
05:48:55.910 --> 05:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
and say hey bear broker
 
05:48:58.490 --> 05:48:58.500 align:start position:0%
et cetera um does your the funding that
 
05:49:00.048 --> 05:49:00.058 align:start position:0%
you get through arpa for that type of
 
05:49:02.390 --> 05:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
work expire at the same time as other
 
05:49:05.110 --> 05:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
Opera which I think is December of 24
 
05:49:08.150 --> 05:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
yes okay so you're on that same timeline
 
05:49:09.708 --> 05:49:09.718 align:start position:0%
that you would need to spend time you
 
05:49:12.708 --> 05:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
must be encumbered by 20.
 
05:49:15.650 --> 05:49:15.660 align:start position:0%
um and so one of the challenges I would
 
05:49:18.470 --> 05:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
say in that sense is finding the right
 
05:49:20.030 --> 05:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
people find people to do the work right
 
05:49:22.930 --> 05:49:22.940 align:start position:0%
I was going to ask that too okay
 
05:49:27.048 --> 05:49:27.058 align:start position:0%
okay the conception of let's see if we
 
05:49:29.208 --> 05:49:29.218 align:start position:0%
can expand campgrounds with arpa funds
 
05:49:31.490 --> 05:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
started a year and a half ago to now
 
05:49:33.650 --> 05:49:33.660 align:start position:0%
things have tripled in price and it's
 
05:49:35.150 --> 05:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
hard to find people we're working our
 
05:49:37.010 --> 05:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
way through the process and prioritizing
 
05:49:38.690 --> 05:49:38.700 align:start position:0%
things but that that would also be a
 
05:49:40.010 --> 05:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
challenge that's not unique to our
 
05:49:41.868 --> 05:49:41.878 align:start position:0%
agency no that's true
 
05:49:43.788 --> 05:49:43.798 align:start position:0%
um resources are tight all around
 
05:49:46.250 --> 05:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
including inflationary constraints
 
05:49:47.150 --> 05:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
um my other question completely
 
05:49:50.448 --> 05:49:50.458 align:start position:0%
different um I like your fact sheets I
 
05:49:51.708 --> 05:49:51.718 align:start position:0%
was looking that out
 
05:49:53.270 --> 05:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
um and you talked about a few different
 
05:49:55.070 --> 05:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
positions one being sort of Legal
 
05:49:57.170 --> 05:49:57.180 align:start position:0%
Financial Analyst curator et cetera but
 
05:49:59.628 --> 05:49:59.638 align:start position:0%
on the score sheet or a fact sheet it
 
05:50:01.490 --> 05:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
looks like you're only adding one
 
05:50:04.430 --> 05:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
position so are you repurposing existing
 
05:50:05.868 --> 05:50:05.878 align:start position:0%
positions and it's really just a net
 
05:50:08.510 --> 05:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
gain of one position okay uh that's
 
05:50:11.628 --> 05:50:11.638 align:start position:0%
that's correct um in the where we are
 
05:50:15.288 --> 05:50:15.298 align:start position:0%
increasing the forests and lands by two
 
05:50:17.570 --> 05:50:17.580 align:start position:0%
um but the commissioner's office is
 
05:50:19.128 --> 05:50:19.138 align:start position:0%
going up by three we're also abolishing
 
05:50:20.930 --> 05:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
three positions two thoughts at that so
 
05:50:24.048 --> 05:50:24.058 align:start position:0%
it is a net that's why you don't see uh
 
05:50:28.368 --> 05:50:28.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:33.110 --> 05:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:36.110 --> 05:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
like to invite Fish and Game
 
05:50:55.490 --> 05:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:55.500 --> 05:51:28.150 align:start position:0%
 
things

05:51:28.150 --> 05:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:30.048 --> 05:51:30.058 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
05:51:31.330 --> 05:51:31.340 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
05:51:33.890 --> 05:51:33.900 align:start position:0%
my name is Scott Mason I'm the executive

over the next biennium our goal is to

one of our goals is to upgrade our

database systems we received a go for
 
05:54:50.868 --> 05:54:50.878 align:start position:0%
Grant in in
 
05:54:53.270 --> 05:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
um to to do this goal so it's not
 
05:54:54.650 --> 05:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
necessarily showing up in our budget
 
05:54:57.890 --> 05:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
because of the the go for funding on it
 
05:54:57.900 --> 05:55:00.288 align:start position:0%
because of the the go for funding on it
um

05:55:00.288 --> 05:55:00.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:03.230 --> 05:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
our our database system had aged out and
 
05:55:05.990 --> 05:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
we needed to make a major investment
 
05:55:07.970 --> 05:55:07.980 align:start position:0%
um by the end of this year or else we
 
05:55:09.708 --> 05:55:09.718 align:start position:0%
would have lost the serviceability of
 
05:55:11.390 --> 05:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
these systems
 
05:55:15.530 --> 05:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
uh we're moving more we're trying to
 
05:55:17.048 --> 05:55:17.058 align:start position:0%
move more of our paper systems
 
05:55:19.730 --> 05:55:19.740 align:start position:0%
computer-based systems a good example of
 
05:55:22.190 --> 05:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
this is a new fish stocking page that
 
05:55:25.610 --> 05:55:25.620 align:start position:0%
you can find on our web on our website
 
05:55:29.030 --> 05:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
um my Inland Inland Fisheries Chief
 
05:55:32.048 --> 05:55:32.058 align:start position:0%
Diane Timmons came up with this
 
05:55:35.690 --> 05:55:35.700 align:start position:0%
site that allows the what the citizen
 
05:55:37.850 --> 05:55:37.860 align:start position:0%
see is it allows it allows citizens to
 
05:55:40.430 --> 05:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
see where we've stocked fish in a in a
 
05:55:41.990 --> 05:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
time delayed fashion so they're not
 
05:55:43.548 --> 05:55:43.558 align:start position:0%
necessarily following the truck but
 
05:55:45.230 --> 05:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
within a few weeks they actually know
 
05:55:47.810 --> 05:55:47.820 align:start position:0%
where the fish went in uh the first 60
 
05:55:49.670 --> 05:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
days that this site was up we had over
 
05:55:52.128 --> 05:55:52.138 align:start position:0%
three million hits now I can't guarantee
 
05:55:53.750 --> 05:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
you that that three million different
 
05:55:55.788 --> 05:55:55.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents and tourists
 
05:55:57.350 --> 05:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
coming to New Hampshire it might just be
 
05:55:59.090 --> 05:55:59.100 align:start position:0%
six 12 year old boys that know the New
 
05:56:00.410 --> 05:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire stocking program a lot better
 
05:56:02.810 --> 05:56:02.820 align:start position:0%
than anyone else
 
05:56:05.570 --> 05:56:05.580 align:start position:0%
um but also what the citizens don't see
 
05:56:07.970 --> 05:56:07.980 align:start position:0%
are gone are this the old paper stocking
 
05:56:10.070 --> 05:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
tickets that our Hatchery folks would
 
05:56:12.170 --> 05:56:12.180 align:start position:0%
fill out and would end up on the
 
05:56:13.850 --> 05:56:13.860 align:start position:0%
dashboards of the trucks and eventually
 
05:56:15.708 --> 05:56:15.718 align:start position:0%
the trucks would have a slow day they
 
05:56:19.510 --> 05:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
would get uh picked up and sent and then
 
05:56:21.650 --> 05:56:21.660 align:start position:0%
inputted into the system
 
05:56:25.070 --> 05:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
this allows our staff to have a much
 
05:56:25.080 --> 05:56:25.930 align:start position:0%
this allows our staff to have a much
more

05:56:25.930 --> 05:56:25.940 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:56:28.548 --> 05:56:28.558 align:start position:0%
current uh
 
05:56:31.128 --> 05:56:31.138 align:start position:0%
status of where we've been stalking or
 
05:56:32.990 --> 05:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
exactly where we've been stocking what
 
05:56:34.910 --> 05:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
fish are out what fish aren't which
 
05:56:39.230 --> 05:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:41.628 --> 05:56:41.638 align:start position:0%
um we're also working on expanding our
 
05:56:44.448 --> 05:56:44.458 align:start position:0%
our online licensing programs to include
 
05:56:47.990 --> 05:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
online deer registration and online ohrv
 
05:56:49.788 --> 05:56:49.798 align:start position:0%
registrations both of these were
 
05:56:52.490 --> 05:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
requested by the legislature this year
 
05:56:54.230 --> 05:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
we are working to give the right staff
 
05:56:56.330 --> 05:56:56.340 align:start position:0%
the right access to data to improve
 
05:56:58.368 --> 05:56:58.378 align:start position:0%
internal efficiencies as part of the
 
05:57:00.770 --> 05:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs from doit
 
05:57:02.708 --> 05:57:02.718 align:start position:0%
we're asking for for
 
05:57:06.170 --> 05:57:06.180 align:start position:0%
as as part of this prioritized needs we
 
05:57:08.810 --> 05:57:08.820 align:start position:0%
are asking our D.O.T is working with us
 
05:57:11.930 --> 05:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
to create a halftime position at Fish
 
05:57:14.330 --> 05:57:14.340 align:start position:0%
and Game the other half will be with a
 
05:57:15.610 --> 05:57:15.620 align:start position:0%
different agency
 
05:57:18.530 --> 05:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
and this is a full-time I.T lead
 
05:57:18.540 --> 05:57:21.288 align:start position:0%
and this is a full-time I.T lead
position

05:57:21.288 --> 05:57:21.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:23.330 --> 05:57:23.340 align:start position:0%
um and some of you are well aware we are
 
05:57:25.190 --> 05:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
working on another major gopher project
 
05:57:29.150 --> 05:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
which is a hatchery rebuild project we
 
05:57:30.890 --> 05:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
are finishing up the study that we've
 
05:57:33.368 --> 05:57:33.378 align:start position:0%
been working on uh this year
 
05:57:36.650 --> 05:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
uh we hopefully will have some answers
 
05:57:39.110 --> 05:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
on exactly where where and what we'll be
 
05:57:39.120 --> 05:57:40.610 align:start position:0%
on exactly where where and what we'll be
building

05:57:40.610 --> 05:57:40.620 align:start position:0%
building
 
05:57:44.208 --> 05:57:44.218 align:start position:0%
um this project is a very difficult task
 
05:57:48.190 --> 05:57:48.200 align:start position:0%
uh and um EPA set a 12 Bar per billion
 
05:57:52.250 --> 05:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
uh discharge permit for us at New Durham
 
05:57:54.590 --> 05:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things we discovered as
 
05:57:57.048 --> 05:57:57.058 align:start position:0%
we're going through the process the
 
05:57:59.990 --> 05:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
technique that we are required by EPA to
 
05:58:03.110 --> 05:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
use to determine the phosphorus level of
 
05:58:04.190 --> 05:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
the water
 
05:58:07.070 --> 05:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't read until it's 10 parts per
 
05:58:07.080 --> 05:58:08.270 align:start position:0%
doesn't read until it's 10 parts per
billion

05:58:08.270 --> 05:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
billion
 
05:58:10.670 --> 05:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
which means if we're running at three
 
05:58:12.410 --> 05:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
parts per billion we don't and it's
 
05:58:14.090 --> 05:58:14.100 align:start position:0%
gradually going up we won't know that
 
05:58:16.010 --> 05:58:16.020 align:start position:0%
Until It Breaks 10 and then we only have
 
05:58:17.690 --> 05:58:17.700 align:start position:0%
two more parts per billion before we
 
05:58:20.570 --> 05:58:20.580 align:start position:0%
have a violation so uh there's a lot of
 
05:58:23.448 --> 05:58:23.458 align:start position:0%
technical issues that that we're working
 
05:58:25.070 --> 05:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
through and hopefully
 
05:58:26.868 --> 05:58:26.878 align:start position:0%
um we'll have some answers
 
05:58:28.610 --> 05:58:28.620 align:start position:0%
by the end of the year beginning of next
 
05:58:28.620 --> 05:58:29.990 align:start position:0%
by the end of the year beginning of next
year

05:58:29.990 --> 05:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:58:32.530 --> 05:58:32.540 align:start position:0%
we got our efficiency Target included
 
05:58:34.970 --> 05:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
and that included an increased cost
 
05:58:36.610 --> 05:58:36.620 align:start position:0%
associated with fuel and electricity
 
05:58:39.170 --> 05:58:39.180 align:start position:0%
we've asked the governor to retain our
 
05:58:40.610 --> 05:58:40.620 align:start position:0%
general funding to return our general
 
05:58:42.948 --> 05:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
funding back to the 2021 level of
 
05:58:45.190 --> 05:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
funding we've had
 
05:58:48.350 --> 05:58:48.360 align:start position:0%
this year I'm asking to add a senior
 
05:58:50.690 --> 05:58:50.700 align:start position:0%
accounting technician to improve our
 
05:58:52.788 --> 05:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
business office efficiency
 
05:58:54.470 --> 05:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
this will be funded through the fish and
 
05:58:56.570 --> 05:58:56.580 align:start position:0%
game fund I'm looking to replace our
 
05:59:00.590 --> 05:59:00.600 align:start position:0%
part-time bow coordinator uh bo is an
 
05:59:04.330 --> 05:59:04.340 align:start position:0%
acronym for becoming an outdoor woman
 
05:59:07.490 --> 05:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
with a temporary full-time position with
 
05:59:09.670 --> 05:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
a and this is with a goal of expanding
 
05:59:12.948 --> 05:59:12.958 align:start position:0%
our outdoor women's program
 
05:59:16.430 --> 05:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
I would also like to fund two unfunded
 
05:59:19.670 --> 05:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
conservation offices positions with ohrv
 
05:59:21.830 --> 05:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
registration money and fund the other
 
05:59:25.070 --> 05:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
two and then fund the other two unfunded
 
05:59:27.350 --> 05:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
conservation officers positions
 
05:59:30.230 --> 05:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh with general fund money this would
 
05:59:32.810 --> 05:59:32.820 align:start position:0%
bring our total number of offices to 48.
 
05:59:37.670 --> 05:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
we have four headquarters and
 
05:59:40.850 --> 05:59:40.860 align:start position:0%
uh right now we have 44 funded positions
 
05:59:42.650 --> 05:59:42.660 align:start position:0%
for those who are at headquarters 40 are
 
05:59:46.368 --> 05:59:46.378 align:start position:0%
in the field this would give us uh 44 in
 
05:59:48.230 --> 05:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
the field
 
05:59:49.910 --> 05:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
this is still lower than the number of
 
05:59:52.128 --> 05:59:52.138 align:start position:0%
offices we had back in the 70s when the
 
05:59:54.470 --> 05:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
department had 50 offices
 
05:59:56.090 --> 05:59:56.100 align:start position:0%
I've also asked the government to
 
05:59:58.128 --> 05:59:58.138 align:start position:0%
restore the department General funding
 
06:00:00.230 --> 06:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
to pre-covered levels without this
 
06:00:02.448 --> 06:00:02.458 align:start position:0%
increase our fish and game fund would be
 
06:00:06.288 --> 06:00:06.298 align:start position:0%
depleted within two more budget Cycles
 
06:00:09.430 --> 06:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
06:00:12.048 --> 06:00:12.058 align:start position:0%
okay that was you actually in the last
 
06:00:13.368 --> 06:00:13.378 align:start position:0%
Point answered my question I was
 
06:00:15.350 --> 06:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could expand that a
 
06:00:17.270 --> 06:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
little bit as far as what's been
 
06:00:19.330 --> 06:00:19.340 align:start position:0%
happening with the fish and game fund
 
06:00:24.650 --> 06:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
and uh the impact that moving away from
 
06:00:27.110 --> 06:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
General funds has had on it and if we
 
06:00:29.570 --> 06:00:29.580 align:start position:0%
don't do anything it will be depleted I
 
06:00:30.708 --> 06:00:30.718 align:start position:0%
think you said deplete in the next two
 
06:00:33.170 --> 06:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
years no uh sorry two budget Cycles two
 
06:00:35.150 --> 06:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
budget Cycles okay
 
06:00:38.030 --> 06:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
um prior to covert uh and I apologize I
 
06:00:39.350 --> 06:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
don't have the exact numbers but I
 
06:00:41.150 --> 06:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
believe we were getting about uh one and
 
06:00:43.128 --> 06:00:43.138 align:start position:0%
a half million 1.6 million a year of
 
06:00:45.288 --> 06:00:45.298 align:start position:0%
General funds this has been going on for
 
06:00:47.208 --> 06:00:47.218 align:start position:0%
a few years
 
06:00:49.128 --> 06:00:49.138 align:start position:0%
um when we did the budget two years ago
 
06:00:51.530 --> 06:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
as all you remember those were very
 
06:00:53.330 --> 06:00:53.340 align:start position:0%
uncertain time
 
06:00:55.490 --> 06:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
um and we and we met with Governor's
 
06:00:58.490 --> 06:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
budget Target but that hit us very hard
 
06:01:01.788 --> 06:01:01.798 align:start position:0%
I believe we lost over 70 percent of our
 
06:01:05.390 --> 06:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
general funding at that point
 
06:01:05.400 --> 06:01:06.548 align:start position:0%
general funding at that point
um

06:01:06.548 --> 06:01:06.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:09.110 --> 06:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
ESU comes in
 
06:01:09.120 --> 06:01:09.890 align:start position:0%
ESU comes in
um

06:01:09.890 --> 06:01:09.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:13.010 --> 06:01:13.020 align:start position:0%
if we don't receive that money back we
 
06:01:15.530 --> 06:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
can get through this budget cycle but by
 
06:01:17.570 --> 06:01:17.580 align:start position:0%
the end of the next budget cycle
 
06:01:19.610 --> 06:01:19.620 align:start position:0%
I apologize we can get through the 24 25
 
06:01:21.770 --> 06:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
budget cycle but by the time we get
 
06:01:24.410 --> 06:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
finished up with 26 and 27 the fish and
 
06:01:26.448 --> 06:01:26.458 align:start position:0%
game fund would be
 
06:01:28.730 --> 06:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
if not negative close to it
 
06:01:32.270 --> 06:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
we did see an uptick in license uh sales
 
06:01:35.270 --> 06:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
during covid some of that has started to
 
06:01:36.368 --> 06:01:36.378 align:start position:0%
drop off
 
06:01:38.990 --> 06:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
as you're well aware
 
06:01:40.448 --> 06:01:40.458 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
06:01:42.708 --> 06:01:42.718 align:start position:0%
when everything's shut down people are
 
06:01:44.030 --> 06:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
looking for things to do with their kids
 
06:01:45.650 --> 06:01:45.660 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden you didn't have the
 
06:01:47.150 --> 06:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
ball games to go to you didn't have
 
06:01:50.150 --> 06:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
school plays bands that kind of stuff so
 
06:01:51.770 --> 06:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
there was an uptick in people buying
 
06:01:53.690 --> 06:01:53.700 align:start position:0%
fishing licenses and hunting licenses to
 
06:01:55.970 --> 06:01:55.980 align:start position:0%
get their kids outdoors
 
06:01:55.980 --> 06:01:58.030 align:start position:0%
get their kids outdoors
um

06:01:58.030 --> 06:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:02.570 --> 06:02:02.580 align:start position:0%
we and we also saw an uptick in ohrv
 
06:02:04.910 --> 06:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
registration I think the ohrv
 
06:02:06.590 --> 06:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
registrations will stay with us a little
 
06:02:08.030 --> 06:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
bit longer than the light than the
 
06:02:09.610 --> 06:02:09.620 align:start position:0%
increase in license sales
 
06:02:12.948 --> 06:02:12.958 align:start position:0%
if you just think through it you know a
 
06:02:15.530 --> 06:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
brand new ATV is fifteen thousand to
 
06:02:18.110 --> 06:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars
 
06:02:20.810 --> 06:02:20.820 align:start position:0%
um it's it's too big of an investment to
 
06:02:22.788 --> 06:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
just leave in your garage unregistered
 
06:02:24.410 --> 06:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
and unused most people will either
 
06:02:26.868 --> 06:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
register it and use it or probably will
 
06:02:28.250 --> 06:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
decide to sell it to somebody else
 
06:02:31.430 --> 06:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
that'll register it and use it
 
06:02:33.170 --> 06:02:33.180 align:start position:0%
um whereas you know hunting or fishing
 
06:02:34.788 --> 06:02:34.798 align:start position:0%
equipment it's a little easier to leave
 
06:02:36.948 --> 06:02:36.958 align:start position:0%
in the back of the closet somewhere
 
06:02:36.958 --> 06:02:38.690 align:start position:0%
in the back of the closet somewhere
okay

06:02:38.690 --> 06:02:38.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:02:40.670 --> 06:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
I know and unfortunately no that
 
06:02:42.530 --> 06:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
recently you've had a a very well
 
06:02:45.948 --> 06:02:45.958 align:start position:0%
publicized search and rescue mission
 
06:02:48.830 --> 06:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering though with with the
 
06:02:52.310 --> 06:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
the Back To Nature movement and and with
 
06:02:55.850 --> 06:02:55.860 align:start position:0%
the a lot of uh towns and cities up
 
06:02:59.390 --> 06:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
north uh really investing in ATV trails
 
06:03:02.570 --> 06:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
and in the ATV industry
 
06:03:05.330 --> 06:03:05.340 align:start position:0%
uh how much of an expenditure have you
 
06:03:07.610 --> 06:03:07.620 align:start position:0%
seen in the search and rescue in basic
 
06:03:10.910 --> 06:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh need for attention to that area over
 
06:03:12.650 --> 06:03:12.660 align:start position:0%
the last few years as it has it grown
 
06:03:14.628 --> 06:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
exponentially it has been fairly
 
06:03:17.810 --> 06:03:17.820 align:start position:0%
constant it has not grown exponentially
 
06:03:20.750 --> 06:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that we have is
 
06:03:23.030 --> 06:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
um the height Safeguard program it's a
 
06:03:26.390 --> 06:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
donation and that program has ex has
 
06:03:28.128 --> 06:03:28.138 align:start position:0%
expanded quite well over the last few
 
06:03:28.138 --> 06:03:29.868 align:start position:0%
expanded quite well over the last few
years

06:03:29.868 --> 06:03:29.878 align:start position:0%
years
 
06:03:31.548 --> 06:03:31.558 align:start position:0%
um we're at the point now where we're
 
06:03:33.410 --> 06:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
paying kind of the variable cost side of
 
06:03:35.628 --> 06:03:35.638 align:start position:0%
it we're not paying the fixed cost of
 
06:03:37.910 --> 06:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
having a CO there but any levels
 
06:03:39.410 --> 06:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
overtime any of his special equipment
 
06:03:41.330 --> 06:03:41.340 align:start position:0%
that where that we're able to pick up
 
06:03:44.930 --> 06:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
with the pipesafecard program
 
06:03:46.850 --> 06:03:46.860 align:start position:0%
um where
 
06:03:48.350 --> 06:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that's come up and
 
06:03:49.730 --> 06:03:49.740 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why I'm pushing for
 
06:03:52.128 --> 06:03:52.138 align:start position:0%
some more CEOs and the kernel could
 
06:03:53.868 --> 06:03:53.878 align:start position:0%
probably give you better examples than I
 
06:03:56.390 --> 06:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
can a couple things like for example
 
06:03:57.708 --> 06:03:57.718 align:start position:0%
this last
 
06:03:59.810 --> 06:03:59.820 align:start position:0%
um search that obviously was a front
 
06:04:02.570 --> 06:04:02.580 align:start position:0%
page search all across the nation
 
06:04:04.070 --> 06:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
um the other part that didn't come out
 
06:04:06.230 --> 06:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
was is while that was going on we had a
 
06:04:07.910 --> 06:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
second search for a lost boy in the
 
06:04:10.128 --> 06:04:10.138 align:start position:0%
woods in another part of the state and
 
06:04:13.670 --> 06:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
then we also ended up being asked by a
 
06:04:16.788 --> 06:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
local police department a murderer had
 
06:04:18.250 --> 06:04:18.260 align:start position:0%
or a
 
06:04:21.890 --> 06:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
apologize a suspected murderer had fled
 
06:04:24.650 --> 06:04:24.660 align:start position:0%
into the woods and asked our cos to
 
06:04:27.850 --> 06:04:27.860 align:start position:0%
assist in in trying to find that person
 
06:04:30.410 --> 06:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
I know the the search for the little boy
 
06:04:32.570 --> 06:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
included some of our dog teams that we
 
06:04:35.510 --> 06:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
had to you know move down into that one
 
06:04:36.770 --> 06:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
of the things that's starting to happen
 
06:04:40.490 --> 06:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
is is that on the weekends we've had
 
06:04:43.128 --> 06:04:43.138 align:start position:0%
multiple weekends where every law
 
06:04:45.770 --> 06:04:45.780 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer that we have is
 
06:04:47.570 --> 06:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
totally engaged in either you know
 
06:04:49.670 --> 06:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
search search and rescue issues or
 
06:04:52.730 --> 06:04:52.740 align:start position:0%
accident details on ATVs and we're just
 
06:04:54.288 --> 06:04:54.298 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you we're just you
 
06:04:55.910 --> 06:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
know running out of
 
06:04:58.970 --> 06:04:58.980 align:start position:0%
um the ability to cover all of these
 
06:05:04.330 --> 06:05:04.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:07.970 --> 06:05:07.980 align:start position:0%
I remember when the um when fishing game
 
06:05:10.310 --> 06:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
first hit the general fund for money it
 
06:05:11.750 --> 06:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
was a few years back and it was thought
 
06:05:13.970 --> 06:05:13.980 align:start position:0%
to be at the time temporary yeah and
 
06:05:15.890 --> 06:05:15.900 align:start position:0%
made at some point went away from
 
06:05:18.350 --> 06:05:18.360 align:start position:0%
general fund funding for a while too is
 
06:05:20.090 --> 06:05:20.100 align:start position:0%
it your expectation that this is a
 
06:05:22.610 --> 06:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
permanent change we this isn't to get
 
06:05:24.890 --> 06:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
you through something but that well part
 
06:05:26.990 --> 06:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
of what's going on and let me give an
 
06:05:29.690 --> 06:05:29.700 align:start position:0%
example of some search and rescue work
 
06:05:32.868 --> 06:05:32.878 align:start position:0%
that we do Under New Hampshire law if
 
06:05:34.910 --> 06:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
you get lost in the woods or in the
 
06:05:36.650 --> 06:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
water it's fish and games responsibility
 
06:05:39.410 --> 06:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
to come look for you
 
06:05:39.420 --> 06:05:40.010 align:start position:0%
to come look for you
um

06:05:40.010 --> 06:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:43.970 --> 06:05:43.980 align:start position:0%
you know when my father was a CEO uh it
 
06:05:45.410 --> 06:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
was mostly lost Hunters we were looking
 
06:05:47.390 --> 06:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
for today it's lost hikers we've
 
06:05:49.970 --> 06:05:49.980 align:start position:0%
developed programs for that but a group
 
06:05:51.650 --> 06:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
that we end up getting called out very
 
06:05:55.010 --> 06:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
often for are Alzheimer's patients if an
 
06:05:56.628 --> 06:05:56.638 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's patient walks out of the
 
06:05:58.368 --> 06:05:58.378 align:start position:0%
back door into the woods where the
 
06:06:00.350 --> 06:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
agency that gets called they walk out
 
06:06:01.730 --> 06:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
the front door onto the road than at
 
06:06:04.730 --> 06:06:04.740 align:start position:0%
State Police the local PD
 
06:06:08.030 --> 06:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
um these are things that you're asking
 
06:06:10.730 --> 06:06:10.740 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Sportsmen and or other
 
06:06:12.350 --> 06:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
user groups of fish and game that pay
 
06:06:14.690 --> 06:06:14.700 align:start position:0%
into the system to pick up the bill for
 
06:06:17.030 --> 06:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
I personally don't think to do this
 
06:06:18.830 --> 06:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
right and I do believe that for some of
 
06:06:21.948 --> 06:06:21.958 align:start position:0%
the work that we're doing as an agency
 
06:06:24.650 --> 06:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
using that as an example I believe that
 
06:06:26.510 --> 06:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
you know we shouldn't I mean access the
 
06:06:28.850 --> 06:06:28.860 align:start position:0%
general funds in order to
 
06:06:31.610 --> 06:06:31.620 align:start position:0%
balance the books between Sportsmen and
 
06:06:34.128 --> 06:06:34.138 align:start position:0%
citizens how much is search and rescue
 
06:06:36.410 --> 06:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
going up over the last um like how much
 
06:06:42.288 --> 06:06:42.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:44.750 --> 06:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
I can give you the numbers from the
 
06:06:46.970 --> 06:06:46.980 align:start position:0%
search and rescue account but I don't
 
06:06:49.310 --> 06:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
believe that that really incorporates
 
06:06:51.610 --> 06:06:51.620 align:start position:0%
everything Kevin you might speak to that
 
06:06:55.670 --> 06:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
so we spend any sense
 
06:06:55.680 --> 06:07:26.390 align:start position:0%
so we spend any sense
foreign

06:07:26.390 --> 06:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:28.788 --> 06:07:28.798 align:start position:0%
and so the argument can be made the
 
06:07:30.410 --> 06:07:30.420 align:start position:0%
Sportsman's pain
 
06:07:33.770 --> 06:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
almost a type statement helps with that
 
06:07:36.730 --> 06:07:36.740 align:start position:0%
the displacement paying on Sportsman 100
 
06:07:40.970 --> 06:07:40.980 align:start position:0%
office conceding at the children the
 
06:07:48.048 --> 06:07:48.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:52.070 --> 06:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
so it's it's time
 
06:07:56.208 --> 06:07:56.218 align:start position:0%
for 20 years of disability to get
 
06:07:59.810 --> 06:07:59.820 align:start position:0%
General funds I just think it's the
 
06:08:01.548 --> 06:08:01.558 align:start position:0%
state's responsibility and we want these
 
06:08:03.048 --> 06:08:03.058 align:start position:0%
folks to come up with me to demonstrate
 
06:08:07.030 --> 06:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:09.170 --> 06:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
we have a responsibility to make sure
 
06:08:13.030 --> 06:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:16.730 --> 06:08:16.740 align:start position:0%
it has gone up it is going to continue I
 
06:08:18.470 --> 06:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
hope it boosted that tremendously
 
06:08:21.650 --> 06:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
opposite Mr many puppets to keep on that
 
06:08:23.750 --> 06:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
that literally brought people out of the
 
06:08:26.030 --> 06:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
city because hiking was the same
 
06:08:29.570 --> 06:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
activity and a lot of that sustaining
 
06:08:31.490 --> 06:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
you're staying on
 
06:08:36.190 --> 06:08:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:38.570 --> 06:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
if you're in the middle of this extended
 
06:08:38.580 --> 06:08:39.410 align:start position:0%
if you're in the middle of this extended
Church

06:08:39.410 --> 06:08:39.420 align:start position:0%
Church
 
06:08:41.330 --> 06:08:41.340 align:start position:0%
where I've got everything available on
 
06:08:41.340 --> 06:08:45.850 align:start position:0%
where I've got everything available on
reviews

06:08:45.850 --> 06:08:45.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:49.128 --> 06:08:49.138 align:start position:0%
of short staff we call these losses back
 
06:08:49.138 --> 06:08:54.010 align:start position:0%
of short staff we call these losses back
opportunities

06:08:54.010 --> 06:08:54.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:57.368 --> 06:08:57.378 align:start position:0%
and it also meets these guys up
 
06:09:00.470 --> 06:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
and then you get a call
 
06:09:04.990 --> 06:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:08.110 --> 06:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
she had to replace
 
06:09:10.190 --> 06:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
constrained would not accomplish her
 
06:09:13.690 --> 06:09:13.700 align:start position:0%
chief of judgment falling off the street
 
06:09:18.590 --> 06:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:21.048 --> 06:09:21.058 align:start position:0%
that's why I would repeatedly asked to
 
06:09:25.128 --> 06:09:25.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:28.010 --> 06:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
and you think it's more than that those
 
06:09:29.690 --> 06:09:29.700 align:start position:0%
costs have uh I think I heard you say
 
06:09:32.090 --> 06:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
more than doubled yes over over a year
 
06:09:35.270 --> 06:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
over 20 or 30 years
 
06:09:50.090 --> 06:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:53.448 --> 06:09:53.458 align:start position:0%
in absolutely treacherous terrain and
 
06:09:55.190 --> 06:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
weather conditions I offered on your
 
06:09:57.530 --> 06:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
knees crawling at some points during
 
06:10:00.110 --> 06:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
this Rescue Mission and the expired
 
06:10:03.230 --> 06:10:03.240 align:start position:0%

ministry Memphis resource
 
06:10:08.628 --> 06:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
across the state of Connecticut a little
 
06:10:08.638 --> 06:10:14.750 align:start position:0%
across the state of Connecticut a little
bit

06:10:14.750 --> 06:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:17.090 --> 06:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
no no question
 
06:10:18.708 --> 06:10:18.718 align:start position:0%
um my next question is do you know the
 
06:10:20.208 --> 06:10:20.218 align:start position:0%
balance of the fish and game fund is at
 
06:10:22.970 --> 06:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
the end of fiscal 22 ballpark at the end
 
06:10:27.230 --> 06:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:31.010 --> 06:10:31.020 align:start position:0%
right here 11 and a half eleven and a
 
06:10:32.990 --> 06:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
half million and and what do we what are
 
06:10:34.850 --> 06:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
we going down a year like two-ish or is
 
06:10:37.610 --> 06:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
it up and down a bit my projection for
 
06:10:40.030 --> 06:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
our efficiency budget
 
06:10:43.128 --> 06:10:43.138 align:start position:0%
based on our estimated revenues and
 
06:10:45.948 --> 06:10:45.958 align:start position:0%
Appropriations in our efficiency budget
 
06:10:48.170 --> 06:10:48.180 align:start position:0%
at the end of the biennium June 30th of
 
06:10:51.470 --> 06:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
25 will be 3.68 million
 
06:10:54.288 --> 06:10:54.298 align:start position:0%
oh at the end of 25 it's down eight over
 
06:10:56.510 --> 06:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
two over two years or is that over
 
06:10:58.490 --> 06:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
that's over three over three years
 
06:11:02.170 --> 06:11:02.180 align:start position:0%
that's 22 to the end of 25.
 
06:11:05.708 --> 06:11:05.718 align:start position:0%
23 24 25. okay
 
06:11:08.448 --> 06:11:08.458 align:start position:0%
so that would be at a level of about
 
06:11:10.368 --> 06:11:10.378 align:start position:0%
four to five hundred thousand of General
 
06:11:10.378 --> 06:11:11.930 align:start position:0%
four to five hundred thousand of General
funding

06:11:11.930 --> 06:11:11.940 align:start position:0%
funding
 
06:11:11.940 --> 06:11:14.170 align:start position:0%
funding
foreign

06:11:14.170 --> 06:11:14.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:17.510 --> 06:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
budget requests for prioritized needs
 
06:11:20.448 --> 06:11:20.458 align:start position:0%
using the same beginning balance and the
 
06:11:22.670 --> 06:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
same end date in the same estimated
 
06:11:27.650 --> 06:11:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:30.590 --> 06:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
and how much is the fish and game annual
 
06:11:35.270 --> 06:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:38.810 --> 06:11:38.820 align:start position:0%
is it flat our expenses are going up
 
06:11:38.820 --> 06:11:41.030 align:start position:0%
is it flat our expenses are going up
exponentially

06:11:41.030 --> 06:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
exponentially
 
06:11:43.250 --> 06:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
so the fishing game is increasing but
 
06:11:45.288 --> 06:11:45.298 align:start position:0%
expenses are increasing faster correct
 
06:11:48.770 --> 06:11:48.780 align:start position:0%
are you seeing fairly steady increase or
 
06:11:50.448 --> 06:11:50.458 align:start position:0%
is it just in the fishing game fund
 
06:11:52.310 --> 06:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
itself or is it
 
06:11:53.810 --> 06:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
um you know you hear talk all the time
 
06:11:56.990 --> 06:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
about the ups and downs of people buying
 
06:12:00.470 --> 06:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
fishing licenses for example the um
 
06:12:02.090 --> 06:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
the general funds that have been coming
 
06:12:03.948 --> 06:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
into Fish and Game have helped stabilize
 
06:12:06.708 --> 06:12:06.718 align:start position:0%
the fun we also saw a major uptick in
 
06:12:08.930 --> 06:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
register I'm sorry in license sales from
 
06:12:11.390 --> 06:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
covet as I say that's now on a
 
06:12:14.208 --> 06:12:14.218 align:start position:0%
trajectory back back down but we you
 
06:12:17.868 --> 06:12:17.878 align:start position:0%
know we know we won't necessarily I mean
 
06:12:20.330 --> 06:12:20.340 align:start position:0%
you think there was a an anomalous
 
06:12:24.048 --> 06:12:24.058 align:start position:0%
uptick yes okay as I say it really is
 
06:12:25.970 --> 06:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
simple you know people trying to do
 
06:12:27.230 --> 06:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
stuff for their kids and they went out
 
06:12:28.970 --> 06:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
fishing or they you know go back to
 
06:12:29.930 --> 06:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
hunting or they had a little bit more
 
06:12:32.570 --> 06:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
time to go do that so we think uh do you
 
06:12:34.730 --> 06:12:34.740 align:start position:0%
think 20 fiscal 23 revenues are going to
 
06:12:36.048 --> 06:12:36.058 align:start position:0%
be more typical
 
06:12:39.410 --> 06:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
of the future or are we still coming out
 
06:12:41.270 --> 06:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
of it
 
06:12:45.670 --> 06:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
um I think we're still coming out of it
 
06:12:48.948 --> 06:12:48.958 align:start position:0%
any pandemic levels
 
06:12:51.530 --> 06:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
they are going to be at this point in
 
06:12:55.010 --> 06:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
time it's similar to fiscal year 22. and
 
06:12:57.288 --> 06:12:57.298 align:start position:0%
the other part of our income or major
 
06:13:00.048 --> 06:13:00.058 align:start position:0%
part of the income is registrations for
 
06:13:02.690 --> 06:13:02.700 align:start position:0%
snow machines and oh hrvs we get a cut
 
06:13:04.910 --> 06:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
of that before we turn money over the
 
06:13:04.920 --> 06:13:06.070 align:start position:0%
of that before we turn money over the
answer

06:13:06.070 --> 06:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
answer
 
06:13:08.890 --> 06:13:08.900 align:start position:0%
and um as I said
 
06:13:10.850 --> 06:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
those numbers will probably you know
 
06:13:13.730 --> 06:13:13.740 align:start position:0%
those went up as well during covid and
 
06:13:16.430 --> 06:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
because of the nature of the usage of
 
06:13:18.470 --> 06:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
them I think those those figures will
 
06:13:20.690 --> 06:13:20.700 align:start position:0%
stay with us a little longer into the
 
06:13:22.190 --> 06:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
future and that that money doesn't
 
06:13:23.750 --> 06:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
technically go on the fish and game fund
 
06:13:25.670 --> 06:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
that's just agency income no that well
 
06:13:29.030 --> 06:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
the less than that goes into our rohrv
 
06:13:31.430 --> 06:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
fund which is what I'm asking to take
 
06:13:33.410 --> 06:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
out you know take money out of that to
 
06:13:35.330 --> 06:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
pay for two of those four offices I'm
 
06:13:37.368 --> 06:13:37.378 align:start position:0%
asking for
 
06:13:39.170 --> 06:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
06:13:41.868 --> 06:13:41.878 align:start position:0%
I have a sort of a follow-up to where uh
 
06:13:45.288 --> 06:13:45.298 align:start position:0%
Charlie was heading so if I look at
 
06:13:47.390 --> 06:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
um your overall budget and then your
 
06:13:49.490 --> 06:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
Revenue that's projected in their agency
 
06:13:52.128 --> 06:13:52.138 align:start position:0%
phase it looks like the draw against the
 
06:13:53.990 --> 06:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
fishing game I happen to be on page six
 
06:13:55.610 --> 06:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
and eight
 
06:13:57.650 --> 06:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
um but the draw against the fish are
 
06:13:59.708 --> 06:13:59.718 align:start position:0%
fish and game fund is about 16 million
 
06:14:04.850 --> 06:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
23 24 25 give or take 16 million and the
 
06:14:07.010 --> 06:14:07.020 align:start position:0%
revenues projected are around 13 million
 
06:14:08.810 --> 06:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
right so you're going to be sort of
 
06:14:10.548 --> 06:14:10.558 align:start position:0%
drawing against your fund balance of 3
 
06:14:13.850 --> 06:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
million a year right every year so at
 
06:14:17.030 --> 06:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
that rate I think by the end of 25 you
 
06:14:18.470 --> 06:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
know you're down to maybe three or four
 
06:14:22.910 --> 06:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
million in total correct okay okay
 
06:14:24.830 --> 06:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay I thought you were saying that your
 
06:14:26.810 --> 06:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
balance would be at 8 million and I was
 
06:14:28.190 --> 06:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
like no I think it's going down by 8
 
06:14:29.750 --> 06:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
million I just wanted to clarify that
 
06:14:29.760 --> 06:14:31.010 align:start position:0%
million I just wanted to clarify that
okay

06:14:31.010 --> 06:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:14:33.770 --> 06:14:33.780 align:start position:0%
okay so that that that Gap is around 3
 
06:14:36.288 --> 06:14:36.298 align:start position:0%
million each year all right
 
06:14:38.570 --> 06:14:38.580 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:14:41.030 --> 06:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much greatly appreciate
 
06:14:41.040 --> 06:14:45.230 align:start position:0%
thank you very much greatly appreciate
it

06:14:45.230 --> 06:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:45.240 --> 06:14:47.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:14:47.510 --> 06:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:47.520 --> 06:14:50.448 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:14:50.448 --> 06:14:50.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:52.610 --> 06:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
we're gonna take about a three minute
 
06:14:54.430 --> 06:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
recess and then be back with the
 
06:14:57.110 --> 06:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities Council for
 
06:14:59.208 --> 06:14:59.218 align:start position:0%
their testimony thank you
 
06:14:59.218 --> 06:17:07.190 align:start position:0%
their testimony thank you
foreign

06:17:07.190 --> 06:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:13.690 --> 06:17:13.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:15.948 --> 06:17:15.958 align:start position:0%
an update for anyone who cares about
 
06:17:19.850 --> 06:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
these things USA one Iran zero
 
06:17:30.288 --> 06:17:30.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:30.298 --> 06:17:32.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:17:32.350 --> 06:17:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:36.048 --> 06:17:36.058 align:start position:0%
Iran can tie and still move on
 
06:17:38.030 --> 06:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
the U.S has to wait
 
06:17:38.040 --> 06:17:41.628 align:start position:0%
the U.S has to wait
yeah

06:17:41.628 --> 06:17:41.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:43.490 --> 06:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
I think it depends what happens in the
 
06:17:45.590 --> 06:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
whether Iran can tie depends on what
 
06:17:49.788 --> 06:17:49.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:49.798 --> 06:17:51.350 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

06:17:51.350 --> 06:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:17:51.360 --> 06:18:17.270 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah

06:18:49.920 --> 06:19:43.010 align:start position:0%
 
expectations

06:19:43.010 --> 06:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:43.020 --> 06:20:05.750 align:start position:0%

06:20:07.128 --> 06:20:07.138 align:start position:0%
like to invite the commissioner to take
 
06:20:14.330 --> 06:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:14.340 --> 06:20:17.230 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:20:17.230 --> 06:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:22.548 --> 06:20:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:24.830 --> 06:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon yes if you just hit the
 
06:20:26.330 --> 06:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
button turn off the red lights on you're
 
06:20:28.368 --> 06:20:28.378 align:start position:0%
good to go
 
06:20:30.410 --> 06:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
how is everybody doing my name is
 
06:20:32.990 --> 06:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
idadora Rodriguez legandre I'm the
 
06:20:35.448 --> 06:20:35.458 align:start position:0%
executive director at the New Hampshire
 
06:20:38.810 --> 06:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
Council on developmental disabilities
 
06:20:41.150 --> 06:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
um thanks for allowing us to present our
 
06:20:43.850 --> 06:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
budget here today
 
06:20:46.368 --> 06:20:46.378 align:start position:0%
um so I like to just walk you a little
 
06:20:49.548 --> 06:20:49.558 align:start position:0%
bit through about the council who we are
 
06:20:52.910 --> 06:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
what we do some of our projects
 
06:20:55.670 --> 06:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
um and then talk you through a little
 
06:20:57.530 --> 06:20:57.540 align:start position:0%
bit about how our funding works because
 
06:21:02.868 --> 06:21:02.878 align:start position:0%
we are 100 federally funded and um then
 
06:21:04.788 --> 06:21:04.798 align:start position:0%
answer any questions about our current
 
06:21:07.850 --> 06:21:07.860 align:start position:0%
budget that you might have so at the New
 
06:21:09.110 --> 06:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Council on developmental
 
06:21:11.930 --> 06:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
disabilities or the DD Council as we
 
06:21:14.868 --> 06:21:14.878 align:start position:0%
refer to it as we're dedicated to
 
06:21:16.730 --> 06:21:16.740 align:start position:0%
dignity full rights and citizenship
 
06:21:18.948 --> 06:21:18.958 align:start position:0%
cultural diversity equal opportunities
 
06:21:21.530 --> 06:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
and full participation for all of our
 
06:21:22.670 --> 06:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens with
 
06:21:24.530 --> 06:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities
 
06:21:29.150 --> 06:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
so we accomplish this Mission primarily
 
06:21:32.030 --> 06:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
through education advocacy and through
 
06:21:34.430 --> 06:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
funding Innovative projects that reduce
 
06:21:36.770 --> 06:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
barriers and create opportunities for
 
06:21:38.208 --> 06:21:38.218 align:start position:0%
people with developmental disabilities
 
06:21:40.310 --> 06:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to really have full
 
06:21:42.770 --> 06:21:42.780 align:start position:0%
access and Community participation in
 
06:21:44.948 --> 06:21:44.958 align:start position:0%
what we call Community integration
 
06:21:47.930 --> 06:21:47.940 align:start position:0%
most of our work is accomplished through
 
06:21:50.330 --> 06:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
collaboration with other organizations
 
06:21:53.030 --> 06:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
and entities that have similar missions
 
06:21:55.548 --> 06:21:55.558 align:start position:0%
and Visions for the full inclusion of
 
06:21:57.110 --> 06:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
people with developmental disabilities
 
06:21:59.830 --> 06:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and so
 
06:22:03.650 --> 06:22:03.660 align:start position:0%
that allows our small amount of funding
 
06:22:05.890 --> 06:22:05.900 align:start position:0%
to really go a long way because we're
 
06:22:08.208 --> 06:22:08.218 align:start position:0%
collaborating on a number of projects
 
06:22:10.310 --> 06:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
and activities that really have a big
 
06:22:13.910 --> 06:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
impact on people's lives so
 
06:22:16.730 --> 06:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
um much like the governor's Commission
 
06:22:19.490 --> 06:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
on disability is Guided by the Ada we
 
06:22:22.190 --> 06:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
are also Guided by a federal law known
 
06:22:24.770 --> 06:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
as the GD act it stands for the
 
06:22:27.948 --> 06:22:27.958 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities and Bill of
 
06:22:31.070 --> 06:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
Rights Act most recently reauthorized in
 
06:22:35.930 --> 06:22:35.940 align:start position:0%
2000 and that Act created a DD Council
 
06:22:38.750 --> 06:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
in every state and territory of the
 
06:22:41.628 --> 06:22:41.638 align:start position:0%
United States and so at such we are
 
06:22:45.590 --> 06:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
federally funded through Congress
 
06:22:45.600 --> 06:22:46.670 align:start position:0%
federally funded through Congress
um

06:22:46.670 --> 06:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:49.670 --> 06:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
and we are what's known as a minimum
 
06:22:53.030 --> 06:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
allotment state so it's their formula is
 
06:22:55.310 --> 06:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
based on per capita incidence of
 
06:22:56.930 --> 06:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities in a
 
06:22:59.390 --> 06:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
particular state so we got just over
 
06:23:02.150 --> 06:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
half a million dollars a year
 
06:23:06.770 --> 06:23:06.780 align:start position:0%
um so our full Federal allotment in FY
 
06:23:11.350 --> 06:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 and fiscal 22 was
 
06:23:11.360 --> 06:23:13.390 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 and fiscal 22 was
527

06:23:13.390 --> 06:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
527
 
06:23:17.030 --> 06:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
570 each year and that's after Congress
 
06:23:19.548 --> 06:23:19.558 align:start position:0%
has approved their budget so from one
 
06:23:21.830 --> 06:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
year to the next you know we may run
 
06:23:23.750 --> 06:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
into things like continuing resolutions
 
06:23:25.850 --> 06:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
or government shutdowns that really
 
06:23:28.788 --> 06:23:28.798 align:start position:0%
influence or uh you know shifts in
 
06:23:30.830 --> 06:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
priorities so we never know if we're
 
06:23:32.868 --> 06:23:32.878 align:start position:0%
going to be funded at the same amount or
 
06:23:34.570 --> 06:23:34.580 align:start position:0%
going to increase or going to decrease
 
06:23:37.128 --> 06:23:37.138 align:start position:0%
but typically it's been around half a
 
06:23:40.670 --> 06:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
million for the last 10 years
 
06:23:43.788 --> 06:23:43.798 align:start position:0%
um our Council membership our council is
 
06:23:48.288 --> 06:23:48.298 align:start position:0%
made up of uh at least 21 members uh the
 
06:23:51.708 --> 06:23:51.718 align:start position:0%
membership is guided in federal law and
 
06:23:55.850 --> 06:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
so uh 30 percent typically are citizens
 
06:23:57.770 --> 06:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
with intellectual and developmental
 
06:24:01.490 --> 06:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
disabilities 30 typically are parents
 
06:24:03.650 --> 06:24:03.660 align:start position:0%
are guardians of individuals with
 
06:24:04.788 --> 06:24:04.798 align:start position:0%
intellectual and developmental
 
06:24:06.708 --> 06:24:06.718 align:start position:0%
disabilities that may not be able to
 
06:24:10.910 --> 06:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
advocate for themselves and then uh the
 
06:24:12.770 --> 06:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
other council members are what we call
 
06:24:14.868 --> 06:24:14.878 align:start position:0%
our agency seats and these are our
 
06:24:17.390 --> 06:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
Community Partners our collaborators so
 
06:24:19.430 --> 06:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
we have entities like Voc Rehab
 
06:24:21.948 --> 06:24:21.958 align:start position:0%
Vocational Rehabilitation special
 
06:24:24.708 --> 06:24:24.718 align:start position:0%
education we have the disability rights
 
06:24:26.750 --> 06:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
Center of New Hampshire we have the
 
06:24:29.930 --> 06:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
institute on disability at UNH we have
 
06:24:32.770 --> 06:24:32.780 align:start position:0%
the private provider Network
 
06:24:35.330 --> 06:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
represented to ensure that the people
 
06:24:37.368 --> 06:24:37.378 align:start position:0%
who support people with developmental
 
06:24:39.470 --> 06:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
disabilities are also providing impact
 
06:24:43.730 --> 06:24:43.740 align:start position:0%
on our work input on our work
 
06:24:46.310 --> 06:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
um there are other state agencies like
 
06:24:49.030 --> 06:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of elderly and Adult Services
 
06:24:53.628 --> 06:24:53.638 align:start position:0%
that are also represented as well as New
 
06:24:56.110 --> 06:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire family voices which is the
 
06:24:59.350 --> 06:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
maternal and child health program
 
06:25:03.350 --> 06:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
that is also a mandated seat as well as
 
06:25:04.970 --> 06:25:04.980 align:start position:0%
of course the Bureau of Developmental
 
06:25:07.490 --> 06:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
Services who who is in charge of
 
06:25:10.548 --> 06:25:10.558 align:start position:0%
providing funding for services to our
 
06:25:12.230 --> 06:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
individuals with intellectual and
 
06:25:13.910 --> 06:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities in New
 
06:25:16.570 --> 06:25:16.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so our members are volunteers
 
06:25:20.510 --> 06:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
we have a we have a working Council so
 
06:25:23.208 --> 06:25:23.218 align:start position:0%
our members participate on different
 
06:25:26.030 --> 06:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
committees that are in charge of things
 
06:25:29.390 --> 06:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
like you know monitoring our projects
 
06:25:33.128 --> 06:25:33.138 align:start position:0%
and programs building our membership
 
06:25:37.070 --> 06:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
and identify what our policy priorities
 
06:25:39.410 --> 06:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
might be any given year because a lot
 
06:25:42.350 --> 06:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
lot of what we do again is advocate for
 
06:25:44.448 --> 06:25:44.458 align:start position:0%
capacity building for New Hampshire to
 
06:25:46.070 --> 06:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
be able to serve its citizens with
 
06:25:48.410 --> 06:25:48.420 align:start position:0%
disabilities as well as systemic change
 
06:25:51.110 --> 06:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
that eliminates those barriers that I
 
06:25:52.490 --> 06:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
06:25:56.030 --> 06:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
so part of our charge is to identify the
 
06:25:59.570 --> 06:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
needs of the people we serve and we do
 
06:26:01.010 --> 06:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
that primarily through things like
 
06:26:02.590 --> 06:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
surveys and
 
06:26:05.510 --> 06:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
interviews and listening sessions and
 
06:26:07.670 --> 06:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
then we we create a Five-Year Plan
 
06:26:10.670 --> 06:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
taking all of that information into
 
06:26:12.890 --> 06:26:12.900 align:start position:0%
account we develop a five-year state
 
06:26:15.288 --> 06:26:15.298 align:start position:0%
plan that helps address students those
 
06:26:18.948 --> 06:26:18.958 align:start position:0%
needs and potentially would identify uh
 
06:26:21.070 --> 06:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
what we call demonstration activities
 
06:26:24.530 --> 06:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
that we can use our grants and
 
06:26:27.010 --> 06:26:27.020 align:start position:0%
scholarship funding to be able to
 
06:26:31.368 --> 06:26:31.378 align:start position:0%
support So a big part of what we do
 
06:26:34.190 --> 06:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
is we provide
 
06:26:37.070 --> 06:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
um grants and
 
06:26:37.080 --> 06:26:38.330 align:start position:0%
um grants and
um

06:26:38.330 --> 06:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:41.208 --> 06:26:41.218 align:start position:0%
project funds to support things like
 
06:26:43.310 --> 06:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
pilot projects
 
06:26:46.788 --> 06:26:46.798 align:start position:0%
um and uh innovative ideas again that
 
06:26:48.650 --> 06:26:48.660 align:start position:0%
support people on the ground because we
 
06:26:50.628 --> 06:26:50.638 align:start position:0%
don't provide Direct Services ourselves
 
06:26:53.930 --> 06:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
we support other organizations that are
 
06:26:56.810 --> 06:26:56.820 align:start position:0%
really working on improving quality of
 
06:26:58.910 --> 06:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
services or improving quality of life
 
06:27:01.490 --> 06:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
for Citizens on the ground so there's a
 
06:27:04.150 --> 06:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
little bit about what we do one of our
 
06:27:07.730 --> 06:27:07.740 align:start position:0%
handouts in the finder today it talks a
 
06:27:09.890 --> 06:27:09.900 align:start position:0%
little bit about some of the specific
 
06:27:12.470 --> 06:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
projects that included a publication at
 
06:27:14.150 --> 06:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
least the poor annually that is a
 
06:27:16.730 --> 06:27:16.740 align:start position:0%
resource guide for families
 
06:27:20.030 --> 06:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
um and a lot of what we also support are
 
06:27:22.030 --> 06:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
things like training activities
 
06:27:25.190 --> 06:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
leadership development for people with
 
06:27:26.390 --> 06:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
intellectual and developmental
 
06:27:29.628 --> 06:27:29.638 align:start position:0%
disabilities in their families and so we
 
06:27:32.330 --> 06:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
have a number of Grants and scholarship
 
06:27:34.910 --> 06:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
programs that help support that that
 
06:27:37.128 --> 06:27:37.138 align:start position:0%
people can apply to and then we have a
 
06:27:39.650 --> 06:27:39.660 align:start position:0%
committee that discuss is the applicants
 
06:27:42.048 --> 06:27:42.058 align:start position:0%
this actually was super helpful during
 
06:27:46.190 --> 06:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
covid because we had the flexibility to
 
06:27:47.990 --> 06:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
create a new Grant we called it the
 
06:27:51.230 --> 06:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
emerging needs Grant to help address
 
06:27:53.150 --> 06:27:53.160 align:start position:0%
some of the needs that agency is
 
06:27:55.368 --> 06:27:55.378 align:start position:0%
providing Direct Services were finding
 
06:27:58.490 --> 06:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
before federal funds came into New
 
06:28:00.350 --> 06:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they were able to get
 
06:28:02.708 --> 06:28:02.718 align:start position:0%
things like you know
 
06:28:05.288 --> 06:28:05.298 align:start position:0%
iPads or or
 
06:28:08.570 --> 06:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
smart TVs so that their individuals
 
06:28:10.310 --> 06:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
could participate in things like
 
06:28:13.910 --> 06:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
Telehealth and community activities that
 
06:28:16.430 --> 06:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
were now being offered online
 
06:28:19.070 --> 06:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
um so that's just an example of what we
 
06:28:22.368 --> 06:28:22.378 align:start position:0%
do now our federal allotment as I
 
06:28:24.170 --> 06:28:24.180 align:start position:0%
mentioned comes from the federal
 
06:28:26.208 --> 06:28:26.218 align:start position:0%
government it's through the
 
06:28:29.150 --> 06:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
administration on community living on
 
06:28:32.810 --> 06:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
our annual Grant award we and I
 
06:28:36.470 --> 06:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned that our word has been 285
 
06:28:40.610 --> 06:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
000 I'm sorry 520 seven thousand for the
 
06:28:43.730 --> 06:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
last couple of years but we have a
 
06:28:47.150 --> 06:28:47.160 align:start position:0%
two-year project period in order to
 
06:28:50.448 --> 06:28:50.458 align:start position:0%
spend those funds so essentially what
 
06:28:52.670 --> 06:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
that allows us to do is carry forward
 
06:28:52.680 --> 06:28:54.110 align:start position:0%
that allows us to do is carry forward
funds

06:28:54.110 --> 06:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
funds
 
06:28:54.120 --> 06:28:55.610 align:start position:0%
funds
right

06:28:55.610 --> 06:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:28:57.650 --> 06:28:57.660 align:start position:0%
um so that when we do experience things
 
06:28:59.810 --> 06:28:59.820 align:start position:0%
like continuing resolutions government
 
06:29:03.110 --> 06:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
shutdowns or shifts or changes that are
 
06:29:07.368 --> 06:29:07.378 align:start position:0%
just in beyond our control we still have
 
06:29:10.250 --> 06:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
a pool of resources from which to draw
 
06:29:13.670 --> 06:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
down from and so
 
06:29:16.310 --> 06:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
um our carry forward last fiscal year
 
06:29:19.910 --> 06:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
was 285
 
06:29:22.970 --> 06:29:22.980 align:start position:0%
000 and so we've kind of put that into
 
06:29:26.750 --> 06:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
our total budget as funds that are
 
06:29:28.788 --> 06:29:28.798 align:start position:0%
available to us that we can draw fund
 
06:29:32.570 --> 06:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
from um but we don't typically budget
 
06:29:35.330 --> 06:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
um for spending all of it because we
 
06:29:37.548 --> 06:29:37.558 align:start position:0%
need to have that you know emergency
 
06:29:40.010 --> 06:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
fund so to be
 
06:29:42.110 --> 06:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
um so
 
06:29:45.830 --> 06:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
I would like to move into our budget
 
06:29:49.430 --> 06:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
which is pretty straightforward I think
 
06:29:52.490 --> 06:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
um we have some new class codes that are
 
06:29:54.048 --> 06:29:54.058 align:start position:0%
really just
 
06:29:57.288 --> 06:29:57.298 align:start position:0%
um in order to better and more
 
06:29:59.270 --> 06:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
accurately capture the expenditures that
 
06:30:00.890 --> 06:30:00.900 align:start position:0%
we're making
 
06:30:03.288 --> 06:30:03.298 align:start position:0%
um such as you know interpreter Services
 
06:30:06.770 --> 06:30:06.780 align:start position:0%
that's part of how we create information
 
06:30:09.288 --> 06:30:09.298 align:start position:0%
access for people with intellectual and
 
06:30:11.690 --> 06:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities is being able
 
06:30:13.868 --> 06:30:13.878 align:start position:0%
to provide not only
 
06:30:17.030 --> 06:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
ASL interpretation Services any language
 
06:30:20.090 --> 06:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
interpretation services or
 
06:30:20.100 --> 06:30:21.128 align:start position:0%
interpretation services or
um

06:30:21.128 --> 06:30:21.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:30:25.490 --> 06:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
also uh creating information that is
 
06:30:27.650 --> 06:30:27.660 align:start position:0%
more accessible through
 
06:30:29.628 --> 06:30:29.638 align:start position:0%
um like closed captioning
 
06:30:29.638 --> 06:30:31.070 align:start position:0%
um like closed captioning
so

06:30:31.070 --> 06:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:30:31.080 --> 06:30:33.070 align:start position:0%
so
um

06:30:33.070 --> 06:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:30:36.410 --> 06:30:36.420 align:start position:0%
we also again there's not really a lot
 
06:30:39.288 --> 06:30:39.298 align:start position:0%
we we've had similar challenges as other
 
06:30:42.770 --> 06:30:42.780 align:start position:0%
agencies with Staffing and so
 
06:30:47.330 --> 06:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
um in the interest of trying to become
 
06:30:50.270 --> 06:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
more creative we're actually proposing
 
06:30:53.690 --> 06:30:53.700 align:start position:0%
to move from three full-time positions
 
06:30:57.350 --> 06:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
to two full-time positions and then have
 
06:31:00.288 --> 06:31:00.298 align:start position:0%
two additional part-time positions that
 
06:31:03.470 --> 06:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
could potentially be filled by a family
 
06:31:06.410 --> 06:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
member of a person with a developmental
 
06:31:09.230 --> 06:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
disability who is available during the
 
06:31:12.170 --> 06:31:12.180 align:start position:0%
day to help us with our project work or
 
06:31:15.530 --> 06:31:15.540 align:start position:0%
our policy work and so we're decreasing
 
06:31:18.890 --> 06:31:18.900 align:start position:0%
full-time and increasing part-time
 
06:31:20.990 --> 06:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
um salary and then
 
06:31:23.208 --> 06:31:23.218 align:start position:0%
um the only other increase which is
 
06:31:25.430 --> 06:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
always exciting for me is the funds that
 
06:31:27.948 --> 06:31:27.958 align:start position:0%
are available in our grants and projects
 
06:31:29.270 --> 06:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
because that's really where our bread
 
06:31:31.730 --> 06:31:31.740 align:start position:0%
and butter is it's being able to put the
 
06:31:34.070 --> 06:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
money into the community Unity into
 
06:31:34.080 --> 06:31:35.350 align:start position:0%
money into the community Unity into
projects

06:31:35.350 --> 06:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
projects
 
06:31:38.750 --> 06:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
and activities that really have an
 
06:31:42.288 --> 06:31:42.298 align:start position:0%
impact on people's lives so one of the
 
06:31:46.128 --> 06:31:46.138 align:start position:0%
bigger projects that we funded last year
 
06:31:48.890 --> 06:31:48.900 align:start position:0%
and are looking to extend this year
 
06:31:50.330 --> 06:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
actually it should be going to governor
 
06:31:51.610 --> 06:31:51.620 align:start position:0%
and Council soon
 
06:31:55.910 --> 06:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
is to provide Education and Training
 
06:31:58.670 --> 06:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
around a new law that New Hampshire has
 
06:32:02.030 --> 06:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
to related to supported decision making
 
06:32:04.548 --> 06:32:04.558 align:start position:0%
which is an alternative to guardianship
 
06:32:07.850 --> 06:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
so it's very exciting and and as a new
 
06:32:11.150 --> 06:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
new possibility for people you can
 
06:32:13.310 --> 06:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
imagine the amount of people that need
 
06:32:15.590 --> 06:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
to be trained and educated on this new
 
06:32:19.610 --> 06:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
approach because anyone who has a child
 
06:32:24.288 --> 06:32:24.298 align:start position:0%
in school for example who is you know 16
 
06:32:29.090 --> 06:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
or 17 the school is informing them that
 
06:32:30.650 --> 06:32:30.660 align:start position:0%
they need to apply for guardianship
 
06:32:34.670 --> 06:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
immediately and so this law now requires
 
06:32:38.090 --> 06:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
that schools also inform families that
 
06:32:40.070 --> 06:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
supported decision making is available
 
06:32:43.070 --> 06:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
as an alternative to guardianship which
 
06:32:45.890 --> 06:32:45.900 align:start position:0%
really puts the um self-directedness
 
06:32:45.900 --> 06:32:47.030 align:start position:0%
really puts the um self-directedness
back

06:32:47.030 --> 06:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
back
 
06:32:49.570 --> 06:32:49.580 align:start position:0%
um you know into individuals whereas
 
06:32:51.948 --> 06:32:51.958 align:start position:0%
guardianship sometimes removes some
 
06:32:53.930 --> 06:32:53.940 align:start position:0%
rights that people might still be able
 
06:32:56.628 --> 06:32:56.638 align:start position:0%
to have if there was another system in
 
06:32:56.638 --> 06:32:57.590 align:start position:0%
to have if there was another system in
place

06:32:57.590 --> 06:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
place
 
06:33:01.310 --> 06:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
so that's pretty much all I have about
 
06:33:04.610 --> 06:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
our budget as other agencies has
 
06:33:08.750 --> 06:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
indicated do doit is experiencing
 
06:33:11.868 --> 06:33:11.878 align:start position:0%
increases so we've added that as well
 
06:33:13.610 --> 06:33:13.620 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you and thank you for
 
06:33:15.048 --> 06:33:15.058 align:start position:0%
your testimony and thank you for all the
 
06:33:18.170 --> 06:33:18.180 align:start position:0%
great work you do uh just I want to be
 
06:33:20.750 --> 06:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
sure I understand the revenue
 
06:33:20.760 --> 06:33:21.350 align:start position:0%
sure I understand the revenue
um

06:33:21.350 --> 06:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:33:23.448 --> 06:33:23.458 align:start position:0%
the I know you said you were on a
 
06:33:25.490 --> 06:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
minimal allotment yeah
 
06:33:30.128 --> 06:33:30.138 align:start position:0%
um and it looks like in 2022 you got 528
 
06:33:33.350 --> 06:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
331 yeah but then it shows going up to
 
06:33:36.948 --> 06:33:36.958 align:start position:0%
662 2023 and 765
 
06:33:39.110 --> 06:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
000 and 24 that would seem to be like a
 
06:33:43.010 --> 06:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
50 increase almost in in federal funds
 
06:33:44.510 --> 06:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
and do I read that correct is that
 
06:33:46.548 --> 06:33:46.558 align:start position:0%
what's happening so what's interesting
 
06:33:48.850 --> 06:33:48.860 align:start position:0%
is before
 
06:33:55.128 --> 06:33:55.138 align:start position:0%
23 we were only uh or up to yeah we were
 
06:33:55.138 --> 06:33:56.090 align:start position:0%
23 we were only uh or up to yeah we were
only

06:33:56.090 --> 06:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
only
 
06:33:59.868 --> 06:33:59.878 align:start position:0%
putting into our budget what our Council
 
06:33:59.878 --> 06:34:01.330 align:start position:0%
putting into our budget what our Council
approved

06:34:01.330 --> 06:34:01.340 align:start position:0%
approved
 
06:34:04.250 --> 06:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
anticipated expenditures were going to
 
06:34:04.260 --> 06:34:05.030 align:start position:0%
anticipated expenditures were going to
be

06:34:05.030 --> 06:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:34:07.190 --> 06:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
and now we've received additional
 
06:34:09.530 --> 06:34:09.540 align:start position:0%
guidance that we should be including our
 
06:34:11.990 --> 06:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
carry for our anticipated carry forward
 
06:34:14.270 --> 06:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
and that's why you see that big increase
 
06:34:16.310 --> 06:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
okay whoever gave you that guidance I
 
06:34:19.250 --> 06:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
would agree with it yeah thank you yeah
 
06:34:21.170 --> 06:34:21.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:34:24.890 --> 06:34:24.900 align:start position:0%
hi hi thank you for everything you do
 
06:34:24.900 --> 06:34:26.030 align:start position:0%
hi hi thank you for everything you do
um

06:34:26.030 --> 06:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:34:27.890 --> 06:34:27.900 align:start position:0%
you currently have a vacancy is that
 
06:34:30.048 --> 06:34:30.058 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing do we have two
 
06:34:34.010 --> 06:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
vacancies I mean it's just you no no we
 
06:34:36.350 --> 06:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
have two full-time Phil
 
06:34:39.948 --> 06:34:39.958 align:start position:0%
and then we took one the the vacant
 
06:34:42.890 --> 06:34:42.900 align:start position:0%
full-time that exists currently and we
 
06:34:44.990 --> 06:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
split it into two part-time positions so
 
06:34:46.610 --> 06:34:46.620 align:start position:0%
we have a big we have two part-time
 
06:34:49.208 --> 06:34:49.218 align:start position:0%
vacancies that we're prioritizing
 
06:34:52.190 --> 06:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
currently we have other smaller
 
06:34:55.010 --> 06:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
positions so we we try to employ people
 
06:34:56.930 --> 06:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
with intellectual and developmental
 
06:34:59.330 --> 06:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
disabilities so we have a clerk one a
 
06:35:02.090 --> 06:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
clerk two we have a clerk one filled but
 
06:35:03.948 --> 06:35:03.958 align:start position:0%
we also have a clerk two and a clerk
 
06:35:05.990 --> 06:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
three that potentially could be filled
 
06:35:07.368 --> 06:35:07.378 align:start position:0%
by people with intellectual and
 
06:35:08.810 --> 06:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
developmental disability I know in the
 
06:35:11.570 --> 06:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
past you have um employed people
 
06:35:14.810 --> 06:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
um with uh with disabilities is it is it
 
06:35:18.708 --> 06:35:18.718 align:start position:0%
common or are they mostly interns
 
06:35:22.010 --> 06:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
um so interestingly the young men who
 
06:35:25.610 --> 06:35:25.620 align:start position:0%
currently Works was an intern through a
 
06:35:27.850 --> 06:35:27.860 align:start position:0%
vocational rehabilitation program
 
06:35:31.430 --> 06:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
originally that was about four
 
06:35:33.110 --> 06:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
it was over
 
06:35:36.288 --> 06:35:36.298 align:start position:0%
five years ago so he's been with us uh
 
06:35:38.810 --> 06:35:38.820 align:start position:0%
almost four years now oh geez okay yeah
 
06:35:40.548 --> 06:35:40.558 align:start position:0%
and that's probably when you used to be
 
06:35:45.230 --> 06:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
over next to him yes yes over at um
 
06:35:46.310 --> 06:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
South Fruit Street that's our
 
06:35:49.490 --> 06:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
Walkerville now and then we moved um I
 
06:35:50.868 --> 06:35:50.878 align:start position:0%
have a just a question about sort of
 
06:35:52.490 --> 06:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
covet and people
 
06:35:54.530 --> 06:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
um with disabilities and is it your
 
06:35:56.390 --> 06:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
sense that
 
06:35:57.770 --> 06:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
um you know during covert a lot of
 
06:36:00.890 --> 06:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
people's World got a lot smaller
 
06:36:03.048 --> 06:36:03.058 align:start position:0%
um a lot smaller and and that was
 
06:36:05.448 --> 06:36:05.458 align:start position:0%
problematic for a lot of us and some of
 
06:36:07.190 --> 06:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
us who have an inner hermit didn't mind
 
06:36:10.730 --> 06:36:10.740 align:start position:0%
it so much but uh some of us did and I
 
06:36:13.070 --> 06:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh for people with disabilities
 
06:36:13.080 --> 06:36:13.788 align:start position:0%
uh for people with disabilities
um

06:36:13.788 --> 06:36:13.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:17.150 --> 06:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
it was dramatic and do you do you sense
 
06:36:19.070 --> 06:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
the sort of
 
06:36:21.410 --> 06:36:21.420 align:start position:0%
um in in coming back to normal if that's
 
06:36:23.570 --> 06:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
even a thing right
 
06:36:25.368 --> 06:36:25.378 align:start position:0%
um do you sense that's changing or do
 
06:36:27.530 --> 06:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
you do you think there was permanent
 
06:36:29.448 --> 06:36:29.458 align:start position:0%
um um I don't know regression is the
 
06:36:31.970 --> 06:36:31.980 align:start position:0%
wrong word but a permanent difficulty
 
06:36:33.110 --> 06:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
that's going to be hard to overcome
 
06:36:37.250 --> 06:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
that's a really great question
 
06:36:39.910 --> 06:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
um our community experience
 
06:36:43.250 --> 06:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
unprecedented social isolation during
 
06:36:45.890 --> 06:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
this time both because of increased
 
06:36:47.930 --> 06:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
health challenges that made them more
 
06:36:51.410 --> 06:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
susceptible during the pandemic which
 
06:36:53.628 --> 06:36:53.638 align:start position:0%
increased you know their inability to
 
06:36:55.670 --> 06:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
really participate in anything in the
 
06:36:58.628 --> 06:36:58.638 align:start position:0%
community hence the need for technology
 
06:36:58.638 --> 06:37:00.368 align:start position:0%
community hence the need for technology
and

06:37:00.368 --> 06:37:00.378 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:37:03.350 --> 06:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
building ways and strategies that they
 
06:37:05.510 --> 06:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
could make connections with people not
 
06:37:08.090 --> 06:37:08.100 align:start position:0%
well not being in person that would put
 
06:37:09.470 --> 06:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
them at risk
 
06:37:12.288 --> 06:37:12.298 align:start position:0%
I would answer your question by saying
 
06:37:12.298 --> 06:37:14.350 align:start position:0%
I would answer your question by saying
that

06:37:14.350 --> 06:37:14.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:37:20.170 --> 06:37:20.180 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the pandemic has created
 
06:37:24.830 --> 06:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
huge gaps in how the service system can
 
06:37:27.110 --> 06:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
support people with disabilities in the
 
06:37:29.830 --> 06:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
community programs have closed
 
06:37:32.890 --> 06:37:32.900 align:start position:0%
everybody's understaffed
 
06:37:35.868 --> 06:37:35.878 align:start position:0%
dsps or direct support professionals are
 
06:37:39.948 --> 06:37:39.958 align:start position:0%
wildly underpaid and undervalued and so
 
06:37:42.708 --> 06:37:42.718 align:start position:0%
it it makes it more attractive for
 
06:37:44.690 --> 06:37:44.700 align:start position:0%
someone to get a job at Dunkin Donuts
 
06:37:48.230 --> 06:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
than to work in a day program supporting
 
06:37:50.270 --> 06:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
people who are looking for employment
 
06:37:53.510 --> 06:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
and happen to have a disability so I I
 
06:37:56.628 --> 06:37:56.638 align:start position:0%
see this as a longer term challenge than
 
06:37:59.030 --> 06:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
some other organizations or groups are
 
06:38:01.670 --> 06:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
facing because of those additional
 
06:38:05.150 --> 06:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
Workforce challenges in our community I
 
06:38:08.570 --> 06:38:08.580 align:start position:0%
mean I think the challenges to the dsps
 
06:38:10.788 --> 06:38:10.798 align:start position:0%
existed probably before coven it's just
 
06:38:12.770 --> 06:38:12.780 align:start position:0%
gotten exacerbated do you think that
 
06:38:14.628 --> 06:38:14.638 align:start position:0%
turns when the economy turns a little
 
06:38:18.230 --> 06:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
bit or is it sort of so I'm I'm hopeful
 
06:38:24.230 --> 06:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:26.628 --> 06:38:26.638 align:start position:0%
um some of the systems change work
 
06:38:28.128 --> 06:38:28.138 align:start position:0%
that's happening at the Bureau of
 
06:38:30.110 --> 06:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
Developmental Services it's going to
 
06:38:34.070 --> 06:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
really help improve uh or attract people
 
06:38:36.830 --> 06:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
to the direct support Workforce
 
06:38:39.110 --> 06:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
um in a way that kind of wasn't possible
 
06:38:42.708 --> 06:38:42.718 align:start position:0%
before I I'm hopeful that you know
 
06:38:46.490 --> 06:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
um through our in our rate development
 
06:38:49.128 --> 06:38:49.138 align:start position:0%
system and that's a question for the
 
06:38:50.628 --> 06:38:50.638 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
06:38:52.368 --> 06:38:52.378 align:start position:0%
not for me
 
06:38:55.208 --> 06:38:55.218 align:start position:0%
um but I I think
 
06:38:59.270 --> 06:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
reimagining our how dsps are paid
 
06:39:01.970 --> 06:39:01.980 align:start position:0%
for and valued for the work that they do
 
06:39:06.170 --> 06:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
would really help attract people to
 
06:39:08.750 --> 06:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
um to our Workforce and again without
 
06:39:11.510 --> 06:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
support some people can't get out of bed
 
06:39:14.510 --> 06:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
some people can't drive to work right
 
06:39:17.090 --> 06:39:17.100 align:start position:0%
they don't have transportation to work
 
06:39:20.208 --> 06:39:20.218 align:start position:0%
um and so they want to be contributing
 
06:39:22.430 --> 06:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
in participatory members of our society
 
06:39:25.250 --> 06:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
but because they need a support person
 
06:39:27.288 --> 06:39:27.298 align:start position:0%
to help them through some of their
 
06:39:30.288 --> 06:39:30.298 align:start position:0%
personal challenges they can't be all
 
06:39:33.170 --> 06:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
that they can be and I and I think that
 
06:39:36.410 --> 06:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
this issue is going to again it's going
 
06:39:39.110 --> 06:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
to be a little longer term than some of
 
06:39:40.788 --> 06:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
the other Workforce challenges that
 
06:39:40.798 --> 06:39:41.868 align:start position:0%
the other Workforce challenges that
exist

06:39:41.868 --> 06:39:41.878 align:start position:0%
exist
 
06:39:43.670 --> 06:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
good thank you thank you for what you do
 
06:39:46.070 --> 06:39:46.080 align:start position:0%

budget
 
06:40:44.330 --> 06:40:44.340 align:start position:0%
we look at our proposed annual budget
 
06:40:46.190 --> 06:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
for the next two years it's
 
06:40:48.110 --> 06:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
approximately 40 million dollars just
 
06:40:51.948 --> 06:40:51.958 align:start position:0%

million Estate General funds
 
06:40:57.530 --> 06:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
we break down those numbers about 88 of
 
06:41:00.310 --> 06:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
our budget goes to Personnel costs
 
06:41:03.110 --> 06:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
utilities contracted services to
 
06:41:05.990 --> 06:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
maintain our infrastructure
 
06:41:07.310 --> 06:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
when you look at page three of Our
 
06:41:09.830 --> 06:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
Testimony you'll see the significant
 
06:41:11.750 --> 06:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
differences from our past operating
 
06:41:13.910 --> 06:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
budget to the current operating budget
 
06:41:15.590 --> 06:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
there's six uh six items I'd like to
 
06:41:17.270 --> 06:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
highlight first and foremost funding
 
06:41:20.448 --> 06:41:20.458 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget is um we abolished 35
 
06:41:24.048 --> 06:41:24.058 align:start position:0%
State positions we are we manned the
 
06:41:26.390 --> 06:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
peace fire department and we converted
 
06:41:28.368 --> 06:41:28.378 align:start position:0%
those positions to Title Five Federal
 
06:41:30.650 --> 06:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
civilians because of a change in
 
06:41:33.170 --> 06:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
admission so that reduced our state
 
06:41:37.730 --> 06:41:37.740 align:start position:0%
Personnel from 163 to 128 positions
 
06:41:40.368 --> 06:41:40.378 align:start position:0%
let me look at item number two you will
 
06:41:42.048 --> 06:41:42.058 align:start position:0%
see what we have forecasted for
 
06:41:45.230 --> 06:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
anticipated incremental increases in our
 
06:41:47.330 --> 06:41:47.340 align:start position:0%
utility costs
 
06:41:48.890 --> 06:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
for the significant amount of inventory
 
06:41:50.090 --> 06:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
we have both on the Army International
 
06:41:50.100 --> 06:41:51.708 align:start position:0%
we have both on the Army International
Guard

06:41:51.708 --> 06:41:51.718 align:start position:0%
Guard
 
06:41:53.990 --> 06:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
you look items three through five they
 
06:41:55.970 --> 06:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
are all 100 fairly reimbursed where we
 
06:41:58.430 --> 06:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
have changes of purpose or mission for
 
06:41:59.868 --> 06:41:59.878 align:start position:0%
example over time additional overtime
 
06:42:02.270 --> 06:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
costs by having a personal State
 
06:42:04.250 --> 06:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
maintenance Personnel on call for
 
06:42:06.590 --> 06:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
overtime to maintain our infrastructure
 
06:42:08.690 --> 06:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
and a new program we're standing up
 
06:42:11.150 --> 06:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
called Starbase which is a fifth grade
 
06:42:13.250 --> 06:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
youth-based stem program which will be
 
06:42:14.990 --> 06:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
housing in Pembroke
 
06:42:17.208 --> 06:42:17.218 align:start position:0%
item number five talks about contracted
 
06:42:19.010 --> 06:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
Services where we had an exception to
 
06:42:22.010 --> 06:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
policy to use 100 federal funds uh
 
06:42:24.110 --> 06:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
sustaining some of our infrastructure
 
06:42:26.030 --> 06:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
and ultimately number six is workers
 
06:42:26.040 --> 06:42:27.788 align:start position:0%
and ultimately number six is workers
compensation

06:42:27.788 --> 06:42:27.798 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
06:42:32.270 --> 06:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:33.410 --> 06:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:42:33.420 --> 06:42:34.128 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

06:42:34.128 --> 06:42:34.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:42:37.010 --> 06:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
nationally the military and National
 
06:42:39.410 --> 06:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
Guards throughout the country have been
 
06:42:41.750 --> 06:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
suffering significant shortfalls in
 
06:42:43.850 --> 06:42:43.860 align:start position:0%
recruiting I wonder if you could expand
 
06:42:46.070 --> 06:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
upon that and how that's affected New
 
06:42:47.990 --> 06:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and your operations here and
 
06:42:50.448 --> 06:42:50.458 align:start position:0%
where you are as far as your need to
 
06:42:50.458 --> 06:42:51.670 align:start position:0%
where you are as far as your need to
recruit

06:42:51.670 --> 06:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
recruit
 
06:42:54.530 --> 06:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
New National Guardsmen so the number one
 
06:42:55.970 --> 06:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
strategic challenge for the New
 
06:42:58.128 --> 06:42:58.138 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Army National Guard not the
 
06:42:59.868 --> 06:42:59.878 align:start position:0%
heir is the ability for us to fulfill
 
06:43:01.730 --> 06:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
our formations
 
06:43:03.770 --> 06:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
um last fiscal year Federal fiscal year
 
06:43:07.490 --> 06:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
22 was the worst recruiting year on
 
06:43:09.890 --> 06:43:09.900 align:start position:0%
records at the end of the draft in 1972
 
06:43:12.410 --> 06:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
for the Army both active National Guard
 
06:43:14.510 --> 06:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
and the reserve component the active
 
06:43:17.330 --> 06:43:17.340 align:start position:0%
duty Mr and strength by over 20 000
 
06:43:19.250 --> 06:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
personnel which equates to an army
 
06:43:19.260 --> 06:43:20.390 align:start position:0%
personnel which equates to an army
division

06:43:20.390 --> 06:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
division
 
06:43:21.650 --> 06:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Army National
 
06:43:23.510 --> 06:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
Guard it's a double-edged sword we're
 
06:43:24.948 --> 06:43:24.958 align:start position:0%
trying to grow our formations from
 
06:43:27.650 --> 06:43:27.660 align:start position:0%
approximately 16 to 1700 unit Personnel
 
06:43:29.990 --> 06:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
to 1800 and we currently have over 200
 
06:43:30.000 --> 06:43:31.788 align:start position:0%
to 1800 and we currently have over 200
vacancies

06:43:31.788 --> 06:43:31.798 align:start position:0%
vacancies
 
06:43:34.030 --> 06:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
um we failed at our recruiting Mission
 
06:43:38.810 --> 06:43:38.820 align:start position:0%
uh by about 35 so in any given month we
 
06:43:40.670 --> 06:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
need to assess approximately 20 service
 
06:43:42.708 --> 06:43:42.718 align:start position:0%
members until the Army National Guard to
 
06:43:44.208 --> 06:43:44.218 align:start position:0%
replace our losses
 
06:43:46.850 --> 06:43:46.860 align:start position:0%
and uh October of the last fiscal year
 
06:43:49.070 --> 06:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
we assessed three
 
06:43:52.010 --> 06:43:52.020 align:start position:0%
now we improved so we assessed about 150
 
06:43:54.470 --> 06:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
ish when we needed about 240. so we
 
06:43:55.970 --> 06:43:55.980 align:start position:0%
missed our Mark by almost 100 percent
 
06:43:58.128 --> 06:43:58.138 align:start position:0%
off of the army side so we're barely
 
06:44:00.048 --> 06:44:00.058 align:start position:0%
we're not even covering our losses on
 
06:44:01.250 --> 06:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
the International Guard it's a different
 
06:44:02.810 --> 06:44:02.820 align:start position:0%
Trend it's a it's a it's a different
 
06:44:06.170 --> 06:44:06.180 align:start position:0%
Market our Air National Guard is fourth
 
06:44:08.150 --> 06:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
in a nation in their entry they're 101
 
06:44:10.910 --> 06:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
percent filled uh the Army were at 92
 
06:44:10.920 --> 06:44:11.868 align:start position:0%
percent filled uh the Army were at 92
percent

06:44:11.868 --> 06:44:11.878 align:start position:0%
percent
 
06:44:14.990 --> 06:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
it is a significant significant uh issue
 
06:44:18.530 --> 06:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
because only 23 percent of today's youth
 
06:44:19.970 --> 06:44:19.980 align:start position:0%
are eligible to serve in the military
 
06:44:21.830 --> 06:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
the number one reason is childhood
 
06:44:23.810 --> 06:44:23.820 align:start position:0%
obesity followed by the lack of
 
06:44:26.090 --> 06:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
propensity to serve uh prescription
 
06:44:27.890 --> 06:44:27.900 align:start position:0%
medications a lack of a high school
 
06:44:29.030 --> 06:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
they're great
 
06:44:31.730 --> 06:44:31.740 align:start position:0%
um the market is not good
 
06:44:33.770 --> 06:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
is there anything the state can do to
 
06:44:35.570 --> 06:44:35.580 align:start position:0%
help alleviate that problem or is this
 
06:44:38.390 --> 06:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
more of a a national problem I mean
 
06:44:40.070 --> 06:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
maybe even marginally to the state could
 
06:44:40.080 --> 06:44:41.350 align:start position:0%
maybe even marginally to the state could
help

06:44:41.350 --> 06:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
help
 
06:44:43.610 --> 06:44:43.620 align:start position:0%
as far as as far as when I'm talking
 
06:44:45.830 --> 06:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
about specifically Financial Resources I
 
06:44:47.990 --> 06:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
think the financial resources that could
 
06:44:49.490 --> 06:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
be beneficial to us is help with
 
06:44:51.770 --> 06:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
International State marketing campaign
 
06:44:53.448 --> 06:44:53.458 align:start position:0%
um we've had exceptional partners with
 
06:44:54.770 --> 06:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
the Community College systems of New
 
06:44:56.868 --> 06:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the university system of
 
06:44:58.910 --> 06:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so for example last year
 
06:45:02.868 --> 06:45:02.878 align:start position:0%
you know one of the biggest benefits uh
 
06:45:04.250 --> 06:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
Beyond just service to your state in
 
06:45:05.868 --> 06:45:05.878 align:start position:0%
your nation is the education benefits
 
06:45:07.310 --> 06:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
with the National Guard have to offer
 
06:45:10.070 --> 06:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
and that benefit is a 100 tuition waiver
 
06:45:12.708 --> 06:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
and any State University so we can't get
 
06:45:14.448 --> 06:45:14.458 align:start position:0%
people in the door we want to retain
 
06:45:17.390 --> 06:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
them from leaving service and so if a
 
06:45:19.310 --> 06:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
soldier or service member re-enlists
 
06:45:21.650 --> 06:45:21.660 align:start position:0%
Beyond his initial six-year obligation
 
06:45:24.048 --> 06:45:24.058 align:start position:0%
he can now transfer that tuition waiver
 
06:45:26.690 --> 06:45:26.700 align:start position:0%
benefit to his spouse
 
06:45:28.128 --> 06:45:28.138 align:start position:0%
so we want to entertain that family
 
06:45:30.110 --> 06:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
member so she she he or she can
 
06:45:31.250 --> 06:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
encourage that service member to
 
06:45:32.810 --> 06:45:32.820 align:start position:0%
continue to serve
 
06:45:34.070 --> 06:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
um the University of Simpson Community
 
06:45:35.510 --> 06:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
College systems have been exceptional in
 
06:45:37.128 --> 06:45:37.138 align:start position:0%
their support of us
 
06:45:38.810 --> 06:45:38.820 align:start position:0%
um I think it's just the ability to for
 
06:45:40.970 --> 06:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
us to get into schools
 
06:45:44.390 --> 06:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
tell this next Generation the values in
 
06:45:46.910 --> 06:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
virtue of military service and what it
 
06:45:49.010 --> 06:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
can mean and how they can make a
 
06:45:51.288 --> 06:45:51.298 align:start position:0%
difference for this generation Z and uh
 
06:45:54.410 --> 06:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:57.288 --> 06:45:57.298 align:start position:0%
so if I could if I could add uh we also
 
06:45:58.850 --> 06:45:58.860 align:start position:0%
instituted in the last legislative
 
06:46:00.470 --> 06:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
session a program called the enlistment
 
06:46:02.868 --> 06:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
incentive program whereby we give
 
06:46:05.090 --> 06:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
currents currently serving members or
 
06:46:07.430 --> 06:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
former members of the National Guard a
 
06:46:11.150 --> 06:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
500 uh incentive payment if they refer
 
06:46:12.830 --> 06:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
somebody who ships or who actually
 
06:46:15.288 --> 06:46:15.298 align:start position:0%
departs to go to basic training uh basic
 
06:46:17.150 --> 06:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
combat training this year's legislative
 
06:46:20.230 --> 06:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
session we've asked uh uh some
 
06:46:22.850 --> 06:46:22.860 align:start position:0%
representative to sponsor legislation to
 
06:46:25.430 --> 06:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
increase that from a 500 payment to a
 
06:46:27.708 --> 06:46:27.718 align:start position:0%
one thousand dollar payment and we've
 
06:46:29.150 --> 06:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
increased the budget line from that from
 
06:46:30.830 --> 06:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand dollars to fifty
 
06:46:32.208 --> 06:46:32.218 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in this particular
 
06:46:35.448 --> 06:46:35.458 align:start position:0%
budget so that gets us 50 incentive
 
06:46:37.548 --> 06:46:37.558 align:start position:0%
payments which is about a third of what
 
06:46:38.930 --> 06:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
we want to go we would certainly
 
06:46:42.230 --> 06:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
favorably accept you know if you wanted
 
06:46:45.230 --> 06:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
to increase that above what we could do
 
06:46:47.708 --> 06:46:47.718 align:start position:0%
in our Target
 
06:46:49.968 --> 06:46:49.978 align:start position:0%

different ways you can thank military
 
06:47:05.150 --> 06:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
for the service and the budget is one of
 
06:47:05.160 --> 06:47:06.048 align:start position:0%
for the service and the budget is one of
them

06:47:06.048 --> 06:47:06.058 align:start position:0%

responsibilities and our audit team
 
06:50:52.788 --> 06:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
the department has very little in the
 
06:50:55.490 --> 06:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
way of General funds about 50 percent is
 
06:50:57.590 --> 06:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
federal funds with utility assessment
 
06:50:59.448 --> 06:50:59.458 align:start position:0%

percent

06:51:00.590 --> 06:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
percent
 
06:51:02.868 --> 06:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
of that about 83 percent of the agency's
 
06:51:05.090 --> 06:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
budget are passed through grants
 
06:51:07.548 --> 06:51:07.558 align:start position:0%
examples would be Reggie
 
06:51:10.128 --> 06:51:10.138 align:start position:0%
um and the renewable energy fund
 
06:51:11.330 --> 06:51:11.340 align:start position:0%
since the creation of the department
 
06:51:13.070 --> 06:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
we've worked hard to find operational
 
06:51:15.288 --> 06:51:15.298 align:start position:0%
and administrative efficiencies
 
06:51:17.448 --> 06:51:17.458 align:start position:0%
the department of energy is proposing a
 
06:51:23.230 --> 06:51:23.240 align:start position:0%
1.3 percent decrease in FY 24.
 
06:51:26.090 --> 06:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
overall for fiscal year 23 the
 
06:51:28.368 --> 06:51:28.378 align:start position:0%
department of energy has 78 positions
 
06:51:30.530 --> 06:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
and this proposal
 
06:51:33.350 --> 06:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
including priority prioritized needs our
 
06:51:36.590 --> 06:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
position count would be 73. this is the
 
06:51:38.330 --> 06:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
result of the reduction of seven
 
06:51:40.548 --> 06:51:40.558 align:start position:0%
positions the conversion of a full-time
 
06:51:43.010 --> 06:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
temporary position in the department and
 
06:51:45.170 --> 06:51:45.180 align:start position:0%
the transfer of one position from the
 
06:51:48.708 --> 06:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
puc to the doe and as you'll notice one
 
06:51:50.628 --> 06:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
of our prioritized needs
 
06:51:52.610 --> 06:51:52.620 align:start position:0%
uh is indeed that conversion of a
 
06:51:54.410 --> 06:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
full-time temporary position I'd like to
 
06:51:56.510 --> 06:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
just go into a little bit of detail on
 
06:51:56.520 --> 06:51:57.650 align:start position:0%
just go into a little bit of detail on
that

06:51:57.650 --> 06:51:57.660 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:51:59.570 --> 06:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
um this position is a program specialist
 
06:52:01.548 --> 06:52:01.558 align:start position:0%
for our weatherization assistance
 
06:52:01.558 --> 06:52:02.930 align:start position:0%
for our weatherization assistance
program

06:52:02.930 --> 06:52:02.940 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:52:04.310 --> 06:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
um for many years the program is
 
06:52:07.250 --> 06:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
operated with only one employee a
 
06:52:09.230 --> 06:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
situation that is unique as far as we
 
06:52:10.250 --> 06:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
are aware
 
06:52:12.230 --> 06:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
we have intended to request this
 
06:52:14.750 --> 06:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
position even before passage of the
 
06:52:16.910 --> 06:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure investment and jobs act
 
06:52:19.670 --> 06:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
necessity necessitated it the the
 
06:52:21.830 --> 06:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
problem is not simply that we have more
 
06:52:24.708 --> 06:52:24.718 align:start position:0%
money to manage the passage of federal
 
06:52:26.930 --> 06:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
legislation has made a number of changes
 
06:52:28.788 --> 06:52:28.798 align:start position:0%
that have significantly significantly
 
06:52:32.708 --> 06:52:32.718 align:start position:0%
increased requirements for compliance
 
06:52:35.990 --> 06:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
reporting and administration the new
 
06:52:37.788 --> 06:52:37.798 align:start position:0%
funding in this legislation is temporary
 
06:52:39.530 --> 06:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
but the programmatic changes are
 
06:52:39.540 --> 06:52:40.910 align:start position:0%
but the programmatic changes are
permanent

06:52:40.910 --> 06:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
permanent
 
06:52:42.890 --> 06:52:42.900 align:start position:0%
the changes have made what was already a
 
06:52:44.990 --> 06:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
burden program impossible to administer
 
06:52:47.868 --> 06:52:47.878 align:start position:0%
with only one person we have added a
 
06:52:49.368 --> 06:52:49.378 align:start position:0%
federally funded full-time temporary
 
06:52:52.010 --> 06:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
position uh and we propose to make that
 
06:52:54.590 --> 06:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
a permanent position
 
06:52:57.110 --> 06:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
so with that we'd be happy to take any
 
06:53:00.590 --> 06:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:03.310 --> 06:53:03.320 align:start position:0%
sure I'm gonna Begin by asking you to
 
06:53:05.510 --> 06:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
answer probably an impossible question
 
06:53:10.128 --> 06:53:10.138 align:start position:0%
but with the spike in energy rates
 
06:53:12.830 --> 06:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I realized that they're
 
06:53:16.610 --> 06:53:16.620 align:start position:0%
caused by many different in factors but
 
06:53:19.788 --> 06:53:19.798 align:start position:0%
uh what what are your projections as far
 
06:53:21.890 --> 06:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
as how long the spike is going to last
 
06:53:25.190 --> 06:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
and when we receive relief
 
06:53:29.390 --> 06:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
absence Russia pulling out of Ukraine
 
06:53:30.770 --> 06:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
06:53:33.230 --> 06:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
um the the it's it's hard to make that
 
06:53:33.240 --> 06:53:34.548 align:start position:0%
um the the it's it's hard to make that
prediction

06:53:34.548 --> 06:53:34.558 align:start position:0%
prediction
 
06:53:37.250 --> 06:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
um you know I think everyone expects the
 
06:53:39.170 --> 06:53:39.180 align:start position:0%
global market for liquefied natural gas
 
06:53:40.910 --> 06:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
to remain High
 
06:53:40.920 --> 06:53:41.570 align:start position:0%
to remain High
um

06:53:41.570 --> 06:53:41.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:53:43.968 --> 06:53:43.978 align:start position:0%
you know there are other factors beyond
 
06:53:46.850 --> 06:53:46.860 align:start position:0%
the war in Ukraine we are constrained
 
06:53:49.850 --> 06:53:49.860 align:start position:0%
when it comes to uh natural gas pipeline
 
06:53:51.350 --> 06:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
capacity into the region so there's
 
06:53:53.930 --> 06:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
there's a whole number of factors and it
 
06:53:55.548 --> 06:53:55.558 align:start position:0%
would be hard for me to uh I wouldn't
 
06:53:57.468 --> 06:53:57.478 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable making a projection of
 
06:53:59.690 --> 06:53:59.700 align:start position:0%
what it might look like a year from now
 
06:53:59.700 --> 06:54:00.410 align:start position:0%
what it might look like a year from now
um

06:54:00.410 --> 06:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:54:02.330 --> 06:54:02.340 align:start position:0%
our hope is that we're in a different
 
06:54:02.340 --> 06:54:03.890 align:start position:0%
our hope is that we're in a different
situation

06:54:03.890 --> 06:54:03.900 align:start position:0%
situation
 
06:54:07.628 --> 06:54:07.638 align:start position:0%
um and and prices are lower but
 
06:54:10.670 --> 06:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
Ukraine does play a very uh large part
 
06:54:13.670 --> 06:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
in this right because why why that's
 
06:54:15.410 --> 06:54:15.420 align:start position:0%
obviously important I agree that I I
 
06:54:17.030 --> 06:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
don't have an answer and I'm not sure I
 
06:54:19.570 --> 06:54:19.580 align:start position:0%
haven't seen anyone else who does but
 
06:54:22.430 --> 06:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
most every agency that comes in one of
 
06:54:24.468 --> 06:54:24.478 align:start position:0%
the things that they're concerned about
 
06:54:26.570 --> 06:54:26.580 align:start position:0%
are the their energy costs when you're
 
06:54:29.208 --> 06:54:29.218 align:start position:0%
driving it so if there was any answer or
 
06:54:31.010 --> 06:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
any relief in sight before the end of
 
06:54:33.410 --> 06:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 that would be wonderful
 
06:54:36.230 --> 06:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
to see it would be amen what are the
 
06:54:38.930 --> 06:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
major uh challenges I mean I realize
 
06:54:40.430 --> 06:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
you're a new agency and you came on at
 
06:54:42.170 --> 06:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
the exact wrong time or maybe the exact
 
06:54:45.770 --> 06:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
right time given the uh the turmoil
 
06:54:48.948 --> 06:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
we're in but obviously prices have
 
06:54:51.708 --> 06:54:51.718 align:start position:0%
spiked what are the challenge for you as
 
06:54:55.670 --> 06:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
an agency for that and how can the state
 
06:54:58.850 --> 06:54:58.860 align:start position:0%
help you meet those challenges
 
06:54:58.860 --> 06:55:00.110 align:start position:0%
help you meet those challenges
well

06:55:00.110 --> 06:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:55:00.120 --> 06:55:01.610 align:start position:0%
well
um I

06:55:01.610 --> 06:55:01.620 align:start position:0%
um I
 
06:55:03.948 --> 06:55:03.958 align:start position:0%
we've seen a number on the Staffing side
 
06:55:06.708 --> 06:55:06.718 align:start position:0%
we've seen a number of retirements in in
 
06:55:07.968 --> 06:55:07.978 align:start position:0%
the last year
 
06:55:09.948 --> 06:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
um it's difficult to recruit in this
 
06:55:11.930 --> 06:55:11.940 align:start position:0%
environment and I think
 
06:55:13.968 --> 06:55:13.978 align:start position:0%
um an agency such as ours and the
 
06:55:16.190 --> 06:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
important work that we do
 
06:55:16.200 --> 06:55:17.390 align:start position:0%
important work that we do
um

06:55:17.390 --> 06:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:55:19.190 --> 06:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
having experienced staff being able to
 
06:55:19.200 --> 06:55:20.270 align:start position:0%
having experienced staff being able to
recruit

06:55:20.270 --> 06:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
recruit
 
06:55:21.770 --> 06:55:21.780 align:start position:0%
um individuals with the experience
 
06:55:25.850 --> 06:55:25.860 align:start position:0%
needed to be fully staffed with the
 
06:55:27.830 --> 06:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
expertise that we need
 
06:55:30.770 --> 06:55:30.780 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful but that challenge
 
06:55:32.510 --> 06:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
is we've had a number of positions that
 
06:55:34.990 --> 06:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
we just continue to post and repost
 
06:55:38.030 --> 06:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
those openings and very little success
 
06:55:41.570 --> 06:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
in in filling those positions so as a
 
06:55:43.250 --> 06:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
new agency with everything that's
 
06:55:46.788 --> 06:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
happening in um in the world of energy
 
06:55:50.150 --> 06:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
um having a full team would be very
 
06:55:53.208 --> 06:55:53.218 align:start position:0%
helpful and beneficial to the state
 
06:55:53.218 --> 06:55:54.170 align:start position:0%
helpful and beneficial to the state
um

06:55:54.170 --> 06:55:54.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:55:57.350 --> 06:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
what type of uh individual you're
 
06:56:00.770 --> 06:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
recruiting for right so utility analysts
 
06:56:00.780 --> 06:56:01.490 align:start position:0%
recruiting for right so utility analysts
um

06:56:01.490 --> 06:56:01.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:56:01.500 --> 06:56:03.830 align:start position:0%
um
attorneys

06:56:03.830 --> 06:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
06:56:05.628 --> 06:56:05.638 align:start position:0%
um those are two that come to mind as
 
06:56:05.638 --> 06:56:07.610 align:start position:0%
um those are two that come to mind as
critical

06:56:07.610 --> 06:56:07.620 align:start position:0%
critical
 
06:56:09.410 --> 06:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
and it's difficult to compete with the
 
06:56:10.788 --> 06:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
private sector
 
06:56:12.948 --> 06:56:12.958 align:start position:0%
um and even with utilities
 
06:56:12.958 --> 06:56:14.090 align:start position:0%
um and even with utilities
um

06:56:14.090 --> 06:56:14.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:56:16.910 --> 06:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
for those for those individuals
 
06:56:20.810 --> 06:56:20.820 align:start position:0%
having worked at the dra and trying to
 
06:56:23.930 --> 06:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
recruit a utility analyst for for them
 
06:56:25.368 --> 06:56:25.378 align:start position:0%
even though it was more of an appraiser
 
06:56:27.650 --> 06:56:27.660 align:start position:0%
but just we would take anyone who could
 
06:56:29.448 --> 06:56:29.458 align:start position:0%
analyze a balance sheet on utility it
 
06:56:32.270 --> 06:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
was impossible to fund no it's difficult
 
06:56:34.548 --> 06:56:34.558 align:start position:0%
if you find a pool of those people
 
06:56:36.968 --> 06:56:36.978 align:start position:0%
please let me know
 
06:56:40.310 --> 06:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you do that
 
06:56:44.690 --> 06:56:44.700 align:start position:0%
on on labor challenges um
 
06:56:46.548 --> 06:56:46.558 align:start position:0%
its salary
 
06:56:49.368 --> 06:56:49.378 align:start position:0%
or it's the works it's a salary I think
 
06:56:51.708 --> 06:56:51.718 align:start position:0%
is I mean I I understand that to compete
 
06:56:53.868 --> 06:56:53.878 align:start position:0%
with utilities who you know like defense
 
06:56:56.270 --> 06:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
contractors and whoever else don't pay
 
06:56:59.750 --> 06:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
by the normal human standards
 
06:57:01.788 --> 06:57:01.798 align:start position:0%
um they're not constrained by the laws
 
06:57:03.288 --> 06:57:03.298 align:start position:0%
of Economics but
 
06:57:03.298 --> 06:57:04.128 align:start position:0%
of Economics but
um

06:57:04.128 --> 06:57:04.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:57:06.110 --> 06:57:06.120 align:start position:0%
it is salary I mean we as you know
 
06:57:08.150 --> 06:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
agencies we can offer
 
06:57:08.160 --> 06:57:08.868 align:start position:0%
agencies we can offer
um

06:57:08.868 --> 06:57:08.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:57:11.330 --> 06:57:11.340 align:start position:0%
a quality of life that may not be
 
06:57:13.070 --> 06:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
available in the private sector
 
06:57:16.010 --> 06:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
um but uh beyond that it really is the
 
06:57:19.128 --> 06:57:19.138 align:start position:0%
challenge with with salaries
 
06:57:27.708 --> 06:57:27.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:30.048 --> 06:57:30.058 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to commit to an exact uh
 
06:57:32.990 --> 06:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
number but it's a bit of a crap shoot
 
06:57:36.288 --> 06:57:36.298 align:start position:0%
anyway but I said like is it like five
 
06:57:40.430 --> 06:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
percent ten percent or like 50. yeah
 
06:57:42.770 --> 06:57:42.780 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't say 50 but but it would be
 
06:57:45.530 --> 06:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
probably in the range of you know 25 to
 
06:57:49.128 --> 06:57:49.138 align:start position:0%
35 and I'm there's others on my team who
 
06:57:50.150 --> 06:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
could probably answer that question
 
06:57:52.670 --> 06:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
better than I but I would say it's it's
 
06:57:54.350 --> 06:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
probably in that range
 
06:57:57.350 --> 06:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
do you find that um you had a lot of
 
06:57:58.910 --> 06:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
retirements I mean and a lot of people
 
06:58:00.468 --> 06:58:00.478 align:start position:0%
did so I'm not
 
06:58:06.048 --> 06:58:06.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:09.650 --> 06:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
anything related to the turmoil is the
 
06:58:11.030 --> 06:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
wrong word but
 
06:58:11.040 --> 06:58:12.048 align:start position:0%
wrong word but
um

06:58:12.048 --> 06:58:12.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:58:14.390 --> 06:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
people don't like change
 
06:58:16.368 --> 06:58:16.378 align:start position:0%
um I haven't we lost an employee at some
 
06:58:17.990 --> 06:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
point because um
 
06:58:19.670 --> 06:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
person was worried that we might
 
06:58:19.680 --> 06:58:21.048 align:start position:0%
person was worried that we might
renovate

06:58:21.048 --> 06:58:21.058 align:start position:0%
renovate
 
06:58:22.968 --> 06:58:22.978 align:start position:0%
and in fact we're going to the building
 
06:58:24.650 --> 06:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
that we're in and you know God forbid we
 
06:58:25.968 --> 06:58:25.978 align:start position:0%
should get rid of some of the Asbestos
 
06:58:29.810 --> 06:58:29.820 align:start position:0%
and um but it was it sounds silly right
 
06:58:32.750 --> 06:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
but it was it was like I I'm nervous
 
06:58:34.430 --> 06:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
about that so I'm gonna leave
 
06:58:37.730 --> 06:58:37.740 align:start position:0%
and you're a new agency and you know the
 
06:58:37.740 --> 06:58:38.810 align:start position:0%
and you're a new agency and you know the
the

06:58:38.810 --> 06:58:38.820 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:58:41.690 --> 06:58:41.700 align:start position:0%
you know the old the old PNC if you will
 
06:58:43.910 --> 06:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
which is I know that's not exactly what
 
06:58:46.788 --> 06:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
happens you're not just the new puc but
 
06:58:49.070 --> 06:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
um there were people who that was a way
 
06:58:52.010 --> 06:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
of life almost and uh and that's turmoil
 
06:58:53.868 --> 06:58:53.878 align:start position:0%
did you have a is some of it
 
06:58:55.548 --> 06:58:55.558 align:start position:0%
attributable to that or do you think not
 
06:58:55.558 --> 06:58:56.530 align:start position:0%
attributable to that or do you think not
really

06:58:56.530 --> 06:58:56.540 align:start position:0%
really
 
06:58:59.570 --> 06:58:59.580 align:start position:0%
maybe a very small part of it uh you
 
06:59:01.490 --> 06:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
know we've really the leadership at the
 
06:59:04.368 --> 06:59:04.378 align:start position:0%
agency we really strive to make uh what
 
06:59:06.948 --> 06:59:06.958 align:start position:0%
can be a difficult transition
 
06:59:09.230 --> 06:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
um as smooth as possible we try to
 
06:59:11.270 --> 06:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
create a very positive environment
 
06:59:13.850 --> 06:59:13.860 align:start position:0%
um and you have a lot of continuity yes
 
06:59:15.770 --> 06:59:15.780 align:start position:0%
we do and we we still have a number of
 
06:59:17.208 --> 06:59:17.218 align:start position:0%
employees that have been at the
 
06:59:19.128 --> 06:59:19.138 align:start position:0%
department for many years we're at the
 
06:59:20.270 --> 06:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission for many
 
06:59:22.548 --> 06:59:22.558 align:start position:0%
years and they they remain
 
06:59:24.530 --> 06:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
um so we've had some of that um
 
06:59:26.930 --> 06:59:26.940 align:start position:0%
continuity and just trying to build an
 
06:59:30.310 --> 06:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:33.530 --> 06:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
they left before Lenny came right
 
06:59:35.770 --> 06:59:35.780 align:start position:0%
yes no
 
06:59:40.010 --> 06:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:47.510 --> 06:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:49.548 --> 06:59:49.558 align:start position:0%
and next up we'd like to invite the
 
07:00:01.070 --> 07:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:01.080 --> 07:00:05.650 align:start position:0%

the Public Utilities Commission has
 
07:00:25.310 --> 07:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
vested with the with General

um
 
07:00:52.788 --> 07:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
the only thing I'll add I might be the
 
07:00:54.350 --> 07:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
briefest one that I've heard so far in
 
07:00:57.110 --> 07:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
the last hour is that if you look at our
 
07:00:59.510 --> 07:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
total headcount as commissioner chicoine
 
07:00:59.520 --> 07:01:00.948 align:start position:0%
total headcount as commissioner chicoine
highlighted

07:01:00.948 --> 07:01:00.958 align:start position:0%
highlighted
 
07:01:04.968 --> 07:01:04.978 align:start position:0%
we're currently at 17 people going to 16
 
07:01:06.650 --> 07:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
with a transfer to the Department of
 
07:01:09.190 --> 07:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
energy we currently have two vacancies
 
07:01:12.890 --> 07:01:12.900 align:start position:0%
one for a senior advisor which is um
 
07:01:15.948 --> 07:01:15.958 align:start position:0%
which can be either an attorney or an
 
07:01:17.570 --> 07:01:17.580 align:start position:0%
analyst and then we have an
 
07:01:22.070 --> 07:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
administrative position as well and um
 
07:01:23.570 --> 07:01:23.580 align:start position:0%
so I'll just pause there and see if
 
07:01:26.030 --> 07:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
there's any questions
 
07:01:28.190 --> 07:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
yeah if you could talk about what your
 
07:01:30.410 --> 07:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
source of income is in
 
07:01:33.590 --> 07:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
we got it from and the
 
07:01:35.868 --> 07:01:35.878 align:start position:0%
um going forward so we're yeah we're
 
07:01:37.310 --> 07:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
collecting correct me if I get this
 
07:01:38.930 --> 07:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
wrong but we're funded by the utilities
 
07:01:41.570 --> 07:01:41.580 align:start position:0%
directly so with no General funds right
 
07:01:43.730 --> 07:01:43.740 align:start position:0%
but but how is that is it what's that
 
07:01:45.288 --> 07:01:45.298 align:start position:0%
based off of
 
07:01:48.650 --> 07:01:48.660 align:start position:0%
you want me yes please
 
07:01:50.990 --> 07:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
um the department of energy we um
 
07:01:53.390 --> 07:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
we manage the assessment process that we
 
07:01:56.810 --> 07:01:56.820 align:start position:0%
assess the utilities and it's uh in part
 
07:01:59.448 --> 07:01:59.458 align:start position:0%
with um the money that we spent in the
 
07:02:02.330 --> 07:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
previous fiscal year which was FY 22 and
 
07:02:03.890 --> 07:02:03.900 align:start position:0%
then uh the projection for what we'll
 
07:02:07.070 --> 07:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
spend in FY 23 and then any credits of
 
07:02:09.350 --> 07:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
what we over collected for 22 compared
 
07:02:12.230 --> 07:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
to actual expenses and then there's
 
07:02:13.968 --> 07:02:13.978 align:start position:0%
um the law breaks it down on there's
 
07:02:16.548 --> 07:02:16.558 align:start position:0%
some some utilities get that get charged
 
07:02:18.708 --> 07:02:18.718 align:start position:0%
a flat rate of say ten thousand dollars
 
07:02:20.628 --> 07:02:20.638 align:start position:0%
and there's some utilities that get a
 
07:02:22.548 --> 07:02:22.558 align:start position:0%
percentage based off their their total
 
07:02:24.708 --> 07:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
revenues and some like with only we only
 
07:02:26.570 --> 07:02:26.580 align:start position:0%
take into account 33 percent of the
 
07:02:29.270 --> 07:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
revenues that's all calculated and then
 
07:02:29.280 --> 07:02:31.010 align:start position:0%
revenues that's all calculated and then
uh

07:02:31.010 --> 07:02:31.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:02:33.288 --> 07:02:33.298 align:start position:0%
um based on all four or three of the
 
07:02:36.170 --> 07:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
agencies budgets and then um we collect
 
07:02:37.368 --> 07:02:37.378 align:start position:0%
the money in and then we transfer the
 
07:02:39.590 --> 07:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
revenue to those the other two agencies
 
07:02:41.090 --> 07:02:41.100 align:start position:0%
that use that um use a utility
 
07:02:43.190 --> 07:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
assessment okay then we also have um
 
07:02:46.490 --> 07:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
special assessments for um uh for both
 
07:02:48.890 --> 07:02:48.900 align:start position:0%
the OCA and for the Department of energy
 
07:02:51.230 --> 07:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
that's um usually just one time things
 
07:02:52.788 --> 07:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
where there's a certain rate case or
 
07:02:54.350 --> 07:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
something that comes up um that we need
 
07:02:56.510 --> 07:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
Specialists for that we have authority
 
07:02:59.030 --> 07:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
to enter into contracts and just uh
 
07:03:01.010 --> 07:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
create the appropriation that's directly
 
07:03:03.890 --> 07:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
charged to the specific utility
 
07:03:07.490 --> 07:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
okay can they appeal those
 
07:03:07.500 --> 07:03:08.990 align:start position:0%
okay can they appeal those
um

07:03:08.990 --> 07:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:03:10.610 --> 07:03:10.620 align:start position:0%
if you give them a special assessment
 
07:03:13.610 --> 07:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
can they say we disagree and
 
07:03:16.548 --> 07:03:16.558 align:start position:0%
they have said that but um then they
 
07:03:18.948 --> 07:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
paid yeah I I haven't seen anything
 
07:03:21.530 --> 07:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
where there's um I'd have to review the
 
07:03:23.390 --> 07:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
the statute specifically but I don't
 
07:03:26.090 --> 07:03:26.100 align:start position:0%
think there's anything that
 
07:03:28.670 --> 07:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
oh here we have we have um the lawyer
 
07:03:29.930 --> 07:03:29.940 align:start position:0%
back there
 
07:03:29.940 --> 07:03:31.368 align:start position:0%
back there
hello

07:03:31.368 --> 07:03:31.378 align:start position:0%

great thank you thank you very much
 
07:03:54.830 --> 07:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
and that's so like in a case like
 
07:03:57.410 --> 07:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
Northern Pass and and or do we not say
 
07:03:58.610 --> 07:03:58.620 align:start position:0%
that anymore
 
07:04:00.708 --> 07:04:00.718 align:start position:0%
um is everyone trying to forget
 
07:04:00.718 --> 07:04:02.030 align:start position:0%
um is everyone trying to forget
um

07:04:02.030 --> 07:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:04:04.430 --> 07:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
it's an enormous amount of work that
 
07:04:06.288 --> 07:04:06.298 align:start position:0%
like destroyed everybody practically
 
07:04:06.298 --> 07:04:07.670 align:start position:0%
like destroyed everybody practically
right

07:04:07.670 --> 07:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:04:07.680 --> 07:04:08.270 align:start position:0%
right
um

07:04:08.270 --> 07:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:04:10.368 --> 07:04:10.378 align:start position:0%
most of our costs are recovered by
 
07:04:14.690 --> 07:04:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:17.150 --> 07:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
for the most part I'm going to look to
 
07:04:17.160 --> 07:04:18.530 align:start position:0%
for the most part I'm going to look to
Laurie

07:04:18.530 --> 07:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
Laurie
 
07:04:18.540 --> 07:04:19.270 align:start position:0%
Laurie
um

07:04:19.270 --> 07:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:04:19.280 --> 07:04:21.850 align:start position:0%
um
yes

07:04:21.850 --> 07:04:21.860 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:04:24.830 --> 07:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
you see those would be directly assess
 
07:04:29.090 --> 07:04:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:29.100 --> 07:04:34.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

07:04:34.990 --> 07:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:37.490 --> 07:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
you're not seeing any uh thank you very
 
07:04:45.788 --> 07:04:45.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:48.048 --> 07:04:48.058 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if I know the opposite of
 
07:04:52.690 --> 07:04:52.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:55.430 --> 07:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
I have served as the consumer Advocate
 
07:04:59.570 --> 07:04:59.580 align:start position:0%
since early 2016 and thus I lead the
 
07:05:01.788 --> 07:05:01.798 align:start position:0%
small and Scrappy state agency of five
 
07:05:03.590 --> 07:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
people that is looking through the
 
07:05:05.448 --> 07:05:05.458 align:start position:0%
current budget process to grow to six
 
07:05:08.150 --> 07:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
and a half people uh as you just heard
 
07:05:10.788 --> 07:05:10.798 align:start position:0%
about the attached agencies we too were
 
07:05:13.548 --> 07:05:13.558 align:start position:0%
paid for by rate payers via the utility
 
07:05:15.590 --> 07:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
assessment process and not the general
 
07:05:18.110 --> 07:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
fund and I can say is the person tasked
 
07:05:19.490 --> 07:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
with representing the interests of
 
07:05:21.770 --> 07:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
residential utility customers that I'm
 
07:05:23.510 --> 07:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
keenly aware that we're paid for
 
07:05:26.150 --> 07:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
directly by the people that we serve and
 
07:05:29.690 --> 07:05:29.700 align:start position:0%
thus we try to spend our or use our
 
07:05:32.510 --> 07:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
resources very wisely so you can look
 
07:05:34.070 --> 07:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
behind me at chairman goldner's face
 
07:05:37.190 --> 07:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
when I say this I would respectfully
 
07:05:39.468 --> 07:05:39.478 align:start position:0%
suggest that our role is to make the
 
07:05:42.350 --> 07:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
puc's job easier and the reason I say
 
07:05:44.750 --> 07:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
that is that by Statute the POC is the
 
07:05:47.270 --> 07:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
Arbiter between the shareholders of
 
07:05:49.368 --> 07:05:49.378 align:start position:0%
investor and utilities and their
 
07:05:52.190 --> 07:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
customers and we put some weight on the
 
07:05:53.810 --> 07:05:53.820 align:start position:0%
scale on the side of the customers
 
07:05:55.850 --> 07:05:55.860 align:start position:0%
because the utilities I can assure you
 
07:05:58.730 --> 07:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
are very well represented and we do that
 
07:06:01.270 --> 07:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
by litigating very actively at the puc
 
07:06:05.150 --> 07:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
including providing expert testimony we
 
07:06:07.070 --> 07:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
also have a public education function
 
07:06:09.890 --> 07:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
that has become extremely critical given
 
07:06:13.490 --> 07:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
the current crisis people often ask why
 
07:06:16.610 --> 07:06:16.620 align:start position:0%
doesn't the puc simply reject those big
 
07:06:17.990 --> 07:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
rate increases that we've all been
 
07:06:20.570 --> 07:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
living with and I'm in a position to
 
07:06:23.810 --> 07:06:23.820 align:start position:0%
explain why the puc simply is unable to
 
07:06:25.208 --> 07:06:25.218 align:start position:0%
do that
 
07:06:28.250 --> 07:06:28.260 align:start position:0%
and ever increasing aspect of our work
 
07:06:31.250 --> 07:06:31.260 align:start position:0%
involves Regional and federal matters
 
07:06:33.948 --> 07:06:33.958 align:start position:0%
and and that really is because it's the
 
07:06:35.330 --> 07:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
same reason that Willie Sutton robbed
 
07:06:37.628 --> 07:06:37.638 align:start position:0%
banks because that's where the money is
 
07:06:40.208 --> 07:06:40.218 align:start position:0%
wholesale electricity and transmission
 
07:06:42.830 --> 07:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
are growing ever more expensive and
 
07:06:45.468 --> 07:06:45.478 align:start position:0%
consequential we belong to Nepal which
 
07:06:48.708 --> 07:06:48.718 align:start position:0%
is the stakeholder advisory body to ISO
 
07:06:50.030 --> 07:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
New England which runs the regional
 
07:06:53.030 --> 07:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
electricity grade grid and our work
 
07:06:56.150 --> 07:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
complements that of the state which
 
07:06:58.250 --> 07:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
participates by the New England states
 
07:07:01.310 --> 07:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
committee on electricity every one of my
 
07:07:03.650 --> 07:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
counterparts in New England has at least
 
07:07:06.708 --> 07:07:06.718 align:start position:0%
one person who is dedicated full time to
 
07:07:09.468 --> 07:07:09.478 align:start position:0%
ISO New England Nepal and ferc which
 
07:07:12.590 --> 07:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
oversees all of this and so that is the
 
07:07:14.930 --> 07:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
reason I've asked the governor to
 
07:07:17.570 --> 07:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
include in his budget a full-time person
 
07:07:20.208 --> 07:07:20.218 align:start position:0%
that I can add to my staff to do that
 
07:07:22.430 --> 07:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
work we've also asked to create a
 
07:07:24.650 --> 07:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
halftime position that would allow us to
 
07:07:26.448 --> 07:07:26.458 align:start position:0%
hire someone with some accounting
 
07:07:29.030 --> 07:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
expertise that we've noticed as a whole
 
07:07:31.548 --> 07:07:31.558 align:start position:0%
in our capabilities when we do rate
 
07:07:34.968 --> 07:07:34.978 align:start position:0%
cases my dream would be to fire find a
 
07:07:37.490 --> 07:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
retired CPA who would kind of sort of
 
07:07:39.230 --> 07:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
like to get back into the action with a
 
07:07:41.208 --> 07:07:41.218 align:start position:0%
part-time gig and to be frank I'm not
 
07:07:42.590 --> 07:07:42.600 align:start position:0%
optimistic that I'll be able to pull
 
07:07:44.570 --> 07:07:44.580 align:start position:0%
that off but I would like the authority
 
07:07:46.730 --> 07:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
to do that if I managed to find such a
 
07:07:46.740 --> 07:07:47.750 align:start position:0%
to do that if I managed to find such a
person

07:07:47.750 --> 07:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
person
 
07:07:50.390 --> 07:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
I'm comparing our current fiscal 23
 
07:07:52.430 --> 07:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
budget to what we're seeking for fiscal
 
07:07:55.310 --> 07:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
24 we are seeking an increase of about
 
07:07:57.350 --> 07:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
20 percent and I I don't make that
 
07:07:59.750 --> 07:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
request lightly uh it's the first time
 
07:08:02.750 --> 07:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
since I took office in early 2016 that I
 
07:08:04.610 --> 07:08:04.620 align:start position:0%
sought an expansion of our budget for
 
07:08:06.770 --> 07:08:06.780 align:start position:0%
reasons other than inflation we think
 
07:08:08.750 --> 07:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
rate payers are well served by the
 
07:08:12.110 --> 07:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
proposed expansion to the scope of what
 
07:08:15.110 --> 07:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
we do I would like to thank the governor
 
07:08:17.090 --> 07:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
and his team for being supportive of our
 
07:08:19.968 --> 07:08:19.978 align:start position:0%
office since I took office uh the
 
07:08:21.530 --> 07:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
department of energy in particular we
 
07:08:23.150 --> 07:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
have an excellent relationship with them
 
07:08:26.150 --> 07:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
Mr radeo sitting next to us provides us
 
07:08:29.150 --> 07:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
with invaluable assistance uh before you
 
07:08:31.628 --> 07:08:31.638 align:start position:0%
ask me I have to confess that right now
 
07:08:35.270 --> 07:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
three of our five positions are vacant
 
07:08:37.310 --> 07:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
we have the same Staffing challenges
 
07:08:39.948 --> 07:08:39.958 align:start position:0%
that everybody else has and I would like
 
07:08:41.690 --> 07:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
commissioner onlyhouse to know that
 
07:08:43.670 --> 07:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
Laurie rudis and her team over at the
 
07:08:45.530 --> 07:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
division of personnel have been
 
07:08:47.690 --> 07:08:47.700 align:start position:0%
extremely helpful cooperative and flex
 
07:08:50.930 --> 07:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
flexible with us and I'm very grateful
 
07:08:54.110 --> 07:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
for that I do a unique perhaps among
 
07:08:55.788 --> 07:08:55.798 align:start position:0%
anybody in the room have a crystal ball
 
07:08:58.730 --> 07:08:58.740 align:start position:0%
in my office and so I will be cheeky
 
07:09:01.670 --> 07:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
enough to actually offer up my
 
07:09:04.128 --> 07:09:04.138 align:start position:0%
prognostication to the question you ask
 
07:09:07.548 --> 07:09:07.558 align:start position:0%
commissioner shacoin I actually and and
 
07:09:10.490 --> 07:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
we are very dependent on natural gas in
 
07:09:12.590 --> 07:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
New England to produce electricity and
 
07:09:14.868 --> 07:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
I've looked at Natural Gas futures for
 
07:09:17.570 --> 07:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
the next couple of years and and based
 
07:09:20.510 --> 07:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
on that my expectation is that there
 
07:09:23.270 --> 07:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
will be some modest amount of relief and
 
07:09:25.968 --> 07:09:25.978 align:start position:0%
electricity prices but the 10 years that
 
07:09:28.968 --> 07:09:28.978 align:start position:0%
we enjoyed of cheap electricity I think
 
07:09:32.288 --> 07:09:32.298 align:start position:0%
that's over permanently unfortunately
 
07:09:35.570 --> 07:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
and with respect to our ability to
 
07:09:37.810 --> 07:09:37.820 align:start position:0%
compete with other employers
 
07:09:42.410 --> 07:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
for new hires my staff attorney just
 
07:09:44.810 --> 07:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
left for a job with the utility
 
07:09:47.330 --> 07:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
regulator in Massachusetts they offered
 
07:09:49.788 --> 07:09:49.798 align:start position:0%
her thirty thousand dollars more than I
 
07:09:52.610 --> 07:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
could so based on that one date and
 
07:09:54.170 --> 07:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
admittedly you know we're probably
 
07:09:56.750 --> 07:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
something like 30 or 35 or even forty
 
07:10:00.590 --> 07:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
percent off of what even comparable uh
 
07:10:02.208 --> 07:10:02.218 align:start position:0%
state agencies in the neighboring states
 
07:10:04.430 --> 07:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
are offering to the people I want to
 
07:10:06.708 --> 07:10:06.718 align:start position:0%
hire and retain uh with that I'd be
 
07:10:08.930 --> 07:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
07:10:11.270 --> 07:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
you did you mention that three of the
 
07:10:12.590 --> 07:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
five positions you have are currently
 
07:10:15.110 --> 07:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
vacant correct how long have they been
 
07:10:18.770 --> 07:10:18.780 align:start position:0%
vacant uh well they the first one to go
 
07:10:20.868 --> 07:10:20.878 align:start position:0%
vacant that happened back in September
 
07:10:23.390 --> 07:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
and the two other vacancies are very
 
07:10:23.400 --> 07:10:24.410 align:start position:0%
and the two other vacancies are very
recent

07:10:24.410 --> 07:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
recent
 
07:10:27.230 --> 07:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
yeah and I just actually I was but for a
 
07:10:29.510 --> 07:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
brief time without any staff I just
 
07:10:31.190 --> 07:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
hired a new legal assistant and we're
 
07:10:36.350 --> 07:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:38.208 --> 07:10:38.218 align:start position:0%
I know they're fairly recent but what's
 
07:10:38.218 --> 07:10:38.990 align:start position:0%
I know they're fairly recent but what's
your

07:10:38.990 --> 07:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
your
 
07:10:41.030 --> 07:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh prognostication about being able to
 
07:10:43.368 --> 07:10:43.378 align:start position:0%
fill those positions in a fairly timely
 
07:10:45.650 --> 07:10:45.660 align:start position:0%
fashion uh I guess it depends a little
 
07:10:49.190 --> 07:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
bit about fairly timely uh you know much
 
07:10:51.110 --> 07:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
depends on how much flexibility it can
 
07:10:52.788 --> 07:10:52.798 align:start position:0%
squeeze out of the division of personnel
 
07:10:55.968 --> 07:10:55.978 align:start position:0%
I have trouble finding people who meet
 
07:10:58.490 --> 07:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
the supplemental job description
 
07:10:58.500 --> 07:10:59.948 align:start position:0%
the supplemental job description
qualifications

07:10:59.948 --> 07:10:59.958 align:start position:0%
qualifications
 
07:11:02.208 --> 07:11:02.218 align:start position:0%
assuming that the division of personnel
 
07:11:03.890 --> 07:11:03.900 align:start position:0%
is willing to work with me and be a bit
 
07:11:07.628 --> 07:11:07.638 align:start position:0%
flexible I'm cautiously optimistic that
 
07:11:10.190 --> 07:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know three months from now
 
07:11:12.048 --> 07:11:12.058 align:start position:0%
roughly I'll be back to full strength
 
07:11:14.090 --> 07:11:14.100 align:start position:0%
okay I've certainly been interviewing
 
07:11:16.548 --> 07:11:16.558 align:start position:0%
some promising candidates but I know I
 
07:11:18.230 --> 07:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
just spoke to one today and she was
 
07:11:20.810 --> 07:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
quite forthright with me that she is
 
07:11:23.448 --> 07:11:23.458 align:start position:0%
talking to other employers here's what I
 
07:11:25.850 --> 07:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
offer that I think might be unique and I
 
07:11:28.310 --> 07:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
brag about this all the time I the
 
07:11:30.410 --> 07:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
office of the consumer Advocate is the
 
07:11:33.590 --> 07:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
ultimate white hat employer everybody at
 
07:11:35.810 --> 07:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
my little agency goes to work every day
 
07:11:38.090 --> 07:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
doing nothing but what we think is good
 
07:11:41.448 --> 07:11:41.458 align:start position:0%
for resident rate payers and we really
 
07:11:43.850 --> 07:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
confront no competing imperatives and
 
07:11:45.890 --> 07:11:45.900 align:start position:0%
it's very rare anywhere in the economy
 
07:11:47.930 --> 07:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
that people get paid to do the right
 
07:11:50.810 --> 07:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
thing exclusively and
 
07:11:54.288 --> 07:11:54.298 align:start position:0%
how do you measure when when a citizen
 
07:11:56.390 --> 07:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
or a company or someone calls up with
 
07:11:59.270 --> 07:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
with a complaint are they are they cases
 
07:12:01.548 --> 07:12:01.558 align:start position:0%
are they just you log them in as
 
07:12:03.830 --> 07:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
complaints or how do you what's the
 
07:12:06.288 --> 07:12:06.298 align:start position:0%
terminology for that well the department
 
07:12:09.368 --> 07:12:09.378 align:start position:0%
of energy has a team of caseworkers
 
07:12:12.708 --> 07:12:12.718 align:start position:0%
whose job it is to deal with individual
 
07:12:14.690 --> 07:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
customers who are having issues with
 
07:12:16.910 --> 07:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
their utility so we typically refer
 
07:12:20.030 --> 07:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
those complaints over to them but we do
 
07:12:21.770 --> 07:12:21.780 align:start position:0%
take note of the complaints that we
 
07:12:23.510 --> 07:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
receive we get a steady stream of them
 
07:12:26.390 --> 07:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
and my Legal Assistant is good at
 
07:12:28.968 --> 07:12:28.978 align:start position:0%
knowing when something comes up that
 
07:12:31.610 --> 07:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
might be indicative of some kind of
 
07:12:34.010 --> 07:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
trend that I'll want to take up as the
 
07:12:35.770 --> 07:12:35.780 align:start position:0%
person whose job it is to represent
 
07:12:38.628 --> 07:12:38.638 align:start position:0%
residential customers as one big group
 
07:12:40.788 --> 07:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
right and and that's sort of what I'm
 
07:12:44.090 --> 07:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
getting at is is I'm I just want if
 
07:12:45.590 --> 07:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
there are some numbers behind it because
 
07:12:47.448 --> 07:12:47.458 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing that over the last
 
07:12:49.250 --> 07:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
certainly a year that that number has
 
07:12:51.468 --> 07:12:51.478 align:start position:0%
gone automatically up and I just wonder
 
07:12:53.030 --> 07:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
if you had some numbers behind that to
 
07:12:54.830 --> 07:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
illustrate the point I'd be making up
 
07:12:56.330 --> 07:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
numbers but I can tell you that my phone
 
07:12:58.490 --> 07:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
has been ringing off the hook in the
 
07:13:00.830 --> 07:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
last six months uh and you know it began
 
07:13:02.510 --> 07:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
about a little more than a year ago now
 
07:13:05.330 --> 07:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
and and I I'm worried about what's going
 
07:13:07.910 --> 07:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
to happen in the near term okay thank
 
07:13:07.920 --> 07:13:11.030 align:start position:0%
to happen in the near term okay thank
you

07:13:11.030 --> 07:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:12.948 --> 07:13:12.958 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the division of personnel will
 
07:13:15.110 --> 07:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
be flexible I'm sure too they really
 
07:13:17.628 --> 07:13:17.638 align:start position:0%
have been very that's my understanding
 
07:13:17.638 --> 07:13:18.230 align:start position:0%
have been very that's my understanding
um

07:13:18.230 --> 07:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:13:20.810 --> 07:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
um we wear white hats too our job is to
 
07:13:23.690 --> 07:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
make the roof leak less and to make the
 
07:13:26.288 --> 07:13:26.298 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet add up in all of its columns
 
07:13:28.310 --> 07:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
and I don't do either one of those
 
07:13:30.590 --> 07:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
things but I have people who do
 
07:13:33.230 --> 07:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
um but uh would you say your job is to
 
07:13:35.868 --> 07:13:35.878 align:start position:0%
make sure I pay less for electricity or
 
07:13:37.368 --> 07:13:37.378 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there's electricity
 
07:13:39.288 --> 07:13:39.298 align:start position:0%
when I turn on the switch I would say
 
07:13:41.390 --> 07:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
it's both of those things and it's not
 
07:13:43.968 --> 07:13:43.978 align:start position:0%
too much to ask that your prices be just
 
07:13:46.190 --> 07:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
as reasonable and that your service is
 
07:13:48.830 --> 07:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
reasonably reliable do you think the
 
07:13:50.750 --> 07:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
state do you think the state government
 
07:13:55.128 --> 07:13:55.138 align:start position:0%
and in your world has the capacity
 
07:13:57.468 --> 07:13:57.478 align:start position:0%
to make a difference on prices are we at
 
07:14:00.288 --> 07:14:00.298 align:start position:0%
the mercy of the Giant Eagle utility
 
07:14:00.298 --> 07:14:01.788 align:start position:0%
the mercy of the Giant Eagle utility
companies

07:14:01.788 --> 07:14:01.798 align:start position:0%
companies
 
07:14:01.798 --> 07:14:03.010 align:start position:0%
companies
um

07:14:03.010 --> 07:14:03.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:14:06.590 --> 07:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
in the near term and it it isn't ever
 
07:14:09.530 --> 07:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
Source Liberty or Unitil or the Electric
 
07:14:12.468 --> 07:14:12.478 align:start position:0%
Co-op that I think are responsible it's
 
07:14:14.628 --> 07:14:14.638 align:start position:0%
the it's it's the companies that produce
 
07:14:16.850 --> 07:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
electricity it's the worldwide market
 
07:14:18.708 --> 07:14:18.718 align:start position:0%
for natural gas and the fact that
 
07:14:21.650 --> 07:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
natural gas sets the clearing price for
 
07:14:24.110 --> 07:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
electricity almost all the time and in
 
07:14:26.030 --> 07:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
the near term there's nothing we can do
 
07:14:28.310 --> 07:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
about that in the longer term I think
 
07:14:31.430 --> 07:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
the key is uh diversifying so that we
 
07:14:34.190 --> 07:14:34.200 align:start position:0%
aren't overly reliant on natural gas and
 
07:14:35.990 --> 07:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's not because there are those who
 
07:14:37.788 --> 07:14:37.798 align:start position:0%
think we have to stop using natural gas
 
07:14:40.250 --> 07:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
for reasons of climate change I let
 
07:14:42.590 --> 07:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
other people serve as The Lorax my
 
07:14:45.468 --> 07:14:45.478 align:start position:0%
concern is the rate payers and we all of
 
07:14:47.990 --> 07:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
us repairs are too dependent on natural
 
07:14:49.850 --> 07:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
gas generation
 
07:14:52.368 --> 07:14:52.378 align:start position:0%
well kudos for the first reference to
 
07:14:55.610 --> 07:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
The Lorax I've heard in 10 years
 
07:14:55.620 --> 07:14:57.048 align:start position:0%
The Lorax I've heard in 10 years
um

07:14:57.048 --> 07:14:57.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:14:59.930 --> 07:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
is it fair to say we don't
 
07:15:02.690 --> 07:15:02.700 align:start position:0%
we don't do enough of anything in
 
07:15:02.700 --> 07:15:04.788 align:start position:0%
we don't do enough of anything in
electric

07:15:04.788 --> 07:15:04.798 align:start position:0%
electric
 
07:15:06.830 --> 07:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
um you mean is there some kind of
 
07:15:08.770 --> 07:15:08.780 align:start position:0%
electricity there's a Magic Bullet right
 
07:15:11.330 --> 07:15:11.340 align:start position:0%
there are there is no magic bullet but
 
07:15:13.610 --> 07:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
there is more that we can do across a
 
07:15:16.730 --> 07:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
pretty broad range of initiatives I mean
 
07:15:18.048 --> 07:15:18.058 align:start position:0%
you know the governor has been talking
 
07:15:20.150 --> 07:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
about offshore wind that's an important
 
07:15:22.430 --> 07:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
part of our future we have to decide how
 
07:15:24.170 --> 07:15:24.180 align:start position:0%
willing we are to pay for that to get
 
07:15:26.090 --> 07:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
that started but there are lots of
 
07:15:29.448 --> 07:15:29.458 align:start position:0%
things at the local level that we can do
 
07:15:32.570 --> 07:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
that are less Capital intensive than
 
07:15:34.368 --> 07:15:34.378 align:start position:0%
building giant wind turbines in the Gulf
 
07:15:35.448 --> 07:15:35.458 align:start position:0%
of me
 
07:15:39.708 --> 07:15:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:46.850 --> 07:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:49.968 --> 07:15:49.978 align:start position:0%
now to end the day's festivities site
 
07:15:58.030 --> 07:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:04.670 --> 07:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:06.288 --> 07:16:06.298 align:start position:0%
good afternoon and thank you for the
 
07:16:07.968 --> 07:16:07.978 align:start position:0%
opportunity to present the fiscal year
 
07:16:11.390 --> 07:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
24 and fiscal year 25 operating budget
 
07:16:13.670 --> 07:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
request from the Department of Revenue
 
07:16:13.680 --> 07:16:15.350 align:start position:0%
request from the Department of Revenue
Administration

07:16:15.350 --> 07:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
07:16:17.030 --> 07:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
the mission of the site evaluation
 
07:16:19.128 --> 07:16:19.138 align:start position:0%
committee is the review approval
 
07:16:21.350 --> 07:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
monitoring and enforcement of compliance
 
07:16:24.048 --> 07:16:24.058 align:start position:0%
in the planning citing construction and
 
07:16:25.850 --> 07:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
operation of energy facilities in the
 
07:16:25.860 --> 07:16:26.810 align:start position:0%
operation of energy facilities in the
state

07:16:26.810 --> 07:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
state
 
07:16:29.090 --> 07:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
ideally our budget is funded through
 
07:16:31.490 --> 07:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
fees paid during the permitting of new
 
07:16:33.468 --> 07:16:33.478 align:start position:0%
energy facilities
 
07:16:35.510 --> 07:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism however can prove
 
07:16:39.048 --> 07:16:39.058 align:start position:0%
unreliable as it is inextricably tied to
 
07:16:41.930 --> 07:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
the number size and scope of applicants
 
07:16:45.890 --> 07:16:45.900 align:start position:0%
currently there are zero applicants
 
07:16:47.570 --> 07:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
accordingly additional funding is often
 
07:16:50.090 --> 07:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
needed to supplement the enforcement and
 
07:16:52.250 --> 07:16:52.260 align:start position:0%
adjudication component of the
 
07:16:54.170 --> 07:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
committee's purview
 
07:16:58.070 --> 07:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
with me today is Leonard radio director
 
07:16:59.448 --> 07:16:59.458 align:start position:0%
of the business office in the department
 
07:17:02.330 --> 07:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
of energy together we will endeavor to
 
07:17:04.490 --> 07:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
answer any questions fully into the best
 
07:17:05.750 --> 07:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
of our ability
 
07:17:11.750 --> 07:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:14.570 --> 07:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
okay what are your currently what are
 
07:17:16.430 --> 07:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
your sources of revenue
 
07:17:22.190 --> 07:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:24.230 --> 07:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
well currently they're virtually nothing
 
07:17:26.628 --> 07:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
because they're application fees okay we
 
07:17:30.530 --> 07:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:30.540 --> 07:17:32.868 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

07:17:32.868 --> 07:17:32.878 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
07:17:32.878 --> 07:17:37.310 align:start position:0%
foreign
historical

07:17:37.310 --> 07:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:40.368 --> 07:17:40.378 align:start position:0%
um information so 21 I think the site
 
07:17:41.868 --> 07:17:41.878 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
 
07:17:47.270 --> 07:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
um collected 3 600 22 collected 7 200
 
07:17:49.910 --> 07:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
um that's kind of why we wanted to
 
07:17:52.310 --> 07:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
um with the way the law was the RSA was
 
07:17:54.948 --> 07:17:54.958 align:start position:0%
previously written is to
 
07:17:57.048 --> 07:17:57.058 align:start position:0%
um budget in this budget
 
07:17:59.150 --> 07:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
um truthfully that it's gonna we're
 
07:18:01.430 --> 07:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
gonna need General funds however just
 
07:18:01.440 --> 07:18:02.868 align:start position:0%
gonna need General funds however just
recently

07:18:02.868 --> 07:18:02.878 align:start position:0%
recently
 
07:18:02.878 --> 07:18:03.468 align:start position:0%
recently
um

07:18:03.468 --> 07:18:03.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:18:06.010 --> 07:18:06.020 align:start position:0%
chapter law 176.
 
07:18:09.110 --> 07:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
change that wording to allow for the
 
07:18:11.448 --> 07:18:11.458 align:start position:0%
administrator and administrative costs
 
07:18:13.968 --> 07:18:13.978 align:start position:0%
to be budgeted with General funds and it
 
07:18:16.430 --> 07:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
took that out and just added that what
 
07:18:18.350 --> 07:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
we used to have as a footnote saying
 
07:18:19.910 --> 07:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
that we could go back to the governor
 
07:18:22.548 --> 07:18:22.558 align:start position:0%
and the fiscal committee for um for a
 
07:18:24.708 --> 07:18:24.718 align:start position:0%
general fund warrant now it now would
 
07:18:26.990 --> 07:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
put it in the iris the statute itself so
 
07:18:29.510 --> 07:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
we no longer need a footnote but it does
 
07:18:32.090 --> 07:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
say that the site evaluation committee
 
07:18:34.788 --> 07:18:34.798 align:start position:0%
administrative functions should be
 
07:18:34.798 --> 07:18:35.390 align:start position:0%
administrative functions should be
um

07:18:35.390 --> 07:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:18:37.968 --> 07:18:37.978 align:start position:0%
should be funded by the fees collected
 
07:18:41.990 --> 07:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
which are at this time zero so
 
07:18:43.368 --> 07:18:43.378 align:start position:0%
um that decision needs to be made
 
07:18:45.350 --> 07:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
whether or not right now in this budget
 
07:18:47.510 --> 07:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
for 24.25 it is
 
07:18:49.310 --> 07:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
um General funds
 
07:18:50.750 --> 07:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
um but whether or not that needs to be
 
07:18:52.548 --> 07:18:52.558 align:start position:0%
changed would would have to be uh
 
07:18:55.128 --> 07:18:55.138 align:start position:0%
additional conversations
 
07:18:59.208 --> 07:18:59.218 align:start position:0%
okay so do you need something in hp2
 
07:19:02.448 --> 07:19:02.458 align:start position:0%
to happen well um I don't um
 
07:19:04.190 --> 07:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner can you can you talk on
 
07:19:05.510 --> 07:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
some of the discussions that are going
 
07:19:09.830 --> 07:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:09.840 --> 07:19:40.788 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

07:19:40.788 --> 07:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:40.798 --> 07:19:43.250 align:start position:0%
 
what

07:19:43.250 --> 07:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
what
 
07:19:45.288 --> 07:19:45.298 align:start position:0%
what that looks like and ultimately the
 
07:19:45.298 --> 07:19:52.968 align:start position:0%
what that looks like and ultimately the
legislature

07:19:52.968 --> 07:19:52.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:55.730 --> 07:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
okay do you have a timeline of when the
 
07:19:56.868 --> 07:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
legislature is going to finish their
 
07:19:56.878 --> 07:20:12.230 align:start position:0%
legislature is going to finish their
work

07:20:12.230 --> 07:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:13.850 --> 07:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
07:20:15.530 --> 07:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
that's why we're not we're not proposing
 
07:20:17.448 --> 07:20:17.458 align:start position:0%
an hb2 language at this time just to see
 
07:20:19.730 --> 07:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
where the legislation goes
 
07:20:21.948 --> 07:20:21.958 align:start position:0%
um but with the change in the law that
 
07:20:24.110 --> 07:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
came into effect July 1st which when
 
07:20:26.150 --> 07:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
this was built when most of the work
 
07:20:27.948 --> 07:20:27.958 align:start position:0%
that was put into building this budget
 
07:20:30.410 --> 07:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
it wasn't known that the general fund
 
07:20:32.208 --> 07:20:32.218 align:start position:0%
terminology was taken out and it was
 
07:20:34.788 --> 07:20:34.798 align:start position:0%
just put um replaced by the the ability
 
07:20:38.330 --> 07:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
to go to the governor and the fiscal
 
07:20:39.530 --> 07:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
committee for
 
07:20:42.410 --> 07:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
um if the um if expenses exceeded the
 
07:20:45.770 --> 07:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
fees brought in which which it will
 
07:20:47.570 --> 07:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
um but it's just you know what we've
 
07:20:49.368 --> 07:20:49.378 align:start position:0%
done in the past I try to get away from
 
07:20:50.570 --> 07:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
what we've done in the past because it
 
07:20:53.090 --> 07:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
wasn't you know realistic but they
 
07:20:54.948 --> 07:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
changed the law so now I think we're
 
07:20:56.690 --> 07:20:56.700 align:start position:0%
stuck with what we have to do
 
07:20:59.750 --> 07:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you if I if I understand that
 
07:21:01.330 --> 07:21:01.340 align:start position:0%
right current law when you're short
 
07:21:05.090 --> 07:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
you're just going to fiscal and say hey
 
07:21:07.968 --> 07:21:07.978 align:start position:0%
we actually have employees
 
07:21:08.990 --> 07:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
um we're going to spend more than three
 
07:21:11.690 --> 07:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
grand this year and uh we're going to be
 
07:21:15.590 --> 07:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
short 86 under 82 Grand and can you give
 
07:21:17.330 --> 07:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
us that from South that was appropriated
 
07:21:19.788 --> 07:21:19.798 align:start position:0%
right so that was a footnote in uh the
 
07:21:22.730 --> 07:21:22.740 align:start position:0%
22-23 budget but they just
 
07:21:22.740 --> 07:21:23.390 align:start position:0%
22-23 budget but they just
um

07:21:23.390 --> 07:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:21:26.628 --> 07:21:26.638 align:start position:0%
codified of that in the in the uh RSA so
 
07:21:28.730 --> 07:21:28.740 align:start position:0%
that's in the RSA now that we can go to
 
07:21:30.708 --> 07:21:30.718 align:start position:0%
and our anticipation is it based on the
 
07:21:32.208 --> 07:21:32.218 align:start position:0%
study committee they'll probably say
 
07:21:34.850 --> 07:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
something along the lines of this should
 
07:21:37.548 --> 07:21:37.558 align:start position:0%
be budgeted as general funds
 
07:21:40.310 --> 07:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
is what we think
 
07:21:42.590 --> 07:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
I would just note for people's
 
07:21:44.390 --> 07:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
edification I think people know this who
 
07:21:46.070 --> 07:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
have followed the site evaluation
 
07:21:48.890 --> 07:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
committee from inside and outside is
 
07:21:51.230 --> 07:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
that fair to say true
 
07:21:52.910 --> 07:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
um that um
 
07:21:54.770 --> 07:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
it's been a problem for a long time when
 
07:21:56.448 --> 07:21:56.458 align:start position:0%
you have really controversial cases you
 
07:21:58.128 --> 07:21:58.138 align:start position:0%
get a lot of money coming in and that's
 
07:22:01.670 --> 07:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
infrequent and not desirable and so you
 
07:22:03.288 --> 07:22:03.298 align:start position:0%
either have a site evaluation committee
 
07:22:04.910 --> 07:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
or you don't but if we're going to have
 
07:22:06.948 --> 07:22:06.958 align:start position:0%
one you got to pay for it and part of
 
07:22:08.628 --> 07:22:08.638 align:start position:0%
the problem with the fees previously is
 
07:22:10.250 --> 07:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
you do as much work for a very small
 
07:22:10.260 --> 07:22:11.208 align:start position:0%
you do as much work for a very small
case

07:22:11.208 --> 07:22:11.218 align:start position:0%
case
 
07:22:13.128 --> 07:22:13.138 align:start position:0%
tip usually than you do with a very
 
07:22:15.410 --> 07:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
large case and you get less you know you
 
07:22:18.250 --> 07:22:18.260 align:start position:0%
get less fees for the the smaller cases
 
07:22:21.708 --> 07:22:21.718 align:start position:0%
and the the enforcement aspect of what
 
07:22:23.868 --> 07:22:23.878 align:start position:0%
and you can correct me if I'm wrong but
 
07:22:26.810 --> 07:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
what what is the constant work that's
 
07:22:29.628 --> 07:22:29.638 align:start position:0%
being done is not funded by anything
 
07:22:31.610 --> 07:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
there's been there's been anger in the
 
07:22:33.170 --> 07:22:33.180 align:start position:0%
past among some policy makers I remember
 
07:22:35.690 --> 07:22:35.700 align:start position:0%
a council meeting which went very badly
 
07:22:38.690 --> 07:22:38.700 align:start position:0%
um two or three years ago where there
 
07:22:41.330 --> 07:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
was a site evaluation committee and
 
07:22:43.490 --> 07:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
um somebody was mad that they that they
 
07:22:45.770 --> 07:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
hadn't met and the person tasked with
 
07:22:47.690 --> 07:22:47.700 align:start position:0%
the question said well
 
07:22:50.510 --> 07:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have any staff and they and we
 
07:22:51.890 --> 07:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
don't have any money to hire any staff
 
07:22:53.868 --> 07:22:53.878 align:start position:0%
and they didn't think that was a good
 
07:22:53.878 --> 07:22:54.830 align:start position:0%
and they didn't think that was a good
excuse

07:22:54.830 --> 07:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
excuse
 
07:22:56.810 --> 07:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
which seemed a little odd
 
07:22:56.820 --> 07:23:02.150 align:start position:0%
which seemed a little odd
okay

07:23:02.150 --> 07:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:10.490 --> 07:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:12.890 --> 07:23:12.900 align:start position:0%
and the hearing will be in recess until
 
07:23:16.610 --> 07:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning at
 
07:23:25.430 --> 07:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
