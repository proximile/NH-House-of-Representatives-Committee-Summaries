uh so they'll be able to explain more
 
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
but they're primarily a data analytics
 
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 align:start position:0%
uh specializing in data analytics and
 
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
they have uh previously done work in
 
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
North Carolina doing a criminal justice
 
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 align:start position:0%

conversation hi good morning every
 
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
everyone my name is Jake yokul I manage
 
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
our state and local government practice

for the Northeast um my team what we do
 
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
is we help departments States leverage
 
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
their data for some of their more
 
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
strategic initiatives um and embed
 
00:07:43.469 --> 00:07:43.479 align:start position:0%
different data and analytic strategies
 
00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:45.159 align:start position:0%
into those initiatives so thank you for
 
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
presentation all right I have to say
 
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
this is my first time talking into Mike
 
00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
so thank you um so we are as I had said
 
00:07:59.830 --> 00:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
we represent SAS Institute and probably
 
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
many of you don't know who SAS is SAS is
 
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
a company that is headquartered out of
 
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
North Carolina Carri specifically car
 
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
North Carolina and I've been working for
 
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
them for about seven years I'm
 
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
originally from New England actually and
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
came from Boston and then moved to North
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
Carolina for various reasons our company
 
00:08:19.869 --> 00:08:19.879 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to start from the beginning
 
00:08:23.309 --> 00:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
and say that our company started out in
 
00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
as a project in the late 1960s when a
 
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
number of different universities came
 
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
together to look at a system a
 
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
statistical and a software package to be
 
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
able to look at agriculture data and
 
00:08:42.029 --> 00:08:42.039 align:start position:0%
that data had they wanted to analyze was
 
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
to identify where they can maximize crop
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
yields as a result of that which was
 
00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
funded by the NIH they developed a
 
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:53.720 align:start position:0%
system called the statistical analysis
 
00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:58.360 align:start position:0%
system which is SAS that system analyzes
 
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
billions and billions and rows of data
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
in a sec in in many seconds and it helps
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
change the way we work and the way
 
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.350 align:start position:0%
change the way we work and the way
people

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:08.360 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
live and since
 
00:09:13.389 --> 00:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
1976 our founder and CEO today Dr
 
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
Goodnight developed this system now is
 
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
in all over the world in many many
 
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
different countries and because of that
 
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:26.680 align:start position:0%
we're able to work in faster ways in
 
00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
ways that we are we're able to save
 
00:09:32.069 --> 00:09:32.079 align:start position:0%
lives and able to be more
 
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
efficient because of our roots in the
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
education system and in government SAS
 
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
is a leader a leader in artificial
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
intelligence and data analytics and as
 
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
Jonathan had said earlier that is where
 
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
our strengths are is being able to
 
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
analyze data from disperate sources in
 
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
ways that no other software company can
 
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
really do and since over the last five
 
00:09:56.829 --> 00:09:56.839 align:start position:0%
decades we've been able to demonstrate
 
00:09:59.230 --> 00:09:59.240 align:start position:0%
that what we wanted to to share with
 
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
with you today is a little bit about
 
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
what we've done in the state agencies
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
we're in about 134 countries around the
 
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
world we're in about 1600 different
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
departments and agencies and bureaus in
 
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
the world and we're also in recognized
 
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
in many different areas in terms of um
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
Finance in health care in
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical but again our foundation
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
in the state so we are actually in New
 
00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have a number of different
 
00:10:34.829 --> 00:10:34.839 align:start position:0%
agencies that we serve um we serve in
 
00:10:37.949 --> 00:10:37.959 align:start position:0%
hospitals we serve in the education
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
systems we also serve in many of the
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
different agencies here and so I'd like
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
to turn it over to Jake to kind of talk
 
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
through um some of the things that we've
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
done in the Northeast he oversees many
 
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
of those um agencies that we are that
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
are using SAS and I think if you look at
 
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
the um presentation deck there is we
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
serve eight every eight different
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
pillars and I'll turn it over to Jake to
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
kind of describe
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
manura so we recognize that agencies and
 
00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
States today have more data than they've
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
ever had um data that exist in different
 
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
silos from different systems that we've
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
invested in over the past several years
 
00:11:22.509 --> 00:11:22.519 align:start position:0%
the data is out there um what SAS does
 
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
is help those States those agencies use
 
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
that data in ways to make better
 
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:31.160 align:start position:0%
decisions um how do you our our systems
 
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
help the agencies help States be able to
 
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
bring that data together to make those
 
00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
decisions make those policy decisions um
 
00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:40.350 align:start position:0%
decisions make those policy decisions um
resource

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
resource
 
00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:42.519 align:start position:0%
allocations that they're trying to do
 
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
based on what the data is saying based
 
00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:45.959 align:start position:0%
by what that evidence is pointing
 
00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
towards um few examples I I want to call
 
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
out from across the Northeast um you
 
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
know we do a lot of work in the public
 
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
safety realm um one of the states that
 
00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
that we're working with um with their
 
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
Fusion Center operations right to help
 
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
them um contribute data and analyze data
 
00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
from you know the a local perspective
 
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
State perspective and then also
 
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
reporting that up to a federal uh the
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
federal um government as well right then
 
00:12:16.509 --> 00:12:16.519 align:start position:0%
in addition to that we're we're working
 
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
with a different state with um there's
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
1600 Troopers that are using our
 
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
software every day um touching the
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
software every single day um and it's
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
pulled to the the software is pulled
 
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
together all their data from across
 
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
Corrections uh from across Public Safety
 
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
and uh Homeland Security right and
 
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
there's they they that state has
 
00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:40.519 align:start position:0%
actually developed a um data sharing
 
00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:42.519 align:start position:0%
Network across those agencies as well
 
00:12:45.069 --> 00:12:45.079 align:start position:0%
which we're supporting um and then in
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
the public health space again there's we
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
recognize that there's also an overlap
 
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
between public health and Public Safety
 
00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
um and we are supporting bring get
 
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
bringing together in a different state
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
different agency data from Department of
 
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
Health from Public Safety to be able to
 
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
analyze um impacts of different
 
00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:06.279 align:start position:0%
different policies different resource
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
allocations um again based on what the
 
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
data is saying today so the reason we're
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
here today is to talk more specifically
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
about a project in North Carolina that
 
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
is very um very relevant to some of the
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
the conversations around data sharing as
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
it relates to Public Safety um and I
 
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
will turn it over to John to talk more
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
specifically about
 
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.310 align:start position:0%
specifically about
that

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
thanks Jake um can everyone hear me okay
 
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
okay good so uh you guys have in your
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
handouts and so I feel like I'm going to
 
00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:42.839 align:start position:0%
be a teacher and say go to the next page
 
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
and here's what you're seeing um but I
 
00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
think that's going to be the easiest
 
00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:48.519 align:start position:0%
thing to do so what I'm going to walk
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
through is a little bit more of my
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
background and and why am I here not
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
just from a SAS perspective but from a
 
00:13:57.949 --> 00:13:57.959 align:start position:0%
experienc perspective um and then you
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
know walk through kind of what data is
 
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
in this system which is really the
 
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
relevant components of what you probably
 
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
are looking for what data have you
 
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:07.720 align:start position:0%
integrated how have you surface that
 
00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
data um tell me about the roles and how
 
00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
people use
 
00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:14.519 align:start position:0%
it some what I we call screenshots from
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
the system um and then show some of the
 
00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
what makes up some of the reports that
 
00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:20.839 align:start position:0%
might be really important like pre-trial
 
00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
service report and those type of things
 
00:14:24.749 --> 00:14:24.759 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to walk through it I
 
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:26.959 align:start position:0%
know it's going to be um kind of like an
 
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
eye chart on these uh on on what you
 
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
have but I think it will I'll I'll walk
 
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
through and describe it I think in a way
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
that will all make sense and then of
 
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
course um we're we're all open to
 
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
discussions and question of course as at
 
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
the direction of the of the chair so
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
again happy to be here John carelles um
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
and again I described my role as a a
 
00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:51.160 align:start position:0%
principal industry consultant and and
 
00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:53.240 align:start position:0%
you know I came from uh the state of
 
00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
North Carolina um I spent over 25 years
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
with the state of North Carolina um the
 
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
last seven or eight of those years I was
 
00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
the deputy State Co and chief data
 
00:15:04.509 --> 00:15:04.519 align:start position:0%
officer and within that
 
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
organization uh there was something
 
00:15:09.389 --> 00:15:09.399 align:start position:0%
called uh a really uh amazing group
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
called the government data analytics
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
Center or GAC for short and and as I
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
described my role at SAS is you know uh
 
00:15:19.629 --> 00:15:19.639 align:start position:0%
integrating data um improving uh you
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
know outcomes and and and trying to gain
 
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
intelligence from from from the data to
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
improve Services gdac did the same thing
 
00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:31.240 align:start position:0%
gdac worked across an Enterprise um 17
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
agencies in in the state were
 
00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
contributing data which is essentially
 
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
all the agencies contri contributing
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
data and receiving some type of analytic
 
00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
benefit back in their operations it's
 
00:15:43.389 --> 00:15:43.399 align:start position:0%
not data and analytics for analytics
 
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
sake it's to do something with to make a
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
decision right so data doesn't help
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
unless you use it and and you use it in
 
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
a way that's you know clear about what
 
00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
you're going to do with it recognizing
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
privacy recognizing security is of
 
00:15:59.230 --> 00:15:59.240 align:start position:0%
utmost importance
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
and then you know handle that data
 
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:04.120 align:start position:0%
responsibly so the the the solution I'm
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
going to talk about today and this gets
 
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:07.240 align:start position:0%
a little confusing for me because I was
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
a state employee for over 25 years and
 
00:16:11.309 --> 00:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
I'm on the vendor side I've been here
 
00:16:13.949 --> 00:16:13.959 align:start position:0%
about 18 months but this system was
 
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
under my leadership in North Carolina so
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
if I get confusing sometimes I talk
 
00:16:19.949 --> 00:16:19.959 align:start position:0%
about it like I'm still administering
 
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:21.519 align:start position:0%
the system and sometimes I talk about it
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
like a vendor so please put those
 
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
together and bear with me but uh let's
 
00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about what CJ leads is
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
um and that stands for the criminal
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
justice law enforcement automated data
 
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:35.720 align:start position:0%
services and so this
 
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
solution uh really provides uh a wealth
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
of data in one place to present a single
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
view of an offender a comprehensive
 
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
trusted single view of an offender and I
 
00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
may go into some of the data components
 
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
but that that's of utmost importance um
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
but how this system came to be was
 
00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately through a lot of really
 
00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
good ideas and solutions come from
 
00:17:00.829 --> 00:17:00.839 align:start position:0%
tragedies in government that we have to
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
address in government so when you think
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
about um you know a lot of these these
 
00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:06.839 align:start position:0%
Solutions that's how they came to be so
 
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
in North Carolina we had two very
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
high-profile murders um uh from two
 
00:17:16.029 --> 00:17:16.039 align:start position:0%
students at are Flagship universities
 
00:17:18.429 --> 00:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
which are U University of North Carolina
 
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
and Duke University and these two um
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
students were murdered by two
 
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
individuals that were known that that
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
were on probation but because the data
 
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:31.799 align:start position:0%
wasn't off connected you know they you
 
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
were only seeing a part of the picture
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
when they showed up in court should they
 
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
have been on the streets because there
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
was additional charges while they're on
 
00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
probation whatnot now I'm not going to
 
00:17:42.669 --> 00:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
say the outcomes would have been
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
different but there might have been
 
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
different opportunities to intervene
 
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
with those outcomes so uh similar uh uh
 
00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
so really the legislature um and really
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
all of State wanted to understand what
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
we could have done better from a state
 
00:17:59.310 --> 00:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
perspective from a local perspective
 
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
just across the board and uh what we
 
00:18:05.149 --> 00:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
really understood was from a data
 
00:18:08.149 --> 00:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
perspective our Criminal Justice System
 
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
it absolutely was not a
 
00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:12.799 align:start position:0%
system uh from a data perspective right
 
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
so it was a bunch of silos um you know
 
00:18:17.549 --> 00:18:17.559 align:start position:0%
the data was all available that was
 
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
probably needed it's just it's it's in
 
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
their like Silo um organizations so what
 
00:18:26.149 --> 00:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
came of that was trying to address that
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
problem by developing that single view
 
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
of an offender
 
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
by integrating the data more fully and
 
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
also trying to break down those it
 
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
barriers right and again it's it's the
 
00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
data is there it's sitting in a in a
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
silo it's not being leveraged because
 
00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
you know and you could access these
 
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
systems if you go to all of them and
 
00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:47.559 align:start position:0%
then you're you're you're burdening uh
 
00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:49.640 align:start position:0%
yourself with the time it takes you need
 
00:18:52.149 --> 00:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
to move on to maybe another another uh
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
search I another the problem those type
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
of things so it's about efficiencies so
 
00:18:58.029 --> 00:18:58.039 align:start position:0%
you'll see a slide that kind of
 
00:19:00.029 --> 00:19:00.039 align:start position:0%
highlight CJ leads or some quotes on it
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go through the whole
 
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
slide but really the purpose was the
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
results really were um uh to to increase
 
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
Public Safety by having this information
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
um and and that's both those that the
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice organizations were
 
00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:18.679 align:start position:0%
serving as well as increasing the safety
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
for the criminal justice professionals
 
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
and then also you know to create those
 
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
efficiencies right so if we could take
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
10 to 15 minutes off of searching that's
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
real money that's general fund
 
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
Appropriations or that's you know local
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that you know create
 
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
those efficiencies so you'll see some
 
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
metrics where the state's reporting
 
00:19:41.909 --> 00:19:41.919 align:start position:0%
today are last year 18.6 million just in
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
efficiencies and that's looking at all
 
00:19:45.789 --> 00:19:45.799 align:start position:0%
the time it takes to what would have
 
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
taken to go through all those systems
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
and having a centralized uh view of that
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
offender you know just saves that time
 
00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
as well as increases uh Public Safety so
 
00:19:58.669 --> 00:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
that's where it came to be um another
 
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
how it also came to be and I mentioned
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
the the the unfortunately the
 
00:20:04.029 --> 00:20:04.039 align:start position:0%
high-profile murders um and the All
 
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
State approach the legislature also you
 
00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
know put GAC uh uh on on course to say
 
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:13.720 align:start position:0%
uh to develop a pilot program to
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
actually integrate criminal justice data
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
get all the partners in the room uh
 
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
provide some funding to get it going and
 
00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
provide authority to get it going uh
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
because on these type of Ventures
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
there's a couple things that are always
 
00:20:29.789 --> 00:20:29.799 align:start position:0%
needed accountability and authority and
 
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
those things were granted and then quick
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
check-ins to check on progress and to
 
00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:37.559 align:start position:0%
remove barriers as you all can imagine
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
um being the committee you serve on um
 
00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
you know data sensitive governance is
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
important and it's not just about
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
connecting data it's about Connecting
 
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
People connecting organizations and
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
breaking down some of those silos that
 
00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
technical so I'm going to uh teaching
 
00:20:59.470 --> 00:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
moment next
 
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
slide sorry uh Jake spoke to this and
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
manura spoke to kind of our portfolio
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
what number slide we on oh I'm on
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
integrated data it should be slide six
 
00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:11.919 align:start position:0%
if we get the same numbers thank you
 
00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you for asking um
 
00:21:17.269 --> 00:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
so when we talk about integrated data
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
6.5 okay yeah that's
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
good so on the dat I'm not going to go
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
too much into this slide but as I
 
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
describe kind of what we're doing for
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
criminal justice I think when you start
 
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
looking at at government problems those
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
large government problems they're really
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
complex um and and sometimes governments
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
have focused on trying to solve them
 
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
from one agency's data perspective and
 
00:21:48.669 --> 00:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
what I would say is the problems are
 
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
interconnected across state services and
 
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
those type of things never more apparent
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
than in criminal justice right so the
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
connectivity of those services
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
um you know are really important which
 
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
means the connectivity of the data is
 
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
really important um because you're
 
00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
really looking at it from a perspective
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
of not just what one service is doing
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
but what's the collective impact of the
 
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
services and investment government's
 
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
making to improve or or inform a problem
 
00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
so when we start talking about criminal
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
justice or any part of our portfolio a
 
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
lot of what we focus is on Enterprise
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
approaches Enterprise strategies
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
Enterprise delivery because that's
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
really where those Investments are
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
enhanced because the problems are are
 
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
are I'm not going to say solved but you
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
can come up with a better
 
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
approach so I'm going to dive deeper in
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
next slide into the the meat of this and
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
again I'm I'm just going to cover some
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
surface points from this system you know
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to do a demo I'm not
 
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
trying to get too deep there's a lot
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
more functionality capability um in this
 
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
system but I'm going to try and
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
highlight the most important piece which
 
00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
is the data piece and the accessibility
 
00:22:58.909 --> 00:22:58.919 align:start position:0%
to that data so I'm going to walk
 
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
through some screenshots very quickly
 
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
and just kind of talk a little bit about
 
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
them but this slide seven where it says
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
CJ leads integrated data summary is
 
00:23:10.269 --> 00:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
really uh the best slide in this deck
 
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
because it shows what data has been
 
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
integrated so you can see the data
 
00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:18.039 align:start position:0%
that's been integrated courts warrants
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
um protective orders Corrections
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
probation DMV of course and other lure
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
data is included in the system many many
 
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
more um you know just looking at this
 
00:23:30.669 --> 00:23:30.679 align:start position:0%
you probably realize the effort it takes
 
00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
just to get people to contribute their
 
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
data and be able to receive benefit back
 
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
from that so this is really again the
 
00:23:39.269 --> 00:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
software the analytics that's all
 
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
wonderful but the process and the
 
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
governance and those type of things
 
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
can't be ignored because you can't get
 
00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
there without it so this is I think um
 
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
speaks Testaments Testament to um is a
 
00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
testament to all the work that not just
 
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
GAC or you know me leading the
 
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
organization performed it's actually The
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
Testament of the work
 
00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
of all these agencies to to to Really
 
00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
bite into the same objective share that
 
00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:06.440 align:start position:0%
that values and and and want to you know
 
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
work together to collectively solve
 
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:10.919 align:start position:0%
problems um the one thing I should also
 
00:24:15.549 --> 00:24:15.559 align:start position:0%
say is CJ leads is used by over 25,000
 
00:24:18.029 --> 00:24:18.039 align:start position:0%
criminal justice professionals today
 
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
it's probably closer to 26
 
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
27,000 700 agencies are participating in
 
00:24:26.669 --> 00:24:26.679 align:start position:0%
this program and leveraging it so it's a
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty big effort
 
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:31.480 align:start position:0%
um with a lot of buyin um and it's m
 
00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
very mature at this point um and it took
 
00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
a little while to get there um as as
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
most things do most good things take a
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
while to get there um but again these
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
are folks using it every day um to to to
 
00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to say to solve problems
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
to react to some situations etc etc so
 
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
slide eight says CJ leads critical
 
00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.630 align:start position:0%
slide eight says CJ leads critical
foundational

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
foundational
 
00:24:57.389 --> 00:24:57.399 align:start position:0%
components and so I I'm going to be
 
00:24:58.990 --> 00:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
talking about screenshots and the
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
technology and those type of things a
 
00:25:02.909 --> 00:25:02.919 align:start position:0%
little bit not very deep but what I want
 
00:25:05.389 --> 00:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
to address is you know technolog is
 
00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:07.480 align:start position:0%
critical but but again I've already said
 
00:25:08.669 --> 00:25:08.679 align:start position:0%
this but I want to say it again
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
developing sound processes um and
 
00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:14.200 align:start position:0%
practices and support for the system you
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
know are also critical because you'll
 
00:25:17.789 --> 00:25:17.799 align:start position:0%
never get to a technology unless you
 
00:25:20.389 --> 00:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
address those so on the right hand side
 
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
you'll see some boxes access policy
 
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
security authentication user admin
 
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
training requirements system auditing
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
communication I'm going to talk a little
 
00:25:30.389 --> 00:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
bit more about those because those are
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
foundational to anyone trying to do an
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
effort like this um so access policy so
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
when you think about this this is your
 
00:25:39.149 --> 00:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
governance so from a governance
 
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
perspective there's there's a couple
 
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
different aspects of this one is those
 
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
that contribute data to the system and
 
00:25:47.789 --> 00:25:47.799 align:start position:0%
that's addressing and identifying all
 
00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:51.039 align:start position:0%
the privacy and and and you know sieges
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
and security concerns that may need to
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
be addressed um and making sure
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
everyone's comfortable in how the data
 
00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
is going to be handled manag managed
 
00:26:01.149 --> 00:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
protected and who's going to be using it
 
00:26:02.669 --> 00:26:02.679 align:start position:0%
right so that's really critical to get
 
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
out of the blocks what's also critical
 
00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:07.919 align:start position:0%
is you know organizations organiz those
 
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
700 organizations need to also know um
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
what they can do on their side so that
 
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
might be a local police department needs
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
to sign a policy and needs to review a
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
policy and and there needs to be
 
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
conversations to make sure they
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
understand how their um how their
 
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
officers can use the system similar with
 
00:26:27.389 --> 00:26:27.399 align:start position:0%
the courts and those type of things so
 
00:26:30.269 --> 00:26:30.279 align:start position:0%
very well documented um processes that
 
00:26:32.389 --> 00:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
are followed policies that are updated
 
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
as they need to be as new data is added
 
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
as data is changed as we see you know
 
00:26:39.149 --> 00:26:39.159 align:start position:0%
changes in the world that privacy
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
policies change we need to address those
 
00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
and I I know I took a lot of time going
 
00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
through that but I think we all know
 
00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
those are very important things the
 
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:49.240 align:start position:0%
other is security and authentication and
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
and that's you know something you do
 
00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
right so this isn't necessarily a policy
 
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
this is how do you protect that data and
 
00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
making sure everyone's you know informed
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
and comfortable with that but it's also
 
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
about how you actually access the system
 
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
so this system is protected by
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
multiactor authentication so you know
 
00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
it's two factors to be able to log in to
 
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
be able to um get gain access to the
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
data Etc um user Administration so this
 
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
is a state system but you know there's
 
00:27:21.789 --> 00:27:21.799 align:start position:0%
it's it's deployed to those 700
 
00:27:24.669 --> 00:27:24.679 align:start position:0%
organizations the state doesn't know
 
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily when a user from a police
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
Department comes and goes so being able
 
00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
to deliver that delegated administrative
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
Authority back to the agencies to manage
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
and control their users and and to
 
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
create super admins that you know that
 
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
that are part of the system is real
 
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
important too otherwise it's just a
 
00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
jumbled mess and making sure practices
 
00:27:47.509 --> 00:27:47.519 align:start position:0%
are in place to do that the other is
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
training requirements right so if you're
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
going to use the system we want you to
 
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:54.559 align:start position:0%
know how to use the system right what
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
and so we have these practices access
 
00:27:58.669 --> 00:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
policy those typ type of things but how
 
00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
do you put that into practice right
 
00:28:03.389 --> 00:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
we're not going to provide uh data to a
 
00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
certain role that doesn't need to see
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
that data but at the end of the day we
 
00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:12.200 align:start position:0%
don't want a court official um someone
 
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
that's you know determining bail those
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
type of things to not understand how to
 
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
use that system and and miss out on
 
00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
intelligence that would have been
 
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
important for that next action right um
 
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
and then uh the system administ system
 
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
auditing so that's user system so
 
00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:31.519 align:start position:0%
especially in this space you know we set
 
00:28:33.549 --> 00:28:33.559 align:start position:0%
up from the day one an auditing
 
00:28:35.549 --> 00:28:35.559 align:start position:0%
capability that is every click is
 
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
audited so what John carelles does in
 
00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
the system who I search um all my
 
00:28:44.029 --> 00:28:44.039 align:start position:0%
activity is auditable we uh the state
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
also publishes or puts back to whoever's
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
identified in the agency let's say it's
 
00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:51.039 align:start position:0%
a local police department the chief of
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
police or Court official those type of
 
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
things we will provide back audit
 
00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
reports on their users so they can see
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
hey is this kind of normal activity um
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
compared to other users in my
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
organization um and if if not they can
 
00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
request deeper audits to say I want to
 
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
know what this individual's been doing
 
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
for however period of time to see if
 
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
they're using the data uh the system
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
appropriately so having those audit
 
00:29:19.509 --> 00:29:19.519 align:start position:0%
capabilities to understand how folks are
 
00:29:21.149 --> 00:29:21.159 align:start position:0%
using it holding them accountable as
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
well is is absolutely important to that
 
00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
system and then I have communication and
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
communication is a across the board but
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
there's a couple things I want to
 
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
highlight about communication which is
 
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
we have so much data in this system
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
that's updated very frequently so when
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
we think about some of the data uploads
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
every night um or multiple times a day
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
some of it's real time and some of that
 
00:29:46.509 --> 00:29:46.519 align:start position:0%
data is warrants that's real time
 
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
protective orders all those things DMV
 
00:29:51.789 --> 00:29:51.799 align:start position:0%
um images those type of things it's real
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
time um information so that you can
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
react to and again some of it's updated
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
every night communicating to the users
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
so they can see when was this data last
 
00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
updated um is important so in their
 
00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
reports they can see the data I'm
 
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
looking at it when was it tagged it was
 
00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
updated 5 minutes ago or was it updated
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
you know um is it real time and it's
 
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
literally current as of this second and
 
00:30:18.029 --> 00:30:18.039 align:start position:0%
I say like real time like warrants um
 
00:30:20.269 --> 00:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
warrants is real time is there a warrant
 
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
that we need to be aware of but then it
 
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
may not hit your criminal criminal
 
00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:27.919 align:start position:0%
history until it loads that that night
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
into your criminal history right so it
 
00:30:31.509 --> 00:30:31.519 align:start position:0%
uploads once a day but it's also real
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
time to tell you if there's an issue so
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
again it's a it's a it's a really um uh
 
00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:40.039 align:start position:0%
you know all these factors all these
 
00:30:42.029 --> 00:30:42.039 align:start position:0%
things really are uh have to be
 
00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:43.720 align:start position:0%
addressed before even implementing you
 
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
know a technology solution um the next
 
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
slide slide nine is just again I'm not
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
going to cover much here but here are
 
00:30:53.789 --> 00:30:53.799 align:start position:0%
some of the roles that access this and
 
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
each state may call different roles
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
differently magistrate May you know be
 
00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
be setting bail in North Carolina um you
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
might have I think bail Commissioners um
 
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
and then you also have judges depending
 
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
on the offenses and those type of things
 
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
and charges excuse me that uh you know
 
00:31:11.549 --> 00:31:11.559 align:start position:0%
that that may be looking at this but
 
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to clearly show here is
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
that there's roles and you fit into one
 
00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
of these roles or you don't have access
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
to the system okay and the other thing
 
00:31:21.629 --> 00:31:21.639 align:start position:0%
is when we start talking about this type
 
00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:23.919 align:start position:0%
of data really any sensitive D data in
 
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
government you know I know the state of
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
North Carolina takes us approach I know
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
SAS takes this approach which is minimum
 
00:31:33.629 --> 00:31:33.639 align:start position:0%
data necessary to do your job right so
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
we don't want to hold data back from
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
people that you know could really use it
 
00:31:40.029 --> 00:31:40.039 align:start position:0%
to to you know do a better job at
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
delivering Services back to
 
00:31:43.789 --> 00:31:43.799 align:start position:0%
organizations but data is risk right so
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
if you don't need it you don't have it
 
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
and that's the approach that that's
 
00:31:49.789 --> 00:31:49.799 align:start position:0%
taken here and again um not trying to be
 
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
stingy we're just trying to be
 
00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.230 align:start position:0%
stingy we're just trying to be
responsible

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:55.240 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
okay next slide uh um which is slide 10
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
and this is just a a a kind of a
 
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
depiction this is the navigation menu
 
00:32:05.629 --> 00:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
and I know it's really hard to read and
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to be going through this
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
because um we would be here till Friday
 
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:12.200 align:start position:0%
um which I'm happy to do um but I don't
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
think that's what you're looking for um
 
00:32:16.669 --> 00:32:16.679 align:start position:0%
we'll be happy to don't feel rushed uh
 
00:32:18.149 --> 00:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure we get all the all
 
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
the available information that may apply
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
to this excellent okay thank you uh Mr
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
chair um so on the navigation and the
 
00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:28.039 align:start position:0%
menu it's really simple so so a couple
 
00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
things I want to call out we'll put any
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
type of immediate news that folks need
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
to be aware of um we'll put back on
 
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
screen you know remember your access
 
00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
policy and whatnot and then we get
 
00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
provide simple navigation um I'm going
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
to transition and and go through some of
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
the actual screenshots but what I want
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
to also highlight is you're looking at
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
what the system would look like but this
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
even the screenshots are from a demo
 
00:32:55.629 --> 00:32:55.639 align:start position:0%
system okay so we have a live demo
 
00:32:58.269 --> 00:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
system that does not have any real data
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
in it it's all fictitious right it's
 
00:33:03.149 --> 00:33:03.159 align:start position:0%
made up just for the purposes of
 
00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
training and the purposes of
 
00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:08.360 align:start position:0%
demonstration so when you see names um
 
00:33:10.509 --> 00:33:10.519 align:start position:0%
that they're not real um I just want to
 
00:33:12.669 --> 00:33:12.679 align:start position:0%
be clear on that um I'm going to
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
highlight kind of how the system would
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
work and how you would uh also um
 
00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
interact with it um but what I really
 
00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
want to get into show you the
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
comprehensive uh details of what's in
 
00:33:26.629 --> 00:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
that system as well at a very high level
 
00:33:26.639 --> 00:33:27.750 align:start position:0%
that system as well at a very high level
still

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
so next slide is slide 11 and I want to
 
00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
uh kind of not so much tell a story but
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
discuss how someone might use this
 
00:33:40.269 --> 00:33:40.279 align:start position:0%
system so if I do a search and I'm doing
 
00:33:43.789 --> 00:33:43.799 align:start position:0%
a search on John Porter John Julian
 
00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
Porter uh Jay Porter um what it's going
 
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
to return is and I'm just searching on
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
an individual's name there's DMV
 
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
searches there's partial name searches
 
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
there's you know other criteria that you
 
00:33:58.830 --> 00:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
could search on on but the results are
 
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
the same it presents back the system
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
presents back who based on the
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
information you provided who is likely
 
00:34:08.589 --> 00:34:08.599 align:start position:0%
the individual you're looking for and
 
00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
then it will provide some other folks
 
00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
that might be similar so that you can
 
00:34:14.589 --> 00:34:14.599 align:start position:0%
make a determination do I have that
 
00:34:16.829 --> 00:34:16.839 align:start position:0%
right person um because you may be
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
staring at this individual and now you
 
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
see a picture and it's like it's not
 
00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
number one it's number
 
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
two it does and it also does um uh
 
00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:30.919 align:start position:0%
things like uh um uh fuzzy matching and
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
then soundex which is how someone's name
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
sounds and and does the any resolution
 
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
around that so there's many factors I
 
00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
mean obviously you can search on social
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
security number and those type of things
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
if you have it but there's many ways
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
into the system and part of that depends
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
on your role part of that depends on you
 
00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:49.720 align:start position:0%
know what you're doing if you're pulling
 
00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
someone over um and you have a license
 
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:54.839 align:start position:0%
plate you're that's your way into the
 
00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:56.440 align:start position:0%
system to understand who you're dealing
 
00:34:58.990 --> 00:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
with um but sometimes you may have start
 
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:01.240 align:start position:0%
with a with an ID you may start with
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
just them telling who them who who they
 
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
are um but recognizing at the time of
 
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
arrest uh not trying to be um snarky but
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of Donald Ducks and Santa
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
Claus at the time of arrest right so you
 
00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
know you want to know kind of those
 
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
things too because even at the time of
 
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
arrest they may say they're Donald Duck
 
00:35:20.109 --> 00:35:20.119 align:start position:0%
but they may say they live at 100 Main
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
Street that might be enough information
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
you know it's hard to consistently lie
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
right so they may provide a a sniff of
 
00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
the right information for you to find
 
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
out who they are right so um hopefully
 
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
that makes sense the other thing that
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
that you're seeing is a bunch of red
 
00:35:40.349 --> 00:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
letters and that's really important
 
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
because we put things in red that that
 
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
you need to react to so in red you'll
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
see these are warning warning icons or
 
00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
Flags is what we call them and so
 
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
AWC which is approach with caution
 
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
that's the most immediate thing you need
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
to see and I know that's more particular
 
00:35:58.750 --> 00:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
for law enforcement but still really
 
00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599 align:start position:0%
important and you'll see other red flags
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
going across John Julian Porter that are
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
also important and this isn't the nicest
 
00:36:08.349 --> 00:36:08.359 align:start position:0%
individual in North Carolina if it was a
 
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
real person because there's a lot of
 
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:12.280 align:start position:0%
stuff going on here this person has has
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
orders for arrest they're a sex offender
 
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
they're habitual felling um they have
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
protected orders they have been involved
 
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
in Community Corrections they're gang
 
00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
affiliated so on and so on so again this
 
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
is a little bit much but when you start
 
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
using this in the real world you'll see
 
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
maybe one or two flags that you need to
 
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
immediately think about address and
 
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
figure out how you're going to respond
 
00:36:37.589 --> 00:36:37.599 align:start position:0%
to and and so that's the most critical
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
thing um so this is kind of that high
 
00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:43.240 align:start position:0%
Lev view just determining who someone is
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
but it's still giving you enough
 
00:36:47.069 --> 00:36:47.079 align:start position:0%
information to react to okay so I want
 
00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:48.599 align:start position:0%
to put that out there but if you were to
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
click in to view more and that would be
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
on the next
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
slide and you know this is a
 
00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
comprehensive summary but it's not a
 
00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.190 align:start position:0%
comprehensive summary but it's not a
detail

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
detail
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
summary so as you click in again what
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
you see is red right I know it's a
 
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
little bit kind of a orangey red but
 
00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's red um those are the things that
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
you need to think about address or
 
00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
basically activity going on with this
 
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
individual that you need to be aware of
 
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
so you'll see a lot of other information
 
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
on here you can actually go through
 
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
things like past addresses and and
 
00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
there's watch lists and other
 
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
capabilities on here but again I'm just
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
addressing I want to talk a little bit
 
00:37:28.309 --> 00:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
about the the navigation and how you
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
drill even further um in this you know
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
getting this detailed information for
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
you to react to and respond to so in the
 
00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:36.839 align:start position:0%
red you know you'll see what's going on
 
00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:39.560 align:start position:0%
you can see sex offender you can see the
 
00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:41.960 align:start position:0%
um been in prison and all these
 
00:37:44.309 --> 00:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
different factors um but then you'll see
 
00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
also um in the middle of the page that
 
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
this person has two pending um court
 
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
cases so if we wanted to click and you
 
00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:54.079 align:start position:0%
can click on the left nav or you can
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
click right on that to understand what
 
00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
are those two pen pending court cases
 
00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
because that's really important um so if
 
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
you click on there if you go to the next
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
slide and again I apologize it's a
 
00:38:05.309 --> 00:38:05.319 align:start position:0%
little hard to
 
00:38:09.309 --> 00:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
read but at the very top you can see um
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
those two pending cases the county and
 
00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:13.880 align:start position:0%
you can see that these this is for
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
traffic these court cases and there's
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
ability to scroll all the way to the
 
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
right there's a ton more information on
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
here now if there was uh disposed of
 
00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
cases you would see all those I I think
 
00:38:28.109 --> 00:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
on the previous page this is where it's
 
00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
demo and we try and in training I know
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
with the state try and throw some
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
anomalies at folks to understand like
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
the previous page said I think there
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
were 62 disposed cases but when you come
 
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
to this page there's only two well
 
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
that's kind of for training purposes
 
00:38:44.349 --> 00:38:44.359 align:start position:0%
what doesn't add up so if you see some
 
00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
of those anomalies that's intentional
 
00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
okay um but if you want to go a little
 
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
further sometimes it's about um those
 
00:38:55.109 --> 00:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
details and if you go to the next slide
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's you know you want to
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
frame what you're looking at so you're
 
00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
looking at data you're looking at tables
 
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
you're looking at information but
 
00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes you want to see things on a
 
00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
timeline like how how clustered were
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
these events this criminal history um
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
you know is this a real recent Trend or
 
00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:15.640 align:start position:0%
was it you know 20 years ago where a lot
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
of this was so so again the looking at
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
the criminal history on a time
 
00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
timeline's very helpful and if you were
 
00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:24.079 align:start position:0%
to click on the icons on the timeline
 
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
you would get more details about that
 
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.309 align:start position:0%
you would get more details about that
event

00:39:27.309 --> 00:39:27.319 align:start position:0%
event
 
00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:29.839 align:start position:0%
um you can also um I've got the timeline
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
set up for basically year-over-year you
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
can actually go deeper and look at you
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
know briefer periods of time um because
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
that may be important to you as well um
 
00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:41.480 align:start position:0%
in determining what your next move is
 
00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
right your next action so I think having
 
00:39:47.069 --> 00:39:47.079 align:start position:0%
the ability to look both at kind of this
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
this you know very heavy textual type of
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
information good but then to be able to
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
see that timeline's also helpful for
 
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
some instances and we've heard um from
 
00:39:59.309 --> 00:39:59.319 align:start position:0%
our users and testimonials about both
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
have been really helpful so so um what I
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
want to just briefly um talk about um is
 
00:40:10.109 --> 00:40:10.119 align:start position:0%
also some of the reporting so what I'm
 
00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
not showing is all the different can
 
00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:13.839 align:start position:0%
reports and or or I should say
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
predefined reports in the system that
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
users want to interact with so you know
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
I'm showing searches and how you can
 
00:40:23.109 --> 00:40:23.119 align:start position:0%
dive deeper into the various um criminal
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
history and those type of things but
 
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes you just want show me the
 
00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:29.480 align:start position:0%
information here's my person I'm I'm
 
00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:31.839 align:start position:0%
looking at the offender now just produce
 
00:40:34.349 --> 00:40:34.359 align:start position:0%
a report so I can actually just you know
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
look at it succinctly and and I can go
 
00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
through what's important to me so one
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
example of this is that's been really
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
helpful for you know our folks that are
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
looking at you know uh bail and and
 
00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
those type of things and conditions Etc
 
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
is been the pre-trial report and so this
 
00:40:52.829 --> 00:40:52.839 align:start position:0%
is a report that again certain users can
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
go to they can run that report it's
 
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
audited what they're doing why they're
 
00:41:00.109 --> 00:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
doing it and be able to return um
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
information and results and I'm showing
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
this a little bit differently because uh
 
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
if I showed you just kind of a report it
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make as much sense in a small
 
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
form factor um like the slide so what I
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
want to describe is all the information
 
00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
that's contained in that pre-trial
 
00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
report for an offender so this next
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
slide 16 shows pre-trial report in the
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
middle and I want to talk about and I'm
 
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
going to show more details on this but I
 
00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
want to talk about some of what data is
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
being pulled back in to that report so
 
00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:31.720 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
convictions um and and that's obviously
 
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
important but the violent convictions
 
00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:39.640 align:start position:0%
are called out separately because of how
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
important that is when thinking about um
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
if someone should be released while they
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
you know wait trial um probation um uh
 
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
you know uh unserved warrants um orders
 
00:41:56.309 --> 00:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
for arrest uh pending cases and we we
 
00:41:58.589 --> 00:41:58.599 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of feedback from our users
 
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
when this went live that you know they
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
may um they may be making
 
00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
determinations without recognizing that
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
there's pending casing cases in other
 
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
counties um there's uh even if there are
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
cases in other counties um that they
 
00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
they weren't aware that they didn't show
 
00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
up right so there's a lot of factors
 
00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
that go into it so having that
 
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
information here is important um failure
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
to appear of course I was covering that
 
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
as well so this is really what we heard
 
00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
was um this was enough information
 
00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
really good information for a
 
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
professional to be able to make a really
 
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
good um uh uh evidence-based judgment
 
00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
okay so if you go to slide
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
17 um this is is not the prettiest
 
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:49.720 align:start position:0%
picture but I want to I wanted to unpack
 
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
that previous slide a little bit and and
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
again with data in here it actually
 
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
looks more messy so what I wanted to do
 
00:43:00.349 --> 00:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
was is go through um you know those same
 
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
data that's coming into this pre-trial
 
00:43:05.309 --> 00:43:05.319 align:start position:0%
report and provide what details of that
 
00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
data come in so you can see what data is
 
00:43:09.549 --> 00:43:09.559 align:start position:0%
in the convictions and violent
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
convictions so I mean what's important
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
what's the last violent um violent
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
conviction date right so is this
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
something that happened 20 years ago is
 
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
this something that happened two years
 
00:43:22.109 --> 00:43:22.119 align:start position:0%
ago or one year ago because those are
 
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
the factors and judgment calls that
 
00:43:25.549 --> 00:43:25.559 align:start position:0%
professionals can make when they see
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
that information
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
um again the pending cases you can see
 
00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
things we have 100 counties in North
 
00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
Carolina um people move people travel
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
across counties um people thinking about
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
like DWIs there was one instent where um
 
00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:42.280 align:start position:0%
someone had when the system first went
 
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
live um they were treating DWI sometimes
 
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
like it was their first DWI in this
 
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
County but there was two other DWI in
 
00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
two other counties across the state or
 
00:43:56.309 --> 00:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
even next door where there are waiting
 
00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
trial and those type of things so
 
00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
understanding the totality of that
 
00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
individual's or offender criminal
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
history and and what's pending and those
 
00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:07.160 align:start position:0%
type of things you know allows them to
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
take take that action um the other thing
 
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
I should say is this is available 24 by7
 
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
um it's it's it's it's set up in a way
 
00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839 align:start position:0%
where you know active active where you
 
00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
know you could have some when something
 
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
goes down you have another replicated
 
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
system come up so that there's very
 
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
little lag or downtime in this system
 
00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
because of the criticality of what it
 
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
and who it serves and and what it
 
00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:37.640 align:start position:0%
does um so if you go to the next page
 
00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:41.240 align:start position:0%
this is a little uh a little different
 
00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
uh uh spin on this system or a little
 
00:44:46.829 --> 00:44:46.839 align:start position:0%
different highlight of this system so
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
you know I'm talking a lot about um
 
00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
criminal justice and uh the the uh you
 
00:44:54.549 --> 00:44:54.559 align:start position:0%
know having that information for those
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
professionals but there's other
 
00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
important important information than it
 
00:44:59.589 --> 00:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
surfaces and one thing that I think is
 
00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:01.240 align:start position:0%
really important that came a little
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
later in this system was we work do a
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
lot of work with our Juvenile Justice um
 
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
department and we wanted to and and the
 
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice department in North
 
00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
Carolina wanted this of course as well
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
and same with all the partners in this
 
00:45:18.069 --> 00:45:18.079 align:start position:0%
um system they wanted to be able to
 
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
address opportunities to um Pro uh
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
identify programs across the state and
 
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
so you're seeing um a juvenile justice
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
service directory that's built into the
 
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
system and what I would say is um it
 
00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
provides extensive search capability
 
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
again it's 100 counties um we have a lot
 
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
of services that we offer juveniles but
 
00:45:40.549 --> 00:45:40.559 align:start position:0%
making sure that folks are aware of
 
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
where to go depending on the problem so
 
00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
a law enforcement officer could use this
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
system and try and work with the family
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
and identify some services that may be
 
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
really important to them whether they're
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
um you know alcohol and drug mental
 
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
health aggression you know all these
 
00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
different factors and they can search
 
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
regionally to provide that information
 
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
unlike the rest of the system where
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
you're very very um strict on what you
 
00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
can print how you can print it who you
 
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
can provide it to if you do print it
 
00:46:12.349 --> 00:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
this is one of those that you know print
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
print it will share it will um because
 
00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
this is one of those just trying to
 
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
direct people to the right level of
 
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
services or or you know in their area
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
and where they live so this is a nice
 
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
add-on um to the system um um to provide
 
00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
another different level of service that
 
00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
you know wasn't what the original system
 
00:46:34.109 --> 00:46:34.119 align:start position:0%
was designed to do over the course of
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
time there's additional features and
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
capabilities and there's also um
 
00:46:41.549 --> 00:46:41.559 align:start position:0%
interactions with other systems such as
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
child welfare you know ensuring that you
 
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
know if something's happening in this
 
00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
system that child welfare knows um for
 
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
there's another similar system that we
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
provided that looks like this that may
 
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
put again information a lot of this
 
00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
information can't be shared with a child
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
welfare worker but what can be shared is
 
00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
a child's at risk based on what we know
 
00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
from this system you know something's
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
happening at a household or with an
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
individual um so some of that
 
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
information can flow into that system so
 
00:47:13.069 --> 00:47:13.079 align:start position:0%
that you know it might be just call your
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
Police Department something happened at
 
00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
this address call your you know re
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
directing to Services basically so again
 
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of um what I call
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
extensibility to what we've done by
 
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:29.240 align:start position:0%
integrating this criminal justice data
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to talk a little bit more
 
00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
about that on the next slide so you know
 
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
CJ leads what I'm showing to to you it's
 
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
amazing system 25,000 users and people
 
00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:41.960 align:start position:0%
love it and I'm not trying to minimize
 
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
it but it's very operationally focused
 
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
right so when I say operationally
 
00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
focused that's really what do I need to
 
00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:51.640 align:start position:0%
do right now like in this situation what
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
do I need to do but as you integrate
 
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
this criminal justice data you start to
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
look at the research and the trend and
 
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
the forecasting to to really start to
 
00:48:02.589 --> 00:48:02.599 align:start position:0%
answer different questions right and I'm
 
00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
not showing you that side I'm showing
 
00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
you the the kind of operational side and
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
those questions are what is happening
 
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
why is it happening um and what will
 
00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
happen right what's the best predictor
 
00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:16.280 align:start position:0%
on what may happen right so so you're
 
00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
start to trying to answer different
 
00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
questions but it's the same data that
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
you integrated it's just looking at it
 
00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:24.200 align:start position:0%
differently and then you know taking
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
that third kind of lens on once you have
 
00:48:28.829 --> 00:48:28.839 align:start position:0%
the integrated data is you know
 
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
obviously specifically in yall's
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
important roles with New Hampshire is
 
00:48:35.549 --> 00:48:35.559 align:start position:0%
that policy development which is not
 
00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
just what's happening how do we
 
00:48:40.109 --> 00:48:40.119 align:start position:0%
intervene right um what's the impact on
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
our services and what's the impact our
 
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
investments you know what's the impact
 
00:48:46.589 --> 00:48:46.599 align:start position:0%
on our with our investments on the
 
00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:47.720 align:start position:0%
people of New
 
00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:54.589 align:start position:0%
people of New
Hampshire

00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:54.599 --> 00:48:59.510 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
yeah and you might want to include
 
00:49:02.789 --> 00:49:02.799 align:start position:0%
there's so that's another one of those
 
00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
complex um uh you know problems that
 
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:07.640 align:start position:0%
you'd probably need to look into Health
 
00:49:09.789 --> 00:49:09.799 align:start position:0%
Data and other data so I would say it's
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
not just this system but your your your
 
00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
um your use your use case is along those
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
um and so I'm actually done with the
 
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
formal presentation so I think I said
 
00:49:46.109 --> 00:49:46.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
close you tell me can you tell me how
 
00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
and if you link are you linked the
 
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
system linked to sieges so for example
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
um would a user be able to access a
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
triple I record through your user
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
interface interface so you're talking
 
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
about U more like the hot files yeah so
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
the federal level Federal level so if
 
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
you go back to that one chart the answer
 
00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
is yes and sort of and I'll describe the
 
00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
sort of okay it is linked from within
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
that system um we use in our state which
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
is what links it um our NC I through you
 
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
know so what we've done is uh for a
 
00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
certain of users you can actually um
 
00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
through CJ leads once you're in there be
 
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
able to authenticate through to receive
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
information on I believe it's the the I
 
00:50:41.069 --> 00:50:41.079 align:start position:0%
think it's module one and two which are
 
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
the you know St stolen vehicles warrants
 
00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
and those most important things are
 
00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
what's included in the system and it's
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
identified on that table the details of
 
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
what's contained in that but the answer
 
00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
is yes so would I be interested to with
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
an officer on the street say with a
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
mobile terminal when he runs an
 
00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
individual be able to see if he has a
 
00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
warrant from another state absolutely so
 
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
that's for so we have and this is where
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
the sort of comes in we have it for a
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
certain number of users because um
 
00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:12.280 align:start position:0%
that's other that that functionality is
 
00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:13.400 align:start position:0%
run through our state Bureau
 
00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
Investigation and we've done an
 
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
integration and we've done an
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
integration for um Federal uh wanted and
 
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
missing persons um state vehicle um
 
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me I'm sorry stolen vehicles um
 
00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:30.680 align:start position:0%
guns and other articles and then um out
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
ofate um driver's license in vehicle
 
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
registrations but it's been deployed to
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
a small subset of the system but it
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
could be deployed to the larger subset
 
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
in North Carolina you have a cost model
 
00:51:45.309 --> 00:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
to be able to access that and so that's
 
00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
kind of been the um the hurdle to be
 
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
able to deliver it to more folks so
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
that's where the sort of come in it's
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
done people are accessing it but it's
 
00:51:58.030 --> 00:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
not uh for a a very large set of the
 
00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
users yet I think the the federal um
 
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
through the FBI they're pretty limited
 
00:52:04.349 --> 00:52:04.359 align:start position:0%
on who they will allow access to anyway
 
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
abely and the training as well that
 
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
comes with that Etc um and my and my
 
00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
next question um related to that is that
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
I know by federal law the courts have to
 
00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:17.720 align:start position:0%
have um protective orders entered within
 
00:52:21.069 --> 00:52:21.079 align:start position:0%
minutes um uh is the court able to enter
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
protective orders through this system if
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
they were to have it um so
 
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
the answer to that's no and I should
 
00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
have probably said this during the
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
presentation it's not that they couldn't
 
00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:32.680 align:start position:0%
um but that's not the functionality
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
today so this system is really not
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
replicating any data I mean excuse me
 
00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
it's only replicating data so it's not
 
00:52:44.789 --> 00:52:44.799 align:start position:0%
um a system of record from like the
 
00:52:46.789 --> 00:52:46.799 align:start position:0%
entry point of the data there's some
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
data that's created within it like audit
 
00:52:51.789 --> 00:52:51.799 align:start position:0%
auditing you know logs and user you know
 
00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
the user um interactions as well as
 
00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
watch list and those type of things but
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
what's interesting about this system
 
00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:00.440 align:start position:0%
which is probably no different than
 
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
other states is you have those Source
 
00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
systems that state Silo this sits in the
 
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
middle of all of them and then it takes
 
00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
in the information so like protective
 
00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:12.200 align:start position:0%
orders soon as it's entered that's a
 
00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
real-time service but it's not entered
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
in CJ
 
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
leads so in other words if you are a a
 
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:21.880 align:start position:0%
judge in a court and you issue a
 
00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
protective order your clerk has to enter
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
it in CJ leads as well as into the
 
00:53:30.430 --> 00:53:30.440 align:start position:0%
federal system so wherever they would
 
00:53:32.109 --> 00:53:32.119 align:start position:0%
enter it into because they would enter
 
00:53:34.589 --> 00:53:34.599 align:start position:0%
it at the state level as well and then
 
00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
it would go to Federal it would then be
 
00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
uh accessible through CJ leads so if
 
00:53:44.349 --> 00:53:44.359 align:start position:0%
there's a a protective order that is in
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
the state so to speak we'll talk North
 
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:49.480 align:start position:0%
Carolina as soon as that is in the
 
00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
system of record then that actually
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
would then be um come up on if if you're
 
00:53:57.069 --> 00:53:57.079 align:start position:0%
searching a fender and there's a
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
protective order a real-time service
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
would go and check to see if there's
 
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
anything in that system and it would
 
00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
surface that flag okay so they don't
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
have to make duplicate entries your
 
00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:09.160 align:start position:0%
system captures what they enter into the
 
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
already existing system am I that is a
 
00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
that is and I'm sorry to be informal I
 
00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:18.280 align:start position:0%
should but um this is uh that's a really
 
00:54:20.829 --> 00:54:20.839 align:start position:0%
good point across the whole system um
 
00:54:22.829 --> 00:54:22.839 align:start position:0%
this is not a duplicate effort for
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
agencies the duplicate effort for
 
00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
agencies is just from uh talk from
 
00:54:29.789 --> 00:54:29.799 align:start position:0%
thinking about getting data into the
 
00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
system is really participating and
 
00:54:35.349 --> 00:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
understanding the data participating in
 
00:54:37.069 --> 00:54:37.079 align:start position:0%
you know contributing their data through
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
some type of data file whatever you know
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
method we're going to use um and and
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
then potentially uh obviously receiver
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
be a receiver of access to that
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
information or access to the system for
 
00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:51.400 align:start position:0%
looking a a more complete record not
 
00:54:53.789 --> 00:54:53.799 align:start position:0%
just what they had in their own agency's
 
00:54:56.109 --> 00:54:56.119 align:start position:0%
system but looking across all the
 
00:54:58.430 --> 00:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
different um criminal histories and
 
00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:01.640 align:start position:0%
interactions so your point um is
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
something I should have made which is
 
00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:05.720 align:start position:0%
you don't enter data typically into the
 
00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
system the systems
 
00:55:10.109 --> 00:55:10.119 align:start position:0%
exist so we're already leveraging
 
00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:11.640 align:start position:0%
Investments that have been made in those
 
00:55:13.870 --> 00:55:13.880 align:start position:0%
systems as those systems change and
 
00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
improve the data still continues to flow
 
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
into this
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
system okay so I'm I'm picturing your
 
00:55:23.029 --> 00:55:23.039 align:start position:0%
system as kind of a spiderweb that
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
connects all these other different
 
00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
things and it captures the information
 
00:55:29.549 --> 00:55:29.559 align:start position:0%
so if I enter my information in my court
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
system your system's connected in the
 
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
background to capture that information
 
00:55:35.029 --> 00:55:35.039 align:start position:0%
yes and that's how that gets in there
 
00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:37.640 align:start position:0%
way absolutely and so um and you know
 
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
there's all sorts of business rules Etc
 
00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
like expungements and those type of
 
00:55:44.109 --> 00:55:44.119 align:start position:0%
things we account for that in the system
 
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
um but I would look at it more like a
 
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:48.839 align:start position:0%
kind of a hub and spoke yeah um this is
 
00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
the one system you can go to that
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
captures cross Agency information I see
 
00:55:56.789 --> 00:55:56.799 align:start position:0%
so the same agencies that are
 
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
contributing data are also the biggest
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
users of this data because they need to
 
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
see across the the actual now um
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
criminal justice data system again that
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
we have to be very plain and say it
 
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
really didn't exist before this okay um
 
00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:19.480 align:start position:0%
next question I have is as far as
 
00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:21.880 align:start position:0%
um data
 
00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
analytics would someone be able to say I
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
would like to see um and I'm not sure
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
which agency would be the the place to
 
00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
go to get data but if say for a
 
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
university wanted to do a study and say
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
we would like to see how many people of
 
00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:41.480 align:start position:0%
um Lithuanian descent or or whatever um
 
00:56:43.069 --> 00:56:43.079 align:start position:0%
have been arrested from this period to
 
00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
this period on this charges and how many
 
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
went to jail how many didn't are you
 
00:56:49.549 --> 00:56:49.559 align:start position:0%
able to capture that informator and
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
generate reports I'm going you know that
 
00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
there's a the specifics of what you're
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
providing is is kind of like you know
 
00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
probably depending on how it's asked is
 
00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
the answer is no but in general research
 
00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
researchers ability to to gain
 
00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
information from the system what has
 
00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
happened in the past is um agencies have
 
00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
come to trust this Hub GAC and as
 
00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
they're contributing their data for CJ
 
00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
leads um you know there may be
 
00:57:19.789 --> 00:57:19.799 align:start position:0%
additional uses for their data um that's
 
00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
not for GAC to determine yeah that's for
 
00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
really going back to the agency or or
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
going back to that researcher and saying
 
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
you're requesting information that's
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
involves these two agency or this one
 
00:57:34.589 --> 00:57:34.599 align:start position:0%
agency here's who you need to talk to
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
yeah here's how you need Who who how you
 
00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:38.440 align:start position:0%
need to approach them there may be forms
 
00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
for that agency what the agency might do
 
00:57:43.029 --> 00:57:43.039 align:start position:0%
just because we have experience with
 
00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
that data they may say or have hey we
 
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
had this request come in for our data
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
you're already getting a feed is there
 
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
any way that you guys are maybe more
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
capable to get back this information to
 
00:57:58.150 --> 00:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
this individual or you know or research
 
00:57:59.789 --> 00:57:59.799 align:start position:0%
institution what we would then go back
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
to and speak this really speaks to the
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
data governance is go back and look at
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
our agreement and make sure that the
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
agreement accounts for that and if it
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't add it and sign that agreement
 
00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:13.880 align:start position:0%
back between the agency um to ensure
 
00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility with that data and then
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
yes we could potentially do that for
 
00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
more specific let me let me drill it
 
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
down a little more um the counties in
 
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are siloed and um some of the
 
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
Court information you would literally
 
00:58:29.309 --> 00:58:29.319 align:start position:0%
have to drive from court to court to
 
00:58:32.069 --> 00:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
court if you wanted to get a a accurate
 
00:58:35.029 --> 00:58:35.039 align:start position:0%
so if the court system wanted to query
 
00:58:36.029 --> 00:58:36.039 align:start position:0%
its own
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
information to be able to generate some
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
type of report is that something they
 
00:58:43.789 --> 00:58:43.799 align:start position:0%
could do um absolutely okay and so um
 
00:58:45.789 --> 00:58:45.799 align:start position:0%
you know the difference and the nuances
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
between different states um North
 
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
Carolina has the um U the chief justice
 
00:58:53.829 --> 00:58:53.839 align:start position:0%
that oversees the courts and then you
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
have local courts yeah um that that are
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
under that umbrella um for some things
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
um and technology is one of them so we
 
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
have one court system that spans all the
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
counties and all the courts even though
 
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
they may operate a little differently so
 
00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
we're connecting into that one system
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
now if you had multiple systems across
 
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire which I'm and I
 
00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
apologize for being unaware then you
 
00:59:23.829 --> 00:59:23.839 align:start position:0%
just have more Integrations okay okay um
 
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
now my last I think I have is regarding
 
00:59:30.990 --> 00:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
um users so we have a bail commissioner
 
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
system and um we would like our bail
 
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
Commissioners to be able to have
 
00:59:37.069 --> 00:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
realtime access and a lot of this
 
00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
information was really good that showed
 
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839 align:start position:0%
open cases um so because oftentimes they
 
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
may not be aware of uh a bail from
 
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
another County that was recently issued
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
that's so can we designate certain users
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
to have certain access to certain
 
00:59:55.150 --> 00:59:55.160 align:start position:0%
systems only um
 
00:59:57.549 --> 00:59:57.559 align:start position:0%
yes okay so so yeah the role base would
 
00:59:59.430 --> 00:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
allow access to certain systems and
 
01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:01.400 align:start position:0%
really drill down a little further into
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
certain data elements and those systems
 
01:00:05.309 --> 01:00:05.319 align:start position:0%
and and that's where you know I'm
 
01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
presenting North Carolina because it
 
01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
seems like a really um interesting
 
01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:11.240 align:start position:0%
business case to present you know to
 
01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.870 align:start position:0%
business case to present you know to
inly

01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
inly
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
familiar yeah so I think that's a good
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
point but you know each state you know
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
has its own you know policies rules and
 
01:00:24.109 --> 01:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
and positions on on what folks may be
 
01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:25.799 align:start position:0%
able to or may not be able to access we
 
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
know a lot of that's Federal but again
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's how it's how it's done in um each
 
01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
of the states and and part of it you
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
know really is you know there's a
 
01:00:37.589 --> 01:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
training aspect um but part of it if
 
01:00:40.109 --> 01:00:40.119 align:start position:0%
you're doing a new system you know you
 
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to throw everything at
 
01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
everyone yeah so you may want to kind of
 
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
uh it's almost like building blocks you
 
01:00:47.349 --> 01:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
want it to go quickly but you want it to
 
01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
go right correct um so you want to make
 
01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
sure the users understand everything
 
01:00:53.789 --> 01:00:53.799 align:start position:0%
that's happening in the data in the
 
01:00:55.829 --> 01:00:55.839 align:start position:0%
release and you also don't want to go
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
too fast and assign wrong Privileges and
 
01:01:00.430 --> 01:01:00.440 align:start position:0%
you want to make sure that everyone
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
understands what they can have access to
 
01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
and so that's diving into also the
 
01:01:07.029 --> 01:01:07.039 align:start position:0%
business cases right to document that
 
01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
you know um yeah this data might be nice
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
to have but it's not for you right now
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
yeah okay type deal and and it's
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
bidirectional so that the bail
 
01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:16.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner would be able to not only
 
01:01:18.589 --> 01:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
see but enter the bail and the
 
01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
conditions of bail they set and so that
 
01:01:23.029 --> 01:01:23.039 align:start position:0%
the judge would see that in other police
 
01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
departments and bail so that's how it
 
01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:26.680 align:start position:0%
could work okay again that might be more
 
01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
specific to your bail system but the
 
01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
idea of that I guess my questions are is
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
it capable of oh absolutely right it's
 
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
just another source system um so it's
 
01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
just another source of data okay so um
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
again you know thinking about North
 
01:01:42.029 --> 01:01:42.039 align:start position:0%
Carolina North Carolina didn't start
 
01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
with these I don't know 25 different you
 
01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
know large data sets you know it started
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
with what was the most important in the
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
pilot right those things that we want to
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
integrate as quickly as possible um
 
01:01:56.029 --> 01:01:56.039 align:start position:0%
don't boil the ocean and then start
 
01:01:59.470 --> 01:01:59.480 align:start position:0%
layering in additional data yeah um
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
twofold one is as North Carolina this
 
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
this group becomes more capable with it
 
01:02:06.309 --> 01:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
and then the other is you know you don't
 
01:02:07.950 --> 01:02:07.960 align:start position:0%
want to try and do too much and and
 
01:02:10.589 --> 01:02:10.599 align:start position:0%
create the spider whip um you want to do
 
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
do you want to be effective be targeted
 
01:02:16.029 --> 01:02:16.039 align:start position:0%
do it the right way and be successful
 
01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
and show value and then grow from there
 
01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um questions from the
 
01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
committee members um representative rhs
 
01:02:27.789 --> 01:02:27.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I apologize if
 
01:02:29.309 --> 01:02:29.319 align:start position:0%
you answered this but I was taking care
 
01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
of getting the heat turned off in here
 
01:02:33.269 --> 01:02:33.279 align:start position:0%
so you're all welcome
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
um the the information
 
01:02:38.829 --> 01:02:38.839 align:start position:0%
that I know that the committee I speak
 
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
to everybody is very interested in is
 
01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
already out there floating in somewhere
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
land how does that information get put
 
01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
in here in the first place yeah so so I
 
01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
think there's oh permission to answer
 
01:02:52.589 --> 01:02:52.599 align:start position:0%
questions sorry okay I've been out of
 
01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:54.440 align:start position:0%
government a little while so I'm I'm you
 
01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
know my testimony skills are a little
 
01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
lower than they have been some
 
01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
committees are a little stricter I
 
01:03:02.349 --> 01:03:02.359 align:start position:0%
prefer our back and forth conversational
 
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:03.880 align:start position:0%
we get more information that way so feel
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
free to thank you Mr chair um so that's
 
01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:13.240 align:start position:0%
twofold one is um you know uh the the
 
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
the data governance piece is huge and
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
can't be ignored and so data governance
 
01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
is is really important and what I would
 
01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
say is data governance is getting all
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
the right people around the table
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
laying out shared and clear
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
objectives um and and being able to have
 
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
those hard conversations to get to yes
 
01:03:36.029 --> 01:03:36.039 align:start position:0%
we're going to share our data then
 
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
there's the technical side of it right
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
and that's that data integration piece
 
01:03:42.069 --> 01:03:42.079 align:start position:0%
and you know um that that technology
 
01:03:43.870 --> 01:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
deployment and those type of things both
 
01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
of those go hand inand um but there has
 
01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
to be you know there has to be people
 
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
that want to make that happen um and you
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
know again I think you know the
 
01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
legislature is probably in in a great
 
01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
position to to help um kind of spur that
 
01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
along um but I a lot of this is really
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
soft when it's about just people and
 
01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
organizations working together there's
 
01:04:11.549 --> 01:04:11.559 align:start position:0%
privacy concerns there's a whole slew of
 
01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
things that need to be addressed and and
 
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
folks need to address those but again it
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
really comes down to working together
 
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
objectives represent brh I I think the
 
01:04:26.109 --> 01:04:26.119 align:start position:0%
answer to your question was probably
 
01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
answer to my question is the information
 
01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
gets in the
 
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
system when the agency enters it in
 
01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:37.799 align:start position:0%
their system their system captures it so
 
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
is that answer
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
so if I may once upon a time before I
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
decided to be a state legislator I sold
 
01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
real estate and one of the things that
 
01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
drove me crazy is that I had to pay and
 
01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
pay and pay and then I had to belong to
 
01:04:55.069 --> 01:04:55.079 align:start position:0%
the multi list system system and then
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
Along Came
 
01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
realtor.com and Zillow and you they all
 
01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
came along and they took the information
 
01:05:05.349 --> 01:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
that I paid to put into one system and
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
then they took it and then wanted me to
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
pay for that other system that they
 
01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:11.240 align:start position:0%
already took my information from so I
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
understand the the whole spider weip
 
01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
thing but
 
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
I'm so how so but it has to somehow get
 
01:05:19.589 --> 01:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
in there in the first place so does it
 
01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
just say hey we're going to take it now
 
01:05:22.349 --> 01:05:22.359 align:start position:0%
that we were told or does somebody have
 
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
to actually yeah so working with the
 
01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
agencies from a technical perspective
 
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
depending on there's many methods to
 
01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:30.440 align:start position:0%
bring that data into the system I think
 
01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
what you're describing screen scrapes
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
and other types of things that's not
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
what we would do um we would actually
 
01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
work with the agency that's contributing
 
01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
data to put into the system to have a
 
01:05:42.549 --> 01:05:42.559 align:start position:0%
formalized process of them pushing the
 
01:05:46.269 --> 01:05:46.279 align:start position:0%
data to a certain place um very secure
 
01:05:48.109 --> 01:05:48.119 align:start position:0%
uh with the right encryption and those
 
01:05:50.670 --> 01:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
type of thing so um no one else can
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
access it unless you're on the other
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
side have the keys and those type of
 
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
things so it might be pushed or you know
 
01:05:59.349 --> 01:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
you may go in and grab that data um but
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
again on the real time it's a real-time
 
01:06:04.589 --> 01:06:04.599 align:start position:0%
connection into that database to pull
 
01:06:06.109 --> 01:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
things like warrants and protective
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
orders and maybe DMV pictures and those
 
01:06:10.109 --> 01:06:10.119 align:start position:0%
type of things because you don't you
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
want to get that real time you may not
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
want to wait till you know once or twice
 
01:06:16.829 --> 01:06:16.839 align:start position:0%
or three times a day so it is a formal
 
01:06:19.789 --> 01:06:19.799 align:start position:0%
movement of data for most of it and then
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
there's um there's actually then some
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
real-time data connections that happen
 
01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
question yep and there has to be
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
agreements in place and those type of
 
01:06:36.109 --> 01:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
things to ensure that it's secure Etc so
 
01:06:38.829 --> 01:06:38.839 align:start position:0%
you could have scheduled nightly uploads
 
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
Y and also at the same time throughout
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
the day realtime access from the same
 
01:06:47.789 --> 01:06:47.799 align:start position:0%
user yep yep and and and sometimes uh
 
01:06:47.799 --> 01:06:48.470 align:start position:0%
user yep yep and and and sometimes uh
you

01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
know this is an interesting space right
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
so I mentioned expungements that's
 
01:06:54.109 --> 01:06:54.119 align:start position:0%
that's complicated right cuz because
 
01:06:56.829 --> 01:06:56.839 align:start position:0%
it's expunged you shouldn't see it so so
 
01:06:58.430 --> 01:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
there's some data that comes in for
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
North Carolina at least that's a full
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
file reload every single night because
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
some data may disappear and it's it's
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
gone for good right so there's things
 
01:07:09.309 --> 01:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
like that you have to account for which
 
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
are the business processes and the
 
01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
policies Etc and and they may be unique
 
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
to each state that you just need to
 
01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:19.880 align:start position:0%
address um I I have another one case um
 
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
so we talked about criminal justice and
 
01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:25.640 align:start position:0%
the aspect of that is is um the
 
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
DMV so on a timeline how long would it
 
01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
take to implement a system like this
 
01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:35.839 align:start position:0%
that tied in the the court the law
 
01:07:39.269 --> 01:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement and the DMB yeah so that's a
 
01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
a great question that assuming everybody
 
01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
agreed everybody
 
01:07:46.589 --> 01:07:46.599 align:start position:0%
participated so you know that's a great
 
01:07:48.589 --> 01:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
question that I would love to answer in
 
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
more detail but I would need to
 
01:07:52.349 --> 01:07:52.359 align:start position:0%
understand more about the
 
01:07:55.390 --> 01:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
systems um and the architectures and
 
01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
those typee of things um but I think
 
01:08:01.349 --> 01:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
what to me a logical approach would be
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
is to take kind of a step forward and a
 
01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
step back at the same time which might
 
01:08:08.589 --> 01:08:08.599 align:start position:0%
be to actually document all that over
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
maybe a period of three months um and go
 
01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
hard at that to understand exactly what
 
01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
you're going to do and then figure out
 
01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
the timeline from there is it six months
 
01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
is a year um some of that depends on the
 
01:08:24.070 --> 01:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
resources being ready to be able to get
 
01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
the files ready and those type of things
 
01:08:28.189 --> 01:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
at the agencies and so there's factors
 
01:08:30.030 --> 01:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
in there and again I apologize for not
 
01:08:32.269 --> 01:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
answering your question directly but you
 
01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
know I think that um you know obviously
 
01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's probably within a year
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
that's for sure could you based on your
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
historical with North Carolina how long
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
did it take them to to get at least that
 
01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
aspect I I understand that there
 
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
potential for different modules to be
 
01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:49.960 align:start position:0%
added but I think what would be um if if
 
01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
allowed what I'd like to do is go back
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
and present some of that information
 
01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
after this this that's okay um because I
 
01:08:58.149 --> 01:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
can look back and see what where do we
 
01:08:59.630 --> 01:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
start first again where we started in
 
01:09:01.590 --> 01:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
North Carolina this is New Hampshire
 
01:09:02.829 --> 01:09:02.839 align:start position:0%
it's not North Carolina I want to
 
01:09:06.269 --> 01:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
recognize that um and uh you know so
 
01:09:07.789 --> 01:09:07.799 align:start position:0%
where they started may be a different
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
starting place for you what would be
 
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
nice to understand is to understand what
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
are those um where do where would you
 
01:09:18.910 --> 01:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
start what scope what agencies first
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
yeah so identify prioritize which what
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
data is most important but we can
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
generalize you know based on what we
 
01:09:28.269 --> 01:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
know in our our past history of
 
01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
delivering um this for North Carolina
 
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
and happy to get back to you on that
 
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative wheeler
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman can you tell us a
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
little bit about the Contracting process
 
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
that you had to go through in North
 
01:09:47.309 --> 01:09:47.319 align:start position:0%
Carolina and other states and what you
 
01:09:48.669 --> 01:09:48.679 align:start position:0%
think that would look like here in New
 
01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if we were to contract with
 
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
you yeah so um
 
01:09:56.910 --> 01:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question so from a
 
01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
Contracting process uh you know in North
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
Carolina uh again North Carolina
 
01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
contracted with SAS we had other
 
01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
engagements with SAS to do this work um
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
and it was you know annual agreements
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
that continue to get renewed with
 
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
additional Scopes and um uh scope of
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
works and Etc to continue to enhance um
 
01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
maintain and and build out the system
 
01:10:24.189 --> 01:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
some more um so we'd have to talk about
 
01:10:26.470 --> 01:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
the you know that's North Carolina but
 
01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
as far as the Contracting procedures in
 
01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm not as familiar with
 
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
um all of the different methods yeah we
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
have different statutes that would have
 
01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
to and and also we'd have to discuss I
 
01:10:41.709 --> 01:10:41.719 align:start position:0%
don't even know um you know we have
 
01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
different branches of government
 
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
involved that would have to also agree
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
it would be complex yeah it's complex I
 
01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
mean and and again I mean you know where
 
01:10:52.510 --> 01:10:52.520 align:start position:0%
it resides and who signs the contract is
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
probably the you know know those first
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
questions again those are details that I
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I can't address at a detailed
 
01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:00.199 align:start position:0%
level but that's a great question that's
 
01:11:01.630 --> 01:11:01.640 align:start position:0%
fine this all just things bouncing in
 
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
our heads uh representative wheeler
 
01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr chairman um aside
 
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
from that uh and when the system is
 
01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
implemented uh SAS is the one who runs
 
01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
the servers and have you guys had any
 
01:11:18.189 --> 01:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
problems with glitches while implemented
 
01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
or anything else which has uh made
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
implementation a rocky process so not
 
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
the implementation so you know can I
 
01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
answer that two ways okay so one way is
 
01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
um that you know some of the some of the
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
glitches are at the start getting those
 
01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
folks around the table formulating a
 
01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
committee and getting people to make
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
sure that we all agree on what we're
 
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
trying to do and accomplish um that's
 
01:11:43.870 --> 01:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
probably I'm not going to say that's a
 
01:11:46.030 --> 01:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
glitch but that's your first Challenge
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
and that's the most important challenge
 
01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
right across the agencies um from
 
01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
glitches in the system absolutely um I
 
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's 's a system I've
 
01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
ever gone to that is runs perfectly all
 
01:11:59.070 --> 01:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
the time um I'm happy to provide the
 
01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
uptime and the stats this system when I
 
01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
was I'm going to put my state of North
 
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
Carol Carolina hat on if the system was
 
01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
going to be down and it rarely went down
 
01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
very rarely went down but if it was
 
01:12:13.189 --> 01:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
going to go down for more than an hour I
 
01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
was going to be in contact with the
 
01:12:17.189 --> 01:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
governor's office I never contacted the
 
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
governor's office so that's probably a
 
01:12:21.790 --> 01:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
better way to answer that but but I
 
01:12:25.229 --> 01:12:25.239 align:start position:0%
don't want to I I I know I've been
 
01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
mentioning this many times around data
 
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
governance and and getting the folks
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
headed in the right direction but that
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
is you know super critical even to make
 
01:12:39.310 --> 01:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
sure the system accomplishes what it's
 
01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
setting out to do and and a system when
 
01:12:43.229 --> 01:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
I say the system setting out what it's
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
accomplishing to do documenting what all
 
01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
the expectations are to make sure the
 
01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
system meets those expectations and and
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
so you know I would say that you know
 
01:12:56.110 --> 01:12:56.120 align:start position:0%
and this isn't speaking for CJ Le this
 
01:12:57.870 --> 01:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
is speaking across all the different
 
01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
systems I've been involved in um you
 
01:13:03.310 --> 01:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
know when a system comes up of seeing
 
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
where people that's not what I wanted
 
01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
and what has happened often times is
 
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
that those that contribute and
 
01:13:12.629 --> 01:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
participate maybe don't participate
 
01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
enough right here's my data we'll see
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
you later um and we're going to use the
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
system when it's up it's no here's my
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
data let's talk through the data let's
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
talk about the quirks on the data let's
 
01:13:24.990 --> 01:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
walk through some of the data quality
 
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
issues we know exist let's document
 
01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
those let's document why you don't want
 
01:13:31.629 --> 01:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
to use this field and those type of
 
01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
things um so it's imparting knowledge
 
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
and it's imparting kind of that shared
 
01:13:39.629 --> 01:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
responsibility on making sure the system
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
is going to do what it's going to do and
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
and I just want to again I don't mean to
 
01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
be continuing to harp on it but it's not
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
just throwing the data over the wall
 
01:13:50.830 --> 01:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
it's providing the data with
 
01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
participation so basically you get into
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
the system what you what you you get out
 
01:13:57.470 --> 01:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
of it what you put absolutely yes sir as
 
01:13:59.229 --> 01:13:59.239 align:start position:0%
far as not just information but time
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
effort and yes what you want y thank you
 
01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.430 align:start position:0%
effort and yes what you want y thank you
representative

01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chair um my question
 
01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
has to do with what this committee might
 
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
want out of some of this data and so one
 
01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
of the things that I recall as an
 
01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
example would be we have discussions
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
about ethnicity and it's for the
 
01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
purposes of understanding whatever
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
ethnicity is out there and how it's
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
gathered by the police in the various
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
places it ends up in
 
01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
databases um and there are problems with
 
01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
that like the drop- down menu with it
 
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
the way that an officer on on at at a
 
01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
stop has to report data is by a drop-
 
01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
down menu and they select a limited
 
01:14:44.669 --> 01:14:44.679 align:start position:0%
number of things based upon whether or
 
01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
not they get data from the individual or
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
not so how so your system if it were
 
01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
implemented would only be able to gather
 
01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
up all the various databases across the
 
01:14:58.390 --> 01:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
state and the the counties and stuff
 
01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
like that and pull it into one place and
 
01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:03.080 align:start position:0%
then do your magic on it and we might be
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
able to get better data but it would be
 
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
reliant on how good the systems are for
 
01:15:08.990 --> 01:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
collecting that data and keeping in a
 
01:15:10.830 --> 01:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
database is that correct it it is
 
01:15:12.990 --> 01:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct yes so it's not the
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
source system of Entry it's it's the
 
01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
aggregator of all these various systems
 
01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
to bring that in um so yeah absolutely
 
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you represent numo help because I
 
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
I think I was trying to ask the same
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
question before with my Lithuanian
 
01:15:30.669 --> 01:15:30.679 align:start position:0%
example um I believe that the problem we
 
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
have now is the courts capture that
 
01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
information better than the police do
 
01:15:37.709 --> 01:15:37.719 align:start position:0%
but the court being able to access it
 
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
because it's spread out at different
 
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
courts everywhere you can't pull a
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
report so I feel like we would if we had
 
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
a system like that you would be able to
 
01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
go to the court and they would be able
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
to pull their information that's stored
 
01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
there and get what they needed to give
 
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
to us um versus the police well wherever
 
01:15:58.910 --> 01:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
the database is it's whatever however
 
01:16:01.149 --> 01:16:01.159 align:start position:0%
good the way you can enter the data then
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
the data is stored somewhere correct
 
01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
once it's just stored in the data system
 
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
you can though go to the various Data
 
01:16:11.709 --> 01:16:11.719 align:start position:0%
Systems and get it out Bring it together
 
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
and then maybe this committee would
 
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps get a report on on what had
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
happened for all of the arrests in the
 
01:16:22.350 --> 01:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
potentially can I respond to that a
 
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
little bit more you would but I I just I
 
01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
my understanding and you correct me in
 
01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
your response we wouldn't go to you we
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
would go to the court and say get the
 
01:16:34.669 --> 01:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
data that's stored on their system y to
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
give us they they're a repository they
 
01:16:39.629 --> 01:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
don't give out data the outside sources
 
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
they give it to the people who put it in
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
so we would have to ask them for a
 
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
specific report but right now the court
 
01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
has no such ability because of their
 
01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
various silos with a system like this
 
01:16:56.590 --> 01:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
the court would have it all in one place
 
01:16:58.629 --> 01:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
I think but please no that's that's
 
01:17:00.430 --> 01:17:00.440 align:start position:0%
exactly right and but I do definitely
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
want to respond once we you know started
 
01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
Living with this system in the state of
 
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
North Carolina you started to see data
 
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
quality issues and so the users started
 
01:17:12.189 --> 01:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
to see some of those data quality issues
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
as well because they're seeing it all
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
put together so I will say that the data
 
01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
quality improved after the system was
 
01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
released because you could see some
 
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies and so the source
 
01:17:26.830 --> 01:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
systems May again some data can never be
 
01:17:29.070 --> 01:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
updated just by Statute in North
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
Carolina I'm sure in all states but some
 
01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:33.800 align:start position:0%
data can be and so there was Data
 
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
corrections made on many different
 
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
things to improve the data collection
 
01:17:41.669 --> 01:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
process um so it's a it's a great point
 
01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
but again CJ leads is kind of that Hub
 
01:17:47.709 --> 01:17:47.719 align:start position:0%
and the source systems are around that
 
01:17:50.669 --> 01:17:50.679 align:start position:0%
Hub and the data flows into the CJ leads
 
01:17:52.830 --> 01:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh repository for lack of a better
 
01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:53.870 align:start position:0%
uh uh repository for lack of a better
work

01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:17:56.350 --> 01:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
in North Carolina is Corrections also in
 
01:17:59.350 --> 01:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
in your using that system yes so they
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
track everything from who's there how
 
01:18:02.430 --> 01:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
long they're there what the charges are
 
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
for yes everything okay everything yep
 
01:18:06.189 --> 01:18:06.199 align:start position:0%
that would be I I shouldn't say
 
01:18:07.870 --> 01:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
everything but I'm not sure if it's
 
01:18:09.870 --> 01:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
everything but yeah want to put in there
 
01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
all the critical uh probation parole all
 
01:18:14.669 --> 01:18:14.679 align:start position:0%
that yes so okay so if as a legislator
 
01:18:17.709 --> 01:18:17.719 align:start position:0%
we man legislature we mandated uh
 
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
corrections to capture certain data and
 
01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
report to us on a yearly basis they
 
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
would be easily as long as they put it
 
01:18:27.189 --> 01:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
in as we told them to be able to pull it
 
01:18:28.709 --> 01:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
right back up y it's another source and
 
01:18:30.189 --> 01:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
the detail within that Source could be
 
01:18:32.590 --> 01:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
brought in yes sir thank you very much
 
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh represent wheeler thank you Mr
 
01:18:36.629 --> 01:18:36.639 align:start position:0%
chairman quick followup for my research
 
01:18:38.189 --> 01:18:38.199 align:start position:0%
purposes just to make sure that I got
 
01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
these numbers right um SAS is in 134
 
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
countries servicing 25,000 users in 700
 
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
counties is that
 
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
correct there 700 agencies oh so so um
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
I'll let you speak to the the corporate
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
but go ahead and I'll speak to C and
 
01:18:59.110 --> 01:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
then the one follow-up question I had
 
01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
for that was also what other states um
 
01:19:03.709 --> 01:19:03.719 align:start position:0%
and if it's a comprehensive list feel
 
01:19:06.189 --> 01:19:06.199 align:start position:0%
free to just send it afterwards but um
 
01:19:07.189 --> 01:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
yeah I'd like to know what other the
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
states sis is service great question
 
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler um so just to
 
01:19:15.149 --> 01:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
clarify so we are actually we are in
 
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
1600 there are 1600 departments and
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
bureaus and commissions where we serve
 
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
for as sasas so um as an example I right
 
01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
now uh I so I live in Massachusetts the
 
01:19:28.709 --> 01:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts and we do work
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
with certain agencies there um one of
 
01:19:33.070 --> 01:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
the and I will I will add that there is
 
01:19:34.669 --> 01:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
some critical work that we've done in
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
relation to the opiate crisis and so a
 
01:19:38.629 --> 01:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
lot of what you're talking about with
 
01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
the data very sensitive data that
 
01:19:43.950 --> 01:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with at the moment so um
 
01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
but we the the backbone of the an
 
01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
analysis that's being done is used by S
 
01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
is is done through SAS so um as far as
 
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
numbers are concerned I mean those
 
01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
numbers are growing in terms of where we
 
01:20:01.390 --> 01:20:01.400 align:start position:0%
are um but for the most part 134 uh uh
 
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
different agencies across the
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
world and so and then 1600 and plus or
 
01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
more give or take across the the
 
01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
different states can I just can I just
 
01:20:14.830 --> 01:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
add to that so sorry it's 134 different
 
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
countries and then government entities
 
01:20:20.110 --> 01:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
within that um and for CJ leads so I
 
01:20:21.709 --> 01:20:21.719 align:start position:0%
think some of it was mixed up with the
 
01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
CJ leads metric
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
so I'll I'll say the CJ leads metrics we
 
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
say over 25,000 I think it's 26,000 to
 
01:20:31.709 --> 01:20:31.719 align:start position:0%
27,000 users
 
01:20:34.750 --> 01:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
um officers courts
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
prosecutors um there's a whole list of I
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's about 13 different
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
roles um there's 100 counties that in
 
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
North Carolina that have access to this
 
01:20:48.550 --> 01:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
um you know there are um some federal
 
01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
agencies supporting North Carolina that
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
have access to this um and so
 
01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's pretty broad user group from
 
01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice Community it's not
 
01:20:59.629 --> 01:20:59.639 align:start position:0%
just for law enforcement it is for you
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
know a broader view of Criminal Justice
 
01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:04.639 align:start position:0%
um and then I'm trying to think if there
 
01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
was other metrics that you were looking
 
01:21:09.149 --> 01:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
for oh we're basically in all the states
 
01:21:11.629 --> 01:21:11.639 align:start position:0%
and it's just different domain areas so
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of um a lot of Health
 
01:21:16.990 --> 01:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
agencies use SAS
 
01:21:20.590 --> 01:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist CJ not specifically CJ
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
leads is not in another state
 
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
um but you know we have a lot of
 
01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
investigative case management and other
 
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
type of and Jake had mentioned fusion
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
centers um and other type of criminal
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
justice state integration activities um
 
01:21:40.669 --> 01:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
but it's not here here's CJ Leeds it's
 
01:21:43.629 --> 01:21:43.639 align:start position:0%
built on the same technology um CJ Leeds
 
01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
is one of those branded um it's really
 
01:21:48.629 --> 01:21:48.639 align:start position:0%
branded for North Carolina but if you
 
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
look at what's behind CJ leads it's our
 
01:21:53.550 --> 01:21:53.560 align:start position:0%
primary SAS tools that are deployed
 
01:21:56.430 --> 01:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
across um a variety of Industries and
 
01:21:59.229 --> 01:21:59.239 align:start position:0%
and specifically government so if we
 
01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
were to um engage with your company we
 
01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
could call it whatever we wanted it
 
01:22:05.310 --> 01:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
didn't have to be CJ leads I would hope
 
01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
you would and and so you know um when I
 
01:22:11.870 --> 01:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
was G the the deputy State CIO I
 
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
encouraged agencies to Brand Solutions
 
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
or Enterprise solutions that cut across
 
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
agencies it helps gain Buy in it it
 
01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
becomes you know it's it's becomes your
 
01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
baby um you know we're we're happy and I
 
01:22:27.790 --> 01:22:27.800 align:start position:0%
think a lot of technology companies are
 
01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
happy to do this that you know almost be
 
01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes be the intelligence
 
01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes that's delivering
 
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
information um but really we encourage
 
01:22:39.550 --> 01:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
you to call things what you want that
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
gets Buy in in commitment from your
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
state did you talk about the fusion I
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
know I I understand fusion centers but
 
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
could you explain it to the members
 
01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:50.719 align:start position:0%
please about the different agencies that
 
01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
involved in a fusion Center
 
01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so um we we are in I believe about
 
01:22:58.110 --> 01:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
16 different fusion centers across the
 
01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
United States right now um and so fusion
 
01:23:03.790 --> 01:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
centers the primary goal of the fusion
 
01:23:05.430 --> 01:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
centers is to share data between
 
01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
different agencies at a local level at a
 
01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:09.800 align:start position:0%
state level with the federal government
 
01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
um our software the same foundational
 
01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
software right that CJ leads is running
 
01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
on the backbone that you know the Hub
 
01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:19.480 align:start position:0%
and spoke model pulling together
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
different systems of of record right
 
01:23:25.709 --> 01:23:25.719 align:start position:0%
your CAD your M data your SAR data all
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
that data is being aggregated together
 
01:23:29.669 --> 01:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
into a single system and then provided
 
01:23:31.870 --> 01:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
to the different users of that Fusion
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
Center um for the different
 
01:23:36.030 --> 01:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
investigative or intelligence needs that
 
01:23:38.990 --> 01:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
they may have um in their given um
 
01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and just for clarification
 
01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
that's usually um anti-terrorism type
 
01:23:47.950 --> 01:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
operations um um Tri child trafficking
 
01:23:49.149 --> 01:23:49.159 align:start position:0%
high level
 
01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
stuff any further questions from the
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
Comm uh representative Pratt
 
01:23:55.550 --> 01:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
I see North Carolina has um oh I have a
 
01:23:58.229 --> 01:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
question for you North Carolina has a uh
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
gun registry and you mentioned the
 
01:24:02.510 --> 01:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
federal government has access to
 
01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
that I'm sorry I couldn't hear the
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
question uh North Carolina seems to have
 
01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
a gun registry yes uh we had a pistol
 
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
per purchase permit program that was run
 
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
by the sheriffs that is set to Sunset
 
01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be that program
 
01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
anymore it may have Sunset it or it's
 
01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
sunsetting in Jan January so there's no
 
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
um that was a program that basically um
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
the sheriff's had um issued permits and
 
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
those type of things and that's that's
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
done away with completely so the federal
 
01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
government will still have access to the
 
01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
old records or the old record so you're
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
talking about Nicks the what we just
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
what we send up to Nicks from concealed
 
01:24:45.229 --> 01:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
handguns yes um well that's not
 
01:24:47.510 --> 01:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
concealed handguns this is purchasing
 
01:24:49.669 --> 01:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
guns I think what the representative is
 
01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
concerned about is we don't want a
 
01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
record of our guns purchased in the
 
01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire accessible to the federal
 
01:24:55.629 --> 01:24:55.639 align:start position:0%
government I and I don't think that
 
01:24:58.109 --> 01:24:58.119 align:start position:0%
would be the case at all other than they
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
what they already get from what they
 
01:25:01.550 --> 01:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
already get which would be from the um
 
01:25:04.910 --> 01:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
TR from the um FFL which would be the
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
disqual offenses that disqualify you
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
from having a gun yeah absolutely so so
 
01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
just a follow-up question so a follow-up
 
01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
question is slightly different uh so
 
01:25:16.350 --> 01:25:16.360 align:start position:0%
you're you're collecting well you're
 
01:25:20.109 --> 01:25:20.119 align:start position:0%
accessing massive amount of data and so
 
01:25:22.590 --> 01:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
who has access to that outside of the
 
01:25:25.149 --> 01:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
justice system outside of and I'm
 
01:25:27.149 --> 01:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
thinking basically uh like a breakdown
 
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
of if you want to break down the silos
 
01:25:30.950 --> 01:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
you going to have to assure that
 
01:25:32.109 --> 01:25:32.119 align:start position:0%
insurance companies real estate
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
companies corporations banks credit card
 
01:25:35.470 --> 01:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
companies wouldn't have any access to
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
any of ab not one piece of it AB no not
 
01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
one piece and this needs to be
 
01:25:41.229 --> 01:25:41.239 align:start position:0%
transparent so all of our Agreements are
 
01:25:44.229 --> 01:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
very transparent and are also updated
 
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
frequently or Revisited to make sure
 
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
that everyone's abiding by them Etc but
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
no this is this is uh you know
 
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
everything should be transparent and
 
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
should be understanding what's going on
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
even our privacy our our policies excuse
 
01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
me I'm going I'm with sass I keep
 
01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
getting confused where where I work so
 
01:26:05.310 --> 01:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
apologize but even if you go to CJ Le's
 
01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
website you'll see all the information
 
01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
you'll even see the um the policies and
 
01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
and and access agreements that are out
 
01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:15.400 align:start position:0%
there that everyone has to sign so it's
 
01:26:16.990 --> 01:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
right there and says what you can do and
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
what you can't do with that data um
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
thank you yep yes
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
sir have you ever been
 
01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:33.229 --> 01:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
no representative Stone thank you uh
 
01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
just to clarify obviously as a vendor
 
01:26:39.310 --> 01:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
you'd be able to uh give us a catered
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
version of what we would want that would
 
01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
not conflict with obviously information
 
01:26:44.669 --> 01:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
or rsas or state laws that would
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
prohibit certain information levels so
 
01:26:49.390 --> 01:26:49.400 align:start position:0%
that when you would get the uh contract
 
01:26:51.229 --> 01:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
as a vendor you would basically
 
01:26:53.229 --> 01:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
categorize everything in compliance to
 
01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
what we would request as a state correct
 
01:26:57.030 --> 01:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely your terms and conditions and
 
01:26:59.669 --> 01:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
your laws um you know I'm presenting
 
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
North Carolina as a use case I'm not
 
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
here to sell this tool for you um this
 
01:27:06.750 --> 01:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
is a good use case that I think
 
01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:08.639 align:start position:0%
represents some of the challenges I've
 
01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
heard with New Hampshire um but whatever
 
01:27:15.270 --> 01:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
we would do for any State uh not just
 
01:27:16.950 --> 01:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I just want to speak
 
01:27:20.189 --> 01:27:20.199 align:start position:0%
vanilla um which would we would abide by
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
um the the laws and statutes of that
 
01:27:25.149 --> 01:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
state and the contracts would reflect
 
01:27:28.109 --> 01:27:28.119 align:start position:0%
and respect um the laws and statutes of
 
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
that state and it's not even just that
 
01:27:31.870 --> 01:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
it might even be just the business
 
01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
processes that you know maybe it's the
 
01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
it processes it's it architectures and
 
01:27:38.189 --> 01:27:38.199 align:start position:0%
those type of things those things would
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed by in collaboration
 
01:27:43.229 --> 01:27:43.239 align:start position:0%
between um you really like working with
 
01:27:46.149 --> 01:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
any vendor um that you would expect from
 
01:27:47.950 --> 01:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
to do business with New Hampshire we
 
01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
would honor those same type of uh uh uh
 
01:27:53.070 --> 01:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
respect and and and discussion questions
 
01:27:55.950 --> 01:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
thank you yes sir and just for the one
 
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
more time I'll reiterate it for the
 
01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
committee they are using North Carolina
 
01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
because first of all that's the only
 
01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
state that I'm aware of that they're
 
01:28:07.189 --> 01:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
they do this but also they have the
 
01:28:09.870 --> 01:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
exact same during the opening their
 
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
opening of the presentation it they
 
01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
could have easily been describing to
 
01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with regard to silad
 
01:28:18.510 --> 01:28:18.520 align:start position:0%
information that's not connected and our
 
01:28:20.189 --> 01:28:20.199 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner is not able to access
 
01:28:23.310 --> 01:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
information real time and so it as I
 
01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
said hauntingly familiar but anything
 
01:28:28.350 --> 01:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
any company we entered into an agreement
 
01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:30.719 align:start position:0%
with or explored this with would tailor
 
01:28:33.229 --> 01:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
it specifically to our statutes our
 
01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
regulations and what we ask them to
 
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
do any further
 
01:28:42.030 --> 01:28:42.040 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none um we really
 
01:28:43.350 --> 01:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate you coming here today to
 
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
share this with us and I hope to stay in
 
01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
touch and um uh I'm going to speak to
 
01:28:49.950 --> 01:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
the different agency heads and and see
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
where that leads us we appreciate your
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%

01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
committee gets it sounds great thank

thank you very much appreciate you um
 
01:29:07.950 --> 01:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
with that we are going to take a break
 
01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:20.920 --> 01:51:04.270 align:start position:0%
 
back

01:51:04.270 --> 01:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:06.109 --> 01:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
um at this time we're going to begin
 
01:51:09.149 --> 01:51:09.159 align:start position:0%
again and we have several um people to
 
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
speak to us from the counties I would
 
01:51:13.790 --> 01:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
invite them to come forward um whichever
 
01:51:15.310 --> 01:51:15.320 align:start position:0%
one has to leave
 
01:51:18.270 --> 01:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
sist and I do apologize if I had
 
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
understood the time crunch I would have
 
01:51:31.030 --> 01:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:33.149 --> 01:51:33.159 align:start position:0%
didn't Mr chairman members of the
 
01:51:34.950 --> 01:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
committee my name is George mcis I'm
 
01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
chairman of the board of County
 
01:51:38.470 --> 01:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioners in straford County I'm
 
01:51:40.069 --> 01:51:40.079 align:start position:0%

01:51:43.629 --> 01:51:43.639 align:start position:0%
Commissioners uh in New Hampshire I have
 
01:51:45.510 --> 01:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
served in that capacity as president of
 
01:51:47.430 --> 01:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
all the County Commissioners for over 25
 
01:51:49.470 --> 01:51:49.480 align:start position:0%
years I'm serving my 19th term on the
 
01:51:51.310 --> 01:51:51.320 align:start position:0%
board of County Commissioners in
 
01:51:54.109 --> 01:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
straford we've been doing pre-trial
 
01:51:56.189 --> 01:51:56.199 align:start position:0%
programming I'm sorry this is Carrie
 
01:51:59.629 --> 01:51:59.639 align:start position:0%
Conway joined with me she's our director
 
01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
of our alternative sensing programs in
 
01:52:04.990 --> 01:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
straford we started about 25 years ago
 
01:52:08.069 --> 01:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
uh doing pre-trial diversion uh as a
 
01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
result of the fact that since I've been
 
01:52:11.709 --> 01:52:11.719 align:start position:0%
County Commissioner I've built three
 
01:52:11.719 --> 01:52:13.189 align:start position:0%
County Commissioner I've built three
County

01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
County
 
01:52:16.750 --> 01:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
jails so the programs we put in place
 
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
were uh
 
01:52:22.189 --> 01:52:22.199 align:start position:0%
designed uh to to uh level the playing
 
01:52:24.149 --> 01:52:24.159 align:start position:0%
field for lack of a better term we had
 
01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
people sitting in jail on $200 and $300
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
cash bail uh that they couldn't pay yet
 
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
had spent uh back then sometimes uh two
 
01:52:36.629 --> 01:52:36.639 align:start position:0%
to three months uh by the time they got
 
01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
before a judge a judge would just
 
01:52:42.069 --> 01:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
release them based on time served uh and
 
01:52:44.669 --> 01:52:44.679 align:start position:0%
uh that's how the system used to be uh
 
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
since that time uh and we had all kinds
 
01:52:49.870 --> 01:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
of other uh different types of
 
01:52:52.589 --> 01:52:52.599 align:start position:0%
characteristics that don't exist today
 
01:52:55.470 --> 01:52:55.480 align:start position:0%
uh but with the programs we put in place
 
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh we're doing pre-trial uh assessment
 
01:53:02.470 --> 01:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
on uh individuals that are are going to
 
01:53:04.750 --> 01:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
be at some point incarcerated or not
 
01:53:08.069 --> 01:53:08.079 align:start position:0%
incarcerated uh as just I just want to
 
01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:15.709 --> 01:53:15.719 align:start position:0%
issue any one of the programs that
 
01:53:18.430 --> 01:53:18.440 align:start position:0%
straford county has started and we've we
 
01:53:21.189 --> 01:53:21.199 align:start position:0%
call it our same Justice sooner model
 
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
that's what we call it the same Justice
 
01:53:26.430 --> 01:53:26.440 align:start position:0%
sooner model uh has anywhere from a 4:1
 
01:53:30.030 --> 01:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
to a 10:1 savings N9 to1 savings uh for
 
01:53:32.430 --> 01:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
the property taxpayer as you know all
 
01:53:33.950 --> 01:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
County jails are supported by the
 
01:53:36.149 --> 01:53:36.159 align:start position:0%
property tax uh every one of these
 
01:53:38.430 --> 01:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
programs we put in place have that type
 
01:53:39.750 --> 01:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
of cost
 
01:53:42.149 --> 01:53:42.159 align:start position:0%
savings so I'm going to have Carrie
 
01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
Conway talk a little bit about pre-trial
 
01:53:48.589 --> 01:53:48.599 align:start position:0%
assessment how we do it uh how the
 
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
system works
 
01:53:51.950 --> 01:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh so that when you're working through
 
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
all these bills that you folks have Mr
 
01:53:57.149 --> 01:53:57.159 align:start position:0%
chairman uh you might want to consider
 
01:53:59.350 --> 01:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh doing this in All Counties not all
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
counties do this uh simply because they
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
don't uh there has different
 
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
philosophies on on uh whether they
 
01:54:09.189 --> 01:54:09.199 align:start position:0%
should be doing it uh some people think
 
01:54:11.069 --> 01:54:11.079 align:start position:0%
that we should just raise the bail and
 
01:54:12.910 --> 01:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
keep them in jail we have that theory
 
01:54:14.990 --> 01:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
out there we have some people that say
 
01:54:17.310 --> 01:54:17.320 align:start position:0%
the people shouldn't pay any bail at all
 
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh there's a lot of PR going on uh
 
01:54:21.589 --> 01:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
people forget the reasons why we have
 
01:54:25.149 --> 01:54:25.159 align:start position:0%
bail we have bail for specific reasons
 
01:54:27.310 --> 01:54:27.320 align:start position:0%
the main one is to make sure you show up
 
01:54:31.109 --> 01:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
for court now I can tell you that
 
01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
nationally uh there's about a 60%
 
01:54:38.350 --> 01:54:38.360 align:start position:0%
escorpion rate that people don't show to
 
01:54:40.430 --> 01:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
court when they're supposed to in
 
01:54:42.910 --> 01:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
straford County we have a 9% rate with
 
01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
one of the leaders in the country when
 
01:54:47.189 --> 01:54:47.199 align:start position:0%
it comes to not making sure people show
 
01:54:49.709 --> 01:54:49.719 align:start position:0%
up for court and the reason for that is
 
01:54:52.189 --> 01:54:52.199 align:start position:0%
is because of the work that we do that
 
01:54:54.870 --> 01:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
Carrie does with her staff uh and doing
 
01:54:56.069 --> 01:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
pre-trial assessments so I'm going to
 
01:54:57.229 --> 01:54:57.239 align:start position:0%
have her talk a little bit about that
 
01:54:59.550 --> 01:54:59.560 align:start position:0%
and then answer any questions you might
 
01:55:01.229 --> 01:55:01.239 align:start position:0%
have good
 
01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
morning thank you for having us today um
 
01:55:06.390 --> 01:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
so the something I really want to focus
 
01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
on is the risk assessment tool that we
 
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
use in straford County um every day
 
01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
Monday through Friday our pre-trial
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
officers enter the Department of
 
01:55:16.910 --> 01:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
Corrections and conduct a public safety
 
01:55:18.430 --> 01:55:18.440 align:start position:0%
assessment on people that have been
 
01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
booked into the to Jail the night prior
 
01:55:23.709 --> 01:55:23.719 align:start position:0%
um we asked them a list of questions and
 
01:55:26.270 --> 01:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
I brought I brought copies of our um
 
01:55:28.350 --> 01:55:28.360 align:start position:0%
assessment that we use I could pass out
 
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
after or
 
01:55:32.350 --> 01:55:32.360 align:start position:0%

01:55:36.069 --> 01:55:36.079 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sorry that's every Monday that
 
01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
that's done um we do it Monday through
 
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
Friday okay every
 
01:55:43.229 --> 01:55:43.239 align:start position:0%
day and so the public safety assessment
 
01:55:45.189 --> 01:55:45.199 align:start position:0%
it's important to use a scientifically
 
01:55:46.870 --> 01:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
studied tool when you're asking
 
01:55:49.950 --> 01:55:49.960 align:start position:0%
questions the the tool um relies heavily
 
01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
on criminal histories but also gives us
 
01:55:56.750 --> 01:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
room um to add in collateral information
 
01:55:58.950 --> 01:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
so we focus heavily on people's ties to
 
01:56:00.510 --> 01:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
the community are they
 
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
employed um their past criminal offenses
 
01:56:05.910 --> 01:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
have we had them on supervision prior we
 
01:56:08.750 --> 01:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
make assessments on bail we send reports
 
01:56:11.310 --> 01:56:11.320 align:start position:0%
to the judges before the defendant
 
01:56:13.709 --> 01:56:13.719 align:start position:0%
appears in court we send the the
 
01:56:15.310 --> 01:56:15.320 align:start position:0%
assessments out to the public defenders
 
01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
and also to the prosecutors so everyone
 
01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
goes to court prepared with an
 
01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
assessment in front of them
 
01:56:22.390 --> 01:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
we currently have
 
01:56:25.870 --> 01:56:25.880 align:start position:0%
375 people out on pre-trial Supervision
 
01:56:28.990 --> 01:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
in straford County um as commissioner
 
01:56:31.310 --> 01:56:31.320 align:start position:0%
mallis mentioned we have about a 9.2
 
01:56:33.870 --> 01:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
failure to appear rate one thing to take
 
01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
into consideration when you're thinking
 
01:56:38.189 --> 01:56:38.199 align:start position:0%
about pre-trial programs is there's no
 
01:56:40.830 --> 01:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
one siiz fits-all to monitor someone in
 
01:56:42.910 --> 01:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
the community we monitor people from
 
01:56:45.030 --> 01:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
second deegree assaults to domestic
 
01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
violence to possession charges to DWIs
 
01:56:50.189 --> 01:56:50.199 align:start position:0%
you name it um
 
01:56:52.669 --> 01:56:52.679 align:start position:0%
we spend the time interviewing each
 
01:56:54.750 --> 01:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
person and we come up with a case
 
01:56:56.830 --> 01:56:56.840 align:start position:0%
management plan with them so if we think
 
01:56:59.390 --> 01:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
about pre-trial we're supposed to think
 
01:57:01.350 --> 01:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
the least amount of restrictions you not
 
01:57:02.910 --> 01:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
you know people haven't been found
 
01:57:06.109 --> 01:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
guilty yet so we have at our at our in
 
01:57:08.550 --> 01:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
our toolkit we have um electronic
 
01:57:10.669 --> 01:57:10.679 align:start position:0%
monitoring devices that we can use for
 
01:57:13.950 --> 01:57:13.960 align:start position:0%
GPS for um we we get that ordered a lot
 
01:57:15.709 --> 01:57:15.719 align:start position:0%
on domestic violence Vic for domestic
 
01:57:18.430 --> 01:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
violence survivors and victims um we
 
01:57:20.470 --> 01:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
have a Bart which is a device that
 
01:57:22.030 --> 01:57:22.040 align:start position:0%
people blow into to test if they're
 
01:57:24.589 --> 01:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
drinking alcohol we do drug testing we
 
01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
have curfews we have telephonic
 
01:57:28.550 --> 01:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
supervision where people that we
 
01:57:30.910 --> 01:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
identify as more low risk on our case
 
01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
loads call in every night to check in at
 
01:57:35.870 --> 01:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
a curfew time so we really tailor our
 
01:57:41.069 --> 01:57:41.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
assessment uh these this tool is
 
01:57:46.390 --> 01:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
evidence-based we we um attend a
 
01:57:47.629 --> 01:57:47.639 align:start position:0%
conference every year a National
 
01:57:49.589 --> 01:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
Conference where we talk about the
 
01:57:51.669 --> 01:57:51.679 align:start position:0%
newest things in pre-trial supervision
 
01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
and we try to adapt to that
 
01:57:57.950 --> 01:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
um I didn't know if you had any specific
 
01:57:59.830 --> 01:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
questions for us as to what we do in
 
01:58:01.870 --> 01:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
straford I'm happy to answer I could
 
01:58:04.069 --> 01:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
give you a lot of information about what
 
01:58:06.030 --> 01:58:06.040 align:start position:0%
we do dayto
 
01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
day if if this is something it's my
 
01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
understanding um it's regarded highly in
 
01:58:14.350 --> 01:58:14.360 align:start position:0%
the community uh Statewide um that we
 
01:58:17.149 --> 01:58:17.159 align:start position:0%
would contemplate um dealing with on a
 
01:58:19.709 --> 01:58:19.719 align:start position:0%
on implementing on a Statewide level I'd
 
01:58:21.629 --> 01:58:21.639 align:start position:0%
like to hear whatever you want to share
 
01:58:25.350 --> 01:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
about um uh implementation of the system
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
cost of the system
 
01:58:33.069 --> 01:58:33.079 align:start position:0%
um uh necessary employees to manage it
 
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
um everything everything you want to
 
01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
share yeah all great questions so the
 
01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
the cost of our programs it's about an 8
 
01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
to1 cost
 
01:58:43.830 --> 01:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
savings incarceration per day correct
 
01:58:46.310 --> 01:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
yeah and and on I do actually have some
 
01:58:49.109 --> 01:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
other charts to show you that show um
 
01:58:52.189 --> 01:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
our costs of programs and incarcerations
 
01:58:56.229 --> 01:58:56.239 align:start position:0%
for the last um since 2010 so I'm happy
 
01:58:58.870 --> 01:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
to share that with the committee as well
 
01:59:00.790 --> 01:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
if I if I could Mr
 
01:59:03.109 --> 01:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
chairman one of the things that you want
 
01:59:06.950 --> 01:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
to do when you talk about a pre-trial
 
01:59:09.149 --> 01:59:09.159 align:start position:0%
assessment uh is that you have to have
 
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
the other side of the stool here which
 
01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
which is the active use of drug court
 
01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
mental health court uh we have a for
 
01:59:21.310 --> 01:59:21.320 align:start position:0%
lack of a better term a dead beat dad
 
01:59:23.350 --> 01:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
program we have we we used to have
 
01:59:25.069 --> 01:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
people that would spend time in jail
 
01:59:26.189 --> 01:59:26.199 align:start position:0%
because they wouldn't pay their child
 
01:59:27.709 --> 01:59:27.719 align:start position:0%
support as an example well that doesn't
 
01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
make a lot of sense because while
 
01:59:31.550 --> 01:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
they're in jail they lose their job uh
 
01:59:33.950 --> 01:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
so we have a program that does that so
 
01:59:36.109 --> 01:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
we have a number of different programs
 
01:59:38.629 --> 01:59:38.639 align:start position:0%
that were all designed to provide
 
01:59:42.350 --> 01:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
alternative s sentencing but also arrive
 
01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
at the same
 
01:59:47.910 --> 01:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
result the same Justice Just
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
sooner so with that in mind what would
 
01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:51.990 align:start position:0%
sooner so with that in mind what would
happen

01:59:51.990 --> 01:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.189 align:start position:0%
happen
is

01:59:54.189 --> 01:59:54.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh in order for the count all counties
 
01:59:58.350 --> 01:59:58.360 align:start position:0%
to do this like for instance it doesn't
 
01:59:59.910 --> 01:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
make a lot of sense for Coos they
 
02:00:03.189 --> 02:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
probably got nine prisoners in jail the
 
02:00:05.669 --> 02:00:05.679 align:start position:0%
last time I worked with the Coos County
 
02:00:08.030 --> 02:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
Commissioners uh several years ago
 
02:00:10.109 --> 02:00:10.119 align:start position:0%
probably seven or eight years ago I
 
02:00:11.550 --> 02:00:11.560 align:start position:0%
don't I really didn't understand why
 
02:00:13.629 --> 02:00:13.639 align:start position:0%
they were running a jail uh I thought
 
02:00:15.709 --> 02:00:15.719 align:start position:0%
they ought to contract with with the
 
02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
state and use the state prison in Berlin
 
02:00:22.430 --> 02:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
um but with that said not all counties
 
02:00:24.390 --> 02:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
are the same not All Counties have
 
02:00:27.629 --> 02:00:27.639 align:start position:0%
services available to them uh to be able
 
02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
to do some of the things that straford
 
02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
does the biggest the certainly the
 
02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
larger counties could do it the smaller
 
02:00:35.229 --> 02:00:35.239 align:start position:0%
counties might have to we might have to
 
02:00:36.790 --> 02:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
be a little flexible as to how they
 
02:00:39.550 --> 02:00:39.560 align:start position:0%
would they would go about doing uh
 
02:00:41.669 --> 02:00:41.679 align:start position:0%
alternative sentencing uh when you
 
02:00:44.069 --> 02:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
really get right down to it that's what
 
02:00:47.709 --> 02:00:47.719 align:start position:0%
with the bail system the the
 
02:00:49.550 --> 02:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
incarceration system the two two-tiered
 
02:00:51.229 --> 02:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
system of Corrections we have in New
 
02:00:51.239 --> 02:00:52.950 align:start position:0%
system of Corrections we have in New
Hampshire

02:00:52.950 --> 02:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:00:56.870 --> 02:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh it's an it's an old system no
 
02:00:58.830 --> 02:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
question about it okay there's an old
 
02:00:59.910 --> 02:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
it's an old
 
02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:01.870 align:start position:0%
it's an old
system

02:01:01.870 --> 02:01:01.880 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:01:05.270 --> 02:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
but we're watching right now over 500
 
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
people in the community we have 80
 
02:01:08.830 --> 02:01:08.840 align:start position:0%
sentenced prisoners in our jail this
 
02:01:11.470 --> 02:01:11.480 align:start position:0%
morning 80 sentenced with over
 
02:01:15.990 --> 02:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
500 uh uh that were watching in the
 
02:01:19.069 --> 02:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
community if we didn't have the alter
 
02:01:22.189 --> 02:01:22.199 align:start position:0%
alternative sentencing program at
 
02:01:25.950 --> 02:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
least 40 45 maybe up to 50% of those
 
02:01:28.790 --> 02:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
people would be in the county jail now
 
02:01:31.709 --> 02:01:31.719 align:start position:0%
when that occurs you take on the
 
02:01:34.910 --> 02:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility for a lot of costs Health
 
02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:37.679 align:start position:0%
Care specifically okay their health care
 
02:01:39.510 --> 02:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
costs and I don't have to tell you the
 
02:01:41.470 --> 02:01:41.480 align:start position:0%
cost of health care it's dramatic and
 
02:01:45.870 --> 02:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
it's gone up hundredfold in 25
 
02:01:48.510 --> 02:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
years so there are other things that go
 
02:01:50.030 --> 02:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
on in people people's lives when we do
 
02:01:51.750 --> 02:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
this assessment tool we talk about
 
02:01:53.189 --> 02:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
whether they're employed what they have
 
02:01:55.069 --> 02:01:55.079 align:start position:0%
going on in their lives what's going on
 
02:01:57.950 --> 02:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
specifically with them uh and that's a
 
02:02:00.430 --> 02:02:00.440 align:start position:0%
model that's been Su we've actually been
 
02:02:03.069 --> 02:02:03.079 align:start position:0%
recognized nationally as a leader uh in
 
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
the area of alternative sentencing uh
 
02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
we've had a a tremendous track record
 
02:02:12.270 --> 02:02:12.280 align:start position:0%
knock on wood uh so far uh and we've
 
02:02:15.149 --> 02:02:15.159 align:start position:0%
been doing it for many many years now so
 
02:02:16.589 --> 02:02:16.599 align:start position:0%
a lot of the counties in the beginning
 
02:02:19.830 --> 02:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
will have to crawl before they could run
 
02:02:23.830 --> 02:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh and there's an expense involved in
 
02:02:26.669 --> 02:02:26.679 align:start position:0%
that and a lot of places a lot of places
 
02:02:29.430 --> 02:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
don't particularly believe in
 
02:02:31.229 --> 02:02:31.239 align:start position:0%
alternative sentencing program a lot of
 
02:02:32.270 --> 02:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
people think you should just lock them
 
02:02:34.510 --> 02:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
up and throw away the key well we locked
 
02:02:35.669 --> 02:02:35.679 align:start position:0%
them up and throw away the key in
 
02:02:37.550 --> 02:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
straford county for many many years
 
02:02:39.430 --> 02:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
that's what I told you earlier I built I
 
02:02:41.550 --> 02:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
built three County jails and I had
 
02:02:44.189 --> 02:02:44.199 align:start position:0%
National Consultants come in and tell me
 
02:02:46.430 --> 02:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
what size jail we should build and we
 
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
would build it and three years later it
 
02:02:50.510 --> 02:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
would be overcrowded
 
02:02:52.430 --> 02:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
the third time around we decided to try
 
02:02:54.069 --> 02:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
to do business a little differently and
 
02:02:55.870 --> 02:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
look at the actual demographics of who
 
02:02:57.550 --> 02:02:57.560 align:start position:0%
we had in jail and the reasons why they
 
02:02:57.560 --> 02:02:58.510 align:start position:0%
we had in jail and the reasons why they
were

02:02:58.510 --> 02:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:03:02.030 --> 02:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
there and when you look at that and you
 
02:03:06.350 --> 02:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
assess that okay it changes your
 
02:03:08.709 --> 02:03:08.719 align:start position:0%
attitude about why we incarcerate people
 
02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
and the reasons for it we like to
 
02:03:12.870 --> 02:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
incarcerate people because we're mad at
 
02:03:17.310 --> 02:03:17.320 align:start position:0%
them we're mad at at the at the things
 
02:03:19.629 --> 02:03:19.639 align:start position:0%
that they've done in the community
 
02:03:21.589 --> 02:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
well when I first went around and talked
 
02:03:23.709 --> 02:03:23.719 align:start position:0%
to Rotary clubs and Chambers of Commerce
 
02:03:25.149 --> 02:03:25.159 align:start position:0%
in my County we have three cities in
 
02:03:27.470 --> 02:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
straford County when I first talked
 
02:03:28.950 --> 02:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
about trying to change the criminal
 
02:03:31.510 --> 02:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
justice system way we did business I
 
02:03:33.109 --> 02:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
used to tell them what would you rather
 
02:03:34.629 --> 02:03:34.639 align:start position:0%
do would you rather have would you
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
rather have us watching somebody having
 
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
them keep their
 
02:03:40.270 --> 02:03:40.280 align:start position:0%
job okay and pay you
 
02:03:42.950 --> 02:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
restitution or would you rather me put
 
02:03:46.470 --> 02:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
them in jail for 60 days which would you
 
02:03:48.629 --> 02:03:48.639 align:start position:0%
prefer because when people commit most
 
02:03:49.629 --> 02:03:49.639 align:start position:0%
of these these crimes are being
 
02:03:51.910 --> 02:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
committed those folks with drug
 
02:03:53.109 --> 02:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
addiction or
 
02:03:55.990 --> 02:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
alcoholism 70% of the of the crimes that
 
02:03:58.510 --> 02:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
they commit are property crimes so when
 
02:03:59.830 --> 02:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
they break in your house and they steal
 
02:04:02.030 --> 02:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
your TV or they steal your computer or
 
02:04:04.350 --> 02:04:04.360 align:start position:0%
whatever they're going to take your
 
02:04:08.270 --> 02:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
jewelry not only is that person uh they
 
02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
contact their insurance company they
 
02:04:11.669 --> 02:04:11.679 align:start position:0%
have a $500 or ,000 deductible that
 
02:04:14.470 --> 02:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to pay okay they
 
02:04:15.990 --> 02:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
want some form of restitution well the
 
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
person can't pay a restitution if
 
02:04:19.870 --> 02:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
they're sitting in jail
 
02:04:22.750 --> 02:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
so there are instances where it makes
 
02:04:25.950 --> 02:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
sense to use them monitor them monitor
 
02:04:27.470 --> 02:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
them in the community in some instance
 
02:04:28.750 --> 02:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
now we have jails for reasons some
 
02:04:30.750 --> 02:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
people belong in jail okay we have them
 
02:04:35.229 --> 02:04:35.239 align:start position:0%
for reasons but I the history that we've
 
02:04:37.109 --> 02:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
been able to develop in straford County
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
over the period of time have have taught
 
02:04:41.350 --> 02:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
us a few lessons number one that people
 
02:04:42.709 --> 02:04:42.719 align:start position:0%
when I talked to those people at Rotary
 
02:04:45.709 --> 02:04:45.719 align:start position:0%
and Chamber of Commerce they said give
 
02:04:47.470 --> 02:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
me my
 
02:04:49.109 --> 02:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
restitution I don't I don't care about
 
02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
the 60 days I want my restitution so
 
02:04:54.109 --> 02:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
we're able to do those types of things
 
02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
over time uh that affect society greatly
 
02:05:02.709 --> 02:05:02.719 align:start position:0%
now straford County only has 130,000
 
02:05:05.990 --> 02:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
people in it about 132,000 people half
 
02:05:08.229 --> 02:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
of them are children so let's just take
 
02:05:10.069 --> 02:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
the adult population we're talking about
 
02:05:14.069 --> 02:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
70 to 74,000 people we have 500 people
 
02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
were watching right now when I was first
 
02:05:17.870 --> 02:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
elect the county commissioner 40 years
 
02:05:19.910 --> 02:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
ago we had 16
 
02:05:22.149 --> 02:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
prisoners we had a part-time County
 
02:05:24.629 --> 02:05:24.639 align:start position:0%
attorney it was Prosecuting crime we the
 
02:05:27.270 --> 02:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
grand jury met once a year we've had a
 
02:05:30.350 --> 02:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
lot of changes in society since then but
 
02:05:31.950 --> 02:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
we've also learned a lot of lessons from
 
02:05:33.709 --> 02:05:33.719 align:start position:0%
that and one of them is to do pre-trial
 
02:05:35.430 --> 02:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
assessments and do alternative
 
02:05:38.390 --> 02:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
sentencing it works it doesn't only work
 
02:05:40.030 --> 02:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
in our County but it works across the
 
02:05:42.390 --> 02:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
country those those c those areas of the
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
country that that have embraced that
 
02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
type of
 
02:05:48.310 --> 02:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
sentencing uh and it works but you have
 
02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
to do the assessments and you have to do
 
02:05:50.079 --> 02:05:51.030 align:start position:0%
to do the assessments and you have to do
best

02:05:51.030 --> 02:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
best
 
02:05:53.350 --> 02:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
practices so my suggestion to the
 
02:05:54.709 --> 02:05:54.719 align:start position:0%
committee was if you really want to look
 
02:05:57.189 --> 02:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
at this is have the count is to pay the
 
02:05:59.149 --> 02:05:59.159 align:start position:0%
counties because most counties don't
 
02:06:01.069 --> 02:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
want to raise property
 
02:06:03.390 --> 02:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
taxes historically they have not wanted
 
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
to raise property taxes to help the
 
02:06:08.510 --> 02:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
folks who commit
 
02:06:12.430 --> 02:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
crime however if they do it the right
 
02:06:15.470 --> 02:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
way we've demonstrated that it saves
 
02:06:18.310 --> 02:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
money it saves a lot of money but you
 
02:06:21.310 --> 02:06:21.320 align:start position:0%
have to do it a certain way and it would
 
02:06:23.629 --> 02:06:23.639 align:start position:0%
be in the counties it would be in the
 
02:06:25.350 --> 02:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
state's interest to have the counties do
 
02:06:28.350 --> 02:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
this and the reason why let me tell you
 
02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
why is that you want an independent
 
02:06:34.229 --> 02:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
opinion when you do these assessments
 
02:06:36.669 --> 02:06:36.679 align:start position:0%
you don't want the judicial branch to
 
02:06:39.109 --> 02:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
run it you don't want prosecutors
 
02:06:40.750 --> 02:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
running it you don't want public
 
02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
defendant program want running it you
 
02:06:44.910 --> 02:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
want an independent an an independent
 
02:06:47.510 --> 02:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
assessment done on folks so when that
 
02:06:49.470 --> 02:06:49.480 align:start position:0%
assessment goes before a judge it's
 
02:06:52.750 --> 02:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
another tool that the judge can use uh
 
02:06:54.350 --> 02:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
to determine how they want to handle
 
02:06:56.750 --> 02:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
that individual case that's what it
 
02:06:58.589 --> 02:06:58.599 align:start position:0%
really boils down to is giving judges
 
02:07:00.549 --> 02:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
Alternatives years ago judges didn't
 
02:07:02.310 --> 02:07:02.320 align:start position:0%
have Alternatives they either let you go
 
02:07:05.189 --> 02:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
or they raised your bail and as a result
 
02:07:07.350 --> 02:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
of that a lot of people who couldn't
 
02:07:10.069 --> 02:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
afford to pay actually their bail
 
02:07:12.790 --> 02:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes was more more than their
 
02:07:15.189 --> 02:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
actual sentenced
 
02:07:18.709 --> 02:07:18.719 align:start position:0%
fine in many instances because they had
 
02:07:19.629 --> 02:07:19.639 align:start position:0%
to go through a
 
02:07:21.629 --> 02:07:21.639 align:start position:0%
trial so those are just some of the
 
02:07:23.149 --> 02:07:23.159 align:start position:0%
things that I would suggest that if you
 
02:07:24.990 --> 02:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
want to look at it and we can spend some
 
02:07:26.709 --> 02:07:26.719 align:start position:0%
more time it with you Mr chairman I
 
02:07:28.109 --> 02:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
don't want to take any more time with
 
02:07:29.990 --> 02:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
the committee but we would certainly
 
02:07:31.589 --> 02:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
like to answer any questions you may
 
02:07:34.270 --> 02:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
have but it seems to me that if we made
 
02:07:37.189 --> 02:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
money some form of cash available to the
 
02:07:39.790 --> 02:07:39.800 align:start position:0%
counties and have them emble have them
 
02:07:41.430 --> 02:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
work with the National Association of
 
02:07:43.229 --> 02:07:43.239 align:start position:0%
counties and those counties across the
 
02:07:44.830 --> 02:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
country that have been successful at
 
02:07:46.750 --> 02:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
doing this uh you'd have a different
 
02:07:49.270 --> 02:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
result for New Hampshire
 
02:07:51.189 --> 02:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
so with that will answer any questions
 
02:07:52.430 --> 02:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
you may
 
02:07:55.709 --> 02:07:55.719 align:start position:0%
have when you envision um giving money
 
02:07:57.910 --> 02:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
to the counties
 
02:08:02.109 --> 02:08:02.119 align:start position:0%
um since this program if uh implemented
 
02:08:05.430 --> 02:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
properly would result in cost savings I
 
02:08:08.870 --> 02:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
I I think of perhaps seed money to to
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
start their programs and then the
 
02:08:13.629 --> 02:08:13.639 align:start position:0%
program should be almost
 
02:08:16.270 --> 02:08:16.280 align:start position:0%
self-funding versus the cost is Right
 
02:08:17.629 --> 02:08:17.639 align:start position:0%
saving depending on the nature of the
 
02:08:19.069 --> 02:08:19.079 align:start position:0%
size of the
 
02:08:20.750 --> 02:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
like for instance Coos would have
 
02:08:22.310 --> 02:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
difficulty doing because they have
 
02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
Rockingham yeah well Rockingham
 
02:08:25.750 --> 02:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
certainly could Rockingham certainly
 
02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
could do it uh you know expand they have
 
02:08:31.229 --> 02:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
a great mat program in Rockingham
 
02:08:34.510 --> 02:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
um the larger counties if they had the
 
02:08:37.669 --> 02:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
seed money and there was a
 
02:08:41.149 --> 02:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
philosophical change and how we approach
 
02:08:41.159 --> 02:08:42.069 align:start position:0%
philosophical change and how we approach
the

02:08:42.069 --> 02:08:42.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:08:44.709 --> 02:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
incarcerated um yes you're right that
 
02:08:45.910 --> 02:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
they would they would eventually they
 
02:08:48.950 --> 02:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
would eventually start to save money a
 
02:08:50.870 --> 02:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
lot of these facilities though were
 
02:08:53.750 --> 02:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
built a lot of Old County jails were
 
02:08:56.549 --> 02:08:56.559 align:start position:0%
built um you have a stand you have you
 
02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
have overhead you have Staffing um a lot
 
02:09:02.990 --> 02:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
of them were built under the old way of
 
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
doing business for lack of a better term
 
02:09:07.549 --> 02:09:07.559 align:start position:0%
uh we've been fortunate in straford
 
02:09:08.950 --> 02:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
County when we built our new jail the
 
02:09:10.430 --> 02:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
latest jail we built it with a maximum
 
02:09:12.669 --> 02:09:12.679 align:start position:0%
flexibility so we can we're able to shut
 
02:09:15.030 --> 02:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
down certain sections of it uh if we
 
02:09:18.709 --> 02:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
don't need it uh we we were successfully
 
02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
in uh getting negotiating Federal
 
02:09:23.030 --> 02:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
contracts with with the federal
 
02:09:26.870 --> 02:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
government with the uh with the ice with
 
02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
the US Customs and enforcement and with
 
02:09:32.350 --> 02:09:32.360 align:start position:0%
the uh US Federal Marshall service so we
 
02:09:35.229 --> 02:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
uh rent out our jail space uh to the
 
02:09:37.109 --> 02:09:37.119 align:start position:0%
feds which gives us Revenue which also
 
02:09:38.750 --> 02:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
helps to offset the cost of some of
 
02:09:40.669 --> 02:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
these things a lot of those counties
 
02:09:41.950 --> 02:09:41.960 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be able to do that
 
02:09:44.549 --> 02:09:44.559 align:start position:0%
because they the physical plant's not
 
02:09:46.830 --> 02:09:46.840 align:start position:0%
capable of doing it so they would need
 
02:09:48.390 --> 02:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
that they would need that money that
 
02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
seed money uh and you'd have to look at
 
02:09:53.149 --> 02:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
it again over a course of time to see
 
02:09:55.470 --> 02:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
how successful they were being
 
02:09:57.669 --> 02:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
on and I know this is probably an
 
02:09:59.669 --> 02:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
impossible question to ask but you know
 
02:10:01.270 --> 02:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
what kind of money are we talking about
 
02:10:04.990 --> 02:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
to to implement or start a program a
 
02:10:06.950 --> 02:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
pilot if you will for a lack of a better
 
02:10:09.109 --> 02:10:09.119 align:start position:0%
term what I'll do is I'll look at that
 
02:10:10.830 --> 02:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
and and ship you those kind of cost
 
02:10:12.149 --> 02:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
estimates to you in the committee and
 
02:10:14.470 --> 02:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
the you know at some point it would be
 
02:10:15.790 --> 02:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
different in every County again
 
02:10:19.870 --> 02:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
depending on the nature of of how broad
 
02:10:21.669 --> 02:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
their alternative sentencing programs
 
02:10:25.910 --> 02:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
would be uh and whether it makes sense
 
02:10:28.510 --> 02:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
in some instances like for instance in
 
02:10:30.149 --> 02:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
Coos I probably would make little and no
 
02:10:32.189 --> 02:10:32.199 align:start position:0%
sense for many of those
 
02:10:35.149 --> 02:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
things if last time I looked at Coos I'm
 
02:10:36.430 --> 02:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
not trying to pick on Coos but it's the
 
02:10:37.950 --> 02:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
smallest county we have and they've only
 
02:10:39.750 --> 02:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
got probably somewhere between 9 and 16
 
02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
prisoners at any one time in their in
 
02:10:43.310 --> 02:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
their County jail and I think you would
 
02:10:44.589 --> 02:10:44.599 align:start position:0%
find that most of them are there for
 
02:10:45.870 --> 02:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
drug rated
 
02:10:48.750 --> 02:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
offenses if they're there for recreation
 
02:10:50.669 --> 02:10:50.679 align:start position:0%
use that's
 
02:10:53.069 --> 02:10:53.079 align:start position:0%
one that would be one set of
 
02:10:54.709 --> 02:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
circumstances if they're there for
 
02:10:59.189 --> 02:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
dealing that's another so if you had a
 
02:11:02.390 --> 02:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
robust small part-time drug court in in
 
02:11:05.910 --> 02:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
Coos that was up and running you may not
 
02:11:07.669 --> 02:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
need the jail at
 
02:11:10.589 --> 02:11:10.599 align:start position:0%
all however one of the things that's
 
02:11:12.390 --> 02:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
interesting about Coos and you'll find
 
02:11:14.870 --> 02:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
this in the smaller counties as well is
 
02:11:17.109 --> 02:11:17.119 align:start position:0%
that the county is an employment base
 
02:11:18.790 --> 02:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
for their people
 
02:11:20.750 --> 02:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
if they were to shut the jail down they
 
02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
would lay off you know 30 40 50 people
 
02:11:26.430 --> 02:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
and that's a huge employment base uh for
 
02:11:29.149 --> 02:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
that region so they don't they don't
 
02:11:31.750 --> 02:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
want it they don't want the reform so
 
02:11:33.030 --> 02:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
those are the kinds of questions you're
 
02:11:34.430 --> 02:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
going to run into in the smaller
 
02:11:35.830 --> 02:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
counties but there's no question in the
 
02:11:37.870 --> 02:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
larger counties there would be a
 
02:11:40.069 --> 02:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
long-term cost savings smaller counties
 
02:11:42.709 --> 02:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
we'd have to work on it a little bit
 
02:11:44.910 --> 02:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
well I would I would Envision um a piece
 
02:11:48.149 --> 02:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
at a time for example I I like the con
 
02:11:49.870 --> 02:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
ccept and I think the committee shares
 
02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
this of electronic monitoring versus
 
02:11:54.229 --> 02:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
incarceration where someone could still
 
02:11:55.470 --> 02:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
go to work but you know what they're
 
02:11:57.270 --> 02:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
doing at all times of the day where they
 
02:11:57.280 --> 02:11:58.910 align:start position:0%
doing at all times of the day where they
are

02:11:58.910 --> 02:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:12:02.229 --> 02:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
um the cost associated with that we've
 
02:12:04.669 --> 02:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
heard depends on who's want if you're
 
02:12:06.549 --> 02:12:06.559 align:start position:0%
running it yourselves it cost less than
 
02:12:09.149 --> 02:12:09.159 align:start position:0%
if you contract with the company um are
 
02:12:10.870 --> 02:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
you able to recoup any of the money from
 
02:12:13.270 --> 02:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
the defendant since they are working
 
02:12:15.270 --> 02:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
those type of things so I I would be
 
02:12:17.310 --> 02:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
interested to see what components make
 
02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
up your pre-trial system that could be
 
02:12:22.549 --> 02:12:22.559 align:start position:0%
used even in a small County like Coos
 
02:12:24.109 --> 02:12:24.119 align:start position:0%
they may may be able to empty half the
 
02:12:25.510 --> 02:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
jail if they could put them on an ankle
 
02:12:27.149 --> 02:12:27.159 align:start position:0%
monitor absolutely and a program of
 
02:12:29.229 --> 02:12:29.239 align:start position:0%
monitoring no no question about that and
 
02:12:30.270 --> 02:12:30.280 align:start position:0%
I'll get that we'll make sure we'll
 
02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
forward that to you okay also um what is
 
02:12:34.470 --> 02:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
your interaction with probation and
 
02:12:36.549 --> 02:12:36.559 align:start position:0%
parole do how do you um interact with
 
02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
them well we got car you can ask that I
 
02:12:40.669 --> 02:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
mean probation and parole in straford
 
02:12:42.910 --> 02:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
county is in our building oh so which is
 
02:12:44.589 --> 02:12:44.599 align:start position:0%
nice yeah it's across the hall across
 
02:12:48.069 --> 02:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
the hall yeah so um fortunately and UNT
 
02:12:50.109 --> 02:12:50.119 align:start position:0%
fortunately we we do get a lot of the
 
02:12:52.390 --> 02:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
people that we set up on pre-trial we
 
02:12:54.270 --> 02:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
have them for x amount of days we get
 
02:12:56.910 --> 02:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
them sober they have a job they're doing
 
02:12:58.310 --> 02:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
what they're supposed to do they get
 
02:12:59.709 --> 02:12:59.719 align:start position:0%
sentenced and then they get sentenced to
 
02:13:02.589 --> 02:13:02.599 align:start position:0%
state probation parole and for us one of
 
02:13:05.870 --> 02:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
the success and functions of pre-trial
 
02:13:07.870 --> 02:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
is we keep our case load small for a
 
02:13:10.430 --> 02:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
reason because studies will show you
 
02:13:11.549 --> 02:13:11.559 align:start position:0%
that you're supposed to do that that's
 
02:13:13.030 --> 02:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
how you work more effectively with
 
02:13:15.629 --> 02:13:15.639 align:start position:0%
people so we have case loads of about 50
 
02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
people per staff probation parole their
 
02:13:20.950 --> 02:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
numbers up around 150 200
 
02:13:24.390 --> 02:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
250 so we often will see that we get
 
02:13:26.229 --> 02:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
someone set up on pre-trial and they're
 
02:13:28.310 --> 02:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
abiding members of the society again and
 
02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
then they unfortunately fall apart
 
02:13:32.189 --> 02:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly when they're getting
 
02:13:34.229 --> 02:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
minimal supervision and minimal
 
02:13:36.790 --> 02:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
interactions um due to staffing issues
 
02:13:39.470 --> 02:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
at probation parle through the state but
 
02:13:41.990 --> 02:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
we do get co- um supervised people
 
02:13:43.510 --> 02:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
there's people that we get on new
 
02:13:44.950 --> 02:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
charges that are already on probation
 
02:13:46.510 --> 02:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
and parole and we have a great working
 
02:13:49.990 --> 02:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:51.510 --> 02:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful to the committee if
 
02:13:54.510 --> 02:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
you could explain um because New
 
02:13:57.229 --> 02:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is is cble together um with
 
02:14:00.830 --> 02:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
old laws and new laws and systems how
 
02:14:04.149 --> 02:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
how someone um ends up under the
 
02:14:06.790 --> 02:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of your pre-trial system
 
02:14:08.910 --> 02:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
could they be ordered there from a state
 
02:14:12.549 --> 02:14:12.559 align:start position:0%
judge based on a state charge and um you
 
02:14:15.069 --> 02:14:15.079 align:start position:0%
know the county versus State and the
 
02:14:16.669 --> 02:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
state orders you to do something with
 
02:14:18.390 --> 02:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
somebody incarcerate them do they give
 
02:14:20.109 --> 02:14:20.119 align:start position:0%
you money to pay for that how how does
 
02:14:24.910 --> 02:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:28.229 --> 02:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
works so someone's arrested brought to
 
02:14:31.270 --> 02:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
our our jail um in our County the bail
 
02:14:33.270 --> 02:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
Commissioners will often recommend
 
02:14:35.430 --> 02:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
Community someone PR bail with Community
 
02:14:37.589 --> 02:14:37.599 align:start position:0%
Corrections so if they're arrested on a
 
02:14:40.069 --> 02:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
Sunday they'll say PR bail show up
 
02:14:41.350 --> 02:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
Community Corrections tomorrow morning
 
02:14:43.950 --> 02:14:43.960 align:start position:0%
at 10: a.m. um we also get people
 
02:14:46.430 --> 02:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
ordered straight from Court um we have
 
02:14:48.390 --> 02:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
people come down that the judge say said
 
02:14:50.990 --> 02:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
I'm on supervision with you now I'm here
 
02:14:53.149 --> 02:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
we get people who were out on uh
 
02:14:55.910 --> 02:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
probation parole violations that we were
 
02:14:59.350 --> 02:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
monitoring on new charges so we see all
 
02:15:02.350 --> 02:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:06.390 --> 02:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
life and what if any reimbursement from
 
02:15:08.669 --> 02:15:08.679 align:start position:0%
the state does the county get for any of
 
02:15:10.310 --> 02:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
that service that is ordered by the
 
02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:18.430 align:start position:0%
 
reimbursement

02:15:18.430 --> 02:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
02:15:20.430 --> 02:15:20.440 align:start position:0%
um any other questions from the

Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:15:28.549 --> 02:15:28.559 align:start position:0%
question um I think what I just want to
 
02:15:29.790 --> 02:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
make sure I understood what you just
 
02:15:31.510 --> 02:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
said for people that are on Personal

recognizance bail you get to see them
 
02:15:37.470 --> 02:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes all the time not or how does
 
02:15:40.109 --> 02:15:40.119 align:start position:0%
it or is it just incarcerated people so
 
02:15:42.350 --> 02:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
people that are so some people will get
 
02:15:44.870 --> 02:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
PR bail and some people will get PR bail
 
02:15:47.189 --> 02:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
with posted with us with Community
 
02:15:48.270 --> 02:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
Corrections the the people that are
 
02:15:50.270 --> 02:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
straight PR we don't we don't
 
02:15:53.109 --> 02:15:53.119 align:start position:0%
see thank
 
02:15:56.430 --> 02:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
you representative Stone thank you thank
 
02:15:58.990 --> 02:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question you sparked
 
02:16:00.910 --> 02:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
us something that I thought about if you
 
02:16:02.790 --> 02:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
have somebody that's on probation or
 
02:16:04.589 --> 02:16:04.599 align:start position:0%
parole and they're charged with a
 
02:16:07.390 --> 02:16:07.400 align:start position:0%
subsequent offense which is a new charge
 
02:16:09.470 --> 02:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
why would you want to absorb the cost of
 
02:16:11.430 --> 02:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
monitoring them on a pre-trial when the
 
02:16:12.910 --> 02:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
probation department has much more
 
02:16:15.030 --> 02:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
Authority and a mechanism to deal with
 
02:16:16.430 --> 02:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
them and basically they have the
 
02:16:18.149 --> 02:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
resources as well why would you want to
 
02:16:20.310 --> 02:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
basically double dip well the judge
 
02:16:21.990 --> 02:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
orders them to us so if it's a new
 
02:16:24.750 --> 02:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
charge they're not they're they're not
 
02:16:26.350 --> 02:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
being if they're on probation that
 
02:16:28.470 --> 02:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
they're not being sent back to jail or
 
02:16:30.149 --> 02:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
prison on a new charge it's a new charge
 
02:16:31.830 --> 02:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
so they have to you know it's either
 
02:16:34.150 --> 02:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
they sit in jail or they come out into
 
02:16:36.150 --> 02:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
the community and we monitor them just
 
02:16:37.750 --> 02:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
follow up on that typically with
 
02:16:40.549 --> 02:16:40.559 align:start position:0%
probation violations and uh parole
 
02:16:42.509 --> 02:16:42.519 align:start position:0%
violations it's triggering mechanism for
 
02:16:44.190 --> 02:16:44.200 align:start position:0%
a type of hearing to go forward if they
 
02:16:46.669 --> 02:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
are charged with that again I just don't
 
02:16:47.910 --> 02:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
understand why you'd want to absor the
 
02:16:49.190 --> 02:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
costs if it's the same type of
 
02:16:51.750 --> 02:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
supervision that would be handled by the
 
02:16:54.910 --> 02:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
state yeah we don't we don't like to
 
02:16:56.429 --> 02:16:56.439 align:start position:0%
absorb the
 
02:16:59.629 --> 02:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
cost until we had a new statute the
 
02:17:02.030 --> 02:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
counties push for a new statute what
 
02:17:03.910 --> 02:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
would happen if somebody for instance
 
02:17:05.790 --> 02:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
violated a state parole let me give you
 
02:17:07.870 --> 02:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
a quick example this one I always talk
 
02:17:09.950 --> 02:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
about because it was it's the truth and
 
02:17:09.960 --> 02:17:10.830 align:start position:0%
about because it was it's the truth and
it

02:17:10.830 --> 02:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:17:13.589 --> 02:17:13.599 align:start position:0%
happened we had somebody out on on state
 
02:17:16.389 --> 02:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
parole who uh was not require was
 
02:17:19.070 --> 02:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
required not to do any drugs or alcohol
 
02:17:20.950 --> 02:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
went to their brother's birthday party
 
02:17:23.349 --> 02:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
and had a
 
02:17:25.950 --> 02:17:25.960 align:start position:0%
beer probation officer found he had a
 
02:17:27.309 --> 02:17:27.319 align:start position:0%
beer had him arrested and they put him
 
02:17:28.910 --> 02:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
in the county jail he sat in the county
 
02:17:31.070 --> 02:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
jail for 60 days because he had a beer
 
02:17:32.349 --> 02:17:32.359 align:start position:0%
at his
 
02:17:36.030 --> 02:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:39.070 --> 02:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
party now we changed we got the laws
 
02:17:40.629 --> 02:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
changed since then now you have to have
 
02:17:43.709 --> 02:17:43.719 align:start position:0%
a hearing within 72 hours uh so they
 
02:17:45.669 --> 02:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't sit in county jail for a very
 
02:17:47.070 --> 02:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
long period of time but depending on the
 
02:17:50.230 --> 02:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
nature of what what the violation is
 
02:17:51.790 --> 02:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
like for instance the beer at the
 
02:17:56.750 --> 02:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
brother's birthday party uh a judge in
 
02:17:58.230 --> 02:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
that case would just turn around and say
 
02:17:59.950 --> 02:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
okay well we'll put them on Community
 
02:18:01.709 --> 02:18:01.719 align:start position:0%
Corrections uh you know because you
 
02:18:03.389 --> 02:18:03.399 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have had the beer instead of
 
02:18:06.150 --> 02:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
putting them back in state prison as as
 
02:18:08.910 --> 02:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
as a quick example now should the county
 
02:18:10.230 --> 02:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
absorb that
 
02:18:13.509 --> 02:18:13.519 align:start position:0%
cost probably not however that's our
 
02:18:14.830 --> 02:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
system in New Hampshire it's been that
 
02:18:17.790 --> 02:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
way for a very very long time that two
 
02:18:19.509 --> 02:18:19.519 align:start position:0%
tiered system of Corrections that we
 
02:18:23.190 --> 02:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
have uh We've in the past when we've
 
02:18:25.750 --> 02:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
tried to legislate reimbursement from
 
02:18:28.549 --> 02:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
the state it was always found
 
02:18:30.549 --> 02:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
inexpedient uh the state didn't want to
 
02:18:34.230 --> 02:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
pay for it um and so they said with
 
02:18:35.629 --> 02:18:35.639 align:start position:0%
their their argument then was well we
 
02:18:36.910 --> 02:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
are paying for it we're using the
 
02:18:39.070 --> 02:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
property tax to pay for it and that's
 
02:18:40.589 --> 02:18:40.599 align:start position:0%
our policy and that's what would
 
02:18:43.549 --> 02:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
happened that's what happened in past
 
02:18:45.270 --> 02:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
years when we tried to try to get
 
02:18:47.750 --> 02:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for time spent by State
 
02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
prohibition violators and county
 
02:18:53.870 --> 02:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
jails thank you so we're absorbing the
 
02:18:55.750 --> 02:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
cost either way either they sit in jail
 
02:18:58.110 --> 02:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
at you know $90 a day or they come out
 
02:19:03.589 --> 02:19:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:08.709 --> 02:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
day thank you um and just so I um it
 
02:19:11.669 --> 02:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
hurts my brain the the state judge
 
02:19:15.469 --> 02:19:15.479 align:start position:0%
orders somebody who's on probation for a
 
02:19:18.750 --> 02:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
state charge with where for example they
 
02:19:21.549 --> 02:19:21.559 align:start position:0%
may have a suspended sentence in state
 
02:19:24.750 --> 02:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
prison the the probation officer
 
02:19:28.349 --> 02:19:28.359 align:start position:0%
violates them pending the hearing which
 
02:19:30.870 --> 02:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
now is up to 72 hours they're sitting on
 
02:19:33.629 --> 02:19:33.639 align:start position:0%
the County's dime after the hearing the
 
02:19:35.190 --> 02:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
judge may say oh I'm not going to invoke
 
02:19:37.790 --> 02:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
the suspended sentence since straford
 
02:19:39.669 --> 02:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
county has such a great pre-trial
 
02:19:41.709 --> 02:19:41.719 align:start position:0%
program I'm going to sentence you to
 
02:19:45.030 --> 02:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
community um supervision
 
02:19:47.709 --> 02:19:47.719 align:start position:0%
for whatever the 60 90 days I don't know
 
02:19:48.910 --> 02:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
how often that how long they would send
 
02:19:51.270 --> 02:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
them for and once again that's on the
 
02:19:54.750 --> 02:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
County's time is that a correct
 
02:19:58.110 --> 02:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
statement thank you however however I I
 
02:20:00.950 --> 02:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:03.150 --> 02:20:03.160 align:start position:0%
point those people who are incarcerated
 
02:20:06.270 --> 02:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
in County Jail spent up to one year in
 
02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
most cases in 99% of the
 
02:20:13.230 --> 02:20:13.240 align:start position:0%
cases some will get released uh within
 
02:20:14.750 --> 02:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
eight months for good
 
02:20:18.270 --> 02:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
behavior now we've had have in the past
 
02:20:21.150 --> 02:20:21.160 align:start position:0%
monitored people post trial post
 
02:20:24.510 --> 02:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
conviction um so for instance they've
 
02:20:26.190 --> 02:20:26.200 align:start position:0%
been good in jail but we're not quite
 
02:20:28.670 --> 02:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
sure they've got a settled home life we
 
02:20:30.630 --> 02:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
don't want them reoffending so we'll
 
02:20:33.510 --> 02:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
monitor them for a period of time when
 
02:20:36.389 --> 02:20:36.399 align:start position:0%
they're released so that's the flip side
 
02:20:39.309 --> 02:20:39.319 align:start position:0%
of the argument in terms of we don't
 
02:20:41.950 --> 02:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
want them coming back because most of
 
02:20:43.190 --> 02:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
the time when they reoffend they'll be
 
02:20:45.750 --> 02:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
in the county jail system again so it's
 
02:20:48.190 --> 02:20:48.200 align:start position:0%
cheaper for us to monitor them uh post
 
02:20:50.230 --> 02:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
conviction in some cases so that's
 
02:20:51.270 --> 02:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
another thing you got to be thinking
 
02:20:54.870 --> 02:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
about as well so if again we're talking
 
02:20:58.990 --> 02:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
about State time if if someone gets out
 
02:21:01.469 --> 02:21:01.479 align:start position:0%
off of a state bid early because of good
 
02:21:03.950 --> 02:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
behavior and they've got four months
 
02:21:06.550 --> 02:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
left um that could be reinvoke or sent
 
02:21:08.670 --> 02:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
back during those four months the county
 
02:21:11.110 --> 02:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
will monitor them to make sure that they
 
02:21:12.790 --> 02:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
don't end up back in the county system
 
02:21:14.309 --> 02:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
because that's where the next charge
 
02:21:16.150 --> 02:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
will start is that if there's a new
 
02:21:17.670 --> 02:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
charge if it's an old charge they'll sit
 
02:21:19.030 --> 02:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
with us until they have a hearing then
 
02:21:20.990 --> 02:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
most likely they would go back to State
 
02:21:22.990 --> 02:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
Prison but there has been some cases I
 
02:21:25.630 --> 02:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
mean we've had cross count
 
02:21:29.790 --> 02:21:29.800 align:start position:0%
issues uh Rockingham has sent us a bunch
 
02:21:33.550 --> 02:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
of folks uh because they didn't have the
 
02:21:35.630 --> 02:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
judge wanted them to have the the type
 
02:21:37.830 --> 02:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
of programming that straford had and so
 
02:21:40.590 --> 02:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
we would take them um because Rockingham
 
02:21:42.510 --> 02:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
didn't provide it that particular type
 
02:21:44.630 --> 02:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
of programming that the judge was
 
02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
looking for for that particular
 
02:21:48.070 --> 02:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
individual so that's has happened in the
 
02:21:51.270 --> 02:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
past um and we we voluntarily done it
 
02:21:52.230 --> 02:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
because we like you don't have an
 
02:21:53.910 --> 02:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
agreement with the county between
 
02:21:55.630 --> 02:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
counties we just we have just a you know
 
02:21:57.070 --> 02:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
gentleman's agreement that we would do
 
02:21:59.830 --> 02:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
it and sometimes they'll take somebody
 
02:22:03.469 --> 02:22:03.479 align:start position:0%
that we have that uh might be some
 
02:22:05.469 --> 02:22:05.479 align:start position:0%
trouble for us doesn't happen too often
 
02:22:07.550 --> 02:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
but we have that reciprocity between
 
02:22:09.429 --> 02:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
counties where we would move prisoners
 
02:22:11.630 --> 02:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
back and forth I guess that would that
 
02:22:14.710 --> 02:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
that's um that's between you all right
 
02:22:16.270 --> 02:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
right but that what I'm interested in is
 
02:22:18.990 --> 02:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
the state county interaction and and
 
02:22:20.590 --> 02:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
especially if we're talking or
 
02:22:22.710 --> 02:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
contemplating expanding these type of
 
02:22:27.550 --> 02:22:27.560 align:start position:0%
programs Statewide um if it's already
 
02:22:28.950 --> 02:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
cost in the
 
02:22:32.030 --> 02:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
county based on what state judges are
 
02:22:35.150 --> 02:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
ordering how much more will that cost um
 
02:22:36.830 --> 02:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
so that's good that should figure into
 
02:22:39.469 --> 02:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
the numbers that we're thinking about
 
02:22:41.950 --> 02:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the
 
02:22:45.710 --> 02:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
committee oh represent Stone thank you
 
02:22:47.670 --> 02:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh one of the questions I have is under
 
02:22:50.630 --> 02:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
a straightup uh pre-trial bail
 
02:22:52.630 --> 02:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
supervision situation what are the
 
02:22:54.230 --> 02:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
realistic time frames in your experience
 
02:22:56.150 --> 02:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
does it take from you detecting a
 
02:22:57.910 --> 02:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
violation or breach of bail conditions
 
02:22:59.510 --> 02:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
to filing paperwork with the court to
 
02:23:01.110 --> 02:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
actually get that individual before a
 
02:23:02.510 --> 02:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
judge for a
 
02:23:04.830 --> 02:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
hearing so in straford county that can
 
02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
happen in a matter of days we can get
 
02:23:07.950 --> 02:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
someone in front of the judge in a
 
02:23:10.230 --> 02:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
matter of days we have an agreement with
 
02:23:12.469 --> 02:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
our judge that um and with our court
 
02:23:15.110 --> 02:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
system that they can get that handled
 
02:23:17.630 --> 02:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
fairly quickly you know commissioner
 
02:23:19.910 --> 02:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
mcis mentioned earlier our judges love
 
02:23:22.070 --> 02:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
having the tools that they have in
 
02:23:24.349 --> 02:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
straford County they they don't want to
 
02:23:26.830 --> 02:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
be up on that bench sending everyone to
 
02:23:29.030 --> 02:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
jail or prison they want options and so
 
02:23:30.990 --> 02:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
when we provide them with options
 
02:23:32.429 --> 02:23:32.439 align:start position:0%
they're they're just so grateful to be
 
02:23:34.309 --> 02:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
sitting in the counties that have these
 
02:23:37.309 --> 02:23:37.319 align:start position:0%
programs um if I could encourage one
 
02:23:39.790 --> 02:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
thing and if you're moving forward and
 
02:23:41.269 --> 02:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
thinking about this I would I would
 
02:23:44.030 --> 02:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
almost think about the money piece as
 
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
almost like an RFP a set of standard
 
02:23:48.710 --> 02:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
conditions that these programs need to
 
02:23:50.870 --> 02:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
meet in order to get the funding because
 
02:23:52.510 --> 02:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people that try to
 
02:23:54.070 --> 02:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
run pre-trial
 
02:23:56.510 --> 02:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
programs willy-nilly and they're not
 
02:23:58.309 --> 02:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
doing anything standardized or
 
02:23:59.510 --> 02:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practice or
 
02:24:00.670 --> 02:24:00.680 align:start position:0%
scientifically studied and they're
 
02:24:03.190 --> 02:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
making bail decisions presenting them to
 
02:24:06.670 --> 02:24:06.680 align:start position:0%
judges based on their own feelings or
 
02:24:08.230 --> 02:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
like a couple of questions on a piece of
 
02:24:10.150 --> 02:24:10.160 align:start position:0%
paper so I really think you know there
 
02:24:11.910 --> 02:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
needs to be some sort of um
 
02:24:13.830 --> 02:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
accountability into that
 
02:24:15.790 --> 02:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
piece thank
 
02:24:17.750 --> 02:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
you um
 
02:24:19.870 --> 02:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
if I could just a couple more questions
 
02:24:24.070 --> 02:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
um regarding bail specifically so um if
 
02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:24.870 align:start position:0%
um regarding bail specifically so um if
you

02:24:24.870 --> 02:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:24:28.469 --> 02:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
could does your program offer
 
02:24:32.269 --> 02:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
um the bail Commissioners more options
 
02:24:34.510 --> 02:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
when they are faced with somebody at
 
02:24:37.309 --> 02:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
3:00 in the morning um to make a
 
02:24:39.630 --> 02:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
decision on whether or not that person
 
02:24:41.230 --> 02:24:41.240 align:start position:0%
who may not probably should walk free
 
02:24:43.590 --> 02:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
just with nobody looking after them
 
02:24:45.429 --> 02:24:45.439 align:start position:0%
versus that or just ordering
 
02:24:47.269 --> 02:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
incarceration or them beh held
 
02:24:49.110 --> 02:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely we definitely get referrals
 
02:24:51.429 --> 02:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
from the bail Commissioners um you know
 
02:24:54.030 --> 02:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
someone 3:00 in the morning that been
 
02:24:55.550 --> 02:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
arrested and they have a job and they're
 
02:24:57.309 --> 02:24:57.319 align:start position:0%
saying that they have to be at that that
 
02:24:59.070 --> 02:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
job in order to you know to pay for
 
02:25:01.510 --> 02:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
their child's care or to keep a mortgage
 
02:25:04.030 --> 02:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
or something like that they we get
 
02:25:06.309 --> 02:25:06.319 align:start position:0%
referrals from um bail Commissioners for
 
02:25:09.110 --> 02:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
those types of situations all the time
 
02:25:11.230 --> 02:25:11.240 align:start position:0%
and so part of the the bail commissioner
 
02:25:14.389 --> 02:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
will set conditions of bail and is it is
 
02:25:16.469 --> 02:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
it specific or do they just say reports
 
02:25:19.070 --> 02:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
of pre trial and and based on your
 
02:25:20.710 --> 02:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
intake you'll decide what it is they
 
02:25:24.710 --> 02:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
need or do they say monitor or stay away
 
02:25:26.510 --> 02:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
from the victim and you monitor them
 
02:25:27.870 --> 02:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
could you explain that a little bit yep
 
02:25:29.469 --> 02:25:29.479 align:start position:0%
they'll they depending on the case they
 
02:25:32.030 --> 02:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
will set um specific conditions no
 
02:25:37.070 --> 02:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
contact order um report by have a curfew
 
02:25:39.349 --> 02:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
drug testing electronic monitoring
 
02:25:42.950 --> 02:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
equipment um a lot of that a lot of that
 
02:25:44.750 --> 02:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
is changed once someone gets in front of
 
02:25:48.309 --> 02:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
a judge um but they definitely use those
 
02:25:50.630 --> 02:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
tools and we were putting equipment on
 
02:25:52.230 --> 02:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
people every day and taking equipment
 
02:25:53.790 --> 02:25:53.800 align:start position:0%
off people every day based on what the
 
02:25:55.349 --> 02:25:55.359 align:start position:0%
judge is
 
02:25:57.990 --> 02:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
recommending in your relationship with
 
02:26:00.870 --> 02:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
your county bail Commissioners um they
 
02:26:02.550 --> 02:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
they all are aware of the services you
 
02:26:05.550 --> 02:26:05.560 align:start position:0%
provide um versus other B Commissioners
 
02:26:07.349 --> 02:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
have in other counties may not have
 
02:26:09.590 --> 02:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
these resources to use yeah we've had
 
02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
meetings um with through through members
 
02:26:13.870 --> 02:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
of the AOC they've come down and we've
 
02:26:15.030 --> 02:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
had bail commissioner meetings and
 
02:26:17.269 --> 02:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
lunchin and brown bags to talk about the
 
02:26:19.830 --> 02:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
resources that are available um the
 
02:26:21.269 --> 02:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
other one of the other things that
 
02:26:22.910 --> 02:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner mcis brought up is very
 
02:26:25.230 --> 02:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
important is the INF infrastructure a
 
02:26:26.510 --> 02:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
lot of counties will say we're going to
 
02:26:27.550 --> 02:26:27.560 align:start position:0%
start a drug court we're going to start
 
02:26:29.389 --> 02:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
a pre-trial program but there's no
 
02:26:31.469 --> 02:26:31.479 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to backfill so for
 
02:26:33.710 --> 02:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
someone to be on a GPS bracelet let's
 
02:26:36.950 --> 02:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
say it's $5.88 a day well we have a
 
02:26:39.510 --> 02:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
sliding scale uh fee scale that we work
 
02:26:41.630 --> 02:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
from but we know that not everyone can
 
02:26:44.150 --> 02:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
pay $588 c a day to be on equipment so
 
02:26:46.790 --> 02:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
we have a work program where people can
 
02:26:50.389 --> 02:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
show up every day work a job this type
 
02:26:52.950 --> 02:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
this year it's time of year it's cutting
 
02:26:55.269 --> 02:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
wood so they'll work in the Woodyard and
 
02:26:57.070 --> 02:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
cut firewood that we then sell to make
 
02:26:58.790 --> 02:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
money in the community and then that
 
02:27:01.469 --> 02:27:01.479 align:start position:0%
that pays for their equipment so to
 
02:27:04.269 --> 02:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
think ahead about the infrastructure and
 
02:27:06.150 --> 02:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
you know if the judge is going to order
 
02:27:07.790 --> 02:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
someone to be held pending a mental
 
02:27:09.830 --> 02:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
health evaluation does that jail have
 
02:27:11.950 --> 02:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
someone that's going to be completing
 
02:27:13.710 --> 02:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
that mental health evaluation because
 
02:27:15.070 --> 02:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
that person's going to sit until they
 
02:27:16.830 --> 02:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
get that evaluation then they come out
 
02:27:18.950 --> 02:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
Community Corrections or someone
 
02:27:20.750 --> 02:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
violates and the judge says well this is
 
02:27:22.230 --> 02:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
your second chance you're going to sit
 
02:27:24.389 --> 02:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
now until you go inpatient well you
 
02:27:25.950 --> 02:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
better have connections and
 
02:27:27.750 --> 02:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
collaborations in the community with
 
02:27:30.670 --> 02:27:30.680 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities to get people into
 
02:27:33.230 --> 02:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
programs quickly or it's really just not
 
02:27:35.590 --> 02:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
going to work which raises another
 
02:27:38.110 --> 02:27:38.120 align:start position:0%
question um so you're you're when
 
02:27:40.190 --> 02:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
someone comes in as part of your
 
02:27:42.150 --> 02:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
assessment you kind of look at their
 
02:27:44.110 --> 02:27:44.120 align:start position:0%
their whole state of play um do they
 
02:27:45.510 --> 02:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
have Medicare are they eligible for
 
02:27:47.030 --> 02:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
Medicare do you help them them get
 
02:27:48.150 --> 02:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
signed up for that do they have a
 
02:27:49.950 --> 02:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
driver's license or identification if
 
02:27:51.510 --> 02:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
they don't do you get them that do you
 
02:27:52.990 --> 02:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
get them the things they need to be able
 
02:27:54.870 --> 02:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
to continue being successful until
 
02:27:57.030 --> 02:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
they're until they're either um finished
 
02:27:59.469 --> 02:27:59.479 align:start position:0%
with their case or wrapped up absolutely
 
02:28:02.150 --> 02:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
no it's a very good point um usually
 
02:28:03.710 --> 02:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
after the second meeting everyone's got
 
02:28:05.469 --> 02:28:05.479 align:start position:0%
a Medicaid identification number that
 
02:28:07.429 --> 02:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
when they're released their Medicaid is
 
02:28:10.030 --> 02:28:10.040 align:start position:0%
active um we do job we help people with
 
02:28:12.870 --> 02:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
Job searches um we give people rides to
 
02:28:14.870 --> 02:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
job interviews we help people obtain
 
02:28:17.910 --> 02:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
their non-d driver's ID uh people's most
 
02:28:19.150 --> 02:28:19.160 align:start position:0%
people don't have you know their social
 
02:28:20.790 --> 02:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
security cards things that we take for
 
02:28:22.710 --> 02:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
granted we help them with money
 
02:28:24.510 --> 02:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
management opening a check-in account
 
02:28:25.990 --> 02:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
like the the basic things that some of
 
02:28:27.750 --> 02:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
us take for granted every day those are
 
02:28:28.990 --> 02:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
things that we're doing in our case
 
02:28:30.630 --> 02:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
management sessions with
 
02:28:33.550 --> 02:28:33.560 align:start position:0%
them do you have a significant number of
 
02:28:35.309 --> 02:28:35.319 align:start position:0%
unhoused individuals that you deal with
 
02:28:36.790 --> 02:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
and do you help people with housing who
 
02:28:38.349 --> 02:28:38.359 align:start position:0%
don't have it how do you how do you deal
 
02:28:40.950 --> 02:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
with that that's a good question we do
 
02:28:43.269 --> 02:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
um we have a transitional housing
 
02:28:45.710 --> 02:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
program in straford county that um we
 
02:28:49.269 --> 02:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
triage uh County people first so if
 
02:28:51.269 --> 02:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
someone's in jail because they first of
 
02:28:53.269 --> 02:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
all we're not keeping someone in jail
 
02:28:54.790 --> 02:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
because they don't have housing anymore
 
02:28:58.070 --> 02:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
that's changed so um they have a tent
 
02:29:00.030 --> 02:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
site uh you can come in and charge your
 
02:29:02.190 --> 02:29:02.200 align:start position:0%
equipment when you are you know we'll
 
02:29:03.510 --> 02:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
give you bus tickets to come in and
 
02:29:05.830 --> 02:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
charge your equipment um but we also
 
02:29:07.190 --> 02:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
have transitional housing where
 
02:29:08.790 --> 02:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
someone's if they really need a
 
02:29:10.630 --> 02:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
residence and they want to come and live
 
02:29:13.190 --> 02:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
at housing they can live at our housing
 
02:29:15.429 --> 02:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
for free for up to 90 days and then the
 
02:29:16.870 --> 02:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
expectation is that you're going to have
 
02:29:18.269 --> 02:29:18.279 align:start position:0%
a job and you're going to pay a third of
 
02:29:20.230 --> 02:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
that income to us to live there and
 
02:29:21.630 --> 02:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
you're going to be drug tested and you
 
02:29:22.910 --> 02:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
have a curfew and you're going to
 
02:29:25.349 --> 02:29:25.359 align:start position:0%
participate in re-entry planning and the
 
02:29:27.429 --> 02:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
whole nine yards so that's kind of like
 
02:29:29.429 --> 02:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
a halfway house type of thing where
 
02:29:31.349 --> 02:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
they're still supervised but they they
 
02:29:33.349 --> 02:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
have a a place to live and it's they can
 
02:29:35.190 --> 02:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
leave if they choose to but correct
 
02:29:38.389 --> 02:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
correct okay and even all these Services
 
02:29:40.590 --> 02:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
you provide you're still seeing a cost
 
02:29:45.510 --> 02:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
savings oh yes versus um per day
 
02:29:47.950 --> 02:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
incarceration um and I assume in
 
02:29:49.429 --> 02:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
figuring into that you're talking about
 
02:29:51.389 --> 02:29:51.399 align:start position:0%
the cost of Corrections Officers and
 
02:29:54.230 --> 02:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
feeding and medical care and all these
 
02:29:56.790 --> 02:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
buildings yeah one other quick point if
 
02:29:58.670 --> 02:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
I may Mr chairman is that in under the
 
02:30:00.269 --> 02:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
old system which is kind of what we've
 
02:30:04.110 --> 02:30:04.120 align:start position:0%
got we've got remnants of the old system
 
02:30:07.670 --> 02:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
here before we did pre-trial
 
02:30:10.910 --> 02:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
assessment when a Bill Bonds would come
 
02:30:10.920 --> 02:30:12.110 align:start position:0%
assessment when a Bill Bonds would come
in

02:30:12.110 --> 02:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:30:14.590 --> 02:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
or uh when they would come in they would
 
02:30:17.269 --> 02:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
ask the officer do you know about this
 
02:30:19.070 --> 02:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
person the police officer arrests
 
02:30:21.469 --> 02:30:21.479 align:start position:0%
somebody they're running you know IMC
 
02:30:26.230 --> 02:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
report or ncic background check and
 
02:30:28.190 --> 02:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes there'd be nothing in the
 
02:30:30.630 --> 02:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
system so then the bail bondsman you
 
02:30:32.830 --> 02:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
know he makes you know the he makes a a
 
02:30:35.389 --> 02:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
judgment based on what he's heard from
 
02:30:36.670 --> 02:30:36.680 align:start position:0%
the police officer you mean the bail
 
02:30:38.070 --> 02:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner bail Commissioners right I
 
02:30:39.469 --> 02:30:39.479 align:start position:0%
call them we used to have Bail Bonds but
 
02:30:42.830 --> 02:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
we got rid of them but
 
02:30:46.110 --> 02:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
um the assessment tool is is important
 
02:30:49.150 --> 02:30:49.160 align:start position:0%
because because it gives the
 
02:30:52.550 --> 02:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
judge uh an idea what's going on with
 
02:30:54.309 --> 02:30:54.319 align:start position:0%
this person's life the old system the
 
02:30:55.710 --> 02:30:55.720 align:start position:0%
judge was just sit there and say okay
 
02:30:58.030 --> 02:30:58.040 align:start position:0%
it's 500 bucks or it's a th000 bucks or
 
02:31:01.110 --> 02:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
it's $250 he was just making a a
 
02:31:03.150 --> 02:31:03.160 align:start position:0%
guesstimate as to what the person was
 
02:31:04.950 --> 02:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
able to pay or not pay based on what he
 
02:31:05.910 --> 02:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
heard that
 
02:31:08.910 --> 02:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
morning without any other assessment you
 
02:31:10.110 --> 02:31:10.120 align:start position:0%
don't know whether the person's mentally
 
02:31:11.670 --> 02:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
ill you don't know any of these things
 
02:31:13.269 --> 02:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
whether they're drug adct you don't know
 
02:31:14.870 --> 02:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
any of those things so with the
 
02:31:16.230 --> 02:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
pre-trial assessment tool this is why
 
02:31:18.429 --> 02:31:18.439 align:start position:0%
the judges like it so much because we're
 
02:31:18.439 --> 02:31:19.750 align:start position:0%
the judges like it so much because we're
an

02:31:19.750 --> 02:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
an
 
02:31:22.230 --> 02:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
independent Authority that's looking at
 
02:31:24.389 --> 02:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
these people and making specific
 
02:31:26.830 --> 02:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the judges as to how
 
02:31:28.469 --> 02:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
they ought to be treated as we move
 
02:31:30.429 --> 02:31:30.439 align:start position:0%
through the process of
 
02:31:32.750 --> 02:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
adjudication uh and that's an important
 
02:31:35.510 --> 02:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
thing that the judges need because the
 
02:31:39.190 --> 02:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
old system it's just not a great system
 
02:31:41.830 --> 02:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
and it and it basically it discriminated
 
02:31:43.790 --> 02:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
against the poor for lack of a better
 
02:31:45.269 --> 02:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
term it's just it is what it is I'll
 
02:31:46.670 --> 02:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
probably get in trouble for saying that
 
02:31:49.469 --> 02:31:49.479 align:start position:0%
but it did it discriminated against
 
02:31:51.750 --> 02:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
against poor folks who didn't have the
 
02:31:53.269 --> 02:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
three or four or 500 bucks and they
 
02:31:54.670 --> 02:31:54.680 align:start position:0%
would just sit in jail like I told you
 
02:31:56.670 --> 02:31:56.680 align:start position:0%
they'd sit in jail sometimes for 60 90
 
02:31:58.469 --> 02:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
days before they'd had the hearing the
 
02:31:59.790 --> 02:31:59.800 align:start position:0%
judge would come in and he'd say okay
 
02:32:02.110 --> 02:32:02.120 align:start position:0%
time served you know see you later
 
02:32:06.590 --> 02:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
goodbye and that happened all the time
 
02:32:08.510 --> 02:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
under the in the old system and probably
 
02:32:09.990 --> 02:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
still does happen in some of the other
 
02:32:13.190 --> 02:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
areas don't have other resources and all
 
02:32:14.550 --> 02:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
that's at the expense of the county
 
02:32:17.550 --> 02:32:17.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayer correct yeah okay further
 
02:32:19.830 --> 02:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
02:32:22.790 --> 02:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none uh thank you
 
02:32:25.710 --> 02:32:25.720 align:start position:0%
s I know that you're not do you have a
 
02:32:32.349 --> 02:32:32.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:34.510 --> 02:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
comment turn on your microphone and
 
02:32:37.349 --> 02:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
speak only to your uh only your what you
 
02:32:39.550 --> 02:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
know in your county where you
 
02:32:42.790 --> 02:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
are in my county in my jurisdiction
 
02:32:45.830 --> 02:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
where I say it you're talking about this
 
02:32:49.110 --> 02:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
old system that just doesn't exist if I
 
02:32:51.230 --> 02:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
if someone is held the judge sees them
 
02:32:54.550 --> 02:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
next day they're still held I'm we are
 
02:32:56.990 --> 02:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
that's just not the way there's no 6090
 
02:32:59.110 --> 02:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
days that just doesn't exist in
 
02:33:02.309 --> 02:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County yeah but the question
 
02:33:03.550 --> 02:33:03.560 align:start position:0%
I have
 
02:33:03.560 --> 02:33:05.150 align:start position:0%
I have
is

02:33:05.150 --> 02:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:33:07.790 --> 02:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
this I'm looking at this pre-trial
 
02:33:10.349 --> 02:33:10.359 align:start position:0%
assessment and I I want to know the
 
02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
profile of the person that's going to be
 
02:33:14.870 --> 02:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
that you're going to be involved with as
 
02:33:17.630 --> 02:33:17.640 align:start position:0%
a bail commissioner after I judge Flight
 
02:33:22.990 --> 02:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
Risk and um uh danger to society do I
 
02:33:25.070 --> 02:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
have the right to ask them these
 
02:33:28.830 --> 02:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
questions once they're who is is this
 
02:33:30.710 --> 02:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
voluntary is this for people who are
 
02:33:33.510 --> 02:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
misusing drugs this isn't for my or
 
02:33:36.070 --> 02:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
ordinary bail I I'm going to ask him
 
02:33:38.469 --> 02:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
what his health insurance is he could
 
02:33:39.990 --> 02:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
tell bail commissioner questions these
 
02:33:43.389 --> 02:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
are for pre-trial Services if the is
 
02:33:43.399 --> 02:33:45.150 align:start position:0%
are for pre-trial Services if the is
this

02:33:45.150 --> 02:33:45.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:33:48.070 --> 02:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
optional Services is it 100% it's
 
02:33:50.429 --> 02:33:50.439 align:start position:0%
optional oh yeah people people turn down
 
02:33:51.870 --> 02:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
these assessments all the
 
02:33:57.070 --> 02:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
time in that case wonderful and I if I
 
02:33:59.990 --> 02:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
may throw in the comment I really was
 
02:34:03.950 --> 02:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
appreciative of your post
 
02:34:07.429 --> 02:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
trial monitoring because not because it
 
02:34:09.950 --> 02:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
saves money why I understand money is
 
02:34:11.910 --> 02:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
important but it sounds like it's the
 
02:34:15.670 --> 02:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
right thing to do that's my my focus of
 
02:34:17.870 --> 02:34:17.880 align:start position:0%
course the question thank you for
 
02:34:21.590 --> 02:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
listening thank you and just for
 
02:34:23.910 --> 02:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
clarification if someone's ordered for
 
02:34:23.920 --> 02:34:25.230 align:start position:0%
clarification if someone's ordered for
pre-trial

02:34:25.230 --> 02:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
pre-trial
 
02:34:28.230 --> 02:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
services and they refuse to take this
 
02:34:30.590 --> 02:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
you just tell the judge they refused
 
02:34:31.910 --> 02:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
correct because the judge will say
 
02:34:36.309 --> 02:34:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:39.870 --> 02:34:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:41.990 --> 02:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
Newman I just have a quick question

gather thank you Mr chair um several
 
02:35:11.750 --> 02:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
years ago right before coid I think
 
02:35:13.469 --> 02:35:13.479 align:start position:0%
nashille was looking into doing
 
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
something similar to this um I was was
 
02:35:17.950 --> 02:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
in a meeting with judge Coburn and I
 
02:35:20.110 --> 02:35:20.120 align:start position:0%
think you were there because you look
 
02:35:22.590 --> 02:35:22.600 align:start position:0%
very familiar and you talked about um
 
02:35:25.230 --> 02:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
what was happening in statford County um
 
02:35:27.670 --> 02:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
do you know if we ever implemented
 
02:35:29.830 --> 02:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
anything in
 
02:35:32.510 --> 02:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
nsha I know that they have some sort of
 
02:35:35.429 --> 02:35:35.439 align:start position:0%
a program but I don't know that a lot
 
02:35:37.429 --> 02:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
came out of that specific meeting
 
02:35:39.429 --> 02:35:39.439 align:start position:0%

02:35:42.389 --> 02:35:42.399 align:start position:0%
health and um drug courts but this
 
02:35:43.950 --> 02:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
particular program we were looking at
 
02:35:48.389 --> 02:35:48.399 align:start position:0%
too back then thank you like I said I
 
02:35:50.070 --> 02:35:50.080 align:start position:0%

02:35:54.309 --> 02:35:54.319 align:start position:0%

02:36:25.790 --> 02:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
counties in the state no I'd like to see
 
02:36:28.830 --> 02:36:28.840 align:start position:0%

more information I'd like to talk to you
 
02:36:36.710 --> 02:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
about how this uh how this could work
 
02:36:44.630 --> 02:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:47.429 --> 02:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
you Ken is going to print them all um
 
02:36:48.550 --> 02:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
just for the benef of the committee
 
02:36:49.830 --> 02:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative rhs wants to say
 
02:36:52.230 --> 02:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
something so committee members I just
 
02:36:55.309 --> 02:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
want you to know that chesher County
 
02:36:58.590 --> 02:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
where I represent obviously does have
 
02:37:00.950 --> 02:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
pre-trial programs we have several of
 
02:37:03.309 --> 02:37:03.319 align:start position:0%
them and I did
 
02:37:06.710 --> 02:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
just I did just get a copy of the pages
 
02:37:08.269 --> 02:37:08.279 align:start position:0%
of the expenses for the pre-child
 
02:37:10.349 --> 02:37:10.359 align:start position:0%
programs and uh Karen is going to print
 
02:37:11.670 --> 02:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
that off so we can all have a look at
 
02:37:13.870 --> 02:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
that and I'm also trying to get somebody
 
02:37:15.910 --> 02:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
from the county to come testify tomorrow
 
02:37:18.510 --> 02:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
but you guys are going to see on top of
 
02:37:19.590 --> 02:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:37:23.429 --> 02:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
program most of the expense is hiring
 
02:37:24.750 --> 02:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
the person to do it because you're
 
02:37:26.910 --> 02:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
paying State retirement you're you know
 
02:37:28.190 --> 02:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're paying everything
 
02:37:30.269 --> 02:37:30.279 align:start position:0%
that goes in along with that but there
 
02:37:33.710 --> 02:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
are grants that our county has also help
 
02:37:35.349 --> 02:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
offset some of these so as soon as Karen
 
02:37:38.150 --> 02:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
prints them off a lot of the questions
 
02:37:40.230 --> 02:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
you guys have asked will be in this for
 
02:37:42.670 --> 02:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
you have they done a cost analysis
 
02:37:45.349 --> 02:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
versus incarceration if there's Savings
 
02:37:46.790 --> 02:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
in chest
 
02:37:48.030 --> 02:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
I'm certain that they have but I don't
 
02:37:49.150 --> 02:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
have the answer to it right now but I
 
02:37:51.070 --> 02:37:51.080 align:start position:0%
can find out for you it comes up during
 
02:37:51.080 --> 02:37:57.870 align:start position:0%
can find out for you it comes up during
budget

02:37:57.870 --> 02:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:00.230 --> 02:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
discussions and now we will hear from
 
02:38:02.309 --> 02:38:02.319 align:start position:0%
one more person from the is is Marat
 
02:38:04.710 --> 02:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
County I believe yes thank
 
02:38:14.710 --> 02:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:21.830 align:start position:0%
 
do

02:38:21.830 --> 02:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:24.190 --> 02:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you for having us
 
02:38:26.150 --> 02:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
my name is Cara Wyman I'm the Human
 
02:38:28.910 --> 02:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
Services director for Mar County started
 
02:38:31.469 --> 02:38:31.479 align:start position:0%
my career 26 years ago working in the
 
02:38:34.150 --> 02:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
court system and as a bail commissioner
 
02:38:36.030 --> 02:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
um and then I worked moved on to the
 
02:38:37.349 --> 02:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections and served
 
02:38:39.070 --> 02:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
there for 20 years leaving there as the
 
02:38:39.080 --> 02:38:39.910 align:start position:0%
there for 20 years leaving there as the
assistant

02:38:39.910 --> 02:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
02:38:42.349 --> 02:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
superintendent um and today I am the
 
02:38:44.429 --> 02:38:44.439 align:start position:0%
Human Services director which brings me
 
02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
to why I'm here which is pre free trial
 
02:38:48.750 --> 02:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
services and adult diversion Juvenile
 
02:38:51.590 --> 02:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
Diversion navigation programs and all
 
02:38:53.110 --> 02:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
the programs that are outlined in the
 
02:38:55.190 --> 02:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
packet that you just received from us
 
02:38:58.150 --> 02:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
with me here is Benjamin Forge he is our
 
02:39:01.190 --> 02:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
program manager and he supervises the
 
02:39:03.670 --> 02:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
grouping of individuals who supervise
 
02:39:07.790 --> 02:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
pre- child services and adult diversion
 
02:39:11.710 --> 02:39:11.720 align:start position:0%
teams so as you can imagine Mart county
 
02:39:14.670 --> 02:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
is different than straford County and
 
02:39:16.230 --> 02:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
different than Rockingham County and
 
02:39:17.990 --> 02:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
different than chachar and every other
 
02:39:19.710 --> 02:39:19.720 align:start position:0%
County just all the counties are just
 
02:39:22.590 --> 02:39:22.600 align:start position:0%
different so we run things the way that
 
02:39:25.830 --> 02:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
we believe works for Mart County um we
 
02:39:28.790 --> 02:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
also work closely with our judges and
 
02:39:30.710 --> 02:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
our public defenders office and our
 
02:39:33.630 --> 02:39:33.640 align:start position:0%
prosecutor's office some of the changes
 
02:39:35.830 --> 02:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
that we made when I came on to pre-trial
 
02:39:38.630 --> 02:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
Services two years ago um was removing
 
02:39:40.670 --> 02:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
pre-trial Services out from under the
 
02:39:42.429 --> 02:39:42.439 align:start position:0%
supervision of the county attorney's
 
02:39:47.150 --> 02:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
office prior to 2021 in April the
 
02:39:50.670 --> 02:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
prosecutor's office supervised and drove
 
02:39:52.630 --> 02:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
the mindset of pre-trial services and
 
02:39:55.670 --> 02:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
adult diversion and um it was my
 
02:39:57.790 --> 02:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
assessment and my opinion along with the
 
02:39:59.349 --> 02:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
County Administrator we spoke to the
 
02:40:01.910 --> 02:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
board and we are now a separate entity
 
02:40:05.070 --> 02:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
it provides us with some neutrality um
 
02:40:06.790 --> 02:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
and we are able to supervise it in arms
 
02:40:08.910 --> 02:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
length we're not then seen as anyone's
 
02:40:11.630 --> 02:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
rubber stamp and that was important for
 
02:40:14.349 --> 02:40:14.359 align:start position:0%
us um also our pre-trial officers are
 
02:40:16.469 --> 02:40:16.479 align:start position:0%
not deputies they were deputized for a
 
02:40:18.269 --> 02:40:18.279 align:start position:0%
time they are no longer deputized they
 
02:40:20.910 --> 02:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
do not have the power of arrest um they
 
02:40:24.230 --> 02:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
work as a certified correctional officer
 
02:40:25.750 --> 02:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
they go through the association of
 
02:40:28.429 --> 02:40:28.439 align:start position:0%
counties Correctional Academy so they
 
02:40:31.230 --> 02:40:31.240 align:start position:0%
can detain individuals that are breach
 
02:40:32.190 --> 02:40:32.200 align:start position:0%
of their
 
02:40:36.389 --> 02:40:36.399 align:start position:0%
bail um as as straford County does we
 
02:40:38.429 --> 02:40:38.439 align:start position:0%
interview five days a week Monday
 
02:40:40.389 --> 02:40:40.399 align:start position:0%
through Friday I have an officer right
 
02:40:42.429 --> 02:40:42.439 align:start position:0%
now it's program manager Forge goes into
 
02:40:45.469 --> 02:40:45.479 align:start position:0%
the jail every morning um on average we
 
02:40:47.510 --> 02:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
we're interviewing about 37 people a
 
02:40:50.550 --> 02:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
month um we go in you know Tuesday it
 
02:40:52.349 --> 02:40:52.359 align:start position:0%
was 11 people that he interviewed today
 
02:40:55.550 --> 02:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
it was one so it varies based upon
 
02:40:57.550 --> 02:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
what's happening but that is directly
 
02:40:59.590 --> 02:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
related to who is brought into the
 
02:41:02.150 --> 02:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
correctional facility if they get PR
 
02:41:04.070 --> 02:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
bailed for an arraignment date at a
 
02:41:06.510 --> 02:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
later time then sometimes we have a
 
02:41:07.870 --> 02:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
Walkin from the
 
02:41:12.950 --> 02:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
courts um we have 160 or9 individuals
 
02:41:14.870 --> 02:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
that we're we've got supervision of this
 
02:41:14.880 --> 02:41:16.030 align:start position:0%
that we're we've got supervision of this
morning

02:41:16.030 --> 02:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
morning
 
02:41:20.710 --> 02:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
um that is approximately 70% of them are
 
02:41:21.990 --> 02:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
doing exactly what they're supposed to
 
02:41:25.630 --> 02:41:25.640 align:start position:0%
be doing and that one3 is 30% is not
 
02:41:27.990 --> 02:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
doing what they're supposed to be doing
 
02:41:29.950 --> 02:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
the way that the system works in marac
 
02:41:33.309 --> 02:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
county is we report to prosecution and
 
02:41:35.110 --> 02:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
defense that someone is in violation of
 
02:41:37.510 --> 02:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
their bail
 
02:41:42.030 --> 02:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
and that is where our arm ends it's up
 
02:41:44.110 --> 02:41:44.120 align:start position:0%
to the prosecutor to file a violation
 
02:41:47.150 --> 02:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
with the court um um but the judge
 
02:41:50.910 --> 02:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't see a violation of bail unless
 
02:41:54.910 --> 02:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:57.750 --> 02:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
that uh we do have electronic monitoring
 
02:41:59.990 --> 02:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
we do have alcohol monitoring um
 
02:42:02.150 --> 02:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
straford called it Bart we we've changed
 
02:42:04.110 --> 02:42:04.120 align:start position:0%
to a different system we've partnered
 
02:42:06.110 --> 02:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
with our Correctional Facility so that
 
02:42:09.110 --> 02:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
we can piggyback on the services which
 
02:42:11.469 --> 02:42:11.479 align:start position:0%
is they are open 24 hours a day 7 days a
 
02:42:15.710 --> 02:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
week and we are not so the jail and pre-
 
02:42:18.309 --> 02:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
utilize the exact same monitoring system
 
02:42:21.790 --> 02:42:21.800 align:start position:0%
and they they um monitor the monitoring
 
02:42:23.790 --> 02:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
system for us if there's a problem they
 
02:42:25.670 --> 02:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
call one of one of the individuals
 
02:42:27.750 --> 02:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's on call through pre-trial and
 
02:42:29.590 --> 02:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
then we reach out to the
 
02:42:32.309 --> 02:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
client we also use an evidence-based
 
02:42:34.389 --> 02:42:34.399 align:start position:0%
validated risk assessment system what
 
02:42:36.590 --> 02:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
the system we use is called oras it's
 
02:42:40.990 --> 02:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
the Ohio risk assessment system um it is
 
02:42:43.389 --> 02:42:43.399 align:start position:0%
they we G we calculate we gather
 
02:42:46.790 --> 02:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
information um from an individual in
 
02:42:51.190 --> 02:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
when we interview them to decide it's
 
02:42:53.150 --> 02:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
they we're deciding what their risk is
 
02:42:56.309 --> 02:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
right to society um and we're working to
 
02:42:58.590 --> 02:42:58.600 align:start position:0%
mitigate Risk by identifying their needs
 
02:42:59.950 --> 02:42:59.960 align:start position:0%
and addressing their needs while they're
 
02:43:01.750 --> 02:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
out there so if they need food resources
 
02:43:03.950 --> 02:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
if they need a job if they're struggling
 
02:43:05.309 --> 02:43:05.319 align:start position:0%
with substance misuse if they're
 
02:43:07.830 --> 02:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
struggling with mental health my staff
 
02:43:10.230 --> 02:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
is working to connect them with all of
 
02:43:12.389 --> 02:43:12.399 align:start position:0%
those programs now if it's beyond if
 
02:43:13.790 --> 02:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit more than just
 
02:43:15.670 --> 02:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
accountability and holding somebody
 
02:43:18.750 --> 02:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
accountable then we transfer we retain
 
02:43:20.550 --> 02:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
the accountability portion of the case
 
02:43:22.269 --> 02:43:22.279 align:start position:0%
but we transfer the they need help with
 
02:43:24.349 --> 02:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
Medicaid paperwork or whatever we
 
02:43:27.349 --> 02:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
transfer that to our Navigator program
 
02:43:29.110 --> 02:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
all of our Navigators all of our
 
02:43:31.309 --> 02:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
pre-trial officers all of our diversion
 
02:43:34.389 --> 02:43:34.399 align:start position:0%
we're all on the same team so we we'll
 
02:43:37.150 --> 02:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes simultaneously open separate
 
02:43:37.160 --> 02:43:43.910 align:start position:0%
sometimes simultaneously open separate
cases

02:43:43.910 --> 02:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:47.590 --> 02:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
so have um have you also realized the
 
02:43:49.950 --> 02:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
same um cost benefit versus
 
02:43:52.469 --> 02:43:52.479 align:start position:0%
incarceration in your county that um
 
02:43:56.030 --> 02:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
statford did certainly I the in my
 
02:43:57.750 --> 02:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
capacity as the assistant superintendent
 
02:44:00.550 --> 02:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
I know that at least two years ago the
 
02:44:03.389 --> 02:44:03.399 align:start position:0%
the numbers were were around $200 a day
 
02:44:05.190 --> 02:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
for an incarcerated individual in Mart
 
02:44:08.190 --> 02:44:08.200 align:start position:0%
County um it's around $10 a day to have
 
02:44:10.190 --> 02:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
somebody um being supervised by pre-
 
02:44:12.550 --> 02:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
Services because they're a free citizen
 
02:44:15.870 --> 02:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
they're out in the community and our
 
02:44:17.510 --> 02:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
hope is that they're being a productive
 
02:44:19.429 --> 02:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
member of society they've got a job and
 
02:44:21.550 --> 02:44:21.560 align:start position:0%
we're pushing on them to get that um so
 
02:44:23.230 --> 02:44:23.240 align:start position:0%
they're they're contributing to society
 
02:44:25.710 --> 02:44:25.720 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a cost Savings in many ways
 
02:44:29.830 --> 02:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
medical is the number one cost
 
02:44:32.910 --> 02:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
savings and as um you I asked them and I
 
02:44:34.389 --> 02:44:34.399 align:start position:0%
think you just touched on it you you
 
02:44:36.830 --> 02:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're coordinated um
 
02:44:38.269 --> 02:44:38.279 align:start position:0%
with if they if they're entitled to
 
02:44:40.309 --> 02:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
Medicare that they get signed up for it
 
02:44:42.230 --> 02:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
those type of things all of those things
 
02:44:44.230 --> 02:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
yes sir we even have a closet in our
 
02:44:45.750 --> 02:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
basement of our building that's got
 
02:44:48.070 --> 02:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
shirts and ties so if you come to court
 
02:44:51.309 --> 02:44:51.319 align:start position:0%
and the judge says get out go it
 
02:44:52.750 --> 02:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
happened to us a couple weeks ago go see
 
02:44:56.230 --> 02:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
Miss Wiman you need a tie for court we
 
02:44:58.830 --> 02:44:58.840 align:start position:0%
we dress them nicely and send them back
 
02:45:01.389 --> 02:45:01.399 align:start position:0%
to the courthouse um prepared for court
 
02:45:04.190 --> 02:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
so we're we're trying to again we're
 
02:45:06.269 --> 02:45:06.279 align:start position:0%
we're trying to mitigate Risk by
 
02:45:06.279 --> 02:45:07.309 align:start position:0%
we're trying to mitigate Risk by
addressing

02:45:07.309 --> 02:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
02:45:10.710 --> 02:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
need and um what about um helping them
 
02:45:12.710 --> 02:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
obtain employment what do you do there
 
02:45:14.830 --> 02:45:14.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely we we the staff will when
 
02:45:16.429 --> 02:45:16.439 align:start position:0%
they when they have the opportunity to
 
02:45:18.349 --> 02:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
do that if it becomes a case where the
 
02:45:20.349 --> 02:45:20.359 align:start position:0%
person's a little bit more difficult um
 
02:45:22.309 --> 02:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
they need more resources they need more
 
02:45:24.910 --> 02:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
time spent with them we will we will ask
 
02:45:26.670 --> 02:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
one of our County Navigators to spend
 
02:45:29.349 --> 02:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
some time with them to help them Garner
 
02:45:31.309 --> 02:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
employment oftentimes it's because
 
02:45:32.830 --> 02:45:32.840 align:start position:0%
they're in recovery and they're
 
02:45:34.630 --> 02:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
struggling a little bit or they're
 
02:45:36.469 --> 02:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
struggling with mental health issues or
 
02:45:39.389 --> 02:45:39.399 align:start position:0%
both and the Navigator is that is their
 
02:45:42.389 --> 02:45:42.399 align:start position:0%
job is to case manage with somebody my
 
02:45:44.510 --> 02:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
pre-trial staff is really focused on
 
02:45:44.520 --> 02:45:45.990 align:start position:0%
pre-trial staff is really focused on
accountability

02:45:45.990 --> 02:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
02:45:47.550 --> 02:45:47.560 align:start position:0%
um and making sure they make it to court
 
02:45:49.110 --> 02:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
and they follow the the rules that the
 
02:45:50.750 --> 02:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
court has set
 
02:45:54.510 --> 02:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
down do you keep track of Statistics um
 
02:45:57.030 --> 02:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
for example failes failures to appear
 
02:46:00.389 --> 02:46:00.399 align:start position:0%
like we heard from um from St U marac
 
02:46:01.870 --> 02:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:46:04.590 --> 02:46:04.600 align:start position:0%
straford that is a number that I cannot
 
02:46:06.030 --> 02:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
give to you today but it is something
 
02:46:07.790 --> 02:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
that I can try and get for you so when I
 
02:46:10.190 --> 02:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
took over it in two years ago there were
 
02:46:13.710 --> 02:46:13.720 align:start position:0%
no statistics at all um the county Mart
 
02:46:17.710 --> 02:46:17.720 align:start position:0%
county has um worked to purchase a
 
02:46:20.510 --> 02:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
program called North Point uh where the
 
02:46:22.349 --> 02:46:22.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections pre-trial all
 
02:46:24.590 --> 02:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
the Human Services programs will all be
 
02:46:27.550 --> 02:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
on the same database so we'll be able to
 
02:46:29.389 --> 02:46:29.399 align:start position:0%
Garner information and it's going to
 
02:46:32.070 --> 02:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
save us time and I suspect that I'll be
 
02:46:34.910 --> 02:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
able to extract that type of information
 
02:46:36.830 --> 02:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
what I have now is nothing more than a
 
02:46:39.790 --> 02:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
fancy Excel spreadsheet anecdotally are
 
02:46:42.990 --> 02:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
you seeing better um fewer failures to
 
02:46:45.469 --> 02:46:45.479 align:start position:0%
appear uh fewer bench warrants in your
 
02:46:47.870 --> 02:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
county based on your services uh if you
 
02:46:49.469 --> 02:46:49.479 align:start position:0%
can if you do have no idea that's okay
 
02:46:50.670 --> 02:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
too do you want to speak to that do you
 
02:46:51.469 --> 02:46:51.479 align:start position:0%
know the
 
02:46:55.510 --> 02:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
information anecdotally yes um overall
 
02:46:58.070 --> 02:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know our rates of success are better
 
02:46:59.269 --> 02:46:59.279 align:start position:0%
with with you know when we're
 
02:47:01.550 --> 02:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
supervising somebody we're having a look
 
02:47:03.990 --> 02:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
at who they are uh figuring out what
 
02:47:06.670 --> 02:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
their needs are you know and addressing
 
02:47:09.230 --> 02:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
those those needs again and mitigating
 
02:47:11.910 --> 02:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
risk and and risk isn't you know
 
02:47:14.150 --> 02:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily when we say risk it's not
 
02:47:16.150 --> 02:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
about you know risk to Public Safety
 
02:47:19.389 --> 02:47:19.399 align:start position:0%
it's risk of non-appearance or or
 
02:47:21.429 --> 02:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
non-compliance with their bail
 
02:47:23.349 --> 02:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
conditions which which leads to other
 
02:47:27.550 --> 02:47:27.560 align:start position:0%
things so um yeah overall I would say
 
02:47:31.710 --> 02:47:31.720 align:start position:0%
yes the success is more um with regard
 
02:47:34.750 --> 02:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
to mental health and substance abuse um
 
02:47:37.870 --> 02:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
issues do do you have um how do you how
 
02:47:39.469 --> 02:47:39.479 align:start position:0%
do you deal with that you refer them to
 
02:47:42.990 --> 02:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
certain places do do you have um a list
 
02:47:44.910 --> 02:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
of places with available beds to put
 
02:47:47.590 --> 02:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
that needs to to go for um
 
02:47:49.950 --> 02:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
rehab that's probably one of the hardest
 
02:47:52.590 --> 02:47:52.600 align:start position:0%
things that we do um in my entire career
 
02:47:55.190 --> 02:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
I never would have bet you 26 years ago
 
02:47:57.190 --> 02:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
that I would have seen the mental health
 
02:48:00.429 --> 02:48:00.439 align:start position:0%
needs surpass the drug the substance use
 
02:48:03.230 --> 02:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
disorders and it has it officially has
 
02:48:04.710 --> 02:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
this year when we gathered the
 
02:48:08.750 --> 02:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
information um we have contracted with
 
02:48:10.830 --> 02:48:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh an individual who comes in and she's
 
02:48:12.750 --> 02:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
embedded in our building she has her off
 
02:48:15.269 --> 02:48:15.279 align:start position:0%
and know her own office and she's in our
 
02:48:19.349 --> 02:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
systems um to provide um lad mlak
 
02:48:21.870 --> 02:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
services to our to our clients if they
 
02:48:24.190 --> 02:48:24.200 align:start position:0%
need it but that's a taxpayer dollar
 
02:48:26.469 --> 02:48:26.479 align:start position:0%
that's paying for that because we cannot
 
02:48:30.510 --> 02:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
get our clients into anywhere to get an
 
02:48:32.710 --> 02:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
mlak assessment or to get some sort of
 
02:48:34.230 --> 02:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
substance use assessment or mental
 
02:48:37.030 --> 02:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
health assessment so knowing that that
 
02:48:38.670 --> 02:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
was an issue for us we elected to bring
 
02:48:42.910 --> 02:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
somebody in and we pay for that is that
 
02:48:44.790 --> 02:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
because the those Services just aren't
 
02:48:46.269 --> 02:48:46.279 align:start position:0%
out there is it because they don't
 
02:48:49.750 --> 02:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
accept Medicare what is it it's both
 
02:48:52.309 --> 02:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
it's both and we're seeing we're a
 
02:48:54.910 --> 02:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
couple weeks ago we had a a behavioral
 
02:48:57.990 --> 02:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
health uh group that just shuted their
 
02:49:00.150 --> 02:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
doors on a Friday morning and they were
 
02:49:02.190 --> 02:49:02.200 align:start position:0%
and they could no longer afford to keep
 
02:49:05.070 --> 02:49:05.080 align:start position:0%
going um and that was a combination of
 
02:49:06.349 --> 02:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
they're not getting the funding they
 
02:49:08.630 --> 02:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
need from Medicare um you know our
 
02:49:10.469 --> 02:49:10.479 align:start position:0%
clients don't have Medicare we're trying
 
02:49:12.190 --> 02:49:12.200 align:start position:0%
to get them into Medicare and all those
 
02:49:14.830 --> 02:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
types of things so it it's really it's
 
02:49:17.630 --> 02:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
really a struggle to get people um the
 
02:49:20.309 --> 02:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
services that they need how long does it
 
02:49:22.910 --> 02:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
take you to get somebody um into
 
02:49:24.229 --> 02:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
Medicare let's say they come in they
 
02:49:25.750 --> 02:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
have no health insurance but they
 
02:49:27.910 --> 02:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
clearly qualify for Medicare how long
 
02:49:29.429 --> 02:49:29.439 align:start position:0%
does it take for you to actually get it
 
02:49:31.110 --> 02:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
so that they can use it to get some of
 
02:49:34.229 --> 02:49:34.239 align:start position:0%
these Services um so we do it and the
 
02:49:36.990 --> 02:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
jail does it um simultaneously and it's
 
02:49:40.150 --> 02:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
it's really not a difficult process to
 
02:49:41.910 --> 02:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
to initiate the paperwork and to submit
 
02:49:43.590 --> 02:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
it and then it's just it's hurry up and
 
02:49:45.710 --> 02:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
wait like anything else you're waiting
 
02:49:48.030 --> 02:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
for the process to turn back to you um
 
02:49:49.790 --> 02:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
but it can be done in a matter of days
 
02:49:52.349 --> 02:49:52.359 align:start position:0%
where the return if the return is done
 
02:49:55.830 --> 02:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
quickly it's it's fairly fairly uh
 
02:49:58.349 --> 02:49:58.359 align:start position:0%
seamless is the county able to build
 
02:50:00.229 --> 02:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
Medicare for any of the services you
 
02:50:02.229 --> 02:50:02.239 align:start position:0%
provide that are related to mental
 
02:50:04.590 --> 02:50:04.600 align:start position:0%
health that is something that we are
 
02:50:08.030 --> 02:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
actually exploring today we we discussed
 
02:50:10.630 --> 02:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
what those numbers would look like um I
 
02:50:13.990 --> 02:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
our diversion staff is licensed um each
 
02:50:16.269 --> 02:50:16.279 align:start position:0%
of them is so we would be able to bill
 
02:50:18.190 --> 02:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
for their time so it is it's a possible
 
02:50:20.429 --> 02:50:20.439 align:start position:0%
Revenue Point yes
 
02:50:23.510 --> 02:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
sir any questions from the committee
 
02:50:25.469 --> 02:50:25.479 align:start position:0%
members representative
 
02:50:27.429 --> 02:50:27.439 align:start position:0%
Stone thank you I'm going to ask you the
 
02:50:28.870 --> 02:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
same question in regards to pre-trial
 
02:50:30.790 --> 02:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
services do you do dual supervision with
 
02:50:32.110 --> 02:50:32.120 align:start position:0%
the probation department and parole
 
02:50:34.790 --> 02:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
department we do and I don't know if you
 
02:50:36.550 --> 02:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
saw me shaking my head and smiling when
 
02:50:37.910 --> 02:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
you asked the question because it is a
 
02:50:40.710 --> 02:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
bone of contention between our some of
 
02:50:43.590 --> 02:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
our staff and that the fact that they're
 
02:50:45.030 --> 02:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
supervising somebody who's already on
 
02:50:47.309 --> 02:50:47.319 align:start position:0%
probation parole but the reality is is
 
02:50:49.190 --> 02:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
that probation parole doesn't have the
 
02:50:51.150 --> 02:50:51.160 align:start position:0%
capacity to do the work that we do our
 
02:50:53.510 --> 02:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
case loads are much smaller and so yes
 
02:50:56.070 --> 02:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
we do double dip and they're paying the
 
02:50:57.910 --> 02:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
state to supervise them and probation
 
02:50:59.870 --> 02:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
parole and we're paying the County
 
02:51:02.830 --> 02:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
Employees to supervise them on bail for
 
02:51:04.990 --> 02:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
that violation of
 
02:51:08.830 --> 02:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
probation thank you yes so the defendant
 
02:51:12.309 --> 02:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
or is paying a probation fee to the
 
02:51:15.110 --> 02:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
state true but you you're really the
 
02:51:17.190 --> 02:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
ones doing the supervision because they
 
02:51:19.229 --> 02:51:19.239 align:start position:0%
have a pending new charge is that
 
02:51:21.790 --> 02:51:21.800 align:start position:0%
correct I would say that we're we work
 
02:51:23.630 --> 02:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
together pretty well we do collaborate I
 
02:51:25.469 --> 02:51:25.479 align:start position:0%
don't want to sh put any shade on
 
02:51:28.389 --> 02:51:28.399 align:start position:0%
probation parole um but we we do the
 
02:51:30.070 --> 02:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
line and share of the supervision yes
 
02:51:32.550 --> 02:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
and pre pre-trial services in marac
 
02:51:36.870 --> 02:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
county today does not require a fee we
 
02:51:39.830 --> 02:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
do not make people pay except they pay
 
02:51:41.389 --> 02:51:41.399 align:start position:0%
for their electronic monitoring or their
 
02:51:43.550 --> 02:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
alcohol monitoring they do pay for that
 
02:51:45.670 --> 02:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
County taxpayers do not not pay for that
 
02:51:47.830 --> 02:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
but otherwise County taxpayers are
 
02:51:50.790 --> 02:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
paying for pre-trial what is the cost of
 
02:51:52.910 --> 02:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring per day for your
 
02:51:55.790 --> 02:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
county um it's $33 a week for us we do
 
02:51:59.670 --> 02:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
it by week um for electronic monitoring
 
02:52:03.269 --> 02:52:03.279 align:start position:0%
and it's $30 for um alcohol monitoring
 
02:52:06.349 --> 02:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
so about 9% of our supervised population
 
02:52:08.070 --> 02:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
are on electronic monitoring that's the
 
02:52:10.590 --> 02:52:10.600 align:start position:0%
highest level of supervision we we hold
 
02:52:12.910 --> 02:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
and does the county own the devices or
 
02:52:14.510 --> 02:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
do you lease them how does that work
 
02:52:17.190 --> 02:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
work that the cost of that we work with
 
02:52:20.070 --> 02:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
a group called track group and they they
 
02:52:22.550 --> 02:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
they send us the equipment and we have a
 
02:52:24.389 --> 02:52:24.399 align:start position:0%
contract with them so we get so many for
 
02:52:27.510 --> 02:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
free and then we pay a fee per day for
 
02:52:29.110 --> 02:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
them sitting on the shelf if they're
 
02:52:32.389 --> 02:52:32.399 align:start position:0%
there's not an ankle inside of them um
 
02:52:34.910 --> 02:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
but this system is um it's a pretty it's
 
02:52:36.790 --> 02:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
a pretty standardized system it works
 
02:52:39.030 --> 02:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
really really well um and all of our
 
02:52:41.190 --> 02:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
staff know how to put myself included
 
02:52:42.990 --> 02:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
know how to put that bracelet on and
 
02:52:46.030 --> 02:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
deploy the bracelet so we can do it
 
02:52:49.830 --> 02:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
within hours of an order from a judge we
 
02:52:51.590 --> 02:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
do have a process that we go about
 
02:52:53.510 --> 02:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
though because you do need to have a
 
02:52:56.830 --> 02:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
place to charge that bracelet so we work
 
02:52:58.630 --> 02:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
out where the person's living you know
 
02:53:01.429 --> 02:53:01.439 align:start position:0%
we have to get Logistics in place do you
 
02:53:03.950 --> 02:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
have um a lot of clients who don't have
 
02:53:07.150 --> 02:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
a place to charge or live we do and what
 
02:53:08.830 --> 02:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
do you do with them and how do you how
 
02:53:10.910 --> 02:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
do you provide services for them if you
 
02:53:15.469 --> 02:53:15.479 align:start position:0%
can so we're lucky that we're
 
02:53:17.510 --> 02:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
right up the street right on North Main
 
02:53:18.950 --> 02:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
Street in conquered so we're really
 
02:53:20.349 --> 02:53:20.359 align:start position:0%
close to the friendly kitchen we're
 
02:53:22.150 --> 02:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
really close to all the services and we
 
02:53:24.229 --> 02:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
work very closely with the Coalition de
 
02:53:25.590 --> 02:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
homelessness and the friendly kitchen
 
02:53:29.030 --> 02:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
team to provide services together um a
 
02:53:31.389 --> 02:53:31.399 align:start position:0%
big piece of this social service process
 
02:53:33.870 --> 02:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
Human Services is that if you overlap
 
02:53:36.550 --> 02:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
you're choking an already choked system
 
02:53:38.110 --> 02:53:38.120 align:start position:0%
it's the same with criminal justice if
 
02:53:40.590 --> 02:53:40.600 align:start position:0%
we overlap we're we're putting more
 
02:53:43.070 --> 02:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
effort into one person than is is
 
02:53:46.150 --> 02:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
probably Fair um so we provide the
 
02:53:49.150 --> 02:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
services in all the same ways
 
02:53:51.910 --> 02:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
um I know that you I can send somebody
 
02:53:53.550 --> 02:53:53.560 align:start position:0%
to the Market Basket parking lot and
 
02:53:55.510 --> 02:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
they can plug into the light pole
 
02:53:57.229 --> 02:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
because there's a there's an outlet
 
02:54:01.110 --> 02:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
there and they can charge their their um
 
02:54:03.389 --> 02:54:03.399 align:start position:0%
bracelet there if they have to but some
 
02:54:04.950 --> 02:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
of the things that we've done is just
 
02:54:06.830 --> 02:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
made sure that they know they can come
 
02:54:09.670 --> 02:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
to us um they can get clothing they can
 
02:54:12.070 --> 02:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
get some quick food if they need it they
 
02:54:14.510 --> 02:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
can have a place to charge their devices
 
02:54:16.550 --> 02:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
in our office it's a safe place it also
 
02:54:18.110 --> 02:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
gives us an opportunity to lay eyes on
 
02:54:19.389 --> 02:54:19.399 align:start position:0%
the person and make sure that they're in
 
02:54:21.309 --> 02:54:21.319 align:start position:0%
a healthy
 
02:54:24.429 --> 02:54:24.439 align:start position:0%
way do you see a large portion of your
 
02:54:27.790 --> 02:54:27.800 align:start position:0%
clients um ordered by the judge to your
 
02:54:29.870 --> 02:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
services how how was your relationship
 
02:54:32.190 --> 02:54:32.200 align:start position:0%
with the Judiciary um I know that we
 
02:54:34.190 --> 02:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
heard from the other County that they
 
02:54:36.110 --> 02:54:36.120 align:start position:0%
were pleased that those Services were
 
02:54:38.349 --> 02:54:38.359 align:start position:0%
offered within their County um do you
 
02:54:40.229 --> 02:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
have the similar experience we have a
 
02:54:42.229 --> 02:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
wonderful relationship with the justices
 
02:54:44.070 --> 02:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
in marac County both in Superior Court
 
02:54:46.389 --> 02:54:46.399 align:start position:0%
and in the district courts the largest
 
02:54:48.870 --> 02:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
struggle we have is that they don't have
 
02:54:51.429 --> 02:54:51.439 align:start position:0%
enough judges sometimes so if they have
 
02:54:52.870 --> 02:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
a traveling judge from a different
 
02:54:54.389 --> 02:54:54.399 align:start position:0%
County they don't know that our
 
02:54:57.269 --> 02:54:57.279 align:start position:0%
pre-trial Services exist but we often
 
02:54:59.150 --> 02:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
will we have we also have two courts
 
02:55:01.750 --> 02:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
that are dual County courts and so that
 
02:55:03.469 --> 02:55:03.479 align:start position:0%
becomes a struggle too because a judge
 
02:55:06.510 --> 02:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
is in bellnap county or excuse me in
 
02:55:08.429 --> 02:55:08.439 align:start position:0%
Franklin District Court is not used to
 
02:55:11.070 --> 02:55:11.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that there's a there's a robust
 
02:55:12.750 --> 02:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
program in Marram County because he
 
02:55:14.429 --> 02:55:14.439 align:start position:0%
knows there's not one in beln not
 
02:55:17.590 --> 02:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily or as just an example um but
 
02:55:18.910 --> 02:55:18.920 align:start position:0%
we do have a good relationship with our
 
02:55:21.309 --> 02:55:21.319 align:start position:0%
judges they are happy with our services
 
02:55:24.389 --> 02:55:24.399 align:start position:0%
um and we you know a large piece of what
 
02:55:26.790 --> 02:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
we do is because we've had conversations
 
02:55:28.510 --> 02:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
what do you need what your honor what
 
02:55:30.550 --> 02:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
are what are your needs and we tailor
 
02:55:33.510 --> 02:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
our programs to that and is it safe to
 
02:55:36.150 --> 02:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
say because your program exists that a
 
02:55:37.870 --> 02:55:37.880 align:start position:0%
large portion of these people are able
 
02:55:40.070 --> 02:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
to continue working and contributing to
 
02:55:41.790 --> 02:55:41.800 align:start position:0%
society versus otherwise they would have
 
02:55:44.750 --> 02:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
to just sit in your county blck up they
 
02:55:46.750 --> 02:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
if they weren't out with us contributing
 
02:55:48.590 --> 02:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
then you would double the capacity of
 
02:55:49.990 --> 02:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections and the
 
02:55:52.429 --> 02:55:52.439 align:start position:0%
price per day would go
 
02:55:55.229 --> 02:55:55.239 align:start position:0%
up last call for
 
02:55:58.469 --> 02:55:58.479 align:start position:0%
questions represent Stone again thank
 
02:56:00.830 --> 02:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair as I asked the other folks
 
02:56:04.590 --> 02:56:04.600 align:start position:0%
from uh straford County when you have a
 
02:56:06.469 --> 02:56:06.479 align:start position:0%
violation in pre-trial how long does it
 
02:56:07.710 --> 02:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
take you to get that individual before
 
02:56:10.830 --> 02:56:10.840 align:start position:0%
the judge we report our violations to
 
02:56:12.429 --> 02:56:12.439 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor's office and they can
 
02:56:16.469 --> 02:56:16.479 align:start position:0%
elect to send it to a judge or not so
 
02:56:17.990 --> 02:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
they have the discretion not to send it
 
02:56:20.870 --> 02:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
if they choose to typically what do you
 
02:56:22.870 --> 02:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
see in your experience if they do decide
 
02:56:25.150 --> 02:56:25.160 align:start position:0%
to have a court hearing if they do
 
02:56:26.990 --> 02:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
decide to have a court hearing um and
 
02:56:29.229 --> 02:56:29.239 align:start position:0%
they file the motion we usually see a
 
02:56:30.630 --> 02:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
hearing within 10
 
02:56:32.469 --> 02:56:32.479 align:start position:0%
days thank
 
02:56:34.590 --> 02:56:34.600 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:56:36.870 --> 02:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
Pratt how early do you get involved with
 
02:56:39.389 --> 02:56:39.399 align:start position:0%
the individuals I mean from the time of
 
02:56:42.030 --> 02:56:42.040 align:start position:0%
the bail bond the bail commission sees
 
02:56:44.910 --> 02:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
them what time do you get involved um we
 
02:56:46.630 --> 02:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
get involved when the court assigns them
 
02:56:48.790 --> 02:56:48.800 align:start position:0%
to us it's court ordered the baill bail
 
02:56:51.110 --> 02:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
Commissioners in marac County um while
 
02:56:53.030 --> 02:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
they are familiar with pre-trial and
 
02:56:55.910 --> 02:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
diversion they do
 
02:56:59.110 --> 02:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
not use that use that and I think it's
 
02:57:00.349 --> 02:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
probably because they don't feel like
 
02:57:02.550 --> 02:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
they can I and that's an that's just me
 
02:57:04.510 --> 02:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
saying it I don't have the data to
 
02:57:05.910 --> 02:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
support that have you reached out to any
 
02:57:08.070 --> 02:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
of to try and have a lunch and learn
 
02:57:09.790 --> 02:57:09.800 align:start position:0%
that the your service is available to
 
02:57:12.710 --> 02:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
them um no sir we haven't we've we've
 
02:57:14.590 --> 02:57:14.600 align:start position:0%
been to the brown bags are offered by
 
02:57:16.630 --> 02:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
the courts but that is certainly
 
02:57:18.269 --> 02:57:18.279 align:start position:0%
something I already wrote down that
 
02:57:19.750 --> 02:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
Carrie said that she's done that and I
 
02:57:21.670 --> 02:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
think it's a solid idea and I think that
 
02:57:23.150 --> 02:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
that's something that we could certainly
 
02:57:25.150 --> 02:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
do thank
 
02:57:27.950 --> 02:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
