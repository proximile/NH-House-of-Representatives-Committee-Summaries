House Bill 62 I also chair the New
 
00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rare disease advisory
 
00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 align:start position:0%
Council and I'm pleased to offer for
 
00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 align:start position:0%
your consideration today House Bill 62
 
00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 align:start position:0%
relative to continued in network access
 
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
to certain Health Care
 
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
Providers this bill began with a concern
 
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
brought to the rare disease advisory
 
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 align:start position:0%
Council last spring
 
00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
briefly since rare disease patients have
 
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 align:start position:0%
diseases about which few doctors have
 
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
any expertise or experience they
 
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
frequently choose their insurance
 
00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 align:start position:0%
products based on whether that product
 
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 align:start position:0%
allows access to the particular Doctor
 
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
Who may have expertise in their
 
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
particular rare disease when panels are
 
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
narrowed they may lose access to the
 
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 align:start position:0%
doctor they believed would have they
 
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
would have had access to when they
 
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
purchased their insurance
 
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
product consequently they are left
 
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
paying for a product which they believe
 
00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
provides little or no value to
 
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
them the language of this bill is based
 
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
on Georgia Senate Bill 352 which passed
 
00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
the Georgia Senate last year simply if
 
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
an insurer Prov if an insurer includes a
 
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
provider in its published directory
 
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
which a prospective insured used in
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
selecting their health plan then the
 
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
insurer must maintain ACC access to that
 
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
provider until the renewal date
 
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
exceptions are made if a provider loses
 
00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 align:start position:0%
their license or unilaterally terminates
 
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 align:start position:0%
participation in my mind this is simply
 
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
a truth and advertising issue insurers
 
00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 align:start position:0%
would never be subject to this provision
 
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
if they did not publish directories
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
which effectively promised perspective
 
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
Insurance access to particular
 
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
providers Tyler Brandon advised me that
 
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
modification of RSA 420 j7d would
 
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
require an update to the contract
 
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 align:start position:0%
provision in RSA 420 j8 I did email you
 
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
all Amendment
 
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
0067 last week and that would accomplish
 
00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 align:start position:0%

which is America's health insurance

of members here in New Hampshire um ahip
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
respectfully uh opposes um House Bill 62
 
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh for a number of reasons and I know
 
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
others will be testifying uh about this
 
00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
as well um the first thing I wanted to
 
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
say I think is that um the providers do
 
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:11.080 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of work um maintaining their
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
provider directories uh they're updated
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh very regularly um and in addition uh
 
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
it's something that the department keeps
 
00:08:21.869 --> 00:08:21.879 align:start position:0%
a close eye on um I know that they can
 
00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
be this provider directories can be
 
00:08:27.469 --> 00:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
included in um uh Market conduct exams
 
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
and uh you know there's improve ments
 
00:08:33.389 --> 00:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
are uh required and um the carriers um
 
00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
carry out those improvements so um we
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention that uh as the 60-day
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
provision which was just mentioned by um
 
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh um that is an
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
important provision in there in law um
 
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
to protect consumers um to ensure that
 
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
if their uh provider has left the
 
00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
network for whatever reason um that the
 
00:08:59.389 --> 00:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
consumer um is able to continue using
 
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
that provider for for 60 days um as if
 
00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
the provider had not left the network um
 
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
so there are continuity of care um
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
provisions and protections in current
 
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
law um the other thing um we are
 
00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:15.519 align:start position:0%
concerned about with this bill is that
 
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
it undermines the value of Provider
 
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
networks so carriers um you know spend a
 
00:09:26.069 --> 00:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
lot of time uh uh developing their
 
00:09:28.069 --> 00:09:28.079 align:start position:0%
networks and carefully selecting
 
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
providers based on um provids um
 
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
credentialing um quality of service
 
00:09:37.949 --> 00:09:37.959 align:start position:0%
patient safety um those sorts of things
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
to really ensure that um the providers
 
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
that they have included uh in their
 
00:09:46.069 --> 00:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
networks are um of you know the utmost
 
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:48.200 align:start position:0%
quality uh you know in terms of
 
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
providing high quality and Affordable
 
00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
Services uh the other concern that we
 
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
have with the bill um is that there
 
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
would be no protection for the patient
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of balance billing
 
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
um you may recall a couple years ago we
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
had a house bill
 
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
1809 um that bill only applies to
 
00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:10.839 align:start position:0%
anesthesiology uh Radiology emergency
 
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
medicine and pathology um so uh any of
 
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
other providers who are out of network
 
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
um under this bill would still be free
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
to balance Bill the patient um so
 
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
there's language in here about ensuring
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
um I think basically that the um
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
the covered person is you know kind of
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
kept whole and so I don't think that
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
there's really any way that um uh you
 
00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:39.959 align:start position:0%
know we we can have that sort of uh
 
00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
Insurance um so that in a nutshell um
 
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
those are the reasons um that we are
 
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:49.240 align:start position:0%
opposed to um House Bill 62 and we would
 
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh respectfully request that you find um
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
this bill to be uh inexpedient to
 
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
legislate and I'd be happy to try to
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
answer any questions or if I'm not able
 
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
to um other speakers may be able to or
 
00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
we can certainly take it back with the
 
00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:03.959 align:start position:0%
carriers and get back to you with
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
answers okay uh we do have a question uh
 
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
represent burough has a
 
00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:12.279 align:start position:0%
question um thank you for taking my my
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
question um back to I I I assume you
 
00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:17.959 align:start position:0%
were on When U representative Marsh was
 
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
speaking and how would you respond to um
 
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
his concern that a patient for example
 
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
who has a rare disease who signed on to
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
a network maybe specific speically for
 
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
the purpose of having access to a rare
 
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
disease specialist um and then that
 
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
person they they suddenly may be cut off
 
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
from that How would how does the
 
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
insurance uh industry respond to that
 
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
concern um sure and there there maybe
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
other carriers who can amplify on this
 
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
but I think generally speaking um first
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
of all there are network adequacy
 
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
requirements um that the carriers are
 
00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
required to meet or exceed um so you
 
00:11:59.550 --> 00:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
know I think that they're there might
 
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
not be that specific provider um the
 
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
person's name um still in the network
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
but there could be um other providers
 
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
who provide the same Services um and
 
00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:12.519 align:start position:0%
obviously um are meeting high quality
 
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
standards as well um the other thing I
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
will say is that there um are Provisions
 
00:12:20.829 --> 00:12:20.839 align:start position:0%
for care for patients to receive care um
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
by out of network providers so um if
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
that P if that patient um really felt
 
00:12:30.269 --> 00:12:30.279 align:start position:0%
strongly about um uh continuing to be a
 
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
patient with that provider um they would
 
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
you um representative Abramson has a
 
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:45.160 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um and thank
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question my the
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
question I was trying to raise my hand
 
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
for uh under William Marsh but maybe you
 
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
can answer um is is there an estimate on
 
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
how much this would increase insurance
 
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
premiums if the bill passed
 
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
um I don't have an estimate but we
 
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
certainly do believe that that there
 
00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
could be upward pressure on
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
premiums um and I would add that the um
 
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
I believe that the insurance department
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
will probably be testifying um before
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
you today um it's my understanding that
 
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
um requests can be made of the insurance
 
00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
department um anytime there's kind of a
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
you know a new mandate type of Bill
 
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
that's being considered um that they
 
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
have the um ability upon request um to
 
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
uh do an analysis to try to understand
 
00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
um the impacts so that could be
 
00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
something that um the insurance
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
department could potentially take a look
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
at followup for the question me
 
00:13:47.949 --> 00:13:47.959 align:start position:0%
inquire um is there a way to amend this
 
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
bill so that hypothetically if you had a
 
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
service provider and they're originally
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
charging uh a certain cost for services
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
if they were to try to increase what
 
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
they build the insurance company uh at
 
00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
at too great an increase in a year that
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
there would there would be some kind of
 
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
Outlet in place under the bill to uh
 
00:14:09.749 --> 00:14:09.759 align:start position:0%
allow the insurance carrier to
 
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
essentially say
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
no in other words if they increase their
 
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
price by you know 177% in one year
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
without a without an
 
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:23.240 align:start position:0%
explanation well I think I I'm not um a
 
00:14:25.629 --> 00:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
Contracting expert by any stretch of the
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
imagination but you know at a high level
 
00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
um I believe believe that um you know
 
00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:33.519 align:start position:0%
when the carriers enter into a contract
 
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
with a provider or hospital or provider
 
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
group um that that is a typically a
 
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
one-year contract so during that that
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
contract period I don't think that there
 
00:14:48.749 --> 00:14:48.759 align:start position:0%
would be um any changes uh in terms of
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
what the provider um is billing or what
 
00:14:53.949 --> 00:14:53.959 align:start position:0%
the carrier is
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
reimbursing um from year to year those
 
00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:00.839 align:start position:0%
can be adjusted um and certainly if um a
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
carrier and a provider uh at the end of
 
00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
at the end of one contract when
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
negotiations are going on for the next
 
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
contract if the two parties are not able
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
to come to an agreement um then there
 
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
would be no contract and that provider
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
network okay any other questions for
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
attorney croll seeing none thank you
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
very much thank you Mr chairman and I
 
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
guess I'll get you Tyler brenon
 
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:42.650 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:52.629 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:55.720 align:start position:0%
and are you on Tyler there you yes and
 
00:15:57.069 --> 00:15:57.079 align:start position:0%
you can hear me and see me okay I could
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
see my little screen but still had to
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
click that pieces so thank you uh Tyler
 
00:16:03.069 --> 00:16:03.079 align:start position:0%
Brandon with the New Hampshire insurance
 
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
department I'm the director of Health
 
00:16:07.069 --> 00:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
economics and uh we do not have a
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
position on the bill which uh as most of
 
00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:12.519 align:start position:0%
you know is traditional um I'm going to
 
00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:14.759 align:start position:0%
speak to both the bill and the amendment
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
uh because I think the amendment
 
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
potentially provides a little bit of
 
00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
clarification on some of the questions
 
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
that came up um clearly there's the
 
00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:23.839 align:start position:0%
intention to protect the member so the
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
member doesn't pay more than cost
 
00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
sharing when they go to a healthcare
 
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
provider that is no longer in the
 
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
network but traditionally if the
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
healthare provider is outside of the
 
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
network then they can charge the patient
 
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
whatever they want because there is no
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
agreement with the insurer to accept
 
00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.870 align:start position:0%
agreement with the insurer to accept
anything

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:16:44.189 --> 00:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
less one of the ways we govern the
 
00:16:46.309 --> 00:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
relationship between a carrier and a
 
00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:48.519 align:start position:0%
health care provider is a section of the
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
insurance statute called provider
 
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
contract standards and within that
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
existing provider contract standards
 
00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
there is the continued access provision
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
so every contract with a healthc care
 
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
provider needs to include language that
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
says a member or patient can continue to
 
00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
access that health care provider under
 
00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
the arrangement that uh existed prior to
 
00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919 align:start position:0%
the termination of the contract but it's
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
just for 60 days so um the amendment
 
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
changes that provision and then links
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
the original Bill and says the member of
 
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
the patient would have continued access
 
00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:25.799 align:start position:0%
for as long as they are under that that
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
contract their that subscriber
 
00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
certificate in other words their health
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
insurance benefit agreement which goes
 
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
back to I think that the purpose of the
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
bill which is if you've selected a
 
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
carrier based on the network you've got
 
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
kind of that ongoing
 
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:41.240 align:start position:0%
access um we have experienced some
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
confusion about uh how this would
 
00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:46.360 align:start position:0%
operationalize in the past um there is a
 
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:48.200 align:start position:0%
requirement also for members to be
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
notified about a provider that is
 
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
leaving the network um when some of
 
00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:56.039 align:start position:0%
these situations exist the um there are
 
00:17:58.029 --> 00:17:58.039 align:start position:0%
questions sometimes about the patient
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
liability ability at least in theory the
 
00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
patient would be um protected that being
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
said Network development is is
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
constantly kind of an evolving thing and
 
00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
when you think about the cycle that most
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
employers or subscribers operate on to
 
00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
the extent they're choosing their
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
insurance and many of them do it for a
 
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
calendar year plan year but not all of
 
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
them so if you're choosing in the fall
 
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
your insurance starts in January um and
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
goes through the calendar year on the
 
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
group side it may not be synchronized
 
00:18:26.669 --> 00:18:26.679 align:start position:0%
with the calendar year so to try and
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
align kind of the network devel El the
 
00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
Contracting phase with that of the uh of
 
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
the people buying their insurance would
 
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
be a substantial Challenge and um
 
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
probably not something that could be
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
operationalized very easily um even
 
00:18:42.149 --> 00:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
trying to make those adjustments deals
 
00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
with sort of cost shearing accumulators
 
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of other operational challenges
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
and even when you think about the
 
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
budgets of of hospitals carriers
 
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
employers they're all not going to be
 
00:18:54.029 --> 00:18:54.039 align:start position:0%
lined up and that's what lends itself in
 
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
part to this kind of Disconnect and the
 
00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
challenge of um synchronizing things in
 
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
such a way that uh everybody chooses
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
their Network and the network doesn't
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
change and you have that continued
 
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
access um we will say that any change in
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
legislatively that does give the
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
providers more bargaining power you are
 
00:19:15.789 --> 00:19:15.799 align:start position:0%
likely to see some inflationary pressure
 
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
with claims simply if they have more
 
00:19:20.669 --> 00:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
power they can demand more um I was
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
unaware that this kind of originated
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
with some of the rare disease concerns
 
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:26.200 align:start position:0%
we tend to think of providers such as
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
hospitals having the most bargaining
 
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
power it's very difficult to sell
 
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
insurance without one of our major
 
00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
hospitals in the network but that being
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
said The more a provider has kind of a
 
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
lock on a particular service they're
 
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
more likely to act as a monopoly so
 
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
that's certainly a consideration but at
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
the same time if you think about kind of
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
continued access under the contract
 
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
terms that were in place a year ago that
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
could be detrimental to a provider too a
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
provider that has accepted a fixed
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
payment at a certain level and now the
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
underlying health care cost cost of
 
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
treating somebody with a particular
 
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
condition goes up the provider wants to
 
00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
get more out of it they can't live under
 
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
the existing contract and now the member
 
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
or the patient has continued access at
 
00:20:12.029 --> 00:20:12.039 align:start position:0%
those those lower reimbursement levels
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
so with a provider that's paid a percent
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
of charges they could just increase
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
their charges but I think it's going to
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
potentially hit providers a little bit
 
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
unequally um the insurance department is
 
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
positioned to do what we call a mandate
 
00:20:27.909 --> 00:20:27.919 align:start position:0%
review we refer to Insurance mandates in
 
00:20:29.549 --> 00:20:29.559 align:start position:0%
the traditional way in other words it
 
00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
changes the scope of services that are
 
00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:34.039 align:start position:0%
covered but the way our statute is
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
actually written it gives the department
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
and the chair of a committee like this
 
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
the flexibility to look at something
 
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
that could be considered a mandate that
 
00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
actually is more than just the change in
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
the scope of services so the department
 
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
would be able to do an analysis um of
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
the policy and the claims data to
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
provide some estimate about how this
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
might impact premiums but it does take
 
00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:56.360 align:start position:0%
us we tend to want to allow about six
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
weeks to do the work and it can cost
 
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
about 25,000 to the department that
 
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
being said we do have the contract in
 
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
place and uh would' be happy to do the
 
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
work for the committee um if there's
 
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
enough interest in doing
 
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
that great we have questions uh
 
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
first Chris yeah
 
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
unmute okay the General thanks thank
 
00:21:31.549 --> 00:21:31.559 align:start position:0%
yous for being here
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
um is this a I'm a little uh unsure
 
00:21:39.789 --> 00:21:39.799 align:start position:0%
about these people are Specialists that
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
are rare I mean is I'm trying to figure
 
00:21:45.149 --> 00:21:45.159 align:start position:0%
out do they have do they charge more
 
00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
because of their
 
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
expertise uh totally or um is it a is it
 
00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
a situation where uh if they or are they
 
00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:56.799 align:start position:0%
just really busy because they're the
 
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
only people that do this work and uh
 
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
they don't need any more business and
 
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
and they you know raise their price if
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
they can uh or is it a situ and if it is
 
00:22:09.549 --> 00:22:09.559 align:start position:0%
that kind of a situ if it is a situation
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
where it's just their specialty and
 
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
they're not that busy can't can
 
00:22:18.029 --> 00:22:18.039 align:start position:0%
insurance companies share these these uh
 
00:22:21.789 --> 00:22:21.799 align:start position:0%
providers I mean uh so that they
 
00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
have uh you know have good business in
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
in the sense of you know being busy uh
 
00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:29.320 align:start position:0%
as opposed to just somebody who's
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
charging a premium because they have a a
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
specialty I don't know if that made any
 
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
sense but I'm just trying to figure out
 
00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:39.039 align:start position:0%
a way to to get around all these
 
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
issues yeah so I think that uh and I'll
 
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
speak generally because I can't speak
 
00:22:46.029 --> 00:22:46.039 align:start position:0%
specifically to some of the issues that
 
00:22:47.549 --> 00:22:47.559 align:start position:0%
may have come up in the rare disease
 
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
Council but uh generally speaking you
 
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
are seeing fewer location um in
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
healthcare in the delivery system that
 
00:22:57.549 --> 00:22:57.559 align:start position:0%
are performing very specialized services
 
00:22:59.310 --> 00:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
and that's in part because medicine is
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
becoming more complicated but it's also
 
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
becoming more expensive to set up a
 
00:23:06.669 --> 00:23:06.679 align:start position:0%
basically a program or an initiative at
 
00:23:08.909 --> 00:23:08.919 align:start position:0%
a particular setting so you might see
 
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock with a providing a
 
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
number of services in Lebanon that
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
aren't offered elsewhere in the state um
 
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
the alternative is going to Boston in
 
00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:18.039 align:start position:0%
the future there may be fewer of those
 
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
sites generally speaking professionals
 
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
Physicians are paid according to a kind
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
of a a fee schedule and it's often based
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
off what Medicare would do so it might
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
be 200% Medicare um those Physicians
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
might be independent they might be
 
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
represented by a hospital the hospital
 
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
on the other hand could be paid at a
 
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
substantially higher rate so to the
 
00:23:39.789 --> 00:23:39.799 align:start position:0%
extent you start to see monopolies
 
00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
develop they're probably going to take
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
place both with consideration for the
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
hospital and the actual physician or
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
other providers that are involved so I
 
00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
think to the extent there is recognition
 
00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
that there may be value or there is
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
value in certain access to specialized
 
00:23:57.549 --> 00:23:57.559 align:start position:0%
services in the future we will see fewer
 
00:23:57.559 --> 00:23:58.510 align:start position:0%
services in the future we will see fewer
sites

00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
sites
 
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
with potentially stronger monopolies
 
00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
when we developed the Network adequacy
 
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
rule we developed uh requirements for a
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
number of services you should get at the
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
local level those things are primary
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
care those things are physical therapy
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
mental health type services but for very
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
specialized Services the best we could
 
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
really do is say look those Services
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
need to be accessible within New England
 
00:24:21.149 --> 00:24:21.159 align:start position:0%
we simply don't have enough providers
 
00:24:23.549 --> 00:24:23.559 align:start position:0%
that we could create a standard that
 
00:24:25.389 --> 00:24:25.399 align:start position:0%
would be local enough without creating a
 
00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:27.559 align:start position:0%
monopoly and that provider saying car
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
you have to contract with me at whatever
 
00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:31.919 align:start position:0%
rates I demand so that's maybe a more
 
00:24:33.389 --> 00:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
General answer than than what you were
 
00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:35.480 align:start position:0%
looking for but it is reflective of the
 
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
trends where are
 
00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:24:43.159 --> 00:24:46.230 align:start position:0%
you representative
AEL

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh Mr Brandon it's good to
 
00:24:52.389 --> 00:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
see you again and thank you for your
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
testimony um I'm trying to to grasp the
 
00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
maximum uh time period that an insurance
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
company if this if this if this bill uh
 
00:25:09.549 --> 00:25:09.559 align:start position:0%
goes through uh that the an insurance
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
company would have to continue to
 
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
pay uh The Specialist uh and um I think
 
00:25:22.269 --> 00:25:22.279 align:start position:0%
Miss croll said that that there's a
 
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
60-day uh already written in there's a
 
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
60-day period so that means if
 
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
this all happened on the first day of
 
00:25:33.269 --> 00:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
coverage there would be 10 months as a
 
00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:35.240 align:start position:0%
maximum that would
 
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
continue um is that correct uh oh I see
 
00:25:42.269 --> 00:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
you're if I understand your question
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
you're talking about an additional 10
 
00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
months so right so a maximum you choose
 
00:25:50.909 --> 00:25:50.919 align:start position:0%
your insurance in November December your
 
00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
insurance starts on January but as soon
 
00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
as you've choose chosen your insurance
 
00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:57.039 align:start position:0%
then there's a dispute with the provider
 
00:25:59.470 --> 00:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
they're out a Network um today you
 
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
should have continued AC for January and
 
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
February under the the the the bill with
 
00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment then you're in a situation
 
00:26:09.149 --> 00:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
where your insurance runs through
 
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
December so you presumably would have
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
continued access to that provider
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
throughout the calendar year and um so
 
00:26:19.389 --> 00:26:19.399 align:start position:0%
that would be a big change for sure um
 
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
May I follow up please is a question may
 
00:26:24.029 --> 00:26:24.039 align:start position:0%
inquire yes so so that if the if we do
 
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
not pass this bill then um
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
the uh the insured would have would have
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
a maximum 10 month period to pay which
 
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
that person would have to pay extra uh
 
00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
under the current under the current
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
situation no so not necessarily so the
 
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
the idea with that continued access is
 
00:26:48.029 --> 00:26:48.039 align:start position:0%
that gives the carrier and the member a
 
00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
chance to find Rider um rather than
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
facing a cliff where they no longer have
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
access or as you were suggesting have to
 
00:26:57.789 --> 00:26:57.799 align:start position:0%
pay the added net Arrangement and and
 
00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
there that goes back to network adequacy
 
00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
requirements there has to be access
 
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere for those services that are
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
covered under your plan is benefit
 
00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
design but it might mean moving from uh
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
if a insurer didn't want to contract
 
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
with dmouth Hitchcock to a provider in
 
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
Boston something like that um that being
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
said we are talking about relatively
 
00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
rare scenarios that it would be um at
 
00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
that level I think it's might be a more
 
00:27:25.149 --> 00:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
specific situation um but again that
 
00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
continued access is to to create a
 
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.110 align:start position:0%
continued access is to to create a
transition

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
period Well Set uh representative
 
00:27:37.029 --> 00:27:37.039 align:start position:0%
Bartlett thank you um it's nice to see
 
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr Brandon again um okay
 
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
so this isn't just necessarily going to
 
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
apply to individually paid insurance
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
contract is that correct right it's not
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
specific to the individual or the group
 
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
market so um I mean we've been using
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
individuals because it's easiest to
 
00:27:56.669 --> 00:27:56.679 align:start position:0%
follow but presumably you could have a
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
group renewing in the middle of the
 
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
calendar year and uh facing the same
 
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
kind of situation where they've selected
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
a um a carrier based on the the the
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
network that's there and uh um but then
 
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
there's a dispute in the contract and
 
00:28:12.509 --> 00:28:12.519 align:start position:0%
they would have presumably they should
 
00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
have continued access with the bill and
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment to that provider but um
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
right yes further question me inquire
 
00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:25.640 align:start position:0%
thank you um so that if um an
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
employee really is not involved in
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
negotiating an insurance contract and
 
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
they say there's a three-year
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
term um this would extend more than just
 
00:28:37.509 --> 00:28:37.519 align:start position:0%
the 10 months we're talking about it
 
00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:39.919 align:start position:0%
could extend for the life of the
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
contract between the employer and the
 
00:28:45.149 --> 00:28:45.159 align:start position:0%
insurance company is that correct no the
 
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
way we would interpret the the language
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
it's based on the really the plan year
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
so to the extent that an employer has
 
00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
signed up for their insurance um they
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
may be intending to stay with the
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
carrier for the next three years but
 
00:28:58.269 --> 00:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
every year the the rates are are set
 
00:28:59.789 --> 00:28:59.799 align:start position:0%
just in place for a year and that's when
 
00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
that the plan year would would take
 
00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
place further question thank you um but
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
the employee is probably not involved in
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
those negotiations is so they I mean
 
00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
they could really be stuck couldn't they
 
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
if they so it's yeah it's an interesting
 
00:29:18.269 --> 00:29:18.279 align:start position:0%
you know you raised actually a larger
 
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
question that I hope I don't be seen as
 
00:29:22.509 --> 00:29:22.519 align:start position:0%
digressing from but individuals tend to
 
00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
be quite selective about their insurance
 
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:25.720 align:start position:0%
products that's why you you might see
 
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
more often narrow networks in the idual
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
Market whereas in the group Market an
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
employer tries to represent all
 
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
employees you T fewer examples of narrow
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
networks in the group Market I'm
 
00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:38.039 align:start position:0%
speaking nationally as much as locally
 
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
and in part because of the the scenario
 
00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:41.320 align:start position:0%
you're describing the individual
 
00:29:43.549 --> 00:29:43.559 align:start position:0%
employee doesn't have a lot of of weight
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
in the selection of the carrier and the
 
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
product so the employer tends to a on
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
the side of having broader networks
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
richer benefit designs and um uh and of
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
course in the you know the small group
 
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
Market there are a lot of sort of Market
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
rules and large group seen as those
 
00:29:58.990 --> 00:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
employers being able to look after their
 
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
employees and choose benefit designs
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
with a fair amount of
 
00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
sophistication thank
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
you okay um before you go Tyler make
 
00:30:11.389 --> 00:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
sure I understand um in the bill there's
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
an um exemptions or providers that it
 
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't include and not withstanding
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
this is not first of all this doesn't
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
look like it's just narrowed to a
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
specialist this looks like all providers
 
00:30:26.909 --> 00:30:26.919 align:start position:0%
is that correct yeah that's that's an
 
00:30:28.509 --> 00:30:28.519 align:start position:0%
important point and and I should have
 
00:30:30.269 --> 00:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
made that we're not talking about just
 
00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
rare diseases and really we're not even
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
talking about providers just in New
 
00:30:35.909 --> 00:30:35.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so you're literally talking
 
00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
about a contract change with what would
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
be thousands of providers in a network
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
so it it's uh I can't understate kind of
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
the significance that um this could have
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
okay but on the other side it then when
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
this exemption says except if uh becomes
 
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
the provider becomes out of network due
 
00:30:55.389 --> 00:30:55.399 align:start position:0%
to suspension
 
00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
expiration now don't generally when an
 
00:31:02.029 --> 00:31:02.039 align:start position:0%
insurance company decides to uh say that
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
they want to take a provider out of the
 
00:31:05.789 --> 00:31:05.799 align:start position:0%
network don't they generally wait till
 
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
their contract has
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
expired um there are two scenarios and
 
00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:15.320 align:start position:0%
um many of the contracts are what are
 
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
considered Evergreens they will
 
00:31:18.909 --> 00:31:18.919 align:start position:0%
automatically renew and those are with
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
Physicians more likely than hospitals
 
00:31:23.549 --> 00:31:23.559 align:start position:0%
and um the hospital contracts I me
 
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
multi-year contracts with Provisions but
 
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
um to the extent that there an
 
00:31:29.549 --> 00:31:29.559 align:start position:0%
expiration date that does force a
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
negotiation uh more readily for
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
sure okay seems this bill would need a
 
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
lot of work if we were to try to pass it
 
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
okay is there any other uh questions for
 
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
Mr Brennan seeing none we thank you very
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
much for your
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
testimony excuse me Mr chairman I just
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
want to let you representative ham has
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
um joined us by phone and she's out in
 
00:31:57.669 --> 00:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
the attendee list so she may um raise
 
00:32:00.389 --> 00:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
her hand using the star n feature on her
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
phone can can I move her over I could
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
not move her over I was given the option
 
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:07.480 align:start position:0%
of allowing her to speak or removing her
 
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
from the meeting entirely and I didn't
 
00:32:13.149 --> 00:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
want to do that do that uh right but she
 
00:32:15.509 --> 00:32:15.519 align:start position:0%
can hear just fine from where she is and
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
if she ra you know knows how to raise
 
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
her hand with the star nine she'll be
 
00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
able to participate okay
 
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
so I I did I just clicked her to allowed
 
00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
her to talk yeah oh okay so I guess can
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
I just note that representative melier
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
is now present and also he's I did see
 
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:37.240 align:start position:0%
he pops up too so um okay
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
great uh so that's it for people who
 
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
testify um we have quite a list of
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
people who signed up I guess this is the
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
the feature benefits of the of having
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
the electronic sign up um so let's see
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%

okay okay so Sabrina uh and Peter bragon

okay um I think Peter did tell me ahead
 
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
of time that he might have a problem but
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
I'll start with Sabrina first and um so

00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%

00:34:48.109 --> 00:34:48.119 align:start position:0%

00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
Sabrina Dunlap I'm director of
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
government relations at Anthem um thanks
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
for having me I won't repeat everything
 
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
that Heidi said but we do um does oppose
 
00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
this bill and we agree largely with um
 
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
many of the concerns Heidi already
 
00:35:04.349 --> 00:35:04.359 align:start position:0%
raised I do want to just emphasize that
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
as has been mentioned um the insurance
 
00:35:08.829 --> 00:35:08.839 align:start position:0%
rigs do require access to out of network
 
00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
care if it can't be obtained in network
 
00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:12.599 align:start position:0%
so I think that does get at the
 
00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
underline concern um with this bill so
 
00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions but um I
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
also did submit written testimony um on
 
00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
this so thank you
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
great uh I don't see any question
 
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
questions so you're all set there okay
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman and uh I hadn't
 
00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned anything earlier um but I
 
00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
mistakenly was out shoveling snow and
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
real didn't realize I came in too late
 
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
to make the 30 minute window so I
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
apologize for that thank you for your
 
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
Indulgence um thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
for the record Peter bragon representing
 
00:36:06.309 --> 00:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare the state's
 
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
only not for profit Health insurer a
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
company founded by doctors providing
 
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
coverage for over 100,000 of our friends
 
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
and Neighbors in the granite state and
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to House Bill
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
62 um it reports to protect consumers by
 
00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
allowing up to one year of what is for
 
00:36:26.829 --> 00:36:26.839 align:start position:0%
all intents and purposes um in network
 
00:36:28.829 --> 00:36:28.839 align:start position:0%
access even though the provider has left
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
the network as had been stated current
 
00:36:34.109 --> 00:36:34.119 align:start position:0%
law um provides that covered members of
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
our insurance plans can retain what is
 
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
essentially in network access to a
 
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
provider for 60 days after the
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
provider's contract with us ends in
 
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
order to allow appropriate transition of
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
care uh this would be a good place to
 
00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:49.640 align:start position:0%
point out that in in some instances we
 
00:36:52.589 --> 00:36:52.599 align:start position:0%
cover access those longer than 60 days
 
00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
in specific instances and I think the
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
whole um purpose of this bill came about
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
because of a specific instance that came
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
about and we oftentimes will consider
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
specific circumstances uh for example
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
the case of a terminal patient we don't
 
00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
want to force that patient to transition
 
00:37:12.309 --> 00:37:12.319 align:start position:0%
to another provider so we can work
 
00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
around that the law says the law does
 
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
not say it has to be 60 days but it
 
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
certainly has a floor of 60 days we're
 
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
willing to work with people to to take
 
00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
care of that the proposal before you
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
because of the amendment would replace
 
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
the 60-day guaranteed consumer
 
00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.230 align:start position:0%
the 60-day guaranteed consumer
protection

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
protection
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
with a variable scheme that could be
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
anywhere from zero days to 365 days
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
given some of the timing issues so in
 
00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
some cases it gives consumers even less
 
00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
protection than they already have uh in
 
00:37:43.309 --> 00:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
addition to less consumer protection as
 
00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
Tyler mentioned the bill will be very
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
difficult to implement keeping track of
 
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
a data member en roles and who was on
 
00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
the directory at the time perhaps this
 
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
bill would be worthy of consideration if
 
00:37:56.109 --> 00:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
all of our health plans ran from January
 
00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
1st to December 31st and all of our
 
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:01.240 align:start position:0%
provider contracts ran from January 1st
 
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
to December 31st but that's not the way
 
00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
it works we have plans that start on
 
00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:07.640 align:start position:0%
every just about every single month in
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
the calendar and we have provider
 
00:38:12.069 --> 00:38:12.079 align:start position:0%
contracts that also have a wide array of
 
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
starting and ending dates so we believe
 
00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
hp62 would be unworkable in this uh
 
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
environment so we prefer the consumer
 
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
protection that exists in current law
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's easy to understand it's easy to
 
00:38:25.309 --> 00:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
implement and rather than change the
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
whole system for some is Rel ated uh
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
incidents we urge you to find hb6
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
expedience legis thank you very
 
00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
much okay is there uh representative
 
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
aberson has a question if you're willing
 
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
to take one I
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
am go ahead thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um what are
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
some of the reasons that uh providers uh
 
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
leave the network are they leaving on
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
their own are they being forced out or
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
is a mutual agreement I think in most
 
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:54.680 align:start position:0%
cases and I'm so no expert but most
 
00:38:56.309 --> 00:38:56.319 align:start position:0%
cases the contracts just come to an end
 
00:38:59.069 --> 00:38:59.079 align:start position:0%
and the the negotiations about uh uh
 
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates for various things
 
00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
lead to one side or the other not uh not
 
00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.030 align:start position:0%
lead to one side or the other not uh not
being

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
cont all
 
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:11.480 align:start position:0%
right great all right um seeing Oh
 
00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:14.440 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions uh I will close
 
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:20.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
62 and we have a two-minute
 
00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
break I got to go find my coffee
 
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
oh before you run off just wanted to let
 
00:39:30.829 --> 00:39:30.839 align:start position:0%
you know I got my vaccine yesterday so I
 
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:33.640 align:start position:0%
will be here all day all right you got
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
it early because of the snowstorm huh
 
00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.079 align:start position:0%
that's right state did a great job
 
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
called us right at home on Sunday
 
00:39:44.309 --> 00:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
night that's that is good but my arm
 
00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:47.480 align:start position:0%
hurts it's a small place price to pay
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
yes that's for sure and that but that's
 
00:39:50.829 --> 00:39:50.839 align:start position:0%
just your first one that's the second
 
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
one that's supposed to be more painful
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
but see what happens I'll risk it
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
well we haven't been able to sign up for
 
00:40:01.589 --> 00:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
the second one yet yeah all right I
 
00:40:08.589 --> 00:40:08.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
it well good morning all I'm sorry I had
 
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
to be late um I had 14 in of fluff out
 
00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
in the uh the ride driveway I had to
 
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
play with and uh it was heavy but it was
 
00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
nice to
 
00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.950 align:start position:0%
nice to
see

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:43.960 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
so I'm back oh by the way Chris I got
 
00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
notebook hang on I'll show
 
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
you there it
 
00:40:55.319 --> 00:41:01.230 align:start position:0%
you there it
is

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
and everything is
 
00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
tabed yeah but the problem is you're not
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
sitting next to me
 
00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
anymore well well we have to move the
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
windows I guess
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
so well hopefully someday in the near
 
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
future we'll be we'll be sitting back in
 
00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.870 align:start position:0%
future we'll be we'll be sitting back in
the

00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
room now good Lord willing
 
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
hey March
 
00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
Christie you got your shot right how you
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
feeling just fine my my arm's a little
 
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
sore but that's the only thing yeah i'
 
00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
I've heard from folks that we older
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
people take it much better because we've
 
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
had so much other stuff in our body
 
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
already and the Young Folks could be the
 
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
Young Folks get it hard because they
 
00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
haven't had all the stuff that we've had
 
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
well we we got most of the diseases we
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
didn't get all the vaccines so I don't
 
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:12.280 align:start position:0%
agree I remember measles being very very
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
sick with measles I was the first in the
 
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
neighborhood to get it yeah back when I
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
was like four or five I had
 
00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
diptheria oh yeah it was pretty heavy
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
yeah but uh then you know all they
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
started coming out with all the shots
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
then again when I was years old it was
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
way back in
 
00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
1952 right right well I remember you
 
00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
know I had Ms and German Measles and
 
00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
measles and you know all of those
 
00:42:46.589 --> 00:42:46.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:55.160 --> 00:43:05.309 align:start position:0%
 
mute

00:43:05.309 --> 00:43:05.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
I just did it I muted myself okay so
 
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
we'll open up the public hearing on 191
 
00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
and here from representative Marsh good
 
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
morning representative Marsh hello again
 
00:43:18.549 --> 00:43:18.559 align:start position:0%
everyone uh for the record I'm
 
00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:19.640 align:start position:0%
representative William Marsh
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
representing seven towns in southern
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
Caroll County relevant to this bill I
 
00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:26.200 align:start position:0%
I've been a trustee of Huggins Hospital
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
since 2004 including two non-consecutive
 
00:43:31.069 --> 00:43:31.079 align:start position:0%
terms as corporate treasur and I'm
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
retired from my solo Private Practice
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
I'm pleased today to offer for your
 
00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:38.079 align:start position:0%
consideration house spill 191 relative
 
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
to Prior authorizations and patient
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
transfers under the Managed Care Group
 
00:43:44.549 --> 00:43:44.559 align:start position:0%
Health insurance policies which I found
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
at the request of the New Hampshire
 
00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:47.430 align:start position:0%
at the request of the New Hampshire
Hospital

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
Hospital
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
Association first of all this is not a
 
00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
bill to ban prior
 
00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:55.640 align:start position:0%
authorizations it does three things
 
00:43:58.549 --> 00:43:58.559 align:start position:0%
first it requires 60 days notice for new
 
00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:01.240 align:start position:0%
prior authorization requirements doctors
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
and hospitals need this tracking
 
00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
patients who have already been referred
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
for a treatment or consultation is
 
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
obviously burdensome and it takes time
 
00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
to educate employed practitioners about
 
00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
new requirements so that they can
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
comply second the bill requires that
 
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
prior authorizations remain valid for 6
 
00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
months sometimes it takes that long to
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
schedule a surgery or get an appointment
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
to see a busy
 
00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
specialist third last and for me this is
 
00:44:34.349 --> 00:44:34.359 align:start position:0%
the most important section of the bill
 
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
it limits the use of Prior
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
authorizations to delay the transfer of
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
patients to step down
 
00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:43.640 align:start position:0%
facilities we all want patients to get
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
the appropriate level of
 
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
care we all want to not spend too much
 
00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
money to provide that
 
00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
care and understand that all of our
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
hospitals have very narrow operating
 
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
margins in a fee for service Hospital
 
00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
extending the length of Stay by one day
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
can easily become financially
 
00:45:05.549 --> 00:45:05.559 align:start position:0%
burdensome in critical access hospitals
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
this is even more of a problem as one
 
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
condition of participation in Medicare
 
00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
for a critical access hospitals
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
maintaining an average length of stay of
 
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
96 hours or
 
00:45:19.549 --> 00:45:19.559 align:start position:0%
less hospitals do understand the need to
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
have appropriate transport for such
 
00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
transfers but delaying or preventing
 
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
transfers to less expensive step down
 
00:45:29.069 --> 00:45:29.079 align:start position:0%
facilities with prior authorizations is
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
just not
 
00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:33.720 align:start position:0%
reasonable Co has hit the balance sheet
 
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
of our hospitals particularly hard so
 
00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
this last provision is particularly
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
needed right now further the recent
 
00:45:44.109 --> 00:45:44.119 align:start position:0%
surge of Co strained our total Hospital
 
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
capacity delay in sending patients to
 
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
step down facilities exacerbates that
 
00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
problem promptly addressing this issue
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
will better prepare New Hampshire to
 
00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
handle potential Surge from the new more
 
00:45:58.910 --> 00:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
infectious strains of covid that we hear
 
00:45:58.920 --> 00:45:59.870 align:start position:0%
infectious strains of covid that we hear
are

00:45:59.870 --> 00:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
coming I thank you all for consideration
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
of my bill I'll be glad to take
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
questions I can't stay for the entire
 
00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:07.640 align:start position:0%
hearing as I need to return to Health
 
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
bill any question yeah representative
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:22.589 --> 00:46:22.599 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you uh thank you dror
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
and uh representative Marsh um
 
00:46:32.349 --> 00:46:32.359 align:start position:0%
does this apply to um to hospital
 
00:46:35.549 --> 00:46:35.559 align:start position:0%
services and to prescriptions or is it
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
just one or the
 
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
other uh the short answer is yes uh the
 
00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
third provision the the transfer
 
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
provision I don't think applies to
 
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
prescriptions that that would strictly
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:56.829 --> 00:46:56.839 align:start position:0%
you okay any other questions
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
all right see not thank you very much
 
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I have quite a list here so
 
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
um let's see why don't uh we'll do
 
00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
another so I see if there's any other
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
legislator who signed up uh I don't see
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
that right off the
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
top um okay so then we're going up
 
00:47:30.349 --> 00:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
um uh let's see well here's is Matt H is
 
00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:41.079 align:start position:0%
list do do I see Matt Matt are you there
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%

I see him on the
 
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
list on on the attendees list oh there

member of the committee
 
00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:57.750 align:start position:0%
member of the committee
good

good
 
00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:05.480 align:start position:0%

today hopefully he's almost there there
 
00:48:07.839 --> 00:48:08.950 align:start position:0%
today hopefully he's almost there there

we
 
00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
go uh thank you Mr chairman I am here I

hope that you can hear me yes I
 
00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
can great thank you very much and thank
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to testify my
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
name is Matthew Hood I'm the vice
 
00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
president of government relations at
 
00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock
 
00:48:30.109 --> 00:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
and uh I am here this morning to support
 
00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 191 as we believe that it
 
00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
reduces barriers to necessary Services
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm going to highlight particular
 
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
sections of the new 420 J12 that would
 
00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:43.720 align:start position:0%
uh particularly alleviate patient as
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
well as administrative
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
burdens um section one uh representative
 
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
Marsh spoke to this about um scheduling
 
00:48:57.789 --> 00:48:57.799 align:start position:0%
procedures and having a six Monon uh
 
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
window during which the prior
 
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
authorization is valid and I guess what
 
00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:03.400 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say is it's not just a
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
schedule but oftentimes uh patients need
 
00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:09.400 align:start position:0%
to reschedule appointments for many
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
reasons whether it's patient
 
00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
complications provider illnesses or
 
00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:15.880 align:start position:0%
schedule shortages of resources uh covid
 
00:49:18.589 --> 00:49:18.599 align:start position:0%
was mentioned and as people know um that
 
00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
threw a wrench into um scheduled
 
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
procedures last spring uh there was
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
actually a bill that addressed that
 
00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:29.480 align:start position:0%
issue and pushed out the authorization
 
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
date for um procedures that may have
 
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
been affected by the by that period of
 
00:49:37.069 --> 00:49:37.079 align:start position:0%
time I would reiterate this is not a
 
00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
blanket prohibition on prior
 
00:49:40.589 --> 00:49:40.599 align:start position:0%
authorizations but it's it's a request
 
00:49:43.309 --> 00:49:43.319 align:start position:0%
to not have to start from Ground Zero um
 
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
I don't think six months is particularly
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
honorous um uh but I'm happy to engage
 
00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:49.960 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
conversation the next piece that I'd
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
like to speak to is um
 
00:49:59.549 --> 00:49:59.559 align:start position:0%
when uh patient this is when patients
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
are undergoing a procedure and the
 
00:50:04.829 --> 00:50:04.839 align:start position:0%
provider provider can see an otherwise
 
00:50:04.839 --> 00:50:06.109 align:start position:0%
provider provider can see an otherwise
previously

00:50:06.109 --> 00:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
previously
 
00:50:08.829 --> 00:50:08.839 align:start position:0%
unknown uh situation that requires
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
additional treatment oftentimes um that
 
00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
is that secondary procedure that's done
 
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
in the course of the primary procedure
 
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
isn't covered because there wasn't a
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
prior off received for that um this is
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
one that particularly strikes me as as
 
00:50:27.309 --> 00:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
odd since why would we ever want to make
 
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
a patient go through two procedures um
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
in the same area so I actually
 
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
understand uh Mr chairman and members of
 
00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
the committee that um ensures the
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
provider the carriers have some U
 
00:50:41.789 --> 00:50:41.799 align:start position:0%
concerns with experimental treatments in
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
this context but I'm fairly certain that
 
00:50:45.789 --> 00:50:45.799 align:start position:0%
the committee and others could draft
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
language that would exclude experimental
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
treatments as part of this uh
 
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
provision uh
 
00:50:58.270 --> 00:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
finally want to make sure it's final um
 
00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
I would reiterate the interf facility
 
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
transport piece since I think again
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's a win-win for both uh providers
 
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
and carriers we have a patient who's
 
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
been sitting uh at Darth Hitchcock since
 
00:51:11.349 --> 00:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
March of
 
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
2020 um I I I'm not pretending that that
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
is exclusively the uh result of failure
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
to get a prior authorization for
 
00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:21.160 align:start position:0%
discharge there's lots of complicating
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
factors but that's a bed for almost a
 
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
year uh that can't be used and um the
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
sooner people can uh at at a high Acuity
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
facility so the the sooner that people
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
can move the sooner that uh other
 
00:51:35.549 --> 00:51:35.559 align:start position:0%
additional patients who need treatment
 
00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
can get in so with that I'll conclude um
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions and
 
00:51:43.710 --> 00:51:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:47.960 align:start position:0%
time uh I don't see any hands up so I
 
00:51:50.789 --> 00:51:50.799 align:start position:0%
guess you're get off easy
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
today you I should say so thank you
 
00:51:54.359 --> 00:51:56.950 align:start position:0%
today you I should say so thank you
representative

00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
uh all right so now we'll do uh do one
 
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
more support um Michael
 
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
padmore so Michael if you just raise
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
your hand and jump to the top for
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
me there you
 
00:52:14.789 --> 00:52:14.799 align:start position:0%
are promoting to a
 
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
panelist and Bonnie you might want to
 
00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
mute oh this way you're on the phone do

you know how do you know the phone
commands

00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
commands
 
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
Bonnie um no I guess
 
00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:26.549 align:start position:0%
Bonnie um no I guess
not

00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
let's see I have them in my notes here
 
00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
somewhere I think it's star nine is that
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
what it is to raise your hand and star

Hampshire Medical Society strongly
 
00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
supports House Bill 191 uh which aims to
 
00:53:00.829 --> 00:53:00.839 align:start position:0%
reform the prior authorization process
 
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
that private insurance companies have in
 
00:53:04.589 --> 00:53:04.599 align:start position:0%
place um with respect to time I I'll
 
00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
keep my remarks brief um as I've
 
00:53:08.109 --> 00:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
actually worked with a couple of our
 
00:53:10.349 --> 00:53:10.359 align:start position:0%
physicians um and and different practice
 
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
managers who are involved with some of
 
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
the different practices around the state
 
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh who have uh been able to sign up uh
 
00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
to testify uh this morning and I think
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
can really speak directly uh to the
 
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:21.880 align:start position:0%
impact of prior authorization um better
 
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
than I can um so I'll just close by
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
saying uh that in addition uh to the New
 
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medical Society um five
 
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
physician specialty organizations are
 
00:53:31.549 --> 00:53:31.559 align:start position:0%
also in strong support the New Hampshire

00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
and then finally I'll just refer you to
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
my written testimony um which outlines
 
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
actually just a number of different
 
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
physician stories um uh nurse stories
 
00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
just from a variety of providers and
 
00:53:59.109 --> 00:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
patients about how prior off has
 
00:54:02.349 --> 00:54:02.359 align:start position:0%
impacted um patient care um so with that
 
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
um we urge you to vote all to pass on
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
House Bill 191 uh and I'm happy to
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you might
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
have great uh representative Ben Hoon
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you and thank you
 
00:54:16.349 --> 00:54:16.359 align:start position:0%
for taking my testimony it's good to see
 
00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
you back Mr padmore um I have a question
 
00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
that is probably more basic than it
 
00:54:23.789 --> 00:54:23.799 align:start position:0%
needs to be but I'd like to understand
 
00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
why prior authorization is necessary to
 
00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
move a patient to a lesser level of care
 
00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
is that I just don't understand that
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that just be automatic to move
 
00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
a patient to where he belongs to a
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
lesser expensive con conceivably um
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
level of care thank you for your
 
00:54:44.069 --> 00:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
question and what I'll do forgive me I I
 
00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
do think there may be some folks um who
 
00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:48.200 align:start position:0%
are testifying after me who just can
 
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
speak to that with much more experienced
 
00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
than I can so I I'll defer to them and
 
00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
and and close my testimony but again
 
00:54:55.109 --> 00:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any additional question
 
00:54:58.870 --> 00:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you I appreciate
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
that okay all right so now we'll change
 
00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
your pace a little bit and we'll invite
 
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
Heidi crawl up who will uh give us the
 
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
other point of
 
00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
view so hi I don't I think I took you
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
out so you need to raise your hand again
 
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
so I can see you oh there you are I see
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
you now you don't have to raise your
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
hand i'm promoting you to a panelist
 
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:34.710 align:start position:0%

00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh maybe she stepped out oh right she
 
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
did say she had another build she was
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
testifying on so that must be what where
 
00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:55.839 align:start position:0%
she is right now okay so uh
 
00:56:02.829 --> 00:56:02.839 align:start position:0%

Anthem um I thank you for having me I
 
00:56:39.150 --> 00:56:39.160 align:start position:0%
did submit written testimony um from our
 
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
medical director dick lefur who could
 
00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
not be here today so I did point out in
 
00:56:46.829 --> 00:56:46.839 align:start position:0%
our testimony two Provisions in
 
00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:48.839 align:start position:0%
particular um that I'd like to speak to
 
00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
one is the procedure during another um
 
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
already approved procedure so we
 
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
generally do approve uh procedures that
 
00:57:00.029 --> 00:57:00.039 align:start position:0%
are medically necessary but we do review
 
00:57:01.029 --> 00:57:01.039 align:start position:0%
them and we think that's really
 
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
important for patient safety um and to
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that the procedure that was
 
00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:07.640 align:start position:0%
performed during the other procedure was
 
00:57:10.029 --> 00:57:10.039 align:start position:0%
in fact medically appropriate so I just
 
00:57:12.789 --> 00:57:12.799 align:start position:0%
want to flag that um and from from what
 
00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
I can tell we we actually most of the
 
00:57:17.069 --> 00:57:17.079 align:start position:0%
time do approve these so um we don't
 
00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
really see that as as a problem or a
 
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
barrier to care at all um and then the
 
00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
second issue is the transfer issue so
 
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
we actually do not require prior off for
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
transfer um we're aligned with the
 
00:57:32.589 --> 00:57:32.599 align:start position:0%
providers we would like to get patients
 
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:34.799 align:start position:0%
to appropriate care especially step down
 
00:57:37.109 --> 00:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
care um so we actually don't require
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
prior o for the transfer we do review
 
00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
the facility however um and I think
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
that's important to flag because we want
 
00:57:45.069 --> 00:57:45.079 align:start position:0%
to make sure patients actually end up in
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
the correct place um and as far as I
 
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
know I've talked to our internal folks
 
00:57:52.589 --> 00:57:52.599 align:start position:0%
we have very fast turnaround time on uh
 
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
transfers so again we don't really see
 
00:57:58.150 --> 00:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
that as a problem um I we're not seeing
 
00:57:59.950 --> 00:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
slow turnarounds we're not seeing delays
 
00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
and certainly prior o is not a barrier
 
00:58:04.829 --> 00:58:04.839 align:start position:0%
to care or a barrier to being
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
transferred um I would again emphasize
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
the importance of patient safety here
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
and and the importance of reviewing the
 
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
facility to make sure patients actually
 
00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
end up in the right place um so I think
 
00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
that's it for me I do just want to
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
emphasize that um you know we see prior
 
00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
o as a really important Care Management
 
00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
tool it's an important uh decision
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
support tool and I do think this bill
 
00:58:33.069 --> 00:58:33.079 align:start position:0%
undermines prior o in a really
 
00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:35.240 align:start position:0%
detrimental way and and we do oppose it
 
00:58:37.589 --> 00:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
obviously um so happy to take any
 
00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:39.160 align:start position:0%
questions and thank you very much for
 
00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:40.910 align:start position:0%

hospitals we are in strong support of
 
00:59:59.870 --> 00:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
hb11 and we do thank representative
 
01:00:02.589 --> 01:00:02.599 align:start position:0%
Marsh for agreeing to sponsor this bill
 
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
a Senate bill Senate Bill 531 was
 
01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
introduced last year that attempted to
 
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
address some of our cons the concerns of
 
01:00:12.349 --> 01:00:12.359 align:start position:0%
the provider community and while some of
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
those provisions of the Senate Bill were
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
passed last year and signed into law to
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
areas of concern remain and they were
 
01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
outlined very well by your by
 
01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh the administrative
 
01:00:27.309 --> 01:00:27.319 align:start position:0%
complexities associated with the prior o
 
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
as well as the transfer
 
01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:31.880 align:start position:0%
provision we understand that the
 
01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:34.280 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers utilize prior off and
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
again we are not saying anything um
 
01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
we're not asking that that be removed um
 
01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:43.640 align:start position:0%
I I just want to be very clear all we
 
01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
are asking is and that when a prior
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
authorization is necessary the floor
 
01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
goes from three months to six months and
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
I think um Senator Hood did a very very
 
01:00:57.069 --> 01:00:57.079 align:start position:0%
good job explaining giving you some
 
01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:00.799 align:start position:0%
examples of when that occurs so that is
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
um all that we're trying to do is ensure
 
01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
that during especially now um that we
 
01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:07.799 align:start position:0%
have so many issues with folks getting
 
01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
into a specialist that the floor go from
 
01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:12.440 align:start position:0%
three months to six months to ease the
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
burden for providers and patients the um
 
01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:17.960 align:start position:0%
and I just want to mention the carriers
 
01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
have we have had discussions with the
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
carriers um and they have suggested
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
creating an electronic prior
 
01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
process that could address some of these
 
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
issues and we would agree I think that
 
01:01:31.349 --> 01:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
is a a great idea um and we welcome
 
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
those um discussions however the need to
 
01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
reduce administrative burden um of Prior
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
o um needing to be reauthorized multiple
 
01:01:44.029 --> 01:01:44.039 align:start position:0%
times for the same service remains um I
 
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
just wanted to mention the medical
 
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
necessity again Senator Hood outlined
 
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
that well um it does happen I I heard
 
01:01:56.430 --> 01:01:56.440 align:start position:0%
the testimony of um Miss Dunlop um and I
 
01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
guess I would say that that is um one
 
01:02:02.829 --> 01:02:02.839 align:start position:0%
carrier um and I don't know um what the
 
01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
particular experience is with our
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals but certainly what I have
 
01:02:10.109 --> 01:02:10.119 align:start position:0%
heard is that this is a problem and that
 
01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
obviously that's why we put this bill in
 
01:02:15.549 --> 01:02:15.559 align:start position:0%
um and then um the last change was just
 
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
going from um a 30-day notice to a
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
60-day notice um a prior bill that we
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
worked on actually had a much longer um
 
01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
time frame but we we adjusted that to 60
 
01:02:29.309 --> 01:02:29.319 align:start position:0%
days the patient transfer is an issue
 
01:02:32.589 --> 01:02:32.599 align:start position:0%
that is very challenging in fact um the
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
hospital Association and the foundation
 
01:02:37.150 --> 01:02:37.160 align:start position:0%
for Healthy Communities actually creates
 
01:02:41.069 --> 01:02:41.079 align:start position:0%
um yearly a barriers to um discharge we
 
01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
call it or barriers to people um
 
01:02:46.269 --> 01:02:46.279 align:start position:0%
receiving the right care and we just
 
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
produced a report that just is kind of
 
01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:50.200 align:start position:0%
Hut off the presses and I will share
 
01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
that with everyone after um this hearing
 
01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
but we do do have a significant number
 
01:02:59.309 --> 01:02:59.319 align:start position:0%
of individuals that are unable to get to
 
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
the lower level of care we're not
 
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
talking about transferring from an acute
 
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
care hospital to Mass General that is
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
not those emergencies are not the issue
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
we are trying to get patients as again
 
01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh um clarified
 
01:03:16.029 --> 01:03:16.039 align:start position:0%
getting them to a lower level such as
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
rehab um or a long-term care facility
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
and we just need to get them moved more
 
01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:23.720 align:start position:0%
quickly there are carriers that require
 
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
prior ations again hence why we put this
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
in the bill we are not looking to um to
 
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
undermine any any work that the carriers
 
01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
are doing and to make sure that they are
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
it is a legitimate transfer that's why
 
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
with the language is written the way it
 
01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
is um and we're happy to continue to
 
01:03:43.870 --> 01:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
work with the carriers we have met
 
01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
numerous times I just wanted to be on
 
01:03:48.549 --> 01:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
the record um trying to come up with
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
language or ask them for additional
 
01:03:53.069 --> 01:03:53.079 align:start position:0%
language but we need something that
 
01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
really allow allows the providers the
 
01:03:59.390 --> 01:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals in this case to work to get to
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
the right level of care make sure
 
01:04:05.309 --> 01:04:05.319 align:start position:0%
they're using the carry the the transfer
 
01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
vendor that um is appropriate and in
 
01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
network for the carrier we're fine with
 
01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
all that we just need them to get we
 
01:04:14.349 --> 01:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
need help getting them into the right
 
01:04:16.029 --> 01:04:16.039 align:start position:0%
level of care that really is what we're
 
01:04:20.349 --> 01:04:20.359 align:start position:0%
trying to do um and like I said I I will
 
01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
share with everyone the barriers to
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
discharge report that I think will be
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
illuminated um it's we have the issue
 
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
for a lot of carriers um including
 
01:04:31.269 --> 01:04:31.279 align:start position:0%
Medicare but that this bill does not
 
01:04:34.269 --> 01:04:34.279 align:start position:0%
address that we do believe that the
 
01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
prior authorization um the changes to
 
01:04:38.269 --> 01:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
the prior authorization process are in
 
01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
the best interest of patients and will
 
01:04:42.829 --> 01:04:42.839 align:start position:0%
result in a more costeffective Care by
 
01:04:44.309 --> 01:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
eliminating inappropriate and
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
unnecessary barriers we support the bill
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
ask you to pass it and I'm happy to
 
01:04:51.549 --> 01:04:51.559 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you so
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%

01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak I've met some of
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
you before I'm the director of breast
 
01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
Imaging at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical
 
01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
Center up here in Lebanon and my
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
testimony is brief but best related by
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
an example from a tragic story of how
 
01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
this requirement for preauth ization can
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
actually kill and this is a true story
 
01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
from Pennsylvania not from Dartmouth
 
01:06:31.870 --> 01:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
thankfully but a typical scenario is a
 
01:06:34.829 --> 01:06:34.839 align:start position:0%
woman came to a radiology facility she
 
01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
had a breast lump and she had a
 
01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
prescription from her doctor for a
 
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
diagnostic mamogram which is where
 
01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
things usually start the prescription
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
did not include orders for
 
01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
unanticipated additional testing that
 
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
would be required but again you can't
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
guess what's going to happen The
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
Physician could not be successfully
 
01:06:59.390 --> 01:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
contacted for this order for the
 
01:07:03.269 --> 01:07:03.279 align:start position:0%
additional Imaging and the patient left
 
01:07:05.109 --> 01:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
because otherwise she would have
 
01:07:07.069 --> 01:07:07.079 align:start position:0%
uncovered medical expenses in the
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars and the medically
 
01:07:13.269 --> 01:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate testing to diagnose her lump
 
01:07:15.309 --> 01:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
as a breast cancer which specifically
 
01:07:18.029 --> 01:07:18.039 align:start position:0%
would include ultrasound an ultrasound
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
guided core biopsy was not done so the
 
01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
patient was told her mamogram was normal
 
01:07:26.349 --> 01:07:26.359 align:start position:0%
and she was sent home she fell through
 
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
the cracks the provider thought
 
01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
Radiology would pick it up and the
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
radiologist thought the provider would
 
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
pick it up and she now has metastatic
 
01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
breast cancer and is actually in
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
hospice so the very Act of having to
 
01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839 align:start position:0%
stop and call someone like a referring
 
01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
provider or an insurance company when
 
01:07:49.390 --> 01:07:49.400 align:start position:0%
dealing with women afraid of having
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
breast cancer stressful potentially
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
life-threatening is in my opinion as a
 
01:07:58.829 --> 01:07:58.839 align:start position:0%
As a caretaker inhumane it's inefficient
 
01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:02.200 align:start position:0%
regularly and it's potentially dangerous
 
01:08:05.309 --> 01:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
so neither the insurance company nor the
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
referring provider have any training or
 
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
knowledge of breast cancer or Imaging
 
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
findings or testing required no one can
 
01:08:17.709 --> 01:08:17.719 align:start position:0%
predict or understand the specifics of
 
01:08:21.309 --> 01:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
the testing required leaving unskilled
 
01:08:25.470 --> 01:08:25.480 align:start position:0%
decision makers in the way of timely
 
01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
diagnosis so from my perspective the
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
only thing that pre-authorization
 
01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
requirement does is introduce
 
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
inefficiency suffering and potential for
 
01:08:41.709 --> 01:08:41.719 align:start position:0%
actual harm and medical negligence so I
 
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
strongly encourage the passage of this
 
01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
bill to save everyone time money and
 
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
distress and possibly alive thank
 
01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you any questions from the
 
01:08:55.149 --> 01:08:55.159 align:start position:0%
committee seeing n thank you very much
 
01:08:58.149 --> 01:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you so uh Heidi
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:04.349 --> 01:09:04.359 align:start position:0%
yet good morning Mr chairman yes I am
 
01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
back okay sorry for that thank you very
 
01:09:10.269 --> 01:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
much for accommodating I'm doing two
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
zooms um so again uh good morning uh Mr
 
01:09:15.149 --> 01:09:15.159 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee um
 
01:09:17.349 --> 01:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Heidi croll I
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
work at Gallagher Callahan and gartell
 
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
I'm here today representing ahip which
 
01:09:23.789 --> 01:09:23.799 align:start position:0%
stands for America's health insurance
 
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
plans we are the trade Association for
 
01:09:30.269 --> 01:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
um health insurance carriers um we ahip
 
01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
is opposed to House Bill 199 I'm sorry
 
01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
191 because it will restrict and
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
undermine the use of prior authorization
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
which is a critical tool used to protect
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
patient safety and promote
 
01:09:44.189 --> 01:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
evidence-based treatments and improved
 
01:09:46.829 --> 01:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
outcomes um we also oppose house build
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
191 because we believe it could lead to
 
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
Upward pressure on health insurance
 
01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
premium at a time when New Hampshire
 
01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
residents and businesses um cannot
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
afford higher
 
01:09:59.070 --> 01:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
prices um I want to cover kind of three
 
01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
areas today one is just um a little bit
 
01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
about what prior authorization is and
 
01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
why it's important um second some
 
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
background information on prior
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
authorization in New Hampshire um and I
 
01:10:11.950 --> 01:10:11.960 align:start position:0%
did send you an email last night um with
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
a two-page document or um and then uh
 
01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
third I wanted to just cover kind of uh
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
alternative uh non-legislative solutions
 
01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
to hille
 
01:10:25.950 --> 01:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
191 um so first a little bit about prior
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
authorization and why it's important um
 
01:10:30.990 --> 01:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
Health Plans use medical management
 
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
tools um such as prior authorization uh
 
01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
step therapy formularies provider
 
01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:39.080 align:start position:0%
networks to ensure that patients receive
 
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
access to Safe effective and evident
 
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
space Care at an affordable cost um
 
01:10:47.189 --> 01:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
prior authorization also helps to P put
 
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
certain patients on carrier's radar um
 
01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than later so that the
 
01:10:54.030 --> 01:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
carrier can actually help with patient
 
01:10:56.110 --> 01:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
care coordination namely getting the
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
right care uh at the right setting at
 
01:10:59.390 --> 01:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
the right
 
01:11:02.229 --> 01:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
time prior authorization also targets
 
01:11:04.149 --> 01:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
certain prescription drugs and Medical
 
01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
Services um that are prone to a wide
 
01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
variation in provider practices um and
 
01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
the potential for either overuse
 
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
underuse or misuse of services um which
 
01:11:17.189 --> 01:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
of course can impact uh have an impact
 
01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
on patient care and safety as well as
 
01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
costs um when a prior authorization is
 
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
required and and not every drug or
 
01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
service is has a prior authorization in
 
01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
fact it's a small minority um but when
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
it is required the prior authorization
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
Protocols are developed and tailored um
 
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
very specifically to the particular drug
 
01:11:42.669 --> 01:11:42.679 align:start position:0%
or the medical service in question um so
 
01:11:45.070 --> 01:11:45.080 align:start position:0%
there is no one-size fits-all when it
 
01:11:47.189 --> 01:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
comes to prior authorization
 
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
protocols um prior authorization
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
Protocols are routinely reviewed and
 
01:11:55.390 --> 01:11:55.400 align:start position:0%
adjusted um in response to changes in
 
01:11:58.590 --> 01:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
the safety uh Effectiveness or value of
 
01:12:01.629 --> 01:12:01.639 align:start position:0%
an existing drug or medical procedure um
 
01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
as well as in response to new medical
 
01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
guidance or or new drugs or procedures
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
coming to Market um that may provide
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
more um effective and cost-effective
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
treatment uh Federal programs such as
 
01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and Medicare recognize the
 
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
value of prior authorization as do
 
01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
providers um especially if providers
 
01:12:25.229 --> 01:12:25.239 align:start position:0%
that are in value-based reimbursement
 
01:12:28.270 --> 01:12:28.280 align:start position:0%
models um so when those providers are in
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
those kind of contracts value based care
 
01:12:33.310 --> 01:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
contracts um where they have a stake in
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
patient outcomes as well as cost and
 
01:12:38.590 --> 01:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
savings um the providers themselves
 
01:12:41.629 --> 01:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
actually um also develop and use prior
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
authorization protocols to help them
 
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
deliver highquality medically necessary
 
01:12:49.229 --> 01:12:49.239 align:start position:0%
care and a cost effective manner so um
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
the point is that even providers
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
recognize the value of prior
 
01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.390 align:start position:0%
recognize the value of prior
authorization

01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
01:12:56.669 --> 01:12:56.679 align:start position:0%
um turning to the background um and
 
01:12:58.510 --> 01:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
information on prior authorization in
 
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um first I wanted to let
 
01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
you know that um to the best of ahip's
 
01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
knowledge uh other states do not have
 
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
laws or Provisions similar to House Bill
 
01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:12.440 align:start position:0%
191 um ahip reviewed its database of
 
01:13:14.629 --> 01:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
laws related to prior authorization in
 
01:13:17.830 --> 01:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
other states and was unable to find laws
 
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
similar to the ones proposed in house
 
01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:20.830 align:start position:0%
similar to the ones proposed in house
bille

01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
bille
 
01:13:24.629 --> 01:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
191 um secondly uh in the handout that I
 
01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
emailed to you you'll see a description
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
of how carriers develop their
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
utilization Management Programs um
 
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
including prior authorization and the
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
bottom line is that um utilization
 
01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
management policies are developed
 
01:13:41.470 --> 01:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
through a very rigorous process um to
 
01:13:43.709 --> 01:13:43.719 align:start position:0%
ensure that they reflect um the most
 
01:13:46.229 --> 01:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
current scientific data and also
 
01:13:46.239 --> 01:13:47.310 align:start position:0%
current scientific data and also
clinical

01:13:47.310 --> 01:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
clinical
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
knowledge um third it's important to
 
01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
know that in recent years the
 
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
legislature has made quite a number of
 
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
significant ific amendments to New
 
01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's prior authorization laws um
 
01:13:59.709 --> 01:13:59.719 align:start position:0%
including five changes that were made
 
01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
last year pursuant to the passage of
 
01:14:05.470 --> 01:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1280 and House Bill 1639 um
 
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
the carriers came to the table and did a
 
01:14:09.709 --> 01:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
lot of negotiating with the hospital
 
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
Association the medical society and
 
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
others um legislators as well um those
 
01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
changes took effect uh between July 29th
 
01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
of 2020 and January 1st of this year and
 
01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
we think it's important to give those
 
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
changes some time um and see what their
 
01:14:29.550 --> 01:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
impacts are before we start making more
 
01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
significant uh
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
changes finally it's important to
 
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
understand that we do have uh consumer
 
01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
protection Provisions um in RSA
 
01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
420e relative to lure of medical
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
utilization review entities and these
 
01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
consumer uh uh protection Provisions
 
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
include time periods within which prior
 
01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
authorization must be determined uh
 
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
Provisions for expedited review and the
 
01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:55.960 align:start position:0%
right for both an internal and external
 
01:14:58.750 --> 01:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
review um and I will also mention that
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
the carriers meet um national standards
 
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
as well um around uh their prior
 
01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:06.550 align:start position:0%
as well um around uh their prior
authorization

01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
01:15:10.709 --> 01:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
protocols so finally um turning to um
 
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
non-legislative Solutions uh in our
 
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
opinion legislating legislatively
 
01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
mandated restrictions like those
 
01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
proposed in house bow 191 are far too
 
01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
broad and um simply not appropriate uh
 
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
and we believe that there are
 
01:15:24.159 --> 01:15:25.350 align:start position:0%
and we believe that there are
non-legislative

01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
non-legislative
 
01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
Solutions uh we have spoken with the
 
01:15:30.149 --> 01:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
providers um and offered that if the
 
01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
providers are running into problems with
 
01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
a particular prior authorization
 
01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
requirement that one or more carriers
 
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
have you know particular to a particular
 
01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:42.520 align:start position:0%
drug or particular service um that we
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
are you know the medical directors and
 
01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
others at the carriers are are all ears
 
01:15:50.189 --> 01:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
and more than willing to um have
 
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
discussions about amending particular
 
01:15:55.229 --> 01:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
prior authorization protocols and in
 
01:15:58.110 --> 01:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
fact um this has happened historically
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
um where uh you know one or more New
 
01:16:04.110 --> 01:16:04.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doctors will approach the
 
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
medical director of a of a um carrier
 
01:16:09.310 --> 01:16:09.320 align:start position:0%
and uh make them aware of some
 
01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
information either um late breaking news
 
01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
uh about um a particular procedure or
 
01:16:18.149 --> 01:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
just maybe a problem that they're having
 
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
and the carriers are more than willing
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
to work um to try to uh see if it's
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate to amend the protocols um
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
but to the best of my knowledge um the
 
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
providers have not of late um taken the
 
01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
carriers up on this
 
01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
offer um the other thing that we did
 
01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
offer is to um take specific examples of
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
the pro of the you know uh problems that
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
the providers are running into and try
 
01:16:44.189 --> 01:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
to crosswalk that with the use of the
 
01:16:46.590 --> 01:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
electronic prior authorization systems
 
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
that the carriers have um could help U
 
01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
minimize or even avoid um some of the
 
01:16:54.870 --> 01:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
problems in so um that's the other thing
 
01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to mention is that um
 
01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
electronic prior authorization is a tool
 
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
that can be used to kind of you know
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
ease the administrative burden of prior
 
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
authorization um that the providers um
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
you know have mentioned without losing
 
01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
the benefits of prior authorization um
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
so that's uh something I wanted to
 
01:17:16.629 --> 01:17:16.639 align:start position:0%
mention that we have um we have those
 
01:17:19.149 --> 01:17:19.159 align:start position:0%
tools that can streamline the process
 
01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
and reduce the administrative burden for
 
01:17:23.790 --> 01:17:23.800 align:start position:0%
everyone involved um so short we
 
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
strongly object to House Bill 199 uh 191
 
01:17:29.310 --> 01:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
um because we feel it will undermine a
 
01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
critical tool used to protect patient
 
01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
safety and promote evidence-based
 
01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
treatments um and uh we are concerned it
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
will drive up premiums for New Hampshire
 
01:17:40.189 --> 01:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
citizens and businesses and with that
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any questions um
 
01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
consideration uh um we do have a
 
01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
question uh representative
 
01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
abson uh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
you than you for taking my question um
 
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
just like the last bill do you have an
 
01:17:58.750 --> 01:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
estimate for how much you think this
 
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
might increase the costs for a premiums
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
as a percentage
 
01:18:06.910 --> 01:18:06.920 align:start position:0%
basis it's a great question I don't um
 
01:18:09.229 --> 01:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
but I can say that the way the bill is
 
01:18:12.990 --> 01:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
written it is very broad so this would
 
01:18:16.990 --> 01:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
uh impact prior authorizations um and
 
01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
drugs across the board Services across
 
01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
the board so it um has the potential to
 
01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
touch um every single service or
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
prescription medication that a patient
 
01:18:30.239 --> 01:18:33.669 align:start position:0%
prescription medication that a patient
might

01:18:33.669 --> 01:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
receive great I'm seeing no more
 
01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank
 
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
you uh I will next call
 
01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
on uh Nancy erson boia Bonia let me see
 
01:18:52.629 --> 01:18:52.639 align:start position:0%
so you if she would just raise her hand

01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:00.350 align:start position:0%
there we go and I can promote you the
panelist

01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:16.510 --> 01:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:19.709 --> 01:19:19.719 align:start position:0%
muted am I unmuted now you're unmuted
 
01:19:23.629 --> 01:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
now you're good okay good morning um my
 
01:19:27.149 --> 01:19:27.159 align:start position:0%
name is Nancy erson Bona I'm a retina
 
01:19:30.629 --> 01:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
specialist which is a subsp specialist
 
01:19:31.830 --> 01:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh within
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology I practice in Bedford New
 
01:19:36.750 --> 01:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I've been here for in New
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for almost 16 years and
 
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
um I was notified about this bill
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday and I wanted to um weigh in on
 
01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
the bill itself but the broader ISS
 
01:19:54.910 --> 01:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
issue of prior
 
01:19:57.070 --> 01:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
authorization um I think it's very
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate that I'm following um Heidi
 
01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
croll because I could not disagree more
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
with pretty much everything she said and
 
01:20:09.390 --> 01:20:09.400 align:start position:0%
I'm going to start by saying retina
 
01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
specialists in the United States are the
 
01:20:15.070 --> 01:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
number one Medicare
 
01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
billers drug-wise and that is
 
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
because we use FDA approved Medicaid s
 
01:20:28.270 --> 01:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
such as IIA lucentis B ofu drugs which
 
01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:29.110 align:start position:0%
such as IIA lucentis B ofu drugs which
were

01:20:29.110 --> 01:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:20:33.229 --> 01:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
designed to treat macular degeneration
 
01:20:33.239 --> 01:20:34.310 align:start position:0%
designed to treat macular degeneration
diabetic

01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
diabetic
 
01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
retinopathy vascular diseases all of
 
01:20:40.149 --> 01:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
which are sight threatening and
 
01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
blinding without these
 
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
medications during my training for
 
01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
instance over 25 years
 
01:20:51.310 --> 01:20:51.320 align:start position:0%
ago we had no effective treatments and
 
01:20:55.229 --> 01:20:55.239 align:start position:0%
people tradition Ally went legally blind
 
01:20:58.270 --> 01:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
from their disease with the Advent of
 
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
these medications over the last 15 years
 
01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
we've reduced we've been able to
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
maintain Vision in 90% of our wet Mac
 
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
degeneration cases and we have reduced
 
01:21:15.229 --> 01:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
diabetic blindness which is the leading
 
01:21:18.189 --> 01:21:18.199 align:start position:0%
reason why young diabetics lose their
 
01:21:21.629 --> 01:21:21.639 align:start position:0%
jobs go on disability and are out of the
 
01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
workforce these drugs are very
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
expensive because they're FDA
 
01:21:32.110 --> 01:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
approved and over the
 
01:21:37.390 --> 01:21:37.400 align:start position:0%
last 48 months and as of January 1 the
 
01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:40.639 align:start position:0%
burden on providers in private practice
 
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
to use these drugs for our patients is
 
01:21:50.830 --> 01:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
prohibited um just to use some of her
 
01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
comments that providers have not taken
 
01:21:56.430 --> 01:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
up the
 
01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:57.990 align:start position:0%
up the
offer

01:21:57.990 --> 01:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
offer
 
01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.669 align:start position:0%
offer
to

01:21:59.669 --> 01:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
discuss issues with medical directors on
 
01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
the use of these
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
drugs is first of all not even the issue
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
they have as of January 1 for instance
 
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
United healthc
 
01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
care they're all of the Medicare
 
01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
Advantage plans across the board have
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
instituted stepwise therapy and PR
 
01:22:28.270 --> 01:22:28.280 align:start position:0%
authorization and to the point
 
01:22:32.629 --> 01:22:32.639 align:start position:0%
where it takes my solo practice more
 
01:22:35.790 --> 01:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
than one full-time equivalent on the
 
01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
phone all day trying to get prior
 
01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
offs and we are now being told and this
 
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
is all new as of January 1 so when she
 
01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
said give time for these former bills to
 
01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
take event January 1 marked the start of
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
all of these Medicare Advantage Plans in
 
01:22:56.110 --> 01:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
particular and the commercial United
 
01:22:58.430 --> 01:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
Etna Sigma Blue Cross Blue Shield
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
Harvard Pilgrim stride to
 
01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
reverse or let ex ex
 
01:23:12.270 --> 01:23:12.280 align:start position:0%
the request that was made by the by HHS
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
in 2020 because of covid to back off on
 
01:23:16.199 --> 01:23:17.990 align:start position:0%
in 2020 because of covid to back off on
prior

01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
prior
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
off they let January 1 be the end of of
 
01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
that Arena and now we are being told
 
01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
that not only do we have to have prior
 
01:23:31.550 --> 01:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
offs for things we didn't used to have
 
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
including a vastin which is the off
 
01:23:36.910 --> 01:23:36.920 align:start position:0%
label medication they're trying to force
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
us to use instead of IA and Luc sentus
 
01:23:40.590 --> 01:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
because it's
 
01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
$65 they're actually making us go
 
01:23:46.910 --> 01:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
through a prior off to get a $65 drug
 
01:23:49.470 --> 01:23:49.480 align:start position:0%
for injection every time the patient
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
comes and the prior
 
01:23:55.149 --> 01:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
off this in this bill the six month
 
01:23:58.229 --> 01:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
prior off to me should be the minimum if
 
01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
you had any idea how long we sit on the
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
phone for a single patient single prior
 
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
off we're talking sometimes an hour and
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
45 minutes and she talked about these
 
01:24:15.470 --> 01:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
electronic options for prior oth that is
 
01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
a joke because we have a problem in New
 
01:24:21.310 --> 01:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with our availity website most
 
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
of these
 
01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
plans we have tried going
 
01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:27.719 align:start position:0%
online we end up having to go on the
 
01:24:29.950 --> 01:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
phone as a matter of fact the carriers
 
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
themselves tell us the best way to get
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
to them is on the phone not trying
 
01:24:36.750 --> 01:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
electronically then they tell us as of
 
01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
January 1 that they have well human and
 
01:24:42.030 --> 01:24:42.040 align:start position:0%
others have told us that before that
 
01:24:44.109 --> 01:24:44.119 align:start position:0%
they have 14 business days to decide
 
01:24:46.709 --> 01:24:46.719 align:start position:0%
whether this patient needs treatment in
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
the meantime my patient can go blind
 
01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:51.030 align:start position:0%
the meantime my patient can go blind
irreversibly

01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
irreversibly
 
01:24:53.669 --> 01:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
blind and
 
01:24:58.590 --> 01:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
you know compounding all of that is now
 
01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
um Miss craw said that prior offs are
 
01:25:05.550 --> 01:25:05.560 align:start position:0%
essential because they're evidence-based
 
01:25:08.430 --> 01:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
therapy and for patient safety who is
 
01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:09.550 align:start position:0%
therapy and for patient safety who is
she

01:25:09.550 --> 01:25:09.560 align:start position:0%
she
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
kidding we know our Academy has been
 
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
fighting and been in this in the federal
 
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
legislation showing that over 90% of
 
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
every prior off for intravital
 
01:25:22.669 --> 01:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
injections which is what I'm talking
 
01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:27.800 align:start position:0%
about is approved so why are we being
 
01:25:30.430 --> 01:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
delayed care and having to go through
 
01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:31.990 align:start position:0%
delayed care and having to go through
this

01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:25:35.149 --> 01:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
continuous prior off burden and Blue
 
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
Cross Blue
 
01:25:41.709 --> 01:25:41.719 align:start position:0%
Shield the other um Miss Dunlap was
 
01:25:44.910 --> 01:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
saying you know how Blue Cross Blue
 
01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:47.480 align:start position:0%
Shield is is
 
01:25:50.910 --> 01:25:50.920 align:start position:0%
um their prior off is for safety and all
 
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
this other stuff they're a perfect
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
example after fighting and fighting and
 
01:26:00.229 --> 01:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
fighting for prior off on their
 
01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
patients we have patients that have been
 
01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:06.639 align:start position:0%
getting injections for three years and
 
01:26:08.750 --> 01:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
every time I do an injection on certain
 
01:26:11.390 --> 01:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
patients Blue Cross Blue Shield holds up
 
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
the payment asks for the records reviews
 
01:26:16.270 --> 01:26:16.280 align:start position:0%
the treatment this is after the prior
 
01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
off procedure so I know I'm going on and
 
01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
on but all I can say is Bill 191 to me
 
01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
forget being broad it is so specific it
 
01:26:28.229 --> 01:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
is so limited the least these patients
 
01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
deserve is a six-month prior off the
 
01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
transfer of care obviously is more of a
 
01:26:35.629 --> 01:26:35.639 align:start position:0%
a facility
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
issue um but when it comes to private
 
01:26:44.830 --> 01:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
practice and patient care my patients
 
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
are currently in a very very precarious
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
situation because almost 40% of seniors
 
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
now are signing on to these Medicare
 
01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:54.430 align:start position:0%
now are signing on to these Medicare
Advantage

01:26:54.430 --> 01:26:54.440 align:start position:0%
Advantage
 
01:26:59.590 --> 01:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
plans all of them require prior offs now
 
01:27:01.470 --> 01:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
all of them have instituted stepwise
 
01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
therapy and they are quoting studies
 
01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
that's the other thing that Miss croll
 
01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
said about
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
evidence-based they don't know the
 
01:27:11.870 --> 01:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
beginnings of how to interpret these
 
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
studies they are taking the studies out
 
01:27:17.590 --> 01:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
of context they are putting statements
 
01:27:21.709 --> 01:27:21.719 align:start position:0%
in their in their plans that say that um
 
01:27:24.109 --> 01:27:24.119 align:start position:0%
you might show that the patient has
 
01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
failed on a vastin which is forcing us
 
01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
to use an off-label drug non FDA
 
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
approved with safety issues over FDA
 
01:27:36.270 --> 01:27:36.280 align:start position:0%
approved drugs in and of itself is
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
unethical but for them to quote studies
 
01:27:41.910 --> 01:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
saying they're equivalent when they
 
01:27:43.390 --> 01:27:43.400 align:start position:0%
haven't even
 
01:27:46.750 --> 01:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
studied the the 15 years of data that's
 
01:27:49.390 --> 01:27:49.400 align:start position:0%
out there that shows that some drugs are
 
01:27:52.109 --> 01:27:52.119 align:start position:0%
superior and I after 16 years of
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
training I like to be the one to decide
 
01:27:57.629 --> 01:27:57.639 align:start position:0%
which drug my patient gets so with that
 
01:27:59.910 --> 01:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
I urge you to consider not only
 
01:28:03.550 --> 01:28:03.560 align:start position:0%
approving 191 but really looking
 
01:28:07.109 --> 01:28:07.119 align:start position:0%
into um why they're saying premiums are
 
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
going to go up they're going to go up
 
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
for one reason and one reason only
 
01:28:12.750 --> 01:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
because they're going to have to prior
 
01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:15.400 align:start position:0%
off the appropriate treatment and drugs
 
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
of patients not because they had to have
 
01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
a prior off procedure to do it there's
 
01:28:23.189 --> 01:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely no reason in one 91 why any
 
01:28:25.390 --> 01:28:25.400 align:start position:0%
premium should go up if anything it
 
01:28:26.910 --> 01:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
should go down if you're getting
 
01:28:30.189 --> 01:28:30.199 align:start position:0%
transfer of care to a a less expensive
 
01:28:33.070 --> 01:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
facility and your prior offs are for six
 
01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
months your own staff won't have to be
 
01:28:38.109 --> 01:28:38.119 align:start position:0%
on the phone with providers every day of
 
01:28:41.109 --> 01:28:41.119 align:start position:0%
the week for we we now have some Blue
 
01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
Cross Blue Shield people giving us 30
 
01:28:46.629 --> 01:28:46.639 align:start position:0%
days one drug one injection and making
 
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
us go back and get another prior
 
01:28:52.229 --> 01:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
off so with that I thank you for your
 
01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
time and um I can take any
 
01:28:57.629 --> 01:28:57.639 align:start position:0%
questions um yeah before I take
 
01:28:59.310 --> 01:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
questions um I'm not sure this
 
01:29:01.629 --> 01:29:01.639 align:start position:0%
legislation is going to affect medic
 
01:29:03.109 --> 01:29:03.119 align:start position:0%
Medicare or
 
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid I I did not say Medicare or
 
01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid as a matter of fact I
 
01:29:11.709 --> 01:29:11.719 align:start position:0%
wish the problem this bill will affect
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
is your commercial Medicare Medicaid
 
01:29:18.510 --> 01:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
replacement plans because they run under
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
they are commercial and they're prior
 
01:29:23.470 --> 01:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
offs Medicare does not chire prior
 
01:29:27.669 --> 01:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
o okay all right uh any other questions
 
01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none we thank you very
 
01:29:34.910 --> 01:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony thanks okay next

[Music]

01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
muted there you go hi okay thanks so
 
01:30:14.189 --> 01:30:14.199 align:start position:0%
much for this opportunity um I don't
 
01:30:18.910 --> 01:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
know oh I can start a video too okay um
 
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
I'm a practice manager for general
 
01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
surgery practice
 
01:30:25.109 --> 01:30:25.119 align:start position:0%
um and I've been uh working with them
 
01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
for 17 years and I would concur so much
 
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
of what Nancy just said um again we're
 
01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
general surgery so it's very different
 
01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:33.750 align:start position:0%
general surgery so it's very different
than

01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:30:36.030 --> 01:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology um
 
01:30:41.629 --> 01:30:41.639 align:start position:0%
but pre-authorization at this point um
 
01:30:44.709 --> 01:30:44.719 align:start position:0%
Anthem uses a company by the name of aim
 
01:30:47.950 --> 01:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
and I am not exagerating when I say I
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
have a staff member that will be on the
 
01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
phone for two or three hours waiting for
 
01:30:55.159 --> 01:30:56.550 align:start position:0%
phone for two or three hours waiting for
a

01:30:56.550 --> 01:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:30:59.270 --> 01:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative um and you're not getting
 
01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
a representative that
 
01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
um is um knowledgeable for the most part
 
01:31:12.109 --> 01:31:12.119 align:start position:0%
they're just taking the data not really
 
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
even aware of the data they're taking um
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
many times we do MRI for breast cancer
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
and you can they're wearing blinders
 
01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
they have um little to no medical
 
01:31:29.109 --> 01:31:29.119 align:start position:0%
experience and they're making a lot of
 
01:31:31.229 --> 01:31:31.239 align:start position:0%
times the determination about whether
 
01:31:35.550 --> 01:31:35.560 align:start position:0%
this um oth is is expedited or not um
 
01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
you know a woman's waiting for her MRI
 
01:31:40.229 --> 01:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
because her pathology has said that she
 
01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
has a um a possibly invasive um breast
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
cancer um and it's it's really um
 
01:31:55.109 --> 01:31:55.119 align:start position:0%
it's time consuming a waste of time um
 
01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
for many of the
 
01:32:00.669 --> 01:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
authorizations um and there's little to
 
01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
no value I would like to talk about when
 
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
they're talking about the increase of um
 
01:32:08.830 --> 01:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
costs I've been in the business for a
 
01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
long time and my understanding was that
 
01:32:14.189 --> 01:32:14.199 align:start position:0%
they put authorizations in place to save
 
01:32:15.709 --> 01:32:15.719 align:start position:0%
money so I think it's sort of
 
01:32:17.709 --> 01:32:17.719 align:start position:0%
interesting that now they're saying it's
 
01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
going to cost money um I'll also address
 
01:32:24.270 --> 01:32:24.280 align:start position:0%
the fact that she's mentioning something
 
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
about calling the um
 
01:32:29.470 --> 01:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
or discussing it with the medical
 
01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
director that is
 
01:32:38.270 --> 01:32:38.280 align:start position:0%
um it's I I've I've I've done it um for
 
01:32:41.109 --> 01:32:41.119 align:start position:0%
a procedure that continually got um
 
01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
denied but it took me over a year to try
 
01:32:49.070 --> 01:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
to finally get somebody that would
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
understand what it was that they were
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
denying that made no sense and at no
 
01:32:55.990 --> 01:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
point did I ever fully get to the
 
01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
medical director and this was Anthem um
 
01:33:02.270 --> 01:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
United Health Care for the second
 
01:33:04.430 --> 01:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
procedure piece of it United healthc
 
01:33:07.550 --> 01:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
Care uses a company by the name of
 
01:33:11.149 --> 01:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
optim so you have to send the claim in
 
01:33:14.270 --> 01:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
then they say you know uh NOP you didn't
 
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
off the second procedure we need notes
 
01:33:21.229 --> 01:33:21.239 align:start position:0%
and we'll send notes in and I can't tell
 
01:33:23.310 --> 01:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
you how many times sometimes two or
 
01:33:25.629 --> 01:33:25.639 align:start position:0%
three times and I'm not exaggerating
 
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
that we will fax the whole record for
 
01:33:31.109 --> 01:33:31.119 align:start position:0%
this patient to get um the surgery paid
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
for at 50% mind you because it's the
 
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
second procedure so more often than not
 
01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
since they figure you're in there then
 
01:33:39.189 --> 01:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
they're only going to pay you at
 
01:33:42.629 --> 01:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
50% um you don't get somebody that is
 
01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
English as their primary language and
 
01:33:46.990 --> 01:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
those are the people that most likely
 
01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:49.400 align:start position:0%
are reviewing our medical records and
 
01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's disappointing to say the least um
 
01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
the other thing is a long time ago there
 
01:33:58.229 --> 01:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
was um and I would challenge the
 
01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
insurance companies for their um you
 
01:34:05.790 --> 01:34:05.800 align:start position:0%
know what are they using as data because
 
01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
a long time ago they had data that said
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
if a provider's office continually did a
 
01:34:15.070 --> 01:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
pre-authorization and got approved and I
 
01:34:17.229 --> 01:34:17.239 align:start position:0%
would tell you less than 1% of our
 
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
pre-authorizations are denied in general
 
01:34:24.270 --> 01:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
surgery so in my practice in any event
 
01:34:26.430 --> 01:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
um which tells me that my doctors are
 
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
doing nothing but medical necessity um
 
01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
surgeries and medical necessity
 
01:34:35.310 --> 01:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
procedures uh but anyway there was a
 
01:34:37.070 --> 01:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
carrier I think it might have even been
 
01:34:40.990 --> 01:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
siga that would give um a practice or a
 
01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
provider um almost like a gold card so
 
01:34:45.709 --> 01:34:45.719 align:start position:0%
they didn't have to go through the pre
 
01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
offs again and again and again when in
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
fact they had a proven track record of
 
01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
getting all their pre Ops approved at
 
01:34:55.229 --> 01:34:55.239 align:start position:0%
100% because everything that they did
 
01:34:57.629 --> 01:34:57.639 align:start position:0%
was necessary and then they followed
 
01:35:00.669 --> 01:35:00.679 align:start position:0%
through maybe with the operative note to
 
01:35:02.590 --> 01:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
you know with the icd10 codes and the
 
01:35:05.070 --> 01:35:05.080 align:start position:0%
procedure codes
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know why that was thrown
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
out and I don't even remember but it was
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
a long time ago but it was something
 
01:35:15.229 --> 01:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
worthwhile and I would tell you just
 
01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
recently we had somebody with a Medicaid
 
01:35:22.709 --> 01:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
and her prior o was uh approved but for
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
some reason maybe the the gal couldn't
 
01:35:27.790 --> 01:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
get to uh it was an MRI for her breast
 
01:35:29.950 --> 01:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
and she had breast cancer but she
 
01:35:31.990 --> 01:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't get to her appointment and
 
01:35:33.870 --> 01:35:33.880 align:start position:0%
possibly the hospital was delayed
 
01:35:35.709 --> 01:35:35.719 align:start position:0%
because of covid and recently they were
 
01:35:38.830 --> 01:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
packed and so that was a condition too
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
um and of course we're getting patients
 
01:35:42.669 --> 01:35:42.679 align:start position:0%
that cancel because they're afraid to go
 
01:35:46.350 --> 01:35:46.360 align:start position:0%
to the hospital but anyway her prior oth
 
01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
was um expired by one
 
01:35:54.030 --> 01:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
day my staff member had to start from
 
01:35:58.030 --> 01:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
scratch to get her prior auth approved
 
01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
again is that a good utilization of e
 
01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
expertise or time it's not that's insane
 
01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
but you know the companies say well I'm
 
01:36:10.990 --> 01:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
sorry we can't transfer all that
 
01:36:12.510 --> 01:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
information you have to start from
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
scratch I I I have no
 
01:36:19.149 --> 01:36:19.159 align:start position:0%
idea with anybody with a an ounce of
 
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
intelligence would put that procedure in
 
01:36:22.990 --> 01:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
place it makes no
 
01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
sense um and that's and that's basically
 
01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
it um I think to um Extended to six
 
01:36:34.030 --> 01:36:34.040 align:start position:0%
months at the very least is um
 
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
especially in this climate is should go
 
01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
without saying um
 
01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
and don't believe everything you hear
 
01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
from the um from the big insurance
 
01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
companies than very much okay do we have
 
01:36:52.669 --> 01:36:52.679 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee members
 
01:36:54.430 --> 01:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
uh see them we are we are running a
 
01:36:57.189 --> 01:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
little bit behind here uh so next I'll
 
01:37:00.590 --> 01:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
call on Nick carer
 
01:37:04.350 --> 01:37:04.360 align:start position:0%

appreciate having three minutes to talk
 
01:38:56.910 --> 01:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
about an issue that I've watched
 
01:39:01.669 --> 01:39:01.679 align:start position:0%
just just unfold over my 30 years um as
 
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:04.880 align:start position:0%

offices um I right now I'm managing the

Bedford and Dr Nancy Bona
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
and the other practice manager Miss Wood
 
01:39:22.629 --> 01:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
I cannot tell you I cannot addess enough
 
01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
of what they speak of and how um
 
01:39:29.229 --> 01:39:29.239 align:start position:0%
unbelievable this prior authorization
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
process is every single thing that they
 
01:39:35.189 --> 01:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
said I kept writing notes and I'm like
 
01:39:37.589 --> 01:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
yes everybody that we talked to I'm on
 
01:39:40.270 --> 01:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
the phone I talk to these people they
 
01:39:42.270 --> 01:39:42.280 align:start position:0%
don't know what they're authorizing they
 
01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
don't even know what they're talking
 
01:39:48.430 --> 01:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
about um the inefficiencies in the
 
01:39:50.470 --> 01:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
utilization management programs that
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
they speak of um is
 
01:39:59.350 --> 01:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
unfathomable the um urgent uh emergent
 
01:40:01.950 --> 01:40:01.960 align:start position:0%
Rush of a PA that's necessary the
 
01:40:07.229 --> 01:40:07.239 align:start position:0%
soonest you can get it is 72 hours it's
 
01:40:09.790 --> 01:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
unbelievable what has happened and how
 
01:40:11.070 --> 01:40:11.080 align:start position:0%
things have
 
01:40:13.709 --> 01:40:13.719 align:start position:0%
deteriorated um and especially when I
 
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
work in uh retina specialty now where
 
01:40:21.149 --> 01:40:21.159 align:start position:0%
we're talking about sight people's
 
01:40:23.149 --> 01:40:23.159 align:start position:0%
eyesight not that I'm putting anything
 
01:40:27.470 --> 01:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
the cancer the breast cancers um but the
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
people's Vision if you're sight if your
 
01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:32.350 align:start position:0%
people's Vision if you're sight if your
sight

01:40:32.350 --> 01:40:32.360 align:start position:0%
sight
 
01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:34.350 align:start position:0%
sight
was

01:40:34.350 --> 01:40:34.360 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:40:37.709 --> 01:40:37.719 align:start position:0%
threatened or that of a loved one and
 
01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
you couldn't get the treatment that you
 
01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
needed because of a prior authorization
 
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
treatment it's just it's criminal it's
 
01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:48.589 align:start position:0%
treatment it's just it's criminal it's
absolutely

01:40:48.589 --> 01:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
criminal um so I I know we don't have a
 
01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
lot of time I just wanted to reiterate
 
01:40:58.109 --> 01:40:58.119 align:start position:0%
that I experience daily what these
 
01:41:03.390 --> 01:41:03.400 align:start position:0%
people uh are speaking to and um I say

and the knowledge they are the ones that
 
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
need to determine the care the level of
 
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:25.669 --> 01:41:25.679 align:start position:0%

um good morning Mr chair members of the
 
01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Mora Weston and I'm
 
01:42:56.589 --> 01:42:56.599 align:start position:0%
here today to testify on behalf of dairy
 
01:42:59.430 --> 01:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
medical uh Tom Buchanan the CEO of dairy
 
01:43:01.709 --> 01:43:01.719 align:start position:0%
medical had hoped to testify today
 
01:43:04.510 --> 01:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
however he's currently um testifying in
 
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
another committee so get the B team and
 
01:43:09.990 --> 01:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
I'll do my best uh I'm here this morning
 
01:43:13.109 --> 01:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
to express support for House Bill 191
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
but we would like to encourage the
 
01:43:16.709 --> 01:43:16.719 align:start position:0%
committee to consider an amendment to
 
01:43:18.990 --> 01:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
actually expand its
 
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
application Dair Medical Center is an
 
01:43:25.350 --> 01:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
independent 60 provider primary care
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
Physician Group in Southern New
 
01:43:31.629 --> 01:43:31.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we see about 45,000 patients
 
01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
and on average we see about a thousand
 
01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
people a day we believe that prior
 
01:43:38.950 --> 01:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
authorizations have turned into
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
burdensome a burdensome function that
 
01:43:45.149 --> 01:43:45.159 align:start position:0%
drives up costs reduces consumer choice
 
01:43:47.149 --> 01:43:47.159 align:start position:0%
and operates outside the general view of
 
01:43:47.159 --> 01:43:48.390 align:start position:0%
and operates outside the general view of
insurance

01:43:48.390 --> 01:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
01:43:50.350 --> 01:43:50.360 align:start position:0%
regulations while this bill is a good
 
01:43:53.310 --> 01:43:53.320 align:start position:0%
start we don't think it goes far
 
01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
enough possible changes that would
 
01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
strengthen consumer protections and
 
01:43:58.709 --> 01:43:58.719 align:start position:0%
reduce administrative burdens would
 
01:44:01.229 --> 01:44:01.239 align:start position:0%
include uh a couple of different um
 
01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
ideas that we
 
01:44:06.310 --> 01:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
have first all clinical prior off
 
01:44:08.189 --> 01:44:08.199 align:start position:0%
guidelines used to make clinical
 
01:44:10.589 --> 01:44:10.599 align:start position:0%
determinations to cover Services need to
 
01:44:13.950 --> 01:44:13.960 align:start position:0%
be available to the contracted provider
 
01:44:16.189 --> 01:44:16.199 align:start position:0%
all too often lower level employees in
 
01:44:18.270 --> 01:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
health plans render decisions that are
 
01:44:20.189 --> 01:44:20.199 align:start position:0%
not consistent with appropriate medical
 
01:44:20.199 --> 01:44:22.189 align:start position:0%
not consistent with appropriate medical
guidelines

01:44:22.189 --> 01:44:22.199 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
01:44:24.750 --> 01:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
this forces peer-to-peer to-peer
 
01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
discussions which are timec consuming
 
01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:28.070 align:start position:0%
discussions which are timec consuming
for

01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:44:30.149 --> 01:44:30.159 align:start position:0%
Physicians and not the highest and best
 
01:44:31.629 --> 01:44:31.639 align:start position:0%
use of the provider's
 
01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
time outside of that physician time
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
Dairy medical employs five people solely
 
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of handling prior
 
01:44:43.790 --> 01:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
authorizations we need those prior
 
01:44:45.510 --> 01:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
guidelines and they need to be
 
01:44:48.550 --> 01:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
accessible and they are
 
01:44:51.629 --> 01:44:51.639 align:start position:0%
not for an entity like very
 
01:44:54.189 --> 01:44:54.199 align:start position:0%
medical prior authorization the prior
 
01:44:56.709 --> 01:44:56.719 align:start position:0%
authorization process is real money it's
 
01:44:59.629 --> 01:44:59.639 align:start position:0%
a real expense we pride ourselves on
 
01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
being a lowcost highquality provider
 
01:45:05.709 --> 01:45:05.719 align:start position:0%
generally our cost of patient care is on
 
01:45:05.719 --> 01:45:07.030 align:start position:0%
generally our cost of patient care is on
average

01:45:07.030 --> 01:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
average
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
15% below other providers in the state
 
01:45:12.629 --> 01:45:12.639 align:start position:0%
in an outpatient Primary Care setting
 
01:45:15.310 --> 01:45:15.320 align:start position:0%
like Dairy medical our patients seek the
 
01:45:18.030 --> 01:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
best medical treatment options and we
 
01:45:21.430 --> 01:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
seek prior authorizations for their care
 
01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh with any number of different
 
01:45:24.910 --> 01:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
providers and
 
01:45:27.390 --> 01:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
Facilities prior authorizations should
 
01:45:30.030 --> 01:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
not be a tool to reduce competition and
 
01:45:32.189 --> 01:45:32.199 align:start position:0%
keep a patient beholden to a certain
 
01:45:33.910 --> 01:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
Health Care
 
01:45:37.229 --> 01:45:37.239 align:start position:0%
System prior offs for Diagnostic testing
 
01:45:40.270 --> 01:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
should be provider agnostic this means
 
01:45:42.270 --> 01:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
an approved diagnostic study should
 
01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
allow the patient to go to any
 
01:45:46.589 --> 01:45:46.599 align:start position:0%
contracted provider for that service
 
01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:49.320 align:start position:0%
currently the prior off process requires
 
01:45:51.310 --> 01:45:51.320 align:start position:0%
the name of the facility to be included
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
in the prior auth approval patients have
 
01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
little choice of where to go and if they
 
01:46:00.750 --> 01:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
want that changed it's cumbersome and
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
many originating providers are unwilling
 
01:46:06.750 --> 01:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
to change it in the age of six to
 
01:46:09.550 --> 01:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
$122,000 deductibles patients should
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
have the right to go where they want
 
01:46:13.750 --> 01:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
within a plan
 
01:46:16.149 --> 01:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
Network especially given the range of
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
pricing that exists in New Hampshire
 
01:46:21.149 --> 01:46:21.159 align:start position:0%
that the patient is liable for
 
01:46:23.390 --> 01:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
therefore we encourage the committee to
 
01:46:25.149 --> 01:46:25.159 align:start position:0%
expand the conversation around Prior
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
authorizations we would be happy to work
 
01:46:29.189 --> 01:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
with the sponsors in the committee on
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
prior authorization reform and
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
specifically on language relative to
 
01:46:35.910 --> 01:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
prior authorization portability we
 
01:46:37.950 --> 01:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
believe that this step would increase
 
01:46:39.910 --> 01:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
transparency and allow for greater

consumer choice in their health care
 
01:46:45.589 --> 01:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
decision making and reduce the total
 
01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
overall costs of healthc care services

Hampshire thank you for the giving me
 
01:49:16.510 --> 01:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
the time to speak to you this morning on
 
01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:17.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:49:19.870 --> 01:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
191 I have a lot of concerns with the
 
01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
bill and how it will impact how we
 
01:49:24.430 --> 01:49:24.440 align:start position:0%
manage the care of our Members First the
 
01:49:26.550 --> 01:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
bill requires all prior RS to be valid
 
01:49:29.310 --> 01:49:29.320 align:start position:0%
for six months six months is not
 
01:49:30.830 --> 01:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate for all services or
 
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
treatments in fact sometimes it's not
 
01:49:35.589 --> 01:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
even long enough um and we will you know
 
01:49:38.589 --> 01:49:38.599 align:start position:0%
routinely give oneyear uh approvals for
 
01:49:40.109 --> 01:49:40.119 align:start position:0%
many of the drugs where the condition
 
01:49:42.629 --> 01:49:42.639 align:start position:0%
isn't expected to change it's going to
 
01:49:45.510 --> 01:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
continue um all of our prior are service
 
01:49:47.430 --> 01:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
or treatment specific they're they
 
01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
address what is a typical length of time
 
01:49:50.910 --> 01:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
that some somebody might need to be in
 
01:49:52.669 --> 01:49:52.679 align:start position:0%
an acute rehab or
 
01:49:56.350 --> 01:49:56.360 align:start position:0%
hospital um and again just to reassure
 
01:49:59.270 --> 01:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
everybody it's not uh gcha medicine it's
 
01:50:02.589 --> 01:50:02.599 align:start position:0%
not arbitrary um we really do base them
 
01:50:04.270 --> 01:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
on input from published evidence-based
 
01:50:06.830 --> 01:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
medicine and clinical experts uh when we
 
01:50:09.070 --> 01:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
have prior Ross you'll see a site at the
 
01:50:11.709 --> 01:50:11.719 align:start position:0%
bottom all the list of the different uh
 
01:50:13.270 --> 01:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
articles that we reviewed so that if
 
01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
somebody has a concern about that we can
 
01:50:18.750 --> 01:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
address it um we also try to make prior
 
01:50:21.790 --> 01:50:21.800 align:start position:0%
Ro easy uh we offer electronic prior oth
 
01:50:24.229 --> 01:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
process and if something gets moved out
 
01:50:25.750 --> 01:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
I heard that commented on if something
 
01:50:28.470 --> 01:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
does get pushed out because of covid or
 
01:50:30.990 --> 01:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
prior to co there were reasons why um
 
01:50:32.990 --> 01:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
things had to be moved out and all the
 
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
provider needs to do is change the date
 
01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
in the electronic prior off that doesn't
 
01:50:39.430 --> 01:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
need to be PRI uh reauthorized um again
 
01:50:41.790 --> 01:50:41.800 align:start position:0%
to try to make it easier for the
 
01:50:44.069 --> 01:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
providers um as far as the last section
 
01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
of the bill on patient transfers uh we
 
01:50:48.149 --> 01:50:48.159 align:start position:0%
consider any request to transfer a
 
01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
patient to a low level of care as an
 
01:50:53.510 --> 01:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
urgent pre-service request all of the
 
01:50:55.470 --> 01:50:55.480 align:start position:0%
requests are reviewed within 24 to 48
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
hours per ncqa um ncq as a National
 
01:51:01.350 --> 01:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
Committee for quality assurance um it's
 
01:51:03.910 --> 01:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
a nonprofit that uses evidence-based
 
01:51:05.550 --> 01:51:05.560 align:start position:0%
medicine that we all have to adhere to
 
01:51:06.430 --> 01:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:07.990 align:start position:0%
to be
credential

01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
credential
 
01:51:11.189 --> 01:51:11.199 align:start position:0%
um one the the only priori that we have
 
01:51:13.229 --> 01:51:13.239 align:start position:0%
is on authorization to transport
 
01:51:15.950 --> 01:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
somebody um to a lower level of care
 
01:51:18.189 --> 01:51:18.199 align:start position:0%
again I think Paula and others had
 
01:51:20.510 --> 01:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned that transfers from hospital
 
01:51:22.669 --> 01:51:22.679 align:start position:0%
to acute Hospital you know from frisbee
 
01:51:25.470 --> 01:51:25.480 align:start position:0%
where I work to Portsmouth or or Mass
 
01:51:27.629 --> 01:51:27.639 align:start position:0%
General we don't require any prior Roth
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
for that but any that is an elective
 
01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:31.390 align:start position:0%
for that but any that is an elective
non-emergency

01:51:31.390 --> 01:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
non-emergency
 
01:51:33.589 --> 01:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
transfer um if somebody's using an
 
01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
ambulance we we'd ask for Med medical
 
01:51:37.390 --> 01:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
justification for why they need an
 
01:51:39.550 --> 01:51:39.560 align:start position:0%
ambulance rather than a wheelchair van
 
01:51:41.310 --> 01:51:41.320 align:start position:0%
and we'll approve it if in fact that
 
01:51:43.229 --> 01:51:43.239 align:start position:0%
they they can't be in a wheelchair or
 
01:51:45.310 --> 01:51:45.320 align:start position:0%
they can't be transported safely that
 
01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
way and and again frankly I mean you can
 
01:51:50.430 --> 01:51:50.440 align:start position:0%
all imagine um we don't want members to
 
01:51:52.149 --> 01:51:52.159 align:start position:0%
be in acute care any longer than
 
01:51:54.350 --> 01:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
necessary you know having a Bed full
 
01:51:56.109 --> 01:51:56.119 align:start position:0%
I've been on diversion at hospitals I've
 
01:51:58.589 --> 01:51:58.599 align:start position:0%
had to move people around um we want
 
01:51:59.709 --> 01:51:59.719 align:start position:0%
people to be able to get into the
 
01:52:01.589 --> 01:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
hospital when they need to get into we
 
01:52:03.709 --> 01:52:03.719 align:start position:0%
need them to get to a lower uh level of
 
01:52:05.310 --> 01:52:05.320 align:start position:0%
care when they uh when that's
 
01:52:09.149 --> 01:52:09.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate as well um I'm personally
 
01:52:10.830 --> 01:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
and I know we as a company are happy to
 
01:52:13.109 --> 01:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
work continue to work with the hospitals
 
01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
if they have specific concerns about how
 
01:52:18.669 --> 01:52:18.679 align:start position:0%
we do things um but I I haven't had
 
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
specific examples to really be able to
 
01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
address or you know fix a problem if
 
01:52:25.470 --> 01:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
there is one and would like to continue
 
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
to work with them outside of the
 
01:52:29.669 --> 01:52:29.679 align:start position:0%
legislative Arena
 
01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
possible again I I tell my staff it's
 
01:52:34.270 --> 01:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
not our money it's your money if you're
 
01:52:36.069 --> 01:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
a member of ours it's the employer's
 
01:52:38.270 --> 01:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
money um we need to manage that
 
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
responsibly we need to try to keep the
 
01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
cost of care as affordable as possible
 
01:52:45.229 --> 01:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
and Broad limits on what plans can do in
 
01:52:47.669 --> 01:52:47.679 align:start position:0%
the space will only serve to increase
 
01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
costs for members and I for all all of
 
01:52:51.510 --> 01:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
those reasons I urge you to find Senate
 
01:52:55.109 --> 01:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
Bill 191 inexpedient to legislate thank
 
01:52:58.830 --> 01:52:58.840 align:start position:0%
you for your time and happy to take any
 
01:53:01.189 --> 01:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
questions uh well I thought we had a
 
01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
question but representative pusk put his
 
01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
hand down so I guess we're all set uh
 
01:53:08.189 --> 01:53:08.199 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire insurance department and
 
01:53:21.310 --> 01:53:21.320 align:start position:0%
uh we don't have a position on the bill
 
01:53:22.910 --> 01:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
first thing I want to do is clarify I
 
01:53:25.149 --> 01:53:25.159 align:start position:0%
think one of the questions that came up
 
01:53:28.870 --> 01:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
um this would be a insurance change and
 
01:53:31.669 --> 01:53:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh so it would not apply to the Medicare
 
01:53:33.390 --> 01:53:33.400 align:start position:0%
Advantage plans which are regulated by
 
01:53:35.669 --> 01:53:35.679 align:start position:0%
the federal government it would also not
 
01:53:38.069 --> 01:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
apply to the Managed Care organizations
 
01:53:41.550 --> 01:53:41.560 align:start position:0%
that are under contract with DHHS for
 
01:53:44.470 --> 01:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um as usual it would also not
 
01:53:46.669 --> 01:53:46.679 align:start position:0%
apply to self-funded populations that
 
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
are using a carrier like Anthem to
 
01:53:50.830 --> 01:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
administer their benefits this is
 
01:53:51.990 --> 01:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
typically the case when we have
 
01:53:55.390 --> 01:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
Commercial Insurance legislation um one
 
01:53:57.550 --> 01:53:57.560 align:start position:0%
of the first things I I noticed about
 
01:53:59.229 --> 01:53:59.239 align:start position:0%
this legislation it's a little different
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
is it's it's General applies to all
 
01:54:06.030 --> 01:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
services products um it's in the statute
 
01:54:08.109 --> 01:54:08.119 align:start position:0%
and the Managed Care statute that would
 
01:54:10.950 --> 01:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
apply to any network-based products when
 
01:54:12.069 --> 01:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
you look at the other prior
 
01:54:15.189 --> 01:54:15.199 align:start position:0%
authorization restrictions or areas in
 
01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
statute they're all targeting certain
 
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
types of services or providers or circum
 
01:54:22.350 --> 01:54:22.360 align:start position:0%
ances such as obstetrical Care Mental
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
Health Services something like that so
 
01:54:26.030 --> 01:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
it's unusual to see something that would
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
be as as broad as um as this legislation
 
01:54:31.510 --> 01:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
would be um I actually can't think of
 
01:54:33.390 --> 01:54:33.400 align:start position:0%
another prior authorization change that
 
01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
would be as broad the um generally
 
01:54:38.790 --> 01:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
speaking legislation like this would
 
01:54:40.510 --> 01:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
weaken a Care's ability to perform
 
01:54:42.990 --> 01:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
utilization management case management
 
01:54:45.229 --> 01:54:45.239 align:start position:0%
through prior authorization and uh
 
01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
certainly we we hear kind of some the
 
01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
the frustrations in the provider
 
01:54:51.470 --> 01:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
Community um it does prior authorization
 
01:54:53.310 --> 01:54:53.320 align:start position:0%
is a utilization management tool that
 
01:54:55.950 --> 01:54:55.960 align:start position:0%
does control cost to an extent so
 
01:54:58.109 --> 01:54:58.119 align:start position:0%
despite what might be inefficiencies
 
01:55:00.189 --> 01:55:00.199 align:start position:0%
doing away with it or restricting it we
 
01:55:02.310 --> 01:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
should see some inflationary pressure on
 
01:55:05.149 --> 01:55:05.159 align:start position:0%
on Healthcare claims costs and uh and
 
01:55:08.109 --> 01:55:08.119 align:start position:0%
and turn our premiums um it is worth all
 
01:55:09.830 --> 01:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
also recognizing and I think it's been
 
01:55:12.149 --> 01:55:12.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned but maybe not perfectly clear
 
01:55:13.830 --> 01:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes prior authorization is always
 
01:55:15.390 --> 01:55:15.400 align:start position:0%
granted it's just a part of the
 
01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
administrative process of a carrier
 
01:55:19.669 --> 01:55:19.679 align:start position:0%
flagging a particular patient so they
 
01:55:21.189 --> 01:55:21.199 align:start position:0%
can use case managers they can
 
01:55:23.790 --> 01:55:23.800 align:start position:0%
coordinate care they can be involved we
 
01:55:25.030 --> 01:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
have to remember that sometimes when you
 
01:55:26.430 --> 01:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
go to a hospital or you go to another
 
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
health care provider the insurer may not
 
01:55:30.270 --> 01:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
know about it until really until the
 
01:55:31.990 --> 01:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
claim comes in without some sort of
 
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
prior authorization process the other
 
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
reality is that uh Health Care uh
 
01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
findings do change sometimes quickly it
 
01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
could be a service is now deemed high-
 
01:55:43.270 --> 01:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
risk for a particular population or
 
01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
maybe it's even high- risk within a
 
01:55:48.229 --> 01:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
particular provider setting the um the
 
01:55:49.990 --> 01:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
other consideration is an insure tends
 
01:55:51.830 --> 01:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
to be able to see kind of a bird's eye
 
01:55:53.870 --> 01:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
view of a patient's health care
 
01:55:56.510 --> 01:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
experience so something like a a number
 
01:55:58.750 --> 01:55:58.760 align:start position:0%
of CT scans or something that just has a
 
01:56:01.149 --> 01:56:01.159 align:start position:0%
lot of radiation exposure over time
 
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
maybe being done by different providers
 
01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
that's not something an individual
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
provider may be aware of but a carrier
 
01:56:10.109 --> 01:56:10.119 align:start position:0%
could Implement um tracking and
 
01:56:12.030 --> 01:56:12.040 align:start position:0%
identifying those types of
 
01:56:16.750 --> 01:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
services um the uh so that's most of it
 
01:56:19.030 --> 01:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the prior o there is
 
01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
the the segment that does deal with the
 
01:56:24.669 --> 01:56:24.679 align:start position:0%
transfers and um I thought this was also
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
perhaps trying to Target particular
 
01:56:28.709 --> 01:56:28.719 align:start position:0%
circumstances such as people being in
 
01:56:31.750 --> 01:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
the ER or otherwise held up and because
 
01:56:33.669 --> 01:56:33.679 align:start position:0%
intuitively a carrier has a business
 
01:56:35.709 --> 01:56:35.719 align:start position:0%
interest in transferring a patient to a
 
01:56:38.470 --> 01:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
lower cost setting the language though
 
01:56:39.950 --> 01:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
makes me a little bit uncomfortable
 
01:56:42.069 --> 01:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
because it it could be open to
 
01:56:44.149 --> 01:56:44.159 align:start position:0%
interpretation um it does make reference
 
01:56:45.790 --> 01:56:45.800 align:start position:0%
to the carrier not providing
 
01:56:47.629 --> 01:56:47.639 align:start position:0%
accommodations and that's that's a
 
01:56:49.550 --> 01:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
little unclear exactly what that means
 
01:56:51.030 --> 01:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
and then of course paying that the per
 
01:56:54.270 --> 01:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
day rate where that assumes that the
 
01:56:56.430 --> 01:56:56.440 align:start position:0%
patient there is is is receiving
 
01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
services that are paid on a per day so
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
it sounded initially it looked like it
 
01:57:03.069 --> 01:57:03.079 align:start position:0%
was intended to Target very specific
 
01:57:05.189 --> 01:57:05.199 align:start position:0%
circumstances but I couldn't actually
 
01:57:07.270 --> 01:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
understand what providing accommodations
 
01:57:09.390 --> 01:57:09.400 align:start position:0%
could mean in every context so as a
 
01:57:12.229 --> 01:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
regulator that would be um enforcing the
 
01:57:14.350 --> 01:57:14.360 align:start position:0%
the the requirement that's a little less
 
01:57:18.430 --> 01:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
clear than what we' ideally like um so
 
01:57:20.189 --> 01:57:20.199 align:start position:0%
that's probably everything I I I can
 
01:57:22.149 --> 01:57:22.159 align:start position:0%
cover that would be helpful happy to
 
01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
answer any questions though you might
 
01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
have uh don't any
 
01:57:33.669 --> 01:57:33.679 align:start position:0%
okay a question yes thank you again for
 
01:57:36.310 --> 01:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
your testimony um we've heard two kinds
 
01:57:41.069 --> 01:57:41.079 align:start position:0%
of testimony today uh insurance
 
01:57:44.750 --> 01:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
companies uh Representatives saying that
 
01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:46.109 align:start position:0%
companies uh Representatives saying that
prior

01:57:46.109 --> 01:57:46.119 align:start position:0%
prior
 
01:57:50.149 --> 01:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
authorization reduces costs and improves
 
01:57:54.149 --> 01:57:54.159 align:start position:0%
uh Ser proves care and people
 
01:57:56.830 --> 01:57:56.840 align:start position:0%
representing uh various provider uh
 
01:57:59.109 --> 01:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
Health Care Providers saying just the
 
01:58:03.589 --> 01:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
opposite and it's almost like two uh uh
 
01:58:08.270 --> 01:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
statements of Faith but I wonder if you
 
01:58:10.750 --> 01:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
or any of the other people who have
 
01:58:14.669 --> 01:58:14.679 align:start position:0%
testified could after the after this uh
 
01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:17.800 align:start position:0%
hearing could send us some documentary
 
01:58:20.709 --> 01:58:20.719 align:start position:0%
evidence to support that it either
 
01:58:24.790 --> 01:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
increases costs or decreases costs I
 
01:58:27.149 --> 01:58:27.159 align:start position:0%
just don't know if I want to believe it
 
01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
just because people said it so I this is
 
01:58:33.669 --> 01:58:33.679 align:start position:0%
my question is if anyone can do this
 
01:58:36.550 --> 01:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
would you please get back to us with
 
01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
evidence that in fact it is saving cost
 
01:58:43.069 --> 01:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
it's not saving cost it is improving
 
01:58:45.310 --> 01:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
care it's not improving care from
 
01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
whatever studies thank you very
 
01:58:51.709 --> 01:58:51.719 align:start position:0%
much you want I think along those lines
 
01:58:54.030 --> 01:58:54.040 align:start position:0%
things I I would kind of add is is that
 
01:58:56.310 --> 01:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
this is a competitive area that that one
 
01:58:58.350 --> 01:58:58.360 align:start position:0%
carrier may actually manage their prior
 
01:59:00.109 --> 01:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
authorization better than another
 
01:59:02.149 --> 01:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
carrier which means that uh they're
 
01:59:04.109 --> 01:59:04.119 align:start position:0%
going to reap the benefits of of doing
 
01:59:06.830 --> 01:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
it in a a better more efficient way I
 
01:59:08.109 --> 01:59:08.119 align:start position:0%
think to the extent there's a debate
 
01:59:10.790 --> 01:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
about whether or not it saves in general
 
01:59:12.589 --> 01:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
um I mean clar the carriers would have a
 
01:59:14.350 --> 01:59:14.360 align:start position:0%
business interest in and reducing their
 
01:59:17.030 --> 01:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
their claims costs as much as possible
 
01:59:19.910 --> 01:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
um it not be public information but I
 
01:59:21.990 --> 01:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
think if uh you were to sort of explore
 
01:59:24.149 --> 01:59:24.159 align:start position:0%
some of the discussions between a large
 
01:59:26.750 --> 01:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
provider delivery system and a carrier
 
01:59:28.550 --> 01:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
about assuming risk for health care
 
01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
services than compitation accountable
 
01:59:33.189 --> 01:59:33.199 align:start position:0%
care organizations other sort of global
 
01:59:35.910 --> 01:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
budgets providers are often a little bit
 
01:59:38.030 --> 01:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable assuming responsibility
 
01:59:40.629 --> 01:59:40.639 align:start position:0%
for utilization management and prior
 
01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
authorization if a carrier is p all the
 
01:59:44.750 --> 01:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
risk to the provider then they're less
 
01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
interested so that may be kind of an
 
01:59:48.390 --> 01:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
interesting area to explore to the
 
01:59:50.270 --> 01:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
extent who is actually at risk for these
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
claims expenditures and whether or not
 
01:59:54.109 --> 01:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
prior authorization or other medical
 
01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
management tools are
 
02:00:01.109 --> 02:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
used uh representative aberson has a
 
02:00:04.229 --> 02:00:04.239 align:start position:0%
question the mute button uh thank you Mr
 
02:00:05.990 --> 02:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:00:09.350 --> 02:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
question me lo my hand um is there a way
 
02:00:12.589 --> 02:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
to amend this bill to remove some of the
 
02:00:15.270 --> 02:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
problems and issues that were brought up
 
02:00:17.709 --> 02:00:17.719 align:start position:0%
but still retaining the protection for
 
02:00:19.310 --> 02:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
prior authorization so the
 
02:00:24.390 --> 02:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:26.589 --> 02:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
valid I would say
 
02:00:29.229 --> 02:00:29.239 align:start position:0%
yes um I mean I think that there are
 
02:00:31.950 --> 02:00:31.960 align:start position:0%
ways to modify the bill to perhaps make
 
02:00:33.589 --> 02:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
um perhaps give the
 
02:00:35.870 --> 02:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility uh that is necessary or
 
02:00:37.870 --> 02:00:37.880 align:start position:0%
helpful to a carrier but um but I think
 
02:00:39.189 --> 02:00:39.199 align:start position:0%
at at the end of the day it's going to
 
02:00:41.550 --> 02:00:41.560 align:start position:0%
be a compromise one way or another as I
 
02:00:43.950 --> 02:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
started with uh it may be worth
 
02:00:45.790 --> 02:00:45.800 align:start position:0%
exploring whether or not the the issues
 
02:00:47.910 --> 02:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
are most acute in particular settings or
 
02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
particular providers or whether you know
 
02:00:53.189 --> 02:00:53.199 align:start position:0%
considerations for the what is most
 
02:00:55.990 --> 02:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
efficient that a carrier is doing but um
 
02:00:57.990 --> 02:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh clearly every bill could be made a
 
02:00:59.669 --> 02:00:59.679 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
02:01:03.109 --> 02:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
better well said uh representative Terry
 
02:01:05.790 --> 02:01:05.800 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you Mr chairman uh
 
02:01:09.030 --> 02:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner Brandon we've heard from uh
 
02:01:13.470 --> 02:01:13.480 align:start position:0%
a number of uh individuals uh today who
 
02:01:15.270 --> 02:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
have expressed uh
 
02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
frustration uh in uh dealing with
 
02:01:20.830 --> 02:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
receiving uh prior authorization for
 
02:01:24.550 --> 02:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
medications and services in in your role
 
02:01:26.229 --> 02:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
as commissioner of the the department
 
02:01:30.990 --> 02:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
have you received uh the same sorts of
 
02:01:34.589 --> 02:01:34.599 align:start position:0%
uh complaints uh from uh
 
02:01:37.830 --> 02:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
providers um and to what extent have you
 
02:01:39.030 --> 02:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
received those and how have you
 
02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:40.229 align:start position:0%
received those and how have you
addressed

02:01:40.229 --> 02:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
02:01:43.229 --> 02:01:43.239 align:start position:0%
them so the insurance Department's
 
02:01:46.109 --> 02:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
primary focus is consumer so to the
 
02:01:47.870 --> 02:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
extent complaints come in from a a
 
02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
consumer those are the ones we we
 
02:01:53.430 --> 02:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
prioritize and indeed there um we have
 
02:01:54.910 --> 02:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
received complaints in the past about
 
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
sort of getting access to health care
 
02:01:58.390 --> 02:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
services and potentially a carrier
 
02:02:01.550 --> 02:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
feeling differently about uh a potential
 
02:02:04.990 --> 02:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
treatment um being prescribed for a
 
02:02:06.669 --> 02:02:06.679 align:start position:0%
particular member then that the provider
 
02:02:09.030 --> 02:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
does there are actually several levels
 
02:02:11.229 --> 02:02:11.239 align:start position:0%
of sort of appeals that a consumer can
 
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
go through to deal with um barriers
 
02:02:16.030 --> 02:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
being put up by a carrier and some of
 
02:02:19.030 --> 02:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
those are actually in statut so um we do
 
02:02:21.870 --> 02:02:21.880 align:start position:0%
try to handle these as as we can but um
 
02:02:23.310 --> 02:02:23.320 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day you end up with
 
02:02:25.750 --> 02:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
some disagreement occasionally between a
 
02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
provider and a carrier that being said
 
02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
the the sort of external appeal process
 
02:02:34.109 --> 02:02:34.119 align:start position:0%
actually does allow um a a medical care
 
02:02:36.189 --> 02:02:36.199 align:start position:0%
provider outside of the department and
 
02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
not involved in the dispute to weigh in
 
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
on on medical necessity and uh and the
 
02:02:44.310 --> 02:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
treatment that's being um intended a
 
02:02:46.149 --> 02:02:46.159 align:start position:0%
followup please forther question me
 
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
inquire thank you um with respect to the
 
02:02:51.990 --> 02:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh appeals
 
02:02:53.830 --> 02:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
process um can you would you
 
02:02:56.589 --> 02:02:56.599 align:start position:0%
characterize the approximate uh length
 
02:02:59.470 --> 02:02:59.480 align:start position:0%
of time uh for most of those appeals to
 
02:03:02.430 --> 02:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
be heard and resolved and do you find
 
02:03:05.189 --> 02:03:05.199 align:start position:0%
that the appeals process is adequate to
 
02:03:08.229 --> 02:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
remedy most of the cons uh complaints
 
02:03:08.239 --> 02:03:10.470 align:start position:0%
remedy most of the cons uh complaints
from

02:03:10.470 --> 02:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:03:12.510 --> 02:03:12.520 align:start position:0%
consumers yeah I'm not sure I could
 
02:03:14.790 --> 02:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
weigh in on the average time it takes to
 
02:03:16.750 --> 02:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
resolve a dispute but there is a
 
02:03:19.830 --> 02:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
expedite appeal process which has to be
 
02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
resolved within either 48 or 72 I
 
02:03:24.910 --> 02:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
believe hours but uh but in general I
 
02:03:26.750 --> 02:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
think there is a fair amount of sort of
 
02:03:30.069 --> 02:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
comfort with those protections and um I
 
02:03:31.830 --> 02:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
don't think we've seen legislation to
 
02:03:34.270 --> 02:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
change the appeals process for quite a
 
02:03:36.910 --> 02:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
while so I think that would suggest that
 
02:03:40.589 --> 02:03:40.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:43.229 --> 02:03:43.239 align:start position:0%
intended great thank you very much uh
 
02:03:45.950 --> 02:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
all right now um I think we're done now
 
02:03:48.629 --> 02:03:48.639 align:start position:0%
for uh I don't know I got another hand
 
02:03:53.790 --> 02:03:53.800 align:start position:0%
when up uh yeah uh uh uh Miss Miss Uh
 
02:03:55.950 --> 02:03:55.960 align:start position:0%
Wood we're we're really kind of full up
 
02:03:57.750 --> 02:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
now but you can certainly submit some
 
02:03:59.830 --> 02:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
more testimony if you want like if
 
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
anybody has any more comments they want
 
02:04:03.709 --> 02:04:03.719 align:start position:0%
to make uh please feel free to to send
 
02:04:06.750 --> 02:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
St in and with that I will close the
 
02:04:09.669 --> 02:04:09.679 align:start position:0%
public hearing and because we're we're
 
02:04:12.189 --> 02:04:12.199 align:start position:0%
now really really behind but on a
 
02:04:16.510 --> 02:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
somewhat similar subject so uh we'll go
 
02:04:18.669 --> 02:04:18.679 align:start position:0%
right into it and Patrick Pat I see you

panelists and um it will open up the
 
02:04:26.910 --> 02:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
public hearing on
 
02:04:30.350 --> 02:04:30.360 align:start position:0%

stratum yeah Pat we had the same problem
 
02:04:49.189 --> 02:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
before you're louder you know I've for
 
02:04:51.189 --> 02:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
for for a while it was good now I was
 
02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
just told this morning on ways the means
 
02:04:55.149 --> 02:04:55.159 align:start position:0%
that it was out had to speak up I've
 
02:04:57.030 --> 02:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
tried every setting closer just get
 
02:04:58.910 --> 02:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
closer I'm I'm as Clos as I'm gonna so
 
02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
you're gonna see my you don't see my
 
02:05:02.430 --> 02:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
face you don't see anything so camera
 
02:05:06.870 --> 02:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
okay good that's good so uh go ahead uh
 
02:05:09.069 --> 02:05:09.079 align:start position:0%
again this bill is identical to a bill
 
02:05:12.270 --> 02:05:12.280 align:start position:0%
that I had filed last term uh that time
 
02:05:14.470 --> 02:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
it went to the labor committee where it
 
02:05:17.830 --> 02:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
passed unanimous uh and and on the floor
 
02:05:19.229 --> 02:05:19.239 align:start position:0%
in the consent calendar
 
02:05:22.270 --> 02:05:22.280 align:start position:0%
and again like hundreds of other bills
 
02:05:25.549 --> 02:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
it uh never had a hearing and it and it
 
02:05:28.870 --> 02:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
wound up uh tabled so I refiled this
 
02:05:31.390 --> 02:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
bill uh Mr chair can I ask a question is
 
02:05:32.629 --> 02:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
this an early bill is this going to go
 
02:05:35.109 --> 02:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
to labor or you you f not not an early
 
02:05:36.750 --> 02:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
Bill no okay just want to understand
 
02:05:40.270 --> 02:05:40.280 align:start position:0%
thank you so I was approached by uh
 
02:05:43.109 --> 02:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
several mental health uh practitioners
 
02:05:44.669 --> 02:05:44.679 align:start position:0%
who who want to come out out from
 
02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
underneath non-compete clauses in their
 
02:05:49.310 --> 02:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
employment contracts
 
02:05:51.950 --> 02:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh just for uh Clarity there were five
 
02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
license types that would come under this
 
02:05:59.589 --> 02:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:03.030 --> 02:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
33- that's pastoral uh psychotherapist
 
02:06:05.030 --> 02:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
clinical social workers clinical Mental
 
02:06:08.510 --> 02:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
Health Counselors marriage and family
 
02:06:10.310 --> 02:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
therapists and then there's one that
 
02:06:14.669 --> 02:06:14.679 align:start position:0%
falls under RSA 329 DB
 
02:06:16.390 --> 02:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
psychologists uh members of this
 
02:06:18.109 --> 02:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
committee who have been around for a
 
02:06:21.390 --> 02:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
while uh may remember that we have done
 
02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
similar things for other health
 
02:06:25.750 --> 02:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
professionals in
 
02:06:28.750 --> 02:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
2016 we did a similar thing and created
 
02:06:30.990 --> 02:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
uh we we got Physicians and surgeons out
 
02:06:33.510 --> 02:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
from underneath the noncompete Clauses
 
02:06:37.310 --> 02:06:37.320 align:start position:0%
and that was that is in statute RSA 329
 
02:06:37.320 --> 02:06:39.069 align:start position:0%
and that was that is in statute RSA 329
colon

02:06:39.069 --> 02:06:39.079 align:start position:0%
colon
 
02:06:41.669 --> 02:06:41.679 align:start position:0%
31-a then in
 
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
2018 we did the same for nurses and uh
 
02:06:48.149 --> 02:06:48.159 align:start position:0%
podiatrists uh the nurses are under RSA
 
02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
32 2 6-b col
 
02:06:53.270 --> 02:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
45a and the podiatrists are under RSA
 
02:06:55.950 --> 02:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
315 col
 
02:06:58.669 --> 02:06:58.679 align:start position:0%
18 what I want to point out is that if
 
02:07:01.270 --> 02:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
you go to those statutes you will you
 
02:07:02.830 --> 02:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
will see that the language that I have
 
02:07:05.910 --> 02:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
in this bill is identical to those four
 
02:07:08.870 --> 02:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
professions okay just understand that so
 
02:07:11.310 --> 02:07:11.320 align:start position:0%
I just stole that language and was the
 
02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
language that that is in these statute
 
02:07:15.990 --> 02:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
so that the language has been tested
 
02:07:20.629 --> 02:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:23.390 --> 02:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
this bill's language as it did for
 
02:07:25.750 --> 02:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
Physicians nurses podiatrists Etc only
 
02:07:29.189 --> 02:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
applies to new contracts or renewals of
 
02:07:32.270 --> 02:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
contracts entered into on or after the
 
02:07:34.470 --> 02:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
effective date of the
 
02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
section so you may say well why mental
 
02:07:37.910 --> 02:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
health workers
 
02:07:41.030 --> 02:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
now uh there's a few points we are in
 
02:07:42.549 --> 02:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
the midst of a mental health and
 
02:07:45.350 --> 02:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
addiction epidemic these mental health
 
02:07:48.910 --> 02:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
workers are a Lifeline to their clients
 
02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
they there's a true practitioner client
 
02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
relationship between them if these
 
02:07:56.750 --> 02:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
practitioners want to advance in their
 
02:07:59.750 --> 02:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
careers and move onto another practice
 
02:08:02.910 --> 02:08:02.920 align:start position:0%
in their geographic area uh many current
 
02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
contracts prevent them from doing so the
 
02:08:08.189 --> 02:08:08.199 align:start position:0%
norm that you see is a 30 mile radius
 
02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
you can work outside that 30 mile radius
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
and in many of those cases they would
 
02:08:14.830 --> 02:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
have to sever the relationship with the
 
02:08:16.069 --> 02:08:16.079 align:start position:0%
with their
 
02:08:19.149 --> 02:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
clients so that is
 
02:08:22.549 --> 02:08:22.559 align:start position:0%
uh the the basic Bill uh that basically
 
02:08:25.069 --> 02:08:25.079 align:start position:0%
was the house position last year uh I
 
02:08:27.390 --> 02:08:27.400 align:start position:0%
know we have a new house so there are
 
02:08:28.589 --> 02:08:28.599 align:start position:0%
many I know there's several
 
02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
practitioners who are going to be
 
02:08:32.470 --> 02:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
testifying behind me uh Mr chair will
 
02:08:34.350 --> 02:08:34.360 align:start position:0%
take questions uh but when it comes to
 
02:08:36.709 --> 02:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
more specifics about the situation I'm
 
02:08:38.830 --> 02:08:38.840 align:start position:0%
sure those others would do a good better
 
02:08:41.069 --> 02:08:41.079 align:start position:0%
job than I testifying but I'll take any
 
02:08:43.750 --> 02:08:43.760 align:start position:0%

really negative way that I have turned

licensed clinical psychologist um who
 
02:12:03.950 --> 02:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
moved to New Hampshire from Rhode Island
 
02:12:06.430 --> 02:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
where I had been in a private practice
 
02:12:08.149 --> 02:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
um to New Hampshire to be closer to my
 
02:12:11.830 --> 02:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
husbands and my family um that was now a
 
02:12:14.030 --> 02:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
few years ago um and in order to accept
 
02:12:16.270 --> 02:12:16.280 align:start position:0%
an offer from the single owner Private
 
02:12:18.549 --> 02:12:18.559 align:start position:0%
Practice in Portsmith I was required to
 
02:12:21.149 --> 02:12:21.159 align:start position:0%
sign a contract and non-compete
 
02:12:24.069 --> 02:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
non-solicitation that dictated that
 
02:12:26.270 --> 02:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
currently and for two years after my
 
02:12:28.270 --> 02:12:28.280 align:start position:0%
employment ends I cannot practice
 
02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:31.119 align:start position:0%

center within a 30m radius of the office

um which I negotiated down from 40 miles
 
02:12:42.709 --> 02:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
um the owners and my goal had been to
 
02:12:44.669 --> 02:12:44.679 align:start position:0%
work full-time so scheduling
 
02:12:47.910 --> 02:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
approximately 25 to 35 people per week
 
02:12:49.629 --> 02:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
um um to initially help build my
 
02:12:51.390 --> 02:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
practice I made calls to local
 
02:12:53.870 --> 02:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
professionals to network I wrote pieces
 
02:12:56.069 --> 02:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
for the practice's monthly plog provided
 
02:12:58.069 --> 02:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
free talks at a local community center
 
02:13:00.030 --> 02:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
and spoke to parents at a school you
 
02:13:03.030 --> 02:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
know at schools for presentations um
 
02:13:04.669 --> 02:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
after having been there for almost 10
 
02:13:06.830 --> 02:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
months my schedule was not even close to
 
02:13:10.870 --> 02:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
being full um in my best week I saw 15
 
02:13:12.830 --> 02:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
people which happened twice um and they
 
02:13:16.030 --> 02:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
were in my third month of employment um
 
02:13:18.350 --> 02:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
the the mean was I saw about 10 people
 
02:13:20.470 --> 02:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
per week and I still only worked three
 
02:13:22.069 --> 02:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
days because that's how I started things
 
02:13:26.030 --> 02:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
out um I had been actively involved in
 
02:13:27.549 --> 02:13:27.559 align:start position:0%
doing what she had asked as a way to
 
02:13:29.950 --> 02:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
increase my case load talks written
 
02:13:32.069 --> 02:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
materials for the vog parenting New
 
02:13:34.030 --> 02:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire article made phone calls to
 
02:13:36.189 --> 02:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
other Professionals in the area and
 
02:13:40.310 --> 02:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
similar things um we had two meetings uh
 
02:13:42.310 --> 02:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
where I a couple months apart where I
 
02:13:44.910 --> 02:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
had asked to meet to discuss ways to
 
02:13:48.109 --> 02:13:48.119 align:start position:0%
increase my income um including taking
 
02:13:50.270 --> 02:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
in network clients which she said I was
 
02:13:52.109 --> 02:13:52.119 align:start position:0%
not permitted to do it was a practice
 
02:13:54.549 --> 02:13:54.559 align:start position:0%
where we were only um we didn't accept
 
02:13:57.189 --> 02:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
insurance and she wasn't willing to let
 
02:14:01.629 --> 02:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
that happen um for me in this situation
 
02:14:04.510 --> 02:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
um after about 10 months of working
 
02:14:07.030 --> 02:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
there I was approached um about a
 
02:14:09.350 --> 02:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
part-time opportunity to work at unh's
 
02:14:11.790 --> 02:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
Counseling Center as a way to supplement
 
02:14:14.149 --> 02:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
my income on a temporary basis while I
 
02:14:15.910 --> 02:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't making a sufficient amount of
 
02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
money um the position was offered as a
 
02:14:22.390 --> 02:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
staff psychologist um where I would be
 
02:14:23.910 --> 02:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
available to meet with students on an
 
02:14:25.709 --> 02:14:25.719 align:start position:0%
as-needed basis and I was just going to
 
02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
do it the other two days of the week
 
02:14:29.350 --> 02:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
that I wasn't already previously
 
02:14:32.069 --> 02:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
committed to my current practice um I
 
02:14:34.790 --> 02:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
would have been paid hourly by UNH from
 
02:14:37.589 --> 02:14:37.599 align:start position:0%
fees included in every student's tuition
 
02:14:39.910 --> 02:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
not by individual clients or by
 
02:14:42.510 --> 02:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
Insurance um I told my boss about the
 
02:14:44.470 --> 02:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity how it could fill in my
 
02:14:46.149 --> 02:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
available time while I continued to
 
02:14:48.310 --> 02:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
build my client base her practice and
 
02:14:51.310 --> 02:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
how I could even forward um potential
 
02:14:53.470 --> 02:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
clients to her practice if they wanted
 
02:14:55.470 --> 02:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
private Services as sometimes counseling
 
02:14:59.589 --> 02:14:59.599 align:start position:0%
centers can get overwhelmed um and I
 
02:15:01.270 --> 02:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
explained how it would not negatively
 
02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
impact her business and it seemed to me
 
02:15:05.950 --> 02:15:05.960 align:start position:0%
that it would only be a positive change
 
02:15:08.549 --> 02:15:08.559 align:start position:0%
um my boss believed that it was in
 
02:15:10.310 --> 02:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
conflict with my non-compete because it
 
02:15:12.109 --> 02:15:12.119 align:start position:0%
meant providing Psychotherapy within the
 
02:15:14.229 --> 02:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
30 mile radius and so was not okay with
 
02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
my taking the job um I saw no conflict
 
02:15:20.990 --> 02:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
my compete did not mention University
 
02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
staff positions um also the clients
 
02:15:25.830 --> 02:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
would be completely separate it was
 
02:15:28.510 --> 02:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
drawing from an entirely different pool
 
02:15:31.910 --> 02:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
of individuals um clients at UNH pay
 
02:15:33.910 --> 02:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
nothing to be seen on campus and they
 
02:15:36.189 --> 02:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
would have had to pay $150 a session to
 
02:15:39.549 --> 02:15:39.559 align:start position:0%
be seen by me at the Private Practice um
 
02:15:41.790 --> 02:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
and that fee is included in unh's
 
02:15:45.990 --> 02:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
tuition um later that month she proposed
 
02:15:48.390 --> 02:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
an alternate idea and that was to have
 
02:15:51.950 --> 02:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
my boss contract my services out to UNH
 
02:15:54.430 --> 02:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
so I would remain her employee so that
 
02:15:56.310 --> 02:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
the income from my two days working on
 
02:15:58.629 --> 02:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
campus would come from UNH into her
 
02:16:00.390 --> 02:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
practice meaning my boss would take a
 
02:16:04.350 --> 02:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
cut before I got paid um UNH and I were
 
02:16:08.589 --> 02:16:08.599 align:start position:0%
both very unwilling to do that um and so
 
02:16:10.390 --> 02:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
basically I decided I was ready to leave
 
02:16:12.629 --> 02:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
to look for opportunities um and I hired
 
02:16:16.870 --> 02:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
a lawyer to check to see like how how
 
02:16:19.069 --> 02:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
stuck would I be if I tried to find a
 
02:16:23.030 --> 02:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
job within 30 miles um and but the
 
02:16:25.589 --> 02:16:25.599 align:start position:0%
lawyer that I hired um was not convinced
 
02:16:27.669 --> 02:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
that she would not come after me if I
 
02:16:29.549 --> 02:16:29.559 align:start position:0%
tried to work within the radius and she
 
02:16:31.709 --> 02:16:31.719 align:start position:0%
had you know enough enough grounds to
 
02:16:34.750 --> 02:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
probably be able to do so um given my
 
02:16:37.110 --> 02:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
financial State I chose not to take the
 
02:16:39.790 --> 02:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
risk and instead found something outside
 
02:16:42.030 --> 02:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
so um so I now work in nashille I'm very
 
02:16:44.669 --> 02:16:44.679 align:start position:0%
happy where I am but after finding that
 
02:16:47.070 --> 02:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
new job I was commuting 50 miles each
 
02:16:50.270 --> 02:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
way five days a week for work until I
 
02:16:54.270 --> 02:16:54.280 align:start position:0%
moved my family again so um you know and
 
02:16:56.669 --> 02:16:56.679 align:start position:0%
I like had a two-year-old at home at the
 
02:16:59.589 --> 02:16:59.599 align:start position:0%
time and I was working long days and was
 
02:17:03.750 --> 02:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
driving really far um all because my
 
02:17:07.589 --> 02:17:07.599 align:start position:0%
boss had an issue with my trying I don't
 
02:17:10.389 --> 02:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
know to make enough money and if it
 
02:17:14.910 --> 02:17:14.920 align:start position:0%
meant that she wasn't taking a piece of
 
02:17:20.070 --> 02:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
what I could get um so so um you know
 
02:17:23.349 --> 02:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
and actually in this in this situation
 
02:17:24.870 --> 02:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
um I don't know there's one more little
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
piece to it that like my boss also my
 
02:17:30.549 --> 02:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
old boss also had an issue with how a
 
02:17:33.070 --> 02:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
few of a few clients of mine wanted to
 
02:17:37.150 --> 02:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
follow me um and you know even those
 
02:17:38.790 --> 02:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
that had a long-term relationship with
 
02:17:40.389 --> 02:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
me and I had you know helped
 
02:17:43.589 --> 02:17:43.599 align:start position:0%
sufficiently I'm also um highly trained
 
02:17:46.230 --> 02:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
in treating OCD and anxiety disorders
 
02:17:48.190 --> 02:17:48.200 align:start position:0%
which is a pretty specialized um
 
02:17:50.469 --> 02:17:50.479 align:start position:0%
especially OCD is a pretty specialized
 
02:17:53.629 --> 02:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
um treatment group and so to I was
 
02:17:55.469 --> 02:17:55.479 align:start position:0%
making a name for myself in Portsmith
 
02:17:57.509 --> 02:17:57.519 align:start position:0%
and then to have to say Okay anybody
 
02:17:59.030 --> 02:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
who's looking for me now I'm going to be
 
02:17:59.040 --> 02:17:59.709 align:start position:0%
who's looking for me now I'm going to be
in

02:17:59.709 --> 02:17:59.719 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:18:03.830 --> 02:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
Nashua good luck making that drive um
 
02:18:05.910 --> 02:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
you know so it it it really I think it
 
02:18:07.709 --> 02:18:07.719 align:start position:0%
impacted you know the mental health of
 
02:18:11.349 --> 02:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
some people there um you know as well
 
02:18:13.389 --> 02:18:13.399 align:start position:0%
because I needed to essentially
 
02:18:16.349 --> 02:18:16.359 align:start position:0%
prematurely stop treatment with clients
 
02:18:18.190 --> 02:18:18.200 align:start position:0%
um you know and I I did my best to try
 
02:18:19.990 --> 02:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
to find them other people you know I
 
02:18:21.790 --> 02:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
don't think there were any concerns of
 
02:18:25.230 --> 02:18:25.240 align:start position:0%
Abandonment but you know it meant that
 
02:18:27.830 --> 02:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
she was making things really difficult
 
02:18:30.709 --> 02:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
um and I if I had not had to move and go
 
02:18:32.429 --> 02:18:32.439 align:start position:0%
so far away I could have found a
 
02:18:34.150 --> 02:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
different place to work and continued
 
02:18:37.950 --> 02:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
seeing those patients in that area um so
 
02:18:40.669 --> 02:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
I don't know I mean I think this um you
 
02:18:42.629 --> 02:18:42.639 align:start position:0%
know this bill won't actually even
 
02:18:44.349 --> 02:18:44.359 align:start position:0%
directly affect me I know that it's not
 
02:18:46.190 --> 02:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
going to be for retroactive ones and
 
02:18:48.190 --> 02:18:48.200 align:start position:0%
that's fine I actually only even have
 
02:18:50.469 --> 02:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
four months left on my non-compete
 
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
anyway um but it's still important
 
02:18:55.270 --> 02:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
enough to me that other mental health
 
02:18:57.389 --> 02:18:57.399 align:start position:0%
practitioners don't end up in this same
 
02:18:59.870 --> 02:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
situation both for the practitioners but
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
also for the patients that they treat um
 
02:19:05.110 --> 02:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
you know I mean we develop you know
 
02:19:08.309 --> 02:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes really close um sometimes
 
02:19:10.309 --> 02:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
life-saving relationships with patients
 
02:19:12.150 --> 02:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
and it's really unfortunate that
 
02:19:14.709 --> 02:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
sometimes if somebody's unhappy in their
 
02:19:18.750 --> 02:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
job for what whatever reason um that
 
02:19:20.270 --> 02:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
they need to end and you know they need
 
02:19:23.709 --> 02:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
to sever those relationships um you know
 
02:19:26.389 --> 02:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
is really pretty terrible so um you know
 
02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
I think it's detrimental to patients if
 
02:19:29.910 --> 02:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
their clinician is forced to move if
 
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
she's unhappy in her job um you know
 
02:19:34.629 --> 02:19:34.639 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Services are limited
 
02:19:36.629 --> 02:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
enough in our state and I feel like we
 
02:19:38.270 --> 02:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
should not make it even more challenging
 
02:19:40.190 --> 02:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
for people to get and continue their
 
02:19:43.389 --> 02:19:43.399 align:start position:0%
care um you know unnecessary disruptions
 
02:19:45.070 --> 02:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
in care could have been prevented if I
 
02:19:48.429 --> 02:19:48.439 align:start position:0%
had not been held to my non-compete so
 
02:19:50.590 --> 02:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
um that's basically the end of what I
 
02:19:51.990 --> 02:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
have to say but I'll take any questions
 
02:19:54.670 --> 02:19:54.680 align:start position:0%
if anybody has any for me so uh
 
02:19:56.590 --> 02:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
representative Abramson has a
 
02:19:58.950 --> 02:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you and for your
 
02:20:01.670 --> 02:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you for taking my uh
 
02:20:05.070 --> 02:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
question um I wonder if I know that some
 
02:20:07.830 --> 02:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
businesses uh need to have non-competes
 
02:20:10.389 --> 02:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to invest in a
 
02:20:12.990 --> 02:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
professional in some way or to hire them
 
02:20:15.510 --> 02:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
um I've faced non-competes and I I chose
 
02:20:18.389 --> 02:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
not to sign them uh I wonder if there's
 
02:20:20.309 --> 02:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
some way that we can put like a some
 
02:20:23.750 --> 02:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
type of limitation or a buyout a
 
02:20:26.309 --> 02:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
guaranteed buyout so that if someone's
 
02:20:28.870 --> 02:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
facing an old non-compete that they're
 
02:20:30.910 --> 02:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
they're guaranteed an ability to to just
 
02:20:32.389 --> 02:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
buy out by paying a certain amount of
 
02:20:34.429 --> 02:20:34.439 align:start position:0%
money as though they're kind of paying
 
02:20:36.389 --> 02:20:36.399 align:start position:0%
the other person back because sometimes
 
02:20:38.990 --> 02:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
the the uh the other party holding on to
 
02:20:41.070 --> 02:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
the non-compete will say oh this was
 
02:20:42.950 --> 02:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
much more valuable than anything I
 
02:20:45.510 --> 02:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
suggested when we first signed the
 
02:20:47.750 --> 02:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
contract words if it were I don't know
 
02:20:49.710 --> 02:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
say a few thousand dollars or some some
 
02:20:51.230 --> 02:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
amount that you that you were guaranteed
 
02:20:53.110 --> 02:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
to be able to buy out of a
 
02:20:55.630 --> 02:20:55.640 align:start position:0%
non-compete as a
 
02:20:57.469 --> 02:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
professional I mean that would have made
 
02:21:01.309 --> 02:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
my situation better you know I mean
 
02:21:04.590 --> 02:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
um you know it's still and and I
 
02:21:08.750 --> 02:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
understand I mean I I think this um you
 
02:21:10.990 --> 02:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
know I don't know I mean you know it
 
02:21:12.150 --> 02:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
certainly would have made a difference
 
02:21:13.590 --> 02:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
for me because I probably would not have
 
02:21:15.309 --> 02:21:15.319 align:start position:0%
moved my family again and I probably
 
02:21:16.790 --> 02:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
would have stayed in the area if I could
 
02:21:18.910 --> 02:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
have just you know gotten out of the
 
02:21:23.270 --> 02:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
non- cohete um it's I don't know I guess
 
02:21:25.270 --> 02:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
to me in my situation it was just it it
 
02:21:25.280 --> 02:21:26.110 align:start position:0%
to me in my situation it was just it it
was

02:21:26.110 --> 02:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:21:28.429 --> 02:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
a a lame sounding statement but an
 
02:21:32.309 --> 02:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
unfair advantage that my boss had um you
 
02:21:34.469 --> 02:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
know and I I even had looked you know I
 
02:21:35.590 --> 02:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
felt like I had looked into the
 
02:21:38.070 --> 02:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
non-compete prior to signing it you know
 
02:21:40.349 --> 02:21:40.359 align:start position:0%
wondering is this going to be able to be
 
02:21:43.070 --> 02:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
held up and upon originally checking it
 
02:21:44.910 --> 02:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
out I was like I don't know like I'm not
 
02:21:46.630 --> 02:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
sure that she can keep me from doing my
 
02:21:50.389 --> 02:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
job but apparently she can keep me from
 
02:21:52.870 --> 02:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
doing my job um at least within a 30
 
02:21:55.349 --> 02:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
mile radius
 
02:22:02.389 --> 02:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:05.150 --> 02:22:05.160 align:start position:0%

02:22:47.469 --> 02:22:47.479 align:start position:0%
for being here um my name is Daisy C I'm
 
02:22:49.790 --> 02:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
a licensed um independent clinical
 
02:22:51.670 --> 02:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
social worker so I'm a therapist at a
 
02:22:55.790 --> 02:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
group practice in Dover um about two
 
02:22:58.389 --> 02:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
years ago I started working there and as
 
02:23:00.270 --> 02:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
part of my employment agreement was
 
02:23:05.150 --> 02:23:05.160 align:start position:0%
asked to sign a non-compete Clause um my
 
02:23:07.030 --> 02:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
first thought upon reading it was how it
 
02:23:10.950 --> 02:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
would potentially impact me personally I
 
02:23:12.910 --> 02:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
would not be able to work at all for
 
02:23:14.990 --> 02:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
between 6 months and two years depending
 
02:23:17.510 --> 02:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
on how long I had been at the practice
 
02:23:21.190 --> 02:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
within a 25 mile radius of Dover that
 
02:23:24.190 --> 02:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
would mean that if I left my clients
 
02:23:27.030 --> 02:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
would no longer be able to see me and I
 
02:23:29.110 --> 02:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
could not work in places like Portsmith
 
02:23:32.190 --> 02:23:32.200 align:start position:0%
do Rochester exitor New Market Durham or
 
02:23:34.910 --> 02:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
Hampton which are some of the larger
 
02:23:36.870 --> 02:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
cities or towns in the state and all
 
02:23:40.190 --> 02:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
within reasonable driving distance of my
 
02:23:42.630 --> 02:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
home in the process of thinking about
 
02:23:44.309 --> 02:23:44.319 align:start position:0%
this bill and preparing to get support
 
02:23:46.110 --> 02:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
for it I talked with therapists who had
 
02:23:48.630 --> 02:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
signed non-compete and had to get
 
02:23:51.510 --> 02:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
relicensed in another state or commute
 
02:23:53.630 --> 02:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
up to an hour in order to avoid being
 
02:23:55.309 --> 02:23:55.319 align:start position:0%
sued by their employers when they
 
02:23:58.110 --> 02:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
decided to leave it is possible that
 
02:23:59.750 --> 02:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
they could have prevailed in court if
 
02:24:01.349 --> 02:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
they had been sued proving that it
 
02:24:03.389 --> 02:24:03.399 align:start position:0%
placed undue hardship on their ability
 
02:24:06.309 --> 02:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
to find employment however some may not
 
02:24:08.389 --> 02:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
have been able to afford a lawyer or
 
02:24:09.990 --> 02:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
were convinced that they would not win
 
02:24:12.670 --> 02:24:12.680 align:start position:0%
so they decided to let it go or they
 
02:24:15.030 --> 02:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
were intimidated by the prospect
 
02:24:17.230 --> 02:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
prospect of being sued and as a result
 
02:24:19.469 --> 02:24:19.479 align:start position:0%
felt unable to leave their current POS
 
02:24:22.830 --> 02:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
positions despite a desire to do so some
 
02:24:25.150 --> 02:24:25.160 align:start position:0%
of those people wanted to be here today
 
02:24:27.030 --> 02:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
but could not because they were also
 
02:24:29.150 --> 02:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
asked to sign non-disclosure statements
 
02:24:31.389 --> 02:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
when they did leave or as part of a
 
02:24:33.389 --> 02:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
settlement after contesting a
 
02:24:35.510 --> 02:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
non-compete some of them who are
 
02:24:37.309 --> 02:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
considering leaving the their current
 
02:24:38.990 --> 02:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
practices are afraid their public
 
02:24:40.790 --> 02:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
testimony would make their situations
 
02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:41.950 align:start position:0%
testimony would make their situations
more

02:24:41.950 --> 02:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:24:44.349 --> 02:24:44.359 align:start position:0%
precarious there is a larger more
 
02:24:46.750 --> 02:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
important issue however beyond the unto
 
02:24:49.309 --> 02:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
hard undo hardship C for therapists
 
02:24:51.269 --> 02:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
should they decide to change employers
 
02:24:53.190 --> 02:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
or relocate their
 
02:24:56.510 --> 02:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
practices it is an ethical issue one
 
02:24:58.190 --> 02:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
which concerns our professional
 
02:25:00.990 --> 02:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities toward the people we
 
02:25:04.190 --> 02:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
serve I will I will speak to the nasw
 
02:25:06.070 --> 02:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
code of ethics here since I am so a
 
02:25:07.750 --> 02:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
social worker but all the other
 
02:25:09.750 --> 02:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
professional groups including the
 
02:25:12.349 --> 02:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
American Psychiatric and American
 
02:25:14.510 --> 02:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
Psychological Association and the
 
02:25:16.349 --> 02:25:16.359 align:start position:0%
American Counseling Association have
 
02:25:18.309 --> 02:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
their own version of this
 
02:25:21.070 --> 02:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
standard our number one ethical
 
02:25:22.990 --> 02:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to the well-being of
 
02:25:25.870 --> 02:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
our clients of course we also have
 
02:25:28.349 --> 02:25:28.359 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to the in institutions
 
02:25:29.389 --> 02:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
where we
 
02:25:31.910 --> 02:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
work after all without the mental health
 
02:25:33.670 --> 02:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
centers and practices that serve our
 
02:25:35.389 --> 02:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
communities many of those clients would
 
02:25:38.469 --> 02:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
not have access to treatment at
 
02:25:41.469 --> 02:25:41.479 align:start position:0%
all however the ethical code demands
 
02:25:42.950 --> 02:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
that a therapist's primary
 
02:25:45.030 --> 02:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility be to the people who have
 
02:25:48.269 --> 02:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
entrusted their most private lives to us
 
02:25:50.110 --> 02:25:50.120 align:start position:0%
patients who have invested hours and
 
02:25:52.670 --> 02:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
hours possibly years building a
 
02:25:54.269 --> 02:25:54.279 align:start position:0%
relationship with their therapist so
 
02:25:56.070 --> 02:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
that we can support them in making
 
02:25:58.349 --> 02:25:58.359 align:start position:0%
positive change developing healthy
 
02:26:00.510 --> 02:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
relationships healing from trauma and in
 
02:26:02.349 --> 02:26:02.359 align:start position:0%
some cases staying
 
02:26:04.830 --> 02:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
alive though there are many reasons why
 
02:26:06.750 --> 02:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
patient and therapist may need to end
 
02:26:09.190 --> 02:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
treatment to sever that relationship
 
02:26:12.510 --> 02:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily is irresponsible and
 
02:26:14.950 --> 02:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
unethical it is not a trivial thing to
 
02:26:16.550 --> 02:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
make the decision to seek help from a
 
02:26:19.349 --> 02:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
mental health professional for some it
 
02:26:22.750 --> 02:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
may be a relationship of Last Resort in
 
02:26:24.950 --> 02:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
the best case scenario a client has the
 
02:26:27.110 --> 02:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
motivation and fortitude and is lucky
 
02:26:28.950 --> 02:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
enough to find another therapist who is
 
02:26:31.750 --> 02:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
a good match for them quickly and to
 
02:26:33.990 --> 02:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
begin building trust in a new
 
02:26:36.429 --> 02:26:36.439 align:start position:0%
relationship the worst case scenario is
 
02:26:38.070 --> 02:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
that a suicidal client has an
 
02:26:40.469 --> 02:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
interruption in care that proves
 
02:26:43.269 --> 02:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
fatal I'm sure most of us here are aware
 
02:26:45.150 --> 02:26:45.160 align:start position:0%
of the troubling state of mental health
 
02:26:47.269 --> 02:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
care in New Hampshire the the vast
 
02:26:49.269 --> 02:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
majority of mental illness in our state
 
02:26:50.910 --> 02:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
and in the rest of the country still
 
02:26:53.910 --> 02:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
goes untreated and not unlike in the
 
02:26:55.990 --> 02:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
adjacent medical professions the longer
 
02:26:57.710 --> 02:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
illnesses go unaddressed the more
 
02:26:59.429 --> 02:26:59.439 align:start position:0%
expensive the treatment is likely to
 
02:27:01.750 --> 02:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
become and the more damage may be done
 
02:27:03.550 --> 02:27:03.560 align:start position:0%
to lives families and
 
02:27:05.590 --> 02:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
communities yet weight list to get
 
02:27:07.190 --> 02:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
treatment at Community Mental Health
 
02:27:09.150 --> 02:27:09.160 align:start position:0%
Centers and private practices can be
 
02:27:12.150 --> 02:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
months long this has only increased over
 
02:27:14.710 --> 02:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
the last year and if predictions about
 
02:27:16.910 --> 02:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
an impending Mental Health crisis come
 
02:27:18.710 --> 02:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
true although some would argue there's
 
02:27:20.550 --> 02:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
already one and there has been for a
 
02:27:23.429 --> 02:27:23.439 align:start position:0%
long time finding timely care will be
 
02:27:26.710 --> 02:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
even harder as of now I personally am
 
02:27:28.710 --> 02:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
booked solid for the next two months and
 
02:27:31.510 --> 02:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
have a weight list stretching into May
 
02:27:33.030 --> 02:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
current clients are needing more
 
02:27:34.870 --> 02:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
frequent appointments clients who had
 
02:27:36.630 --> 02:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
switched to monthly monthly check-ins
 
02:27:38.670 --> 02:27:38.680 align:start position:0%
are asking to be seen more frequently
 
02:27:41.190 --> 02:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
again and therapists are having to turn
 
02:27:43.030 --> 02:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
people away because they just don't have
 
02:27:44.590 --> 02:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
room for anybody
 
02:27:48.030 --> 02:27:48.040 align:start position:0%
new so in reality there is no danger of
 
02:27:49.670 --> 02:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Mental Health Centers and
 
02:27:52.590 --> 02:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
group practices running out of business
 
02:27:54.750 --> 02:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
there is however danger for those we
 
02:27:56.790 --> 02:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
serve especially for people dealing with
 
02:27:59.150 --> 02:27:59.160 align:start position:0%
severe mental illness we should not
 
02:28:00.950 --> 02:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
limit the ability of therapists to
 
02:28:03.510 --> 02:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
continue to see their existing clients
 
02:28:05.630 --> 02:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
or their availability for those who are
 
02:28:07.790 --> 02:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
still waiting to get
 
02:28:11.309 --> 02:28:11.319 align:start position:0%
care that's all thank you great thank
 
02:28:14.269 --> 02:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
you um sorry to do this to you but I I I
 
02:28:16.309 --> 02:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
was little shocked when I realized what
 
02:28:18.710 --> 02:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
this bill was really about and um the
 
02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
only time I've actually really heard
 
02:28:22.950 --> 02:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
about because I know we passed the
 
02:28:26.550 --> 02:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
non-compete um over the years was the
 
02:28:28.510 --> 02:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
the classic example the example that I
 
02:28:31.710 --> 02:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
was whole years ago was that a lawyer
 
02:28:34.910 --> 02:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
goes to work for a law office and they
 
02:28:36.469 --> 02:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
spend you know they're promoting the
 
02:28:38.349 --> 02:28:38.359 align:start position:0%
lawyer they're G he's an expert and this
 
02:28:40.110 --> 02:28:40.120 align:start position:0%
whatever and they do a lot spend some
 
02:28:42.990 --> 02:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
money help promoting that person and and

them to go um that that you know if if a
 
02:30:27.429 --> 02:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
practice owner you know were worried
 
02:30:29.349 --> 02:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
about that part that's a separate
 
02:30:31.389 --> 02:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
document that's a non-solicitation so
 
02:30:33.870 --> 02:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
they can say just you can't take your
 
02:30:36.190 --> 02:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
people with you but a
 
02:30:39.190 --> 02:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
non-compete is in in my in my reading of
 
02:30:42.269 --> 02:30:42.279 align:start position:0%
it in my understanding of it um is more
 
02:30:45.750 --> 02:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
about you can't then be a lawyer within
 
02:30:50.030 --> 02:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
the 30 m radius of that right okay well
 
02:30:51.830 --> 02:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
that helps that helps explain it to me a
 
02:30:54.110 --> 02:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
little B yeah so the non so you can't
 
02:30:55.510 --> 02:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
like take your people as the
 
02:30:57.469 --> 02:30:57.479 align:start position:0%
non-solicitation um so actually in my
 
02:31:00.030 --> 02:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
current job I was very clear um and they
 
02:31:01.950 --> 02:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
they didn't ask me to sign one but I
 
02:31:03.630 --> 02:31:03.640 align:start position:0%
would not have signed a non-compete
 
02:31:06.710 --> 02:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
again and will never again but I was
 
02:31:08.590 --> 02:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
okay signing you know like agreeing that
 
02:31:11.670 --> 02:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
I won't take patients with me because
 
02:31:14.630 --> 02:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
that could potentially you know harm the
 
02:31:16.550 --> 02:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
practice although I'm I'm with Daisy on
 
02:31:18.670 --> 02:31:18.680 align:start position:0%
this one that it's it's not likely there
 
02:31:20.510 --> 02:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
are you know we've got clients coming
 
02:31:23.190 --> 02:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
out of our ears you know um you know
 
02:31:25.950 --> 02:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
we're up to our eyeballs in it whereas
 
02:31:27.510 --> 02:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
we're in need of more mental health
 
02:31:30.309 --> 02:31:30.319 align:start position:0%

so I guess but of course it's good that
 
02:31:56.590 --> 02:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
it's a Committee Member that we're
 
02:31:59.190 --> 02:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
behind so we don't have to uh have an
 
02:32:02.750 --> 02:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
awkward situation but uh uh we'll open
 
02:32:05.630 --> 02:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
up the public hearing on what's our
 
02:32:10.830 --> 02:32:10.840 align:start position:0%

you chair hunt and I think it's still
 
02:32:22.070 --> 02:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
morning so good morning to my uh
 
02:32:24.150 --> 02:32:24.160 align:start position:0%
Commerce colleagues for the record my
 
02:32:27.710 --> 02:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
name is Constance van hton I am the
 
02:32:30.230 --> 02:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
repres representative of Hillsboro 45
 
02:32:33.030 --> 02:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
which is Manchester WS 101 and 12 which
 
02:32:35.429 --> 02:32:35.439 align:start position:0%
encompasses the west side of Manchester
 
02:32:37.750 --> 02:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
it's an honor today to introduce hbil
 
02:32:41.190 --> 02:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
472 relative to retroactive denials of
 
02:32:43.710 --> 02:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
previously paid claims that's kind of a
 
02:32:45.950 --> 02:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
cumbersome uh list of words so I will
 
02:32:47.910 --> 02:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
try my best to kind of boil it down a
 
02:32:49.750 --> 02:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
tiny bit I do know that there are others
 
02:32:52.830 --> 02:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
who are lined up behind me to testify um
 
02:32:54.190 --> 02:32:54.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully they're still there because
 
02:32:55.670 --> 02:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
these are people who are practitioners
 
02:32:57.710 --> 02:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
who make appointments and hopefully
 
02:33:00.030 --> 02:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
they've been able to stay on at any rate
 
02:33:01.750 --> 02:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
on new hampsh Just A Brief History New
 
02:33:04.630 --> 02:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law prohibiting insurers from
 
02:33:06.870 --> 02:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
imposing the retroactive denial of a
 
02:33:09.750 --> 02:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
claim previously paid to a health care
 
02:33:12.349 --> 02:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
provider except in certain circumstances
 
02:33:15.710 --> 02:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
was adopted back in 2002 in that law the
 
02:33:17.990 --> 02:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
denial the retroactive denial had to be
 
02:33:19.990 --> 02:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
within 18 months that's a year and a
 
02:33:22.429 --> 02:33:22.439 align:start position:0%
half of the date of the payment of the
 
02:33:25.389 --> 02:33:25.399 align:start position:0%
claim in 2018 the time restriction was
 
02:33:28.510 --> 02:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
changed to 12 months still one year for
 
02:33:30.750 --> 02:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
individual health plans and managed care
 
02:33:34.309 --> 02:33:34.319 align:start position:0%
plans in the last Health house session a
 
02:33:35.670 --> 02:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
bill HB
 
02:33:39.309 --> 02:33:39.319 align:start position:0%
1484 did pass the house it reduced the
 
02:33:42.030 --> 02:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
time period to six months stipulating
 
02:33:44.190 --> 02:33:44.200 align:start position:0%
some exceptions to this time requirement
 
02:33:46.670 --> 02:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
of course with the Advent of covid
 
02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
though as with many other bills that
 
02:33:51.870 --> 02:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
bill died on the table in the Senate
 
02:33:54.190 --> 02:33:54.200 align:start position:0%
current law therefore still provides
 
02:33:56.710 --> 02:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
that the time frame for retroactive
 
02:33:59.269 --> 02:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
denial of such previously paid insurance
 
02:34:03.030 --> 02:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
claims is 12 months 12 months one year
 
02:34:04.990 --> 02:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
this means that a year after a health
 
02:34:07.230 --> 02:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
care provider has rendered services in
 
02:34:09.349 --> 02:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
good faith of course an insurance
 
02:34:11.230 --> 02:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
company can deny the claim that's one
 
02:34:13.550 --> 02:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
year later certainly the insurer
 
02:34:15.309 --> 02:34:15.319 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to pay a claim for which
 
02:34:16.990 --> 02:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
it is not liable
 
02:34:18.670 --> 02:34:18.680 align:start position:0%
however the insurance company which
 
02:34:22.309 --> 02:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
itself often often has time limits
 
02:34:24.230 --> 02:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
within which you must file your claim
 
02:34:26.710 --> 02:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
should not take a year to determine that
 
02:34:29.309 --> 02:34:29.319 align:start position:0%
a service was ineligible and take back
 
02:34:32.070 --> 02:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement uh that it already
 
02:34:34.510 --> 02:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
paid how difficult it must be for a
 
02:34:37.070 --> 02:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
health care provider to recoup the costs
 
02:34:39.630 --> 02:34:39.640 align:start position:0%
from a patient or another insurance
 
02:34:41.990 --> 02:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
company a year later there are other
 
02:34:44.469 --> 02:34:44.479 align:start position:0%
questions for example if an insurer paid
 
02:34:46.670 --> 02:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
a claim an error she should it take a
 
02:34:48.830 --> 02:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
year to figure it out we're often
 
02:34:50.429 --> 02:34:50.439 align:start position:0%
talking here about large insurance
 
02:34:52.469 --> 02:34:52.479 align:start position:0%
companies with the ability to to
 
02:34:54.269 --> 02:34:54.279 align:start position:0%
backtrack and to do this and far less
 
02:34:56.670 --> 02:34:56.680 align:start position:0%
time than one year another question is
 
02:34:58.550 --> 02:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
it fair to the health care provider that
 
02:35:02.550 --> 02:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
the insurance can basically dock future
 
02:35:04.469 --> 02:35:04.479 align:start position:0%
payments to recoup the claim that was
 
02:35:07.990 --> 02:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
incorrectly made after a year has passed
 
02:35:10.110 --> 02:35:10.120 align:start position:0%
uh this is sometimes called the clawback
 
02:35:12.990 --> 02:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
bill for that reason uh a year later
 
02:35:15.190 --> 02:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
they can claw back or take back the
 
02:35:16.710 --> 02:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
money that is rightful theirs this is
 
02:35:18.150 --> 02:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
the insurance company about which I
 
02:35:20.269 --> 02:35:20.279 align:start position:0%
speak it is rightfully theirs however
 
02:35:22.150 --> 02:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
they're taking that money from payments
 
02:35:24.510 --> 02:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
that are coming in a year later House
 
02:35:26.670 --> 02:35:26.680 align:start position:0%
Bill 472 which is the bill before you
 
02:35:30.469 --> 02:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
today is identical to hb1 1484 from the
 
02:35:32.830 --> 02:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
last session it includes the shortened
 
02:35:34.950 --> 02:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
six-month time requirement which in my
 
02:35:37.950 --> 02:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
opinion is probably still too long it is
 
02:35:39.790 --> 02:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
one of the results of discussions in
 
02:35:42.269 --> 02:35:42.279 align:start position:0%
last sessions commission to study the
 
02:35:44.750 --> 02:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
business environment for mental health
 
02:35:47.469 --> 02:35:47.479 align:start position:0%
providers uh as I was waiting and
 
02:35:50.110 --> 02:35:50.120 align:start position:0%
listening to the previous testimonies I
 
02:35:53.510 --> 02:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
got an alert from NPR which says and I
 
02:35:56.389 --> 02:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
quote mental health professionals warn
 
02:35:59.150 --> 02:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
the pandemic may be raising suicide risk
 
02:36:01.670 --> 02:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
for many kids representative abrami and
 
02:36:03.710 --> 02:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
other speakers have alluded to the need
 
02:36:06.190 --> 02:36:06.200 align:start position:0%
for Quality Health Care Health mental um
 
02:36:08.190 --> 02:36:08.200 align:start position:0%
Health Care Providers including Mental
 
02:36:10.269 --> 02:36:10.279 align:start position:0%
Health Providers and yet we are making
 
02:36:11.990 --> 02:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
it very difficult for them to do the
 
02:36:13.630 --> 02:36:13.640 align:start position:0%
jobs with their clients with their
 
02:36:15.429 --> 02:36:15.439 align:start position:0%
patients because they are mired in
 
02:36:17.150 --> 02:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
paperwork trying to take care of this
 
02:36:20.269 --> 02:36:20.279 align:start position:0%
type of an issue um in closing I would
 
02:36:22.990 --> 02:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
just like to I would be Remis to say
 
02:36:24.389 --> 02:36:24.399 align:start position:0%
that there aren't a few issues that have
 
02:36:26.230 --> 02:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
been pointed out to me by those who may
 
02:36:28.630 --> 02:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
testify today they're minor issues and
 
02:36:30.950 --> 02:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
can easily be dealt with uh I'll take
 
02:36:33.150 --> 02:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
questions if need be I know I need to be
 
02:36:35.510 --> 02:36:35.520 align:start position:0%

healthcare providers who I hope are
 
02:36:43.230 --> 02:36:43.240 align:start position:0%
still on will be able to deal much
 
02:36:44.990 --> 02:36:45.000 align:start position:0%

providing mental health counseling my
 
02:37:59.830 --> 02:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
practice is located in conquered and I
 
02:38:02.190 --> 02:38:02.200 align:start position:0%
have been in private practice for 20
 
02:38:06.269 --> 02:38:06.279 align:start position:0%
years now I'm here to speak on this bill
 
02:38:08.830 --> 02:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
on behalf of clinicians United New
 
02:38:12.870 --> 02:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we find that this uh these
 
02:38:15.389 --> 02:38:15.399 align:start position:0%
clawbacks uh are a burden on small
 
02:38:15.399 --> 02:38:17.590 align:start position:0%
clawbacks uh are a burden on small
business

02:38:17.590 --> 02:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:38:20.349 --> 02:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
practitioners do their due diligence in
 
02:38:23.750 --> 02:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
obtaining patient benefits they see the
 
02:38:27.510 --> 02:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
patient maybe for one visit or a series
 
02:38:31.030 --> 02:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
of visits and they bill insurers based
 
02:38:34.389 --> 02:38:34.399 align:start position:0%
on the information insurers gave them
 
02:38:37.750 --> 02:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
then they get paid those claims that to
 
02:38:40.389 --> 02:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
the insurance end of
 
02:38:43.550 --> 02:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
story but then months or even years I've
 
02:38:47.349 --> 02:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
seen in some cases payments
 
02:38:49.870 --> 02:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
uh of these payments clinicians get hit
 
02:38:52.070 --> 02:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
with retroactive
 
02:38:54.429 --> 02:38:54.439 align:start position:0%
denials I'm not aware of any other
 
02:38:57.309 --> 02:38:57.319 align:start position:0%
industry that pays vendors or
 
02:39:00.429 --> 02:39:00.439 align:start position:0%
consultants in a sense and then turns
 
02:39:03.830 --> 02:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
around and takes monies paid back due to
 
02:39:03.840 --> 02:39:04.790 align:start position:0%
around and takes monies paid back due to
their

02:39:04.790 --> 02:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:39:08.030 --> 02:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
error clawbacks are done by withholding
 
02:39:10.710 --> 02:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
payments on current patients we are
 
02:39:14.309 --> 02:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
seeing this creates an onerous paperwork
 
02:39:17.230 --> 02:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
and tracking nightmare any practices
 
02:39:18.590 --> 02:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
especially if there are multiple
 
02:39:21.469 --> 02:39:21.479 align:start position:0%
practitioners at a site my colleague
 
02:39:23.950 --> 02:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
Sean Hassel is hopefully going to be
 
02:39:27.230 --> 02:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
able to speak more on this
 
02:39:30.349 --> 02:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
today with a six-month margin Health
 
02:39:32.910 --> 02:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
insurers who have many more resources
 
02:39:34.830 --> 02:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
than we than small businesses in New
 
02:39:38.070 --> 02:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should be able to identify
 
02:39:39.830 --> 02:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
mistakes we
 
02:39:42.870 --> 02:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
prefer that in cases where they find
 
02:39:46.469 --> 02:39:46.479 align:start position:0%
that another insurance was responsible
 
02:39:49.190 --> 02:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
for the claims that they be limited to
 
02:39:52.870 --> 02:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
six months as well as general claims
 
02:39:56.230 --> 02:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
right now there is an exception in
 
02:40:01.070 --> 02:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
the um in the law that is exception
 
02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:03.950 align:start position:0%
the um in the law that is exception
number

02:40:03.950 --> 02:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:40:06.790 --> 02:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
2E that states that claims that are the
 
02:40:08.190 --> 02:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
subject of an adjustment with a
 
02:40:08.200 --> 02:40:09.349 align:start position:0%
subject of an adjustment with a
different

02:40:09.349 --> 02:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:40:13.349 --> 02:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
insurer um can be pulled back to
 
02:40:16.349 --> 02:40:16.359 align:start position:0%
Infinity there is no restriction if an
 
02:40:19.910 --> 02:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
insurance company say in 2 years finds
 
02:40:21.590 --> 02:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
that there was a different insurer
 
02:40:24.389 --> 02:40:24.399 align:start position:0%
responsible they come after us they
 
02:40:27.750 --> 02:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
don't for the insurance company that is
 
02:40:30.510 --> 02:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
responsible it was responsible for
 
02:40:32.790 --> 02:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
coverage at the time of the DAT of
 
02:40:36.150 --> 02:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
service so we are asking
 
02:40:39.670 --> 02:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
that that the time limit go from the 12
 
02:40:43.469 --> 02:40:43.479 align:start position:0%
months to the six Monon margin and we
 
02:40:45.110 --> 02:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
again we believe that these insurance
 
02:40:47.590 --> 02:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
companies have the resources to and the
 
02:40:51.910 --> 02:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
compu in order to be able to do this and
 
02:40:54.830 --> 02:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
um that I would ask that the committee
 
02:40:57.710 --> 02:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
also consider
 
02:41:01.710 --> 02:41:01.720 align:start position:0%
exception e be eliminated which allows
 
02:41:04.830 --> 02:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
for Infinity for the clawback of claims
 
02:41:08.309 --> 02:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:11.950 --> 02:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
questions okay uh any questions yes
 
02:41:14.429 --> 02:41:14.439 align:start position:0%
representative Fargo me
 
02:41:16.590 --> 02:41:16.600 align:start position:0%
inquire thank you Mr
 
02:41:19.750 --> 02:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
chair um a question that has been
 
02:41:23.630 --> 02:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
bothering me is when they um when they
 
02:41:27.070 --> 02:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
hold this money back on Old claims it
 
02:41:29.030 --> 02:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
the air is usually on the insurance
 
02:41:31.510 --> 02:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
providers side is that
 
02:41:35.710 --> 02:41:35.720 align:start position:0%
correct yes they will um we obtain the
 
02:41:37.550 --> 02:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
benefits from them they give us the
 
02:41:40.110 --> 02:41:40.120 align:start position:0%
benefits and we see the client and
 
02:41:43.790 --> 02:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
collect co-pays or deductibles in um
 
02:41:46.510 --> 02:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
conjunctions with us is the patients
 
02:41:49.429 --> 02:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
coverage and they pay us so there is no
 
02:41:52.230 --> 02:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
alarm on our side our side to say that
 
02:41:53.870 --> 02:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
something's wrong because we're getting
 
02:41:56.790 --> 02:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
paid um as we're seeing the
 
02:41:59.950 --> 02:41:59.960 align:start position:0%
clients followup for the question me
 
02:42:03.950 --> 02:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
clarire so when this happens are is it
 
02:42:06.830 --> 02:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
then your responsibility to go to the
 
02:42:09.870 --> 02:42:09.880 align:start position:0%
patient to collect those
 
02:42:13.870 --> 02:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
monies or I mean how how do you get the
 
02:42:17.389 --> 02:42:17.399 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for what is rightfully um
 
02:42:18.750 --> 02:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
yours as a
 
02:42:21.590 --> 02:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
provider uh thank you for that question
 
02:42:25.990 --> 02:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
um so yes the the idea is that we I if
 
02:42:27.990 --> 02:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
there is another insurance that was
 
02:42:32.030 --> 02:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
responsible at the time that we to get
 
02:42:34.830 --> 02:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
the money from that insurance company
 
02:42:37.429 --> 02:42:37.439 align:start position:0%
which causes um a need for a lot of
 
02:42:40.790 --> 02:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
excess resources to go towards tracking
 
02:42:44.750 --> 02:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
that company filing these claims um
 
02:42:46.269 --> 02:42:46.279 align:start position:0%
retroactive Ive
 
02:42:51.190 --> 02:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
claims and um in in some cases trying to
 
02:42:55.110 --> 02:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
go after the client but um the client
 
02:42:58.110 --> 02:42:58.120 align:start position:0%
have only seen us for let's say six
 
02:43:01.550 --> 02:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
sessions and we haven't seen them for 18
 
02:43:03.550 --> 02:43:03.560 align:start position:0%
months and it's very awkward to go back
 
02:43:06.309 --> 02:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
to a client and now try to retract money
 
02:43:10.429 --> 02:43:10.439 align:start position:0%
from them um often times um as much as
 
02:43:13.590 --> 02:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
80% of these um clawbacks are just
 
02:43:19.150 --> 02:43:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:21.590 --> 02:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
clinician any other questions from

02:44:15.389 --> 02:44:15.399 align:start position:0%
608c it often goes to spam filters if
 
02:44:16.910 --> 02:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
you could fish it out of there that'd be
 
02:44:21.550 --> 02:44:21.560 align:start position:0%
lovely and uh see my thing I have um
 
02:44:25.070 --> 02:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
personal experience with this issue with
 
02:44:28.309 --> 02:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
clawbacks and I was completely surprised
 
02:44:30.830 --> 02:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
I've always had a very sound practice
 
02:44:34.030 --> 02:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
and I do my submissions very carefully
 
02:44:36.550 --> 02:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
making sure that I've honored all of the
 
02:44:40.349 --> 02:44:40.359 align:start position:0%
authorization requirements and such um
 
02:44:44.389 --> 02:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
however I I have two sides of this
 
02:44:46.030 --> 02:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
experience to tell tell you about and
 
02:44:48.550 --> 02:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
one is I think you're aware um my
 
02:44:52.349 --> 02:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
husband who is a retired legislator from
 
02:44:54.429 --> 02:44:54.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire honorable member of the
 
02:44:58.150 --> 02:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
Congress committee and he um as you know
 
02:44:59.990 --> 02:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
several you are aware and in fact thank
 
02:45:03.150 --> 02:45:03.160 align:start position:0%
you very much the three years ago he was
 
02:45:06.070 --> 02:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
stricken with a complete paralysis after
 
02:45:10.030 --> 02:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
a flu shot and was in Boston hospitals
 
02:45:13.550 --> 02:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
for much of year of 2018 I was down
 
02:45:15.150 --> 02:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
there with him much of that time thank
 
02:45:17.950 --> 02:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
thank you people for prayers and good
 
02:45:20.710 --> 02:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
wishes during that time and he's still
 
02:45:24.309 --> 02:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
improving and getting better and uh we
 
02:45:26.750 --> 02:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
learned a lot from the experience it was
 
02:45:30.269 --> 02:45:30.279 align:start position:0%
very um touching how many people showed
 
02:45:32.990 --> 02:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
care and how we learned even more about
 
02:45:35.670 --> 02:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
our love for each other and our need for
 
02:45:39.870 --> 02:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
prayer and um we developed an intense
 
02:45:43.190 --> 02:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
respect for the medical profession uh
 
02:45:45.349 --> 02:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
even being part of it already myself I
 
02:45:47.670 --> 02:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
we just were amazed at the things people
 
02:45:50.429 --> 02:45:50.439 align:start position:0%
did we also were grateful to have
 
02:45:53.910 --> 02:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage and how it covered
 
02:45:57.550 --> 02:45:57.560 align:start position:0%
this entire uh episode which was a lot
 
02:46:00.510 --> 02:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
of money uh being in intensive care and
 
02:46:03.710 --> 02:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
such all over Boston um there were
 
02:46:05.750 --> 02:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
people at the insurance company who were
 
02:46:08.870 --> 02:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
very helpful advocates for us in the
 
02:46:11.389 --> 02:46:11.399 align:start position:0%
admissions process and such they they
 
02:46:13.990 --> 02:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
they went overboard and did great
 
02:46:17.469 --> 02:46:17.479 align:start position:0%
things unfortunately even as late as
 
02:46:20.710 --> 02:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
last year which like two more than two
 
02:46:25.469 --> 02:46:25.479 align:start position:0%
years after the episodes of care we were
 
02:46:29.309 --> 02:46:29.319 align:start position:0%
subject to clawbacks for that care and
 
02:46:31.710 --> 02:46:31.720 align:start position:0%
many thousand dollars like
 
02:46:35.590 --> 02:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
$177,000 and $4,000 and all over the
 
02:46:37.309 --> 02:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
place there were still clawbacks going
 
02:46:40.870 --> 02:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
on in that care and certainly that was
 
02:46:43.870 --> 02:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
not the the major part of what had been
 
02:46:45.830 --> 02:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
paid thank goodness they didn't pull
 
02:46:48.349 --> 02:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
back the bar big Parts but still that
 
02:46:50.950 --> 02:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
kind of money is a huge amount of money
 
02:46:53.990 --> 02:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
for us especially I wasn't working much
 
02:46:57.910 --> 02:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
I was following Mike to Boston and um
 
02:47:00.469 --> 02:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
was out of employment at the moment at
 
02:47:04.750 --> 02:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
that time he he was um couldn't work so
 
02:47:07.429 --> 02:47:07.439 align:start position:0%
that was you know over
 
02:47:11.750 --> 02:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
$20,000 That Came Upon Us uh from these
 
02:47:15.230 --> 02:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
Boston hospitals and still to this day
 
02:47:17.670 --> 02:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
every month I spend a day on the phone
 
02:47:19.630 --> 02:47:19.640 align:start position:0%
with the insurance companies and the
 
02:47:22.110 --> 02:47:22.120 align:start position:0%
hospitals and still trying to metal this
 
02:47:24.670 --> 02:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
out this is from the patient
 
02:47:27.910 --> 02:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
side from the provider's side as a
 
02:47:31.590 --> 02:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
doctor I um received clawbacks just
 
02:47:35.230 --> 02:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
before Mike went in the hospital I was
 
02:47:37.389 --> 02:47:37.399 align:start position:0%
stricken with clawbacks that reached
 
02:47:38.870 --> 02:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
back 20
 
02:47:42.349 --> 02:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
months and it was there were so many
 
02:47:44.230 --> 02:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
errors in them and it was just so
 
02:47:44.240 --> 02:47:45.670 align:start position:0%
errors in them and it was just so
impossible

02:47:45.670 --> 02:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
02:47:48.790 --> 02:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
they ended up taking these clawbacks
 
02:47:52.190 --> 02:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
from future payments of future patients
 
02:47:55.230 --> 02:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
and there was no way to figure out where
 
02:47:57.190 --> 02:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
it was how it happened this was many
 
02:47:59.550 --> 02:47:59.560 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars because the
 
02:48:01.870 --> 02:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
insurance company had suddenly decided
 
02:48:06.870 --> 02:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
that they were going to uh use a um
 
02:48:09.790 --> 02:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
discount for teley medicine and they
 
02:48:11.870 --> 02:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
were going to apply this
 
02:48:14.469 --> 02:48:14.479 align:start position:0%
retroactively for patients who had
 
02:48:18.830 --> 02:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
received care and um it was very
 
02:48:21.750 --> 02:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
dramatic in my budget my cash flow and
 
02:48:24.750 --> 02:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
my business went really badly at that
 
02:48:27.070 --> 02:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
point all the same time that Mike's in
 
02:48:30.030 --> 02:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
the hospital it was a very difficult
 
02:48:34.750 --> 02:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
time um I consulted with my billing um
 
02:48:37.630 --> 02:48:37.640 align:start position:0%
people who submit these things for me n
 
02:48:39.150 --> 02:48:39.160 align:start position:0%
nobody could figure it out and the the
 
02:48:40.830 --> 02:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
company that I use is a multinational
 
02:48:43.910 --> 02:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
company it's not like we they have no uh
 
02:48:47.830 --> 02:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
sophistication at all and um still to
 
02:48:50.910 --> 02:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
this day there those years that those
 
02:48:53.910 --> 02:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
were affected I could not close the
 
02:48:55.630 --> 02:48:55.640 align:start position:0%
books on that account I had to climb
 
02:48:58.070 --> 02:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
through and I I managed to finally
 
02:49:02.429 --> 02:49:02.439 align:start position:0%
figure out through this sweeping swirl
 
02:49:02.439 --> 02:49:03.870 align:start position:0%
figure out through this sweeping swirl
of

02:49:03.870 --> 02:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:49:07.469 --> 02:49:07.479 align:start position:0%
misaligned paperwork that was sent to me
 
02:49:07.479 --> 02:49:09.190 align:start position:0%
misaligned paperwork that was sent to me
and

02:49:09.190 --> 02:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:49:14.790 --> 02:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
un um referenced deductions from future
 
02:49:18.110 --> 02:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
payments that I finally did get some of
 
02:49:20.030 --> 02:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
it and I figured out where the mistakes
 
02:49:23.110 --> 02:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
were made but by then I I couldn't go
 
02:49:26.190 --> 02:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
back to the insurance this is now three
 
02:49:28.469 --> 02:49:28.479 align:start position:0%
years later to be able to go back to the
 
02:49:31.670 --> 02:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and
 
02:49:35.990 --> 02:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh appeal that was it's gone this is
 
02:49:39.389 --> 02:49:39.399 align:start position:0%
much money gone so uh I just wanted to
 
02:49:43.229 --> 02:49:43.239 align:start position:0%
share with you the impact of a long
 
02:49:45.469 --> 02:49:45.479 align:start position:0%
drawn out clawback
 
02:49:50.870 --> 02:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
reach and how it hits a both a consumer
 
02:49:54.590 --> 02:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
and a provider and it's uh very dire so
 
02:49:56.990 --> 02:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
I do support this bill and I appreciate
 
02:49:58.349 --> 02:49:58.359 align:start position:0%
that it's been brought forward I'll take
 
02:49:58.359 --> 02:50:01.150 align:start position:0%
that it's been brought forward I'll take
any

02:50:01.150 --> 02:50:01.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:04.110 --> 02:50:04.120 align:start position:0%

[Music]

02:50:26.870 --> 02:50:26.880 align:start position:0%

hunt and uh thank you for having me I
 
02:50:36.389 --> 02:50:36.399 align:start position:0%
had originally registered and when was
 
02:50:38.269 --> 02:50:38.279 align:start position:0%
unable to make it but then the system
 
02:50:40.469 --> 02:50:40.479 align:start position:0%
didn't allow me to change my status to
 
02:50:42.309 --> 02:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
want to testify so they told me that if
 
02:50:45.309 --> 02:50:45.319 align:start position:0%
I just raised my hand that maybe there
 
02:50:47.670 --> 02:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
would be that chance so I appreciate um
 
02:50:49.469 --> 02:50:49.479 align:start position:0%
you allowing me this chance and thank
 
02:50:51.710 --> 02:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
you to Representative members of um

for hearing this today um I'm calling to
 
02:50:59.590 --> 02:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh talk a bit about retroactive denials
 
02:51:02.110 --> 02:51:02.120 align:start position:0%
and how they impact in this case um
 
02:51:04.469 --> 02:51:04.479 align:start position:0%
group practices so um individual
 
02:51:06.830 --> 02:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
practitioners um are hit very hard by
 
02:51:10.990 --> 02:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
these um and I really um do appreciate
 
02:51:13.190 --> 02:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative en hooton and the other
 
02:51:14.830 --> 02:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
two people who testified in terms of
 
02:51:18.550 --> 02:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
their description of retroactive denials
 
02:51:21.269 --> 02:51:21.279 align:start position:0%
um and how they really do hurt uh small
 
02:51:23.670 --> 02:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
businesses um and I just urge everybody
 
02:51:25.229 --> 02:51:25.239 align:start position:0%
to remember that during this time
 
02:51:26.790 --> 02:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
there's been references to there being a
 
02:51:29.790 --> 02:51:29.800 align:start position:0%
mental health crisis uh today right now
 
02:51:32.750 --> 02:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh Co having worse into that and uh to
 
02:51:34.750 --> 02:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
please consider how these small business
 
02:51:36.630 --> 02:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
and often if it's individual
 
02:51:38.710 --> 02:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
practitioners sort of micro businesses
 
02:51:41.670 --> 02:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
can be very very hard hit uh in terms of
 
02:51:45.790 --> 02:51:45.800 align:start position:0%
impact on on on finances um um I co-own
 
02:51:49.190 --> 02:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
a group um group Psychotherapy family
 
02:51:51.150 --> 02:51:51.160 align:start position:0%
therapy practice in we have offices in
 
02:51:54.269 --> 02:51:54.279 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Salem it's 11 providers
 
02:51:58.630 --> 02:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
total um in the two regions um and I
 
02:52:01.429 --> 02:52:01.439 align:start position:0%
thought I would just describe
 
02:52:04.630 --> 02:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
um some put some some numbers on it
 
02:52:05.950 --> 02:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
because at our practice we've actually
 
02:52:07.950 --> 02:52:07.960 align:start position:0%
tracked you know how this has happened
 
02:52:10.510 --> 02:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
over time so if you go back uh this is
 
02:52:13.389 --> 02:52:13.399 align:start position:0%
only counting clawbacks or retroactive
 
02:52:16.469 --> 02:52:16.479 align:start position:0%
denials that are too $50 are over we
 
02:52:19.150 --> 02:52:19.160 align:start position:0%
have more frequent smaller ones um but
 
02:52:21.190 --> 02:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
in our experience those are a bit more
 
02:52:23.309 --> 02:52:23.319 align:start position:0%
manageable to be able to track down and
 
02:52:24.950 --> 02:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
if it's just say two sessions or three
 
02:52:27.349 --> 02:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
sessions and maybe only three or five
 
02:52:28.870 --> 02:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
months after Services we're pretty
 
02:52:30.229 --> 02:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
successful at getting those but I'm
 
02:52:33.870 --> 02:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
talking sort of um larger uh clawbacks
 
02:52:37.110 --> 02:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
retroactive denials um so the uh if we
 
02:52:38.710 --> 02:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
go back over the course of our history
 
02:52:42.590 --> 02:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
we started in 2009 it's uh 28 total
 
02:52:45.070 --> 02:52:45.080 align:start position:0%
retroactive denials of that size or
 
02:52:47.190 --> 02:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
larger so it's not a enormous amount
 
02:52:50.670 --> 02:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
each year but the work involved is
 
02:52:51.950 --> 02:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
something that I'm wanting to emphasize
 
02:52:54.070 --> 02:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
today and the impact financially can be
 
02:52:56.030 --> 02:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
quite large so they have average those
 
02:52:56.040 --> 02:52:56.990 align:start position:0%
quite large so they have average those
28

02:52:56.990 --> 02:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
28
 
02:53:00.590 --> 02:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
$670 each so some are smaller you know
 
02:53:03.269 --> 02:53:03.279 align:start position:0%
three four $500 others we've had retro
 
02:53:05.389 --> 02:53:05.399 align:start position:0%
we've had retroactive denials amounting
 
02:53:09.110 --> 02:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
to2 $3,000 a couple of times um the
 
02:53:13.349 --> 02:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
total of those uh 28 is
 
02:53:16.030 --> 02:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
$18,750 that hit that we've been hit
 
02:53:19.030 --> 02:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
with at our group practice um and then
 
02:53:21.269 --> 02:53:21.279 align:start position:0%
following up on that with extensive
 
02:53:23.790 --> 02:53:23.800 align:start position:0%
Outreach on our part reaching out trying
 
02:53:26.030 --> 02:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
to ascertain was there another insurance
 
02:53:27.590 --> 02:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
that should have been primary for
 
02:53:29.870 --> 02:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
example or another responsible party and
 
02:53:31.630 --> 02:53:31.640 align:start position:0%
trying to reach out to clients many of
 
02:53:33.190 --> 02:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
whom are
 
02:53:35.590 --> 02:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
terminated um we've been able to get
 
02:53:35.600 --> 02:53:36.590 align:start position:0%
terminated um we've been able to get
back

02:53:36.590 --> 02:53:36.600 align:start position:0%
back
 
02:53:39.590 --> 02:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
6,140 so that has left us with a net
 
02:53:39.600 --> 02:53:41.030 align:start position:0%
6,140 so that has left us with a net
nearly

02:53:41.030 --> 02:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
nearly
 
02:53:43.630 --> 02:53:43.640 align:start position:0%
$113,000 um over a period of time most
 
02:53:44.830 --> 02:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
of that by the way more of those
 
02:53:46.389 --> 02:53:46.399 align:start position:0%
retroactive denials I don't know why
 
02:53:48.710 --> 02:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
they accelerated starting in 2016 so
 
02:53:50.510 --> 02:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
more of them have been since
 
02:53:52.950 --> 02:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
2016 I want to speak a little bit to uh
 
02:53:55.429 --> 02:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
representative Fargo you had a um some
 
02:53:58.150 --> 02:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
questions about this and yes absolutely
 
02:54:01.469 --> 02:54:01.479 align:start position:0%
most often the the error has been on the
 
02:54:03.150 --> 02:54:03.160 align:start position:0%
Insurance's part every once in a while
 
02:54:04.790 --> 02:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's a shared responsibility with the
 
02:54:06.510 --> 02:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
client we sometimes at our group have
 
02:54:08.309 --> 02:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
had clients that don't they fail to
 
02:54:10.630 --> 02:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
mention they have another insurance and
 
02:54:11.670 --> 02:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
they don't know that that other
 
02:54:14.389 --> 02:54:14.399 align:start position:0%
insurance is the primary one and so we
 
02:54:16.670 --> 02:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
verify benefits and we ascertain that
 
02:54:19.229 --> 02:54:19.239 align:start position:0%
there are there is indeed coverage we
 
02:54:20.790 --> 02:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
start billing and the error that the
 
02:54:23.550 --> 02:54:23.560 align:start position:0%
insurance makes is they pay it and then
 
02:54:27.070 --> 02:54:27.080 align:start position:0%
they only later learn you know maybe and
 
02:54:29.990 --> 02:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
and and I have to say it is particularly
 
02:54:32.110 --> 02:54:32.120 align:start position:0%
difficult when it goes beyond six months
 
02:54:34.269 --> 02:54:34.279 align:start position:0%
when when the services were rendered and
 
02:54:36.630 --> 02:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
finished up six seven eight nine months
 
02:54:40.030 --> 02:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
12 months prior um it's not only a
 
02:54:42.030 --> 02:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
financial burden the administrative
 
02:54:45.229 --> 02:54:45.239 align:start position:0%
burden is enormous um each one of these
 
02:54:47.030 --> 02:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
retroactive denials in my experience to
 
02:54:48.830 --> 02:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
sort of troubleshoot and try to find
 
02:54:50.469 --> 02:54:50.479 align:start position:0%
what really went on and then you're
 
02:54:52.429 --> 02:54:52.439 align:start position:0%
trying to reach if you if you imagine if
 
02:54:54.429 --> 02:54:54.439 align:start position:0%
you will will you you're trying to reach
 
02:54:57.349 --> 02:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
a client who often has finished up
 
02:54:59.990 --> 02:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
services a year prior and at the time
 
02:55:02.510 --> 02:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
they thought it was all fine it was all
 
02:55:04.830 --> 02:55:04.840 align:start position:0%
being paid because their insurance paid
 
02:55:08.309 --> 02:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
it and now they're gone and we have to
 
02:55:10.349 --> 02:55:10.359 align:start position:0%
reach out to them if if it indeed is
 
02:55:11.870 --> 02:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
their responsibility or to at least
 
02:55:13.469 --> 02:55:13.479 align:start position:0%
ascertain is there another insurance if
 
02:55:15.870 --> 02:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
that's the issue
 
02:55:17.110 --> 02:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes they work with us sometimes
 
02:55:19.550 --> 02:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
they don't but often we don't succeed in
 
02:55:21.030 --> 02:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
getting those monies back and I'm part
 
02:55:22.670 --> 02:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
of a group and we have some resources
 
02:55:24.110 --> 02:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
for that compared to an individual
 
02:55:26.150 --> 02:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
practitioner and even for us it's often
 
02:55:28.269 --> 02:55:28.279 align:start position:0%
quite overwhelming and the time involved
 
02:55:30.110 --> 02:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
in in each one of these retroactive
 
02:55:32.550 --> 02:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
denials we're talking two three four
 
02:55:34.990 --> 02:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
I've spent up to six hours on one
 
02:55:37.349 --> 02:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
retroactive denial so you can imagine an
 
02:55:39.670 --> 02:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
hourly an already not great
 
02:55:42.030 --> 02:55:42.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate from insurance
 
02:55:44.630 --> 02:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
carriers then gets watered down water
 
02:55:47.030 --> 02:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
down water down so if if if you know in
 
02:55:48.389 --> 02:55:48.399 align:start position:0%
this case I'm often the one who chases
 
02:55:50.950 --> 02:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
them so if I'm on when I say four five
 
02:55:53.110 --> 02:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
six hours it's calling the insurance
 
02:55:55.429 --> 02:55:55.439 align:start position:0%
company being on hold as everybody knows
 
02:55:57.269 --> 02:55:57.279 align:start position:0%
happens now I I've been on hold recently
 
02:55:58.870 --> 02:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
for insurance companies it's been really
 
02:56:01.070 --> 02:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
bad the last month I'm talking hour hour
 
02:56:02.950 --> 02:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
and a half on hold with Anthony lacrosse
 
02:56:05.830 --> 02:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
for example um and then it's trying to
 
02:56:08.150 --> 02:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
talk with um Insurance reps trying to
 
02:56:10.349 --> 02:56:10.359 align:start position:0%
find out what exactly happened how come
 
02:56:13.110 --> 02:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
they paid and then what are they saying
 
02:56:14.590 --> 02:56:14.600 align:start position:0%
was the primary insurance if there was
 
02:56:18.030 --> 02:56:18.040 align:start position:0%
another Insurance uh and then it's uh
 
02:56:20.110 --> 02:56:20.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes we actually another thing
 
02:56:22.229 --> 02:56:22.239 align:start position:0%
represented Fargo to to add to that we
 
02:56:23.630 --> 02:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
have more than one found that the
 
02:56:25.190 --> 02:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
insurance more than one time found the
 
02:56:27.190 --> 02:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
insurance is actually incorrect there
 
02:56:29.389 --> 02:56:29.399 align:start position:0%
was not another Insurance maybe the
 
02:56:31.229 --> 02:56:31.239 align:start position:0%
family started another policy but never
 
02:56:33.630 --> 02:56:33.640 align:start position:0%
paid for it but somehow in the systems
 
02:56:36.150 --> 02:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
it looks like them to them like there
 
02:56:37.510 --> 02:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
should have been another insurance that
 
02:56:39.990 --> 02:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
paid I have to chase it town talk with
 
02:56:41.309 --> 02:56:41.319 align:start position:0%
the family the family says no we never
 
02:56:43.510 --> 02:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
even paid for that other policy it takes
 
02:56:44.790 --> 02:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
and then then you're on the phone and
 
02:56:45.950 --> 02:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes you have to elevate it to a
 
02:56:47.630 --> 02:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
supervisor I mean just the
 
02:56:50.510 --> 02:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
administrative burden alone is enormous
 
02:56:53.030 --> 02:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
um enough so that it often feels like
 
02:56:54.830 --> 02:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's sort of Geared for us to just give
 
02:56:58.030 --> 02:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
up and write it off and we we we do we
 
02:56:59.990 --> 02:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
we often end up having to write off you
 
02:57:01.670 --> 02:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
know each year we we write off a few
 
02:57:05.510 --> 02:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars because of this um so
 
02:57:07.590 --> 02:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
um I guess I just wanted to emphasize
 
02:57:09.830 --> 02:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
those pieces and that this particular
 
02:57:11.389 --> 02:57:11.399 align:start position:0%
Bill the pieces that are helpful is that
 
02:57:13.309 --> 02:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
it would shorten it to six months as the
 
02:57:16.389 --> 02:57:16.399 align:start position:0%
default 12 it is very clear to us the
 
02:57:17.830 --> 02:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
insurance should have the internal
 
02:57:21.229 --> 02:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
resources um Heidi page testified to to
 
02:57:23.349 --> 02:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
that being uh the experience that you
 
02:57:24.870 --> 02:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
know they they have internal resources
 
02:57:26.429 --> 02:57:26.439 align:start position:0%
to be able to do this in Far sooner than
 
02:57:29.590 --> 02:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
a year um and if you can keep in mind if
 
02:57:30.750 --> 02:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
they can let us know that there's been
 
02:57:32.990 --> 02:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
an error on their part and they paid
 
02:57:35.590 --> 02:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
incorrectly and it's four months often
 
02:57:36.990 --> 02:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
we're still with the client or we can
 
02:57:38.429 --> 02:57:38.439 align:start position:0%
reach the client we can apply more
 
02:57:40.070 --> 02:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
leverage it may not be so difficult and
 
02:57:42.269 --> 02:57:42.279 align:start position:0%
we're willing to do that work but it's
 
02:57:43.750 --> 02:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
when it's many many months later and a
 
02:57:45.229 --> 02:57:45.239 align:start position:0%
lot lot of these retroactive denials
 
02:57:48.349 --> 02:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
come in the six to 12 month range um I
 
02:57:50.670 --> 02:57:50.680 align:start position:0%
agreed with um Heidi PA's testimony that
 
02:57:52.429 --> 02:57:52.439 align:start position:0%
there is one part of this bill it's to
 
02:57:56.030 --> 02:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
it's the exception to e um that you know
 
02:57:57.990 --> 02:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
I feel should be eliminated altogether
 
02:57:59.590 --> 02:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
if it goes beyond six months and they
 
02:58:00.790 --> 02:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
find that there should should have been
 
02:58:03.190 --> 02:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
another insurance that was primary um
 
02:58:04.750 --> 02:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
really at this point they have better
 
02:58:06.229 --> 02:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
resources and we're not in a place if
 
02:58:08.750 --> 02:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
anybody here by the way wonders well if
 
02:58:11.710 --> 02:58:11.720 align:start position:0%
the if the end it's client
 
02:58:13.590 --> 02:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility like you should have it
 
02:58:15.269 --> 02:58:15.279 align:start position:0%
set up and indeed in our informed
 
02:58:17.030 --> 02:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
consent we have it set up that we
 
02:58:18.950 --> 02:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
reserve the right to say report them to
 
02:58:20.710 --> 02:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
collections but I just want to make sure
 
02:58:21.590 --> 02:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
all the representatives on this
 
02:58:24.150 --> 02:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
committee know that any mental health
 
02:58:26.309 --> 02:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
provider who's really thinking about it
 
02:58:29.030 --> 02:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
and attending ethics conferences and
 
02:58:31.309 --> 02:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
workshops knows that it is folly to
 
02:58:33.790 --> 02:58:33.800 align:start position:0%
report a client to collections because
 
02:58:35.710 --> 02:58:35.720 align:start position:0%
it is not at all uncommon that they
 
02:58:38.630 --> 02:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
would do a spous report of alleged
 
02:58:40.150 --> 02:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
misconduct to the board of mental health
 
02:58:41.710 --> 02:58:41.720 align:start position:0%
just because they're ferious that we're
 
02:58:44.190 --> 02:58:44.200 align:start position:0%
reporting them to collections uh it also
 
02:58:45.750 --> 02:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
it it it flies in the face of our code
 
02:58:47.510 --> 02:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
of ethics to be able to do something
 
02:58:49.670 --> 02:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
like that when we know many of them are
 
02:58:51.229 --> 02:58:51.239 align:start position:0%
not even going to have the money to pay
 
02:58:53.750 --> 02:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
say $1,200 bill that they thought was
 
02:58:55.830 --> 02:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
already covered a year after Services
 
02:58:59.550 --> 02:58:59.560 align:start position:0%
ended so it is just um it's just not an
 
02:59:02.110 --> 02:59:02.120 align:start position:0%
option for us so it leaves the provider
 
02:59:03.830 --> 02:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
really the way it is right now with clax
 
02:59:05.429 --> 02:59:05.439 align:start position:0%
it leaves the provider holding all the
 
02:59:07.150 --> 02:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility all the burden of the
 
02:59:09.790 --> 02:59:09.800 align:start position:0%
time time involved and often out the
 
02:59:12.349 --> 02:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
money for services rendered you know at
 
02:59:14.870 --> 02:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
the time you know so I guess I'll leave
 
02:59:17.190 --> 02:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
it at that and I'm open to any questions
 
02:59:21.309 --> 02:59:21.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:24.990 --> 02:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
have any questions the
 
02:59:26.910 --> 02:59:26.920 align:start position:0%

on hi I'm um Good Good afternoon

chairman hunt and committee members um
 
02:59:46.349 --> 02:59:46.359 align:start position:0%
I'm here to speak in support of
 
02:59:48.670 --> 02:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
472 uh which you're considering in this
 
02:59:50.110 --> 02:59:50.120 align:start position:0%
committee meeting I'm a licensed
 
02:59:52.070 --> 02:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
independent clinical social worker and
 
02:59:53.830 --> 02:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
and I have a small Private Practice in
 
02:59:56.429 --> 02:59:56.439 align:start position:0%
New Market um and I wanted to provide an
 
02:59:58.910 --> 02:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
example of how practices by insurance
 
03:00:01.870 --> 03:00:01.880 align:start position:0%
companies can have impact on small
 
03:00:05.389 --> 03:00:05.399 align:start position:0%
business um when I started this uh
 
03:00:07.309 --> 03:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
practice it had been really important to
 
03:00:09.349 --> 03:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
me to to support our military and I
 
03:00:10.950 --> 03:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
volunteered for years with New Hampshire
 
03:00:12.550 --> 03:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
debart working with National Guard
 
03:00:14.469 --> 03:00:14.479 align:start position:0%
members and their families and when I
 
03:00:15.990 --> 03:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
opened my practice as a solo
 
03:00:17.870 --> 03:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
practitioner I became enrolled in the
 
03:00:20.950 --> 03:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
tri care Tri care insurance uh company
 
03:00:22.550 --> 03:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to provide treatment
 
03:00:25.750 --> 03:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
for veterans and active duty families at
 
03:00:28.429 --> 03:00:28.439 align:start position:0%
the end of 2013 I received a letter from
 
03:00:29.870 --> 03:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
that insurance company that they
 
03:00:31.990 --> 03:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
conducted a retroactive audit of a
 
03:00:33.830 --> 03:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
client's account who I'd stopped seeing
 
03:00:35.990 --> 03:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
over a year and a half ago demanding
 
03:00:39.110 --> 03:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
that I repay close to $1,000 despite the
 
03:00:41.030 --> 03:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
P the fact that I'd submitted claims
 
03:00:43.269 --> 03:00:43.279 align:start position:0%
correctly and had been given regular
 
03:00:44.950 --> 03:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
authoriz I ations from them for
 
03:00:47.030 --> 03:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
treatment based on medical needs and I I
 
03:00:49.870 --> 03:00:49.880 align:start position:0%
sat in at the tail end of one of your uh
 
03:00:51.670 --> 03:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
committee hearings on prior
 
03:00:53.910 --> 03:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
authorizations and in this particular
 
03:00:56.830 --> 03:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
case um they' given prior authorizations
 
03:01:00.550 --> 03:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
for this client every 12 12 weeks for
 
03:01:03.550 --> 03:01:03.560 align:start position:0%
services um when I called the in in the
 
03:01:05.389 --> 03:01:05.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire insurance company at that
 
03:01:07.870 --> 03:01:07.880 align:start position:0%
time I was told that there wasn't any at
 
03:01:09.550 --> 03:01:09.560 align:start position:0%
the time there was no law or rule that
 
03:01:11.950 --> 03:01:11.960 align:start position:0%
regulated how F how far back insurance
 
03:01:14.349 --> 03:01:14.359 align:start position:0%
companies could go I know that since
 
03:01:16.229 --> 03:01:16.239 align:start position:0%
it's since then there have been a couple
 
03:01:18.030 --> 03:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation that have taken it
 
03:01:21.790 --> 03:01:21.800 align:start position:0%
back to 18 months and then to 12 months
 
03:01:24.670 --> 03:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm and I I I still think that that's
 
03:01:27.070 --> 03:01:27.080 align:start position:0%
too long um as a small business owner
 
03:01:29.150 --> 03:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
that represented a sign this represented
 
03:01:31.830 --> 03:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
a really significant payment to me um I
 
03:01:33.510 --> 03:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
sent a letter of appeal as it seemed
 
03:01:35.150 --> 03:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
really unfair that they'd certify
 
03:01:37.630 --> 03:01:37.640 align:start position:0%
eligibility every 12 weeks and then a
 
03:01:39.510 --> 03:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
year and a half after the client's case
 
03:01:42.469 --> 03:01:42.479 align:start position:0%
had closed uh go back and tell me that I
 
03:01:44.150 --> 03:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
owed money from claims that were three
 
03:01:46.790 --> 03:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
years old based on um the information
 
03:01:49.110 --> 03:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
that I'd submitted and the claims were
 
03:01:51.229 --> 03:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
correct they told me the client wasn't
 
03:01:52.990 --> 03:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
eligible for service and they were going
 
03:01:55.309 --> 03:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
to begin recouping um the money from
 
03:01:57.429 --> 03:01:57.439 align:start position:0%
future claims well at that time I
 
03:01:59.830 --> 03:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
stopped taking Tri trie clients and
 
03:02:02.349 --> 03:02:02.359 align:start position:0%
finally in 2015 I was contacted by their
 
03:02:05.309 --> 03:02:05.319 align:start position:0%
legal department and um they offered me
 
03:02:08.150 --> 03:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
to to file a good CLA good Clause waiver
 
03:02:12.790 --> 03:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
good claim good cause waiver um around
 
03:02:14.469 --> 03:02:14.479 align:start position:0%
that um which hadn't been offered to me
 
03:02:16.070 --> 03:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
at the first time when I appealed it
 
03:02:19.429 --> 03:02:19.439 align:start position:0%
they said there was no appeal so um I
 
03:02:22.110 --> 03:02:22.120 align:start position:0%
recognize that this legislation wouldn't
 
03:02:23.990 --> 03:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
apply to Tri care but at the time that
 
03:02:26.349 --> 03:02:26.359 align:start position:0%
this happened I had multiple um
 
03:02:28.670 --> 03:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
practitioners that I met with and in our
 
03:02:31.309 --> 03:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
practice were required to consult 40
 
03:02:35.030 --> 03:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
hours um a year a licensing period with
 
03:02:38.190 --> 03:02:38.200 align:start position:0%
with peers and we meet regularly um and
 
03:02:39.910 --> 03:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
I just in the small group that I met
 
03:02:41.950 --> 03:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
with there were many uh peers who had
 
03:02:44.790 --> 03:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
had similar circumstances with private
 
03:02:47.229 --> 03:02:47.239 align:start position:0%
insurers it doesn't make sense to me
 
03:02:49.429 --> 03:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
that as a a small business owner I have
 
03:02:51.349 --> 03:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
to submit claims from many insurance
 
03:02:53.229 --> 03:02:53.239 align:start position:0%
companies within six months in order to
 
03:02:54.950 --> 03:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
be paid and some even within three
 
03:02:56.830 --> 03:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
months but companies can do a
 
03:02:58.950 --> 03:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
retroactive audit on a client and go
 
03:03:01.590 --> 03:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
back 12 months requiring clinicians to
 
03:03:03.190 --> 03:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
pay money back when the error wasn't the
 
03:03:04.510 --> 03:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
error of the
 
03:03:07.110 --> 03:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
therapist um I know as Sean mentioned
 
03:03:09.110 --> 03:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
researching those claims is really
 
03:03:11.510 --> 03:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
difficult uh particularly for a small
 
03:03:14.070 --> 03:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
business owner solo practitioner
 
03:03:15.750 --> 03:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
um I'd recommend that the insurance
 
03:03:17.630 --> 03:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
companies be held to the same standards
 
03:03:19.590 --> 03:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
that they hold practitioners to in terms
 
03:03:22.309 --> 03:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
of being being able to build for
 
03:03:26.389 --> 03:03:26.399 align:start position:0%
services um so in insurance companies as
 
03:03:28.990 --> 03:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
Sean mentioned have a huge staff um who
 
03:03:32.630 --> 03:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
are regularly review claims um and so if
 
03:03:34.790 --> 03:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
we have to submit those claims or risk
 
03:03:36.710 --> 03:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
non-payment within six or three months
 
03:03:38.630 --> 03:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
insurance company should have to do the
 
03:03:41.830 --> 03:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
same thing um it's not uncommon for
 
03:03:43.429 --> 03:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
clients seeking treat treatment from
 
03:03:44.910 --> 03:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
from my office as other people have
 
03:03:46.950 --> 03:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned to report a three or more
 
03:03:48.790 --> 03:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
month wait for the Community Mental
 
03:03:51.190 --> 03:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
Health Center for services I know that
 
03:03:54.429 --> 03:03:54.439 align:start position:0%
other legislation's been passed to to um
 
03:03:56.269 --> 03:03:56.279 align:start position:0%
has been filed to address the scarcity
 
03:03:57.950 --> 03:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
of mental health practitioners in the
 
03:04:00.030 --> 03:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
state and I know that right now there
 
03:04:01.910 --> 03:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
are clients that I turn away every week
 
03:04:03.870 --> 03:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
I have a small practice and I'm doing
 
03:04:05.990 --> 03:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
primarily teleah health because of the
 
03:04:08.830 --> 03:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh but even still we I'm
 
03:04:10.510 --> 03:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
finding that there are many more people
 
03:04:12.429 --> 03:04:12.439 align:start position:0%
that need the support of mental health
 
03:04:14.309 --> 03:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
treatment at this point
 
03:04:15.990 --> 03:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
this regulation as it's written
 
03:04:17.750 --> 03:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
discourages small business owners from
 
03:04:19.670 --> 03:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
coming into the field and I really urge
 
03:04:21.229 --> 03:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
you to support this bill and I want to
 
03:04:22.590 --> 03:04:22.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your consideration and
 
03:04:24.469 --> 03:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak on
 
03:04:26.309 --> 03:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
it thank

problem so who do you representing here
 
03:05:35.630 --> 03:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
here we go hi there he is okay I uh for
 
03:05:38.950 --> 03:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
the reckon my name is Don fonstein and
 
03:05:41.630 --> 03:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
um I work with Heidi Coral we represent
 
03:05:44.349 --> 03:05:44.359 align:start position:0%
ahip here in New Hampshire
 
03:05:48.990 --> 03:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
I uh vaguely remember this bill um I
 
03:05:51.990 --> 03:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
think it was back in January or February
 
03:05:55.110 --> 03:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic hit last last
 
03:05:55.120 --> 03:05:56.990 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic hit last last
session

03:05:56.990 --> 03:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
session
 
03:06:02.910 --> 03:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
and I you know I I I know actually my uh
 
03:06:06.870 --> 03:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
peer uh Paula Rogers has actually been
 
03:06:09.910 --> 03:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
very involved in the issue as well but
 
03:06:11.590 --> 03:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
my sense really
 
03:06:14.630 --> 03:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
is are we going to
 
03:06:17.830 --> 03:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
continually rewrite the insurance code
 
03:06:20.950 --> 03:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
the statutes to deal with what
 
03:06:26.910 --> 03:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
is admittedly uh a very uh sympathetic
 
03:06:26.920 --> 03:06:27.950 align:start position:0%
is admittedly uh a very uh sympathetic
but

03:06:27.950 --> 03:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:06:31.870 --> 03:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
small um uh component of the of the
 
03:06:35.469 --> 03:06:35.479 align:start position:0%
provider Community which which last year
 
03:06:39.389 --> 03:06:39.399 align:start position:0%
and from when I was able to hear this
 
03:06:42.750 --> 03:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
today um seems to still be the case and
 
03:06:45.750 --> 03:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
and and really that's that's really the
 
03:06:48.349 --> 03:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
only point I wanted to share with the
 
03:06:51.630 --> 03:06:51.640 align:start position:0%
committee and with that I'd be happy to
 
03:06:53.870 --> 03:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
be quiet or answer any questions if
 
03:06:55.990 --> 03:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
someone is so
 
03:06:57.910 --> 03:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
inclined okay
 
03:07:00.830 --> 03:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
great uh representative AEL has a
 
03:07:03.910 --> 03:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
question if you were willing to take
 
03:07:06.309 --> 03:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
one go ahead representative able yes
 
03:07:10.790 --> 03:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for for testifying um what are
 
03:07:13.750 --> 03:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
the uh main reasons
 
03:07:13.760 --> 03:07:14.950 align:start position:0%
the uh main reasons
insurance

03:07:14.950 --> 03:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
03:07:14.960 --> 03:07:16.830 align:start position:0%
insurance
companies

03:07:16.830 --> 03:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
companies
 
03:07:21.630 --> 03:07:21.640 align:start position:0%
uh uh do clawbacks or requests to be
 
03:07:24.229 --> 03:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
reimbursed uh for those of us who aren't
 
03:07:26.710 --> 03:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
in you know aren't in the business uh it
 
03:07:29.750 --> 03:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to know what kinds
 
03:07:34.510 --> 03:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
of uh mistakes uh you find that re that
 
03:07:37.710 --> 03:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
cause this to happen are you able to to
 
03:07:41.550 --> 03:07:41.560 align:start position:0%
uh give us some examples I I uh I'm sure
 
03:07:43.630 --> 03:07:43.640 align:start position:0%
the planers can do a better job
 
03:07:46.349 --> 03:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
but the probably the the the most
 
03:07:46.359 --> 03:07:47.590 align:start position:0%
but the probably the the the most
obvious

03:07:47.590 --> 03:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
obvious
 
03:07:51.870 --> 03:07:51.880 align:start position:0%
one uh to uh understand would simply be
 
03:07:53.469 --> 03:07:53.479 align:start position:0%
when there is no
 
03:07:56.309 --> 03:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
coverage uh if if there's no coverage on
 
03:07:57.630 --> 03:07:57.640 align:start position:0%
the data
 
03:07:57.640 --> 03:07:59.150 align:start position:0%
the data
service

03:07:59.150 --> 03:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
service
 
03:08:02.630 --> 03:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
um then you shouldn't have a
 
03:08:05.990 --> 03:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
situation where you by Statute or
 
03:08:08.190 --> 03:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise are encouraging someone to pay
 
03:08:10.790 --> 03:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
a bill that's not justly
 
03:08:14.030 --> 03:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
owed um
 
03:08:16.830 --> 03:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
with that I guess I I would say that
 
03:08:19.670 --> 03:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
alone would be a reason why you would be
 
03:08:23.630 --> 03:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
cautious um uh before you
 
03:08:27.030 --> 03:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
expand um what has been done um in the
 
03:08:27.040 --> 03:08:28.670 align:start position:0%
expand um what has been done um in the
recent

03:08:28.670 --> 03:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
recent
 
03:08:31.590 --> 03:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
past yeah I would say is I I know that I
 
03:08:33.830 --> 03:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
often get when you have doing claims and
 
03:08:36.429 --> 03:08:36.439 align:start position:0%
stuff um a question to see whether it
 
03:08:37.670 --> 03:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
really should have been covered under
 
03:08:39.750 --> 03:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
workers comp rather than your health
 
03:08:42.349 --> 03:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
insurance that's the one I know of but
 
03:08:45.309 --> 03:08:45.319 align:start position:0%
uh representative Terry has a
 
03:08:48.229 --> 03:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
question sir were you on uh when we uh
 
03:08:51.070 --> 03:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
heard the testimony from Dr
 
03:08:54.070 --> 03:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
Warner uh unfortunately I was not I
 
03:08:56.349 --> 03:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
tried to get on but for some reason it
 
03:08:59.469 --> 03:08:59.479 align:start position:0%
was not allowing me in she related to us
 
03:09:03.550 --> 03:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
an experience where um she claims that
 
03:09:06.550 --> 03:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh clawbacks were oh Excuse excuse me
 
03:09:08.750 --> 03:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative do do you do you mean the
 
03:09:11.550 --> 03:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
doctor or provider that was speaking
 
03:09:13.590 --> 03:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
immediately prior
 
03:09:16.910 --> 03:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I I did I did hear I did hear that
 
03:09:19.229 --> 03:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
she she described a scenario hear what
 
03:09:22.190 --> 03:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
his question is first on thank you Mr
 
03:09:25.110 --> 03:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
chairman uh she indicated that the
 
03:09:27.870 --> 03:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
clawbacks uh went back as far as two
 
03:09:30.110 --> 03:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
years I think she mentioned something in
 
03:09:32.389 --> 03:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
the area of 17 to
 
03:09:34.710 --> 03:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
$20,000 uh she did not provide us with
 
03:09:37.710 --> 03:09:37.720 align:start position:0%
details but was speaking about primarily
 
03:09:41.110 --> 03:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
about the time frame involved uh do do
 
03:09:43.510 --> 03:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
you know why uh
 
03:09:49.229 --> 03:09:49.239 align:start position:0%
clawbacks um should be uh going on two
 
03:09:53.110 --> 03:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:57.030 --> 03:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
Infinity um I I can't tell you I I'm
 
03:10:00.349 --> 03:10:00.359 align:start position:0%
aware of one uh similar to what you
 
03:10:03.110 --> 03:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
described but I I will tell you sometime
 
03:10:05.190 --> 03:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm not suggesting this was the case
 
03:10:08.830 --> 03:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
certainly with with with a provider but
 
03:10:11.550 --> 03:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
um oftentimes insurance fraud is
 
03:10:16.389 --> 03:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
difficult uh uh uh to discover and to be
 
03:10:19.990 --> 03:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
able to prove so certainly that would be
 
03:10:24.550 --> 03:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
one example where you would have uh a a
 
03:10:28.630 --> 03:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
Long Reach back I mean clearly
 
03:10:34.590 --> 03:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
clearly the the the the story that um uh
 
03:10:36.070 --> 03:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
the provider
 
03:10:39.630 --> 03:10:39.640 align:start position:0%
described uh you know at some level
 
03:10:41.990 --> 03:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
starts to shock the conscious
 
03:10:46.510 --> 03:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
consciousness and and uh you know in the
 
03:10:48.950 --> 03:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
absence of fraud or in the a in the
 
03:10:52.229 --> 03:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
absence of some intentional misconduct
 
03:10:55.030 --> 03:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
that doesn't rise to that level then
 
03:10:58.389 --> 03:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
then you should have you should have uh
 
03:11:00.990 --> 03:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
a bar against that long a lookout and I
 
03:11:03.229 --> 03:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
and I think clearly I mean the law right
 
03:11:06.030 --> 03:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
now has been updated so that wouldn't be
 
03:11:08.269 --> 03:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
the case the story she described I think
 
03:11:10.630 --> 03:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
she said would would would not be
 
03:11:14.150 --> 03:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
allowed to happen today
 
03:11:16.349 --> 03:11:16.359 align:start position:0%
further question represent you you muted
 
03:11:18.670 --> 03:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
yourself so I guess
 
03:11:21.150 --> 03:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for a followup so you do
 
03:11:23.790 --> 03:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
believe that some sort of time frame is
 
03:11:26.269 --> 03:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
reasonable I think we've made one that
 
03:11:29.510 --> 03:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
may be reasonable so the answer is yes
 
03:11:31.550 --> 03:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
yeah the current law is a year the aners
 
03:11:33.990 --> 03:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
the ansers is I I personally think
 
03:11:36.670 --> 03:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
current law makes sense but I
 
03:11:39.229 --> 03:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
mean if you ask me if I think three
 
03:11:42.790 --> 03:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
years is is appropriate no I didn't ask
 
03:11:45.309 --> 03:11:45.319 align:start position:0%
ask you if you saw any time frame was
 
03:11:48.349 --> 03:11:48.359 align:start position:0%
reasonable so thank you okay uh
 
03:11:50.309 --> 03:11:50.319 align:start position:0%
representative Bartlett has a question
 
03:11:53.870 --> 03:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
thanks very much um I have to say Mr
 
03:11:59.590 --> 03:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
um um finstein that you're not coming
 
03:12:03.429 --> 03:12:03.439 align:start position:0%
across very sympathetically to me um yes
 
03:12:07.349 --> 03:12:07.359 align:start position:0%
we changed it to 12 months after hearing
 
03:12:10.389 --> 03:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
many of these kinds of cases um in the
 
03:12:11.670 --> 03:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
last couple of
 
03:12:11.680 --> 03:12:14.309 align:start position:0%
last couple of
years

03:12:14.309 --> 03:12:14.319 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:12:16.429 --> 03:12:16.439 align:start position:0%
because I mean do you think that it's
 
03:12:19.030 --> 03:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable for the insurance companies
 
03:12:23.190 --> 03:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
to require providers to bill in in
 
03:12:26.910 --> 03:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
within three months but you think you
 
03:12:28.429 --> 03:12:28.439 align:start position:0%
think that 12 months is still a
 
03:12:30.910 --> 03:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount of time to claw back
 
03:12:35.150 --> 03:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
if you find something wrong yes
 
03:12:38.070 --> 03:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank
 
03:12:41.710 --> 03:12:41.720 align:start position:0%
you all right uh okay is there anyone

chance I could have but they were four
 
04:07:05.349 --> 04:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
pages long but they're supposed to be
 
04:07:08.229 --> 04:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
giving you a total of opposed in
 
04:07:09.790 --> 04:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
supports if you could just give the

totals that would be
 
04:07:14.750 --> 04:07:14.760 align:start position:0%

04:10:16.630 --> 04:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
that uh half the people who were signed
 
04:10:19.189 --> 04:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
up to speak didn't speak which well we
 
04:10:20.510 --> 04:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
ran late though that's hard when
 
04:10:22.550 --> 04:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
somebody has that was that was probably
 
04:10:26.070 --> 04:10:26.080 align:start position:0%

04:10:43.389 --> 04:10:43.399 align:start position:0%
Insurance um those who were testifying
 
04:10:44.750 --> 04:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the insurance companies
 
04:10:47.670 --> 04:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
didn't come across very sympathetically
 
04:10:51.469 --> 04:10:51.479 align:start position:0%
no that was best F fun scene he and I go
 
04:10:54.630 --> 04:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
way back he he actually
 
04:10:57.429 --> 04:10:57.439 align:start position:0%
um how long to go back this
 
04:11:01.510 --> 04:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
is literally back in
 
04:11:04.910 --> 04:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
19 John John just to let you know my
 
04:11:07.229 --> 04:11:07.239 align:start position:0%
screen says we're being recorded yes we
 
04:11:10.389 --> 04:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
are just so that you know oh yes okay
 
04:11:11.950 --> 04:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
Don and I go back in
 
04:11:16.030 --> 04:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
1980 and which in which um Arie Arison
 
04:11:17.830 --> 04:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
was on the committee and she she
 
04:11:19.469 --> 04:11:19.479 align:start position:0%
insisted that when we had the indoor
 
04:11:23.030 --> 04:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
smoking act she insisted to uh Fraser
 
04:11:25.269 --> 04:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
who was the chair that I chair the
 
04:11:29.070 --> 04:11:29.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of that bill and uh and Don
 
04:11:32.349 --> 04:11:32.359 align:start position:0%
uh represented um businesses who are
 
04:11:33.830 --> 04:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
going to be affected by the indoor
 
04:11:37.109 --> 04:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
smoking act and uh so we we I known each
 
04:11:39.510 --> 04:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
other known each other a very long time
 
04:11:42.590 --> 04:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
and uh so so when he got on there I go
 
04:11:44.750 --> 04:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
oh this is not going to be
 
04:11:47.109 --> 04:11:47.119 align:start position:0%
good because you know he's he's filling
 
04:11:48.389 --> 04:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
in with Heidi he's filling in for
 
04:11:50.510 --> 04:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
another Lobby so he's not totally up to
 
04:11:53.149 --> 04:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
speed and right and you know Heidi did a
 
04:11:55.149 --> 04:11:55.159 align:start position:0%
good job I don't necessarily agree with
 
04:11:57.349 --> 04:11:57.359 align:start position:0%
her but I she always she's always
 
04:11:59.429 --> 04:11:59.439 align:start position:0%
prepared yeah she does and it didn't
 
04:12:03.550 --> 04:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
feel like he was Don Don had no business
 
04:12:05.349 --> 04:12:05.359 align:start position:0%
W it at
 
04:12:07.910 --> 04:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
all but you know it's okay so you know
 
04:12:09.990 --> 04:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
like I say Don and I go way back so I of
 
04:12:11.790 --> 04:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
all the respect in the world for him but
 
04:12:13.590 --> 04:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh and he's you know represents his
 
04:12:16.870 --> 04:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
clients well but um there are time when
 
04:12:18.630 --> 04:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
it comes to these Health bills I don't
 
04:12:20.910 --> 04:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
know how anybody any lobbyist can say oh
 
04:12:23.030 --> 04:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
yeah sure I can stand in for you because
 
04:12:26.349 --> 04:12:26.359 align:start position:0%
the nuances and elements of it is just
 
04:12:28.710 --> 04:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
overwhelming sometimes yeah it's really
 
04:12:31.670 --> 04:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
true yeah but even the word and thank
 
04:12:34.389 --> 04:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
goodness we've got Tyler oh yeah and
 
04:12:35.710 --> 04:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
we're very I read some of these things
 
04:12:39.030 --> 04:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
20 times and I think what did it say
 
04:12:40.910 --> 04:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
and fortunately Tyler's you know last
 
04:12:44.149 --> 04:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
one standing he's still around I we yeah
 
04:12:46.030 --> 04:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of change over there at the it
 
04:12:46.040 --> 04:12:46.870 align:start position:0%
a lot of change over there at the it
sure

04:12:46.870 --> 04:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:12:50.950 --> 04:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
has so okay all right so what's looks
 
04:12:54.349 --> 04:12:54.359 align:start position:0%
like time to open up the hearing and um
 
04:12:55.950 --> 04:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
yes this is one of those where I am
 
04:12:57.990 --> 04:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
sponsoring it for the department so I I
 
04:13:00.269 --> 04:13:00.279 align:start position:0%
would ask the department to introduce
 
04:13:01.710 --> 04:13:01.720 align:start position:0%
the bill even though they would really
 
04:13:03.830 --> 04:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
love me to do it but I just assume have
 
04:13:11.229 --> 04:13:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:17.670 --> 04:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:22.950 --> 04:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:28.870 --> 04:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:31.550 --> 04:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
yourself can you hear me now there you
 
04:13:34.550 --> 04:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
go perfect yeah I literally lost you
 
04:13:36.790 --> 04:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
just as you were about to try to get me
 
04:13:39.429 --> 04:13:39.439 align:start position:0%
so that happen
 
04:13:43.510 --> 04:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes so um my name is Heather
 
04:13:45.429 --> 04:13:45.439 align:start position:0%
Silverstein I'm general counsel the for
 
04:13:49.389 --> 04:13:49.399 align:start position:0%
the insurance department uh this bill uh
 
04:13:53.349 --> 04:13:53.359 align:start position:0%
the HB 519 is a technical bill and it's
 
04:13:55.469 --> 04:13:55.479 align:start position:0%
trying to tidy up some of our insurance
 
04:13:58.870 --> 04:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
statutes um Marty had uh Moy our legal
 
04:14:00.590 --> 04:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
coordinator had submitted written
 
04:14:03.389 --> 04:14:03.399 align:start position:0%
testimony I believe yesterday to the to
 
04:14:06.670 --> 04:14:06.680 align:start position:0%
the committee um I can touch on some of
 
04:14:08.389 --> 04:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
the highlight lights if you'd like me to
 
04:14:09.870 --> 04:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
I'm yeah I think you should I think you
 
04:14:12.550 --> 04:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
should go through okay so there's like
 
04:14:14.070 --> 04:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
eight different things and really it is
 
04:14:16.630 --> 04:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
truly technical um there were no
 
04:14:18.469 --> 04:14:18.479 align:start position:0%
surprises to Industry they're supportive
 
04:14:22.830 --> 04:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
of this bill uh the first two regard
 
04:14:25.229 --> 04:14:25.239 align:start position:0%
relate to record retention one inside
 
04:14:28.710 --> 04:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
the department and one for industry the
 
04:14:30.429 --> 04:14:30.439 align:start position:0%
um our record retention has been a
 
04:14:33.389 --> 04:14:33.399 align:start position:0%
really long time it's been like a full
 
04:14:35.750 --> 04:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
six years so we're we decreasing that to
 
04:14:38.870 --> 04:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
a full three years it's long overdue uh
 
04:14:40.510 --> 04:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
some agencies don't even have a record
 
04:14:44.349 --> 04:14:44.359 align:start position:0%
retention statute so uh we're just
 
04:14:47.109 --> 04:14:47.119 align:start position:0%
trying to get up to speed with not
 
04:14:49.109 --> 04:14:49.119 align:start position:0%
having so much paper around and even
 
04:14:52.389 --> 04:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
electronic data and um so that's the
 
04:14:55.710 --> 04:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
first one the second one deals with a um
 
04:14:58.389 --> 04:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
underwriting file for companies and just
 
04:15:00.269 --> 04:15:00.279 align:start position:0%
making sure that they're keeping uh it
 
04:15:01.870 --> 04:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
is required by law for them to keep a
 
04:15:03.750 --> 04:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
declination notice so that's just
 
04:15:05.469 --> 04:15:05.479 align:start position:0%
clarifying that up in the statute
 
04:15:06.750 --> 04:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
there's some confusion The Way It Was
 
04:15:06.760 --> 04:15:08.149 align:start position:0%
there's some confusion The Way It Was
Written

04:15:08.149 --> 04:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
Written
 
04:15:10.950 --> 04:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
um the other statute uh the next one
 
04:15:12.510 --> 04:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
deals with mergers of
 
04:15:16.590 --> 04:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
companies and this was based on an um an
 
04:15:18.990 --> 04:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
Old neic National Association of
 
04:15:21.109 --> 04:15:21.119 align:start position:0%
insurance Commissioners model so our
 
04:15:23.349 --> 04:15:23.359 align:start position:0%
statute was based on an old model that
 
04:15:25.349 --> 04:15:25.359 align:start position:0%
really made no sense as far as the
 
04:15:28.149 --> 04:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
timing goes uh because we don't have
 
04:15:31.990 --> 04:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
control over when the merger is
 
04:15:35.189 --> 04:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
finalized even if we approve it so that
 
04:15:37.469 --> 04:15:37.479 align:start position:0%
date used to be based off that it made
 
04:15:40.750 --> 04:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
no sense so we're just putting in after
 
04:15:42.870 --> 04:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
we have the hearing at the department
 
04:15:44.750 --> 04:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
the commissioner has to decide within 30
 
04:15:48.710 --> 04:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
days so uh and that's getting more up to
 
04:15:50.510 --> 04:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
speed what what other states in New
 
04:15:54.149 --> 04:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
England or have done and have recognized
 
04:15:57.790 --> 04:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a it's a timeline that makes
 
04:16:00.710 --> 04:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
no sense so we're trying to make some
 
04:16:06.309 --> 04:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
sense there um there's another um change
 
04:16:09.109 --> 04:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
in the Dead line for holding companies
 
04:16:12.070 --> 04:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
so right now the statute requires May
 
04:16:15.070 --> 04:16:15.080 align:start position:0%
one again the neic the National
 
04:16:17.269 --> 04:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
Association of insurance Commissioners
 
04:16:19.790 --> 04:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
they don't even look at this information
 
04:16:22.309 --> 04:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
um once the department has received it
 
04:16:25.990 --> 04:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
until like late fall so it's helping our
 
04:16:28.710 --> 04:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
it's helping our lenses and it's helping
 
04:16:31.870 --> 04:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
our staff as well because they have a
 
04:16:35.750 --> 04:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
very busy filing uh season in the spring
 
04:16:37.750 --> 04:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
and to kind of spread that out these
 
04:16:39.389 --> 04:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
filings that have to be submitted by the
 
04:16:42.070 --> 04:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
companies so moving that from May 1 to
 
04:16:44.630 --> 04:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
August one is really helpful for really
 
04:16:51.109 --> 04:16:51.119 align:start position:0%
everybody involved um we we actually um
 
04:16:52.149 --> 04:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
it was
 
04:16:54.830 --> 04:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
particularly uh noticed
 
04:16:57.510 --> 04:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
last last spring during the
 
04:16:59.510 --> 04:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic when there was companies that
 
04:17:01.910 --> 04:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
were having trouble so um that's what
 
04:17:05.510 --> 04:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's doing there was a typo in the in
 
04:17:11.349 --> 04:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
the um PBM law the 402 N5 it referred to
 
04:17:12.990 --> 04:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
the it was supposed to refer to
 
04:17:17.790 --> 04:17:17.800 align:start position:0%
paragraph one instead it referred to um
 
04:17:23.429 --> 04:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
a preceding um 402 N4 it made no sense
 
04:17:26.189 --> 04:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
so again we're fixing a typo in that
 
04:17:28.870 --> 04:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
statute um in the Life settlement
 
04:17:28.880 --> 04:17:30.309 align:start position:0%
statute um in the Life settlement
statute

04:17:30.309 --> 04:17:30.319 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:17:33.510 --> 04:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
408d um we're adding solicits because
 
04:17:35.670 --> 04:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
that's actually what the definition
 
04:17:37.590 --> 04:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
within that same stat statute talks
 
04:17:39.309 --> 04:17:39.319 align:start position:0%
about for life insurance uh life
 
04:17:41.910 --> 04:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
settlement producers they solicit or and
 
04:17:45.070 --> 04:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
negotiate that's in the definitions it's
 
04:17:48.590 --> 04:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
also in our typical our general producer
 
04:17:51.349 --> 04:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
statute U would talk about soliciting or
 
04:17:54.349 --> 04:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
negotiating so we're tidying that up in
 
04:17:56.349 --> 04:17:56.359 align:start position:0%
that particular part of the the statute
 
04:17:56.359 --> 04:17:58.429 align:start position:0%
that particular part of the the statute
408

04:17:58.429 --> 04:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
408
 
04:18:03.590 --> 04:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
d35a and then uh two the last two uh one
 
04:18:06.790 --> 04:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
is just um getting our terms consistent
 
04:18:09.389 --> 04:18:09.399 align:start position:0%
with what's not what industry
 
04:18:12.349 --> 04:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
recognizes and so like changing to life
 
04:18:14.189 --> 04:18:14.199 align:start position:0%
coverage an annuity
 
04:18:16.870 --> 04:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
contract uh so that we're not using
 
04:18:19.710 --> 04:18:19.720 align:start position:0%
terms that are not up toate in our
 
04:18:25.189 --> 04:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
statutes and then the last one is 415 um
 
04:18:28.550 --> 04:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
6n um dealing with the children's early
 
04:18:30.149 --> 04:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
intervention there was supposed to be a
 
04:18:34.269 --> 04:18:34.279 align:start position:0%
reference to the ACA last year I'm I had
 
04:18:36.109 --> 04:18:36.119 align:start position:0%
discussions with Tyler about this he
 
04:18:38.030 --> 04:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
just said it was was inadvertently like
 
04:18:40.149 --> 04:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
left out and so that's what we're doing
 
04:18:42.229 --> 04:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
we're just including the reference that
 
04:18:45.309 --> 04:18:45.319 align:start position:0%
should have been there before so and
 
04:18:45.319 --> 04:18:48.429 align:start position:0%
should have been there before so and
that's

04:18:48.429 --> 04:18:48.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:50.469 --> 04:18:50.479 align:start position:0%

04:21:31.309 --> 04:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
have scheduled like this like tomorrow
 
04:21:34.670 --> 04:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
we're having exact at 1:15 um I I was
 
04:21:36.870 --> 04:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
going to uh take on the bill bills so we
 
04:21:38.429 --> 04:21:38.439 align:start position:0%
heard the first
 
04:21:42.469 --> 04:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
day we can discuss those bills um and
 
04:21:44.030 --> 04:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
and chrisy I'll talk to you touch base
 
04:21:45.790 --> 04:21:45.800 align:start position:0%
with you so that you know where what I'm
 
04:21:47.389 --> 04:21:47.399 align:start position:0%
thinking and then we can you can get
 
04:21:50.469 --> 04:21:50.479 align:start position:0%
back and your people and my people and
 
04:21:53.910 --> 04:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
we can see how we do um but I would
 
04:21:55.469 --> 04:21:55.479 align:start position:0%
emphasize to everyone especially after
 
04:21:57.149 --> 04:21:57.159 align:start position:0%
today any of these bills that are going
 
04:21:59.550 --> 04:21:59.560 align:start position:0%
to need amendments that really need time
 
04:22:01.910 --> 04:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh we're just going to have to retain I
 
04:22:03.710 --> 04:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
just I just don't feel we can do justice
 
04:22:07.030 --> 04:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
to them um without without spending a
 
04:22:08.429 --> 04:22:08.439 align:start position:0%
little time and really working on them
 
04:22:11.830 --> 04:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
and making sure we we get it right um
 
04:22:13.670 --> 04:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
well I think we' um all acknowledged
 
04:22:15.030 --> 04:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
that we've had a couple of surprises
 
04:22:16.550 --> 04:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
things that we thought were going to be
 
04:22:19.109 --> 04:22:19.119 align:start position:0%
simple aren't going to be simple right
 
04:22:20.429 --> 04:22:20.439 align:start position:0%
right and we'll just have to work on
 
04:22:22.550 --> 04:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
them yeah and I just it just seems you
 
04:22:24.229 --> 04:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
know makes sense that you know we'll
 
04:22:25.750 --> 04:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
just put things off till the fall and
 
04:22:27.950 --> 04:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
then we can it'll mean we'll have a
 
04:22:31.469 --> 04:22:31.479 align:start position:0%
busier fall I guess you know but well
 
04:22:34.349 --> 04:22:34.359 align:start position:0%
depends on where we are in the fall
 
04:22:37.309 --> 04:22:37.319 align:start position:0%
this ha to travel
 
04:22:39.070 --> 04:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
some people want Trav right we'll have
 
04:22:41.149 --> 04:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
to figure out to schedule that in but at
 
04:22:42.630 --> 04:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
least we're not at least it's not an
 
04:22:45.710 --> 04:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
election year so we'll be right time to
 
04:22:47.830 --> 04:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
to work on it but I was just gonna say
 
04:22:50.429 --> 04:22:50.439 align:start position:0%
this last bill um that Heather just
 
04:22:53.030 --> 04:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
presented I am so glad I do not have to
 
04:22:57.510 --> 04:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
read through insurance law anymore my
 
04:23:01.469 --> 04:23:01.479 align:start position:0%
gosh that's dry as a bone I have to say
 
04:23:02.950 --> 04:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
really well some it's really some of the
 
04:23:05.229 --> 04:23:05.239 align:start position:0%
oldest statutes too yeah I'm glad
 
04:23:07.189 --> 04:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
they're doing it it needed to be done
 
04:23:09.429 --> 04:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
we've had a number of bills that cleaned
 
04:23:11.990 --> 04:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
up a lot of old language and I think
 
04:23:13.790 --> 04:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
that came from the previous insurance
 
04:23:15.070 --> 04:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner wasn't it the one that was
 
04:23:18.149 --> 04:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
there for a short time John Ellis was
 
04:23:19.590 --> 04:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
one of his
 
04:23:22.590 --> 04:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
um yeah well he we did well we did a lot
 
04:23:24.870 --> 04:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
of lot of re recodification going
 
04:23:27.429 --> 04:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
through the same with banking but I
 
04:23:29.149 --> 04:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
think that there are urged to do that
 
04:23:30.870 --> 04:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
through internal what we call that
 
04:23:33.269 --> 04:23:33.279 align:start position:0%
internal the uh inspector whatever
 
04:23:37.070 --> 04:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
general or that they PR them to
 
04:23:39.510 --> 04:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
yeah get their statutes up to date and
 
04:23:41.229 --> 04:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
more compliance but the insurance
 
04:23:42.830 --> 04:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
department has been as much as you know
 
04:23:45.550 --> 04:23:45.560 align:start position:0%
a problem because they have Nic really
 
04:23:47.149 --> 04:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
govering well any see can help them a
 
04:23:48.990 --> 04:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
lot but you know it at least steer them
 
04:23:51.870 --> 04:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
in the right direction
 
04:23:55.030 --> 04:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
yeah but it's probably not things I
 
04:23:58.670 --> 04:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:01.309 --> 04:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
prodded excuse me Mr chairman can I just
 
04:24:03.469 --> 04:24:03.479 align:start position:0%
do a little bit of business while we're
 
04:24:08.670 --> 04:24:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:10.990 --> 04:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
melier is that the correct pronunciation
 
04:24:12.389 --> 04:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
I hope it
 
04:24:15.790 --> 04:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
isier um Chris you're on mute so yes
 
04:24:18.790 --> 04:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's correct okay Maier could
 
04:24:20.950 --> 04:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
and the reason I had two on is that I
 
04:24:23.349 --> 04:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't getting my picture up there so I
 
04:24:25.429 --> 04:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
put another one on I thought it was my
 
04:24:28.349 --> 04:24:28.359 align:start position:0%
mistake right my question for you is
 
04:24:31.189 --> 04:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
I've noticed that you come in um as an
 
04:24:33.790 --> 04:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
attendee rather than using your personal
 
04:24:36.590 --> 04:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
link and that's why you keep having that
 
04:24:39.149 --> 04:24:39.159 align:start position:0%
problem you come in on the public link
 
04:24:40.429 --> 04:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
04:24:42.830 --> 04:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
your personal one and I'm wondering if
 
04:24:45.550 --> 04:24:45.560 align:start position:0%
you're not getting it I'm sending it to
 
04:24:47.830 --> 04:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
a private email address not your
 
04:24:51.389 --> 04:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
legislative address okay all right
 
04:24:52.630 --> 04:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
you're right I'm putting in my
 
04:24:54.830 --> 04:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
legislative address I'll put in the
 
04:24:57.469 --> 04:24:57.479 align:start position:0%
other address from now on okay I get it
 
04:24:59.109 --> 04:24:59.119 align:start position:0%
would you get that just before an hour
 
04:25:00.790 --> 04:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
to be the meeting you get this that
 
04:25:03.990 --> 04:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
thing from call it what HCS or it is
 
04:25:06.990 --> 04:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
that writing and and you just click on
 
04:25:09.109 --> 04:25:09.119 align:start position:0%
that one that that gets you in as who
 
04:25:11.510 --> 04:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
you are but I can send it to your
 
04:25:13.550 --> 04:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
legislative address if you prefer it's
 
04:25:16.149 --> 04:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
it's all would you please do that I will
 
04:25:18.710 --> 04:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
change the address and then then that we
 
04:25:20.990 --> 04:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
should be it should be much smoother for
 
04:25:23.830 --> 04:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
you every day thank you and Chris you
 
04:25:26.750 --> 04:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
should tell the house clerk's office
 
04:25:28.510 --> 04:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
that you prefer to have your personal
 
04:25:30.830 --> 04:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
address used because it needs to be
 
04:25:33.590 --> 04:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
consistent i' I've asked no I prefer not
 
04:25:35.389 --> 04:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
to have my personal address I prefer to
 
04:25:36.790 --> 04:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
have my leg
 
04:25:39.149 --> 04:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
oh then well then maybe you need to tell
 
04:25:42.189 --> 04:25:42.199 align:start position:0%
them is that what's listed on your on
 
04:25:45.030 --> 04:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
your um when you go into the New
 
04:25:47.389 --> 04:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire general court and you pull up
 
04:25:49.269 --> 04:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
me uh House of Representatives and
 
04:25:51.510 --> 04:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
members what does it show for your
 
04:25:53.229 --> 04:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
address on there I'll I'll I'll have to
 
04:25:55.670 --> 04:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
go check that out okay and just so
 
04:25:57.910 --> 04:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
everybody knows I the original address
 
04:26:00.149 --> 04:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
that I used for all of your accounts was
 
04:26:01.950 --> 04:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
what was posted on the website but then
 
04:26:03.870 --> 04:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
I know some people changed that address
 
04:26:05.550 --> 04:26:05.560 align:start position:0%
and I didn't get change of address
 
04:26:08.750 --> 04:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
notice so so that could be the
 
04:26:10.550 --> 04:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
explanation that that representative
 
04:26:12.630 --> 04:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
Maier at one point had his personal
 
04:26:14.389 --> 04:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
address and and then asked it to be
 
04:26:17.149 --> 04:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
changed but I didn't recheck everybody's
 
04:26:19.429 --> 04:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
addresses right so this is the first
 
04:26:20.910 --> 04:26:20.920 align:start position:0%
time that that's that's happened every
 
04:26:22.630 --> 04:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
other time I've been able to get up up
 
04:26:27.030 --> 04:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
there thank you okay well um it'll be
 
04:26:28.830 --> 04:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
your legislative address from this day
 
04:26:34.830 --> 04:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:37.950 --> 04:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
you yeah I I I never got a legislative
 
04:26:40.229 --> 04:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
address I I just figured one one more
 
04:26:41.630 --> 04:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
email address was going to be a
 
04:26:46.309 --> 04:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
nightmare for me um you know as it is
 
04:26:49.189 --> 04:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
um I have I have a Gmail account which I
 
04:26:51.349 --> 04:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
don't tell anybody except if I have
 
04:26:55.229 --> 04:26:55.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:57.550 --> 04:26:57.560 align:start position:0%
account how about you John how many
 
04:27:02.389 --> 04:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:06.149 --> 04:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
um four four possible yeah possible but
 
04:27:08.990 --> 04:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
I only use Comcast for my regular and my
 
04:27:12.670 --> 04:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
ledge mail for this stuff uh I've
 
04:27:16.070 --> 04:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
already had a a good dis conversation
 
04:27:18.750 --> 04:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
about which mail I can use to get to
 
04:27:21.510 --> 04:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
what emails because in order for me to
 
04:27:25.309 --> 04:27:25.319 align:start position:0%
do this it it comes in on my ledge mail
 
04:27:28.149 --> 04:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
I forward it to my regular email then I
 
04:27:30.670 --> 04:27:30.680 align:start position:0%
go up to Comcast and put it in one my
 
04:27:33.710 --> 04:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
one of my file folders in Xfinity and
 
04:27:36.189 --> 04:27:36.199 align:start position:0%
like that I can use on my on my laptop
 
04:27:36.199 --> 04:27:37.750 align:start position:0%
like that I can use on my on my laptop
toop

04:27:37.750 --> 04:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
toop
 
04:27:40.830 --> 04:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
right so this is not easy for me that
 
04:27:44.990 --> 04:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
seems right labor intensive but also um
 
04:27:47.229 --> 04:27:47.239 align:start position:0%
so now of course I'm a Mac User and not
 
04:27:50.109 --> 04:27:50.119 align:start position:0%
and I haven't really done PC on mail but
 
04:27:51.870 --> 04:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
I assume you pretty much all the
 
04:27:53.950 --> 04:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
features are the same so one of the
 
04:27:56.469 --> 04:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
things that I I I've been doing so I
 
04:27:58.550 --> 04:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
thought I'd pass this along to everybody
 
04:28:00.670 --> 04:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
then when you get uh people's
 
04:28:02.309 --> 04:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
presentation when they their testimony
 
04:28:04.550 --> 04:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
and stuff what happens is when they
 
04:28:06.670 --> 04:28:06.680 align:start position:0%
register to sign up they at the same
 
04:28:09.790 --> 04:28:09.800 align:start position:0%
time can upload their their um their
 
04:28:12.590 --> 04:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
speech when that speech gets sent it
 
04:28:16.189 --> 04:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
immediately gets emailed to your email
 
04:28:19.149 --> 04:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
address so what I was what I have been
 
04:28:21.429 --> 04:28:21.439 align:start position:0%
doing and I'm just passing it on is that
 
04:28:23.750 --> 04:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
I have color code I had color flags on
 
04:28:26.189 --> 04:28:26.199 align:start position:0%
my Mac and I assume PC has color Flags
 
04:28:28.590 --> 04:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
or something like that where so now I've
 
04:28:31.910 --> 04:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
just chose a color and I just and and so
 
04:28:34.070 --> 04:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
I I flag all those so that if I ever
 
04:28:36.389 --> 04:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
need to go back and look for
 
04:28:38.790 --> 04:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
testimonies it would all be in one be
 
04:28:40.469 --> 04:28:40.479 align:start position:0%
one sort rather than trying to stick it
 
04:28:44.389 --> 04:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
in a folder I just use that flag feature
 
04:28:47.590 --> 04:28:47.600 align:start position:0%

discussing organizational things uh and
 
04:30:29.950 --> 04:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
I my question is uh with your
 
04:30:31.750 --> 04:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
legislative mail
 
04:30:35.950 --> 04:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
email uh can you create folders in that
 
04:30:38.750 --> 04:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
in that email because I don't I don't
 
04:30:41.429 --> 04:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
really know how to do that because so so
 
04:30:42.670 --> 04:30:42.680 align:start position:0%
all my
 
04:30:46.790 --> 04:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
Commerce stuff will go into a folder
 
04:30:51.349 --> 04:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
because I that legislative email is 90%
 
04:30:55.149 --> 04:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
junk and it just adds up uh so
 
04:30:57.710 --> 04:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
quickly catch getting junk in your
 
04:31:00.870 --> 04:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
legislative email no it's just it's just
 
04:31:04.269 --> 04:31:04.279 align:start position:0%
so okay are you being sarcastic no I
 
04:31:07.349 --> 04:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
saying I I although I'm so glad I don't
 
04:31:10.269 --> 04:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
do do that that way but I didn't realize
 
04:31:11.950 --> 04:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
they would get junk by that I I was just
 
04:31:14.710 --> 04:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
looking for something that would uh a
 
04:31:17.309 --> 04:31:17.319 align:start position:0%
folder that I could uh are you a Mac it
 
04:31:20.149 --> 04:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
would automatically go into a folder
 
04:31:23.309 --> 04:31:23.319 align:start position:0%
yeah are you a Mac person or a PC person
 
04:31:25.790 --> 04:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
what do you have uh it's it's a p uh I'm
 
04:31:29.750 --> 04:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
a PC person not windows but Firefox
 
04:31:33.469 --> 04:31:33.479 align:start position:0%
right you blocking the junk my huh you
 
04:31:35.550 --> 04:31:35.560 align:start position:0%
can block the junk so that somebody
 
04:31:37.229 --> 04:31:37.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't keep sending
 
04:31:40.070 --> 04:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
it no I just find most of the content is
 
04:31:43.750 --> 04:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
junk so I uh can block the user that's
 
04:31:48.309 --> 04:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
another story you know go it says says
 
04:31:50.030 --> 04:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
you know I had to turn my junk off
 
04:31:51.870 --> 04:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
because I my constituents would show up
 
04:31:54.630 --> 04:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
in the junk file I mean I that I was
 
04:31:57.670 --> 04:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
having I don't know it was I I could I I
 
04:32:01.189 --> 04:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
got rid of it because I mean spam folder
 
04:32:04.349 --> 04:32:04.359 align:start position:0%
we I get email from Ethiopian princes

04:32:08.269 --> 04:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
oh I haven't gotten those right but but
 
04:32:10.389 --> 04:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
is the answer yes that I can actually
 
04:32:13.070 --> 04:32:13.080 align:start position:0%

on

04:36:04.109 --> 04:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:04.119 --> 04:36:09.590 align:start position:0%
 
see

04:36:09.590 --> 04:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:12.789 --> 04:36:12.799 align:start position:0%

no I haven't seen her no I just checked
the

04:36:16.029 --> 04:36:16.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:36:16.039 --> 04:36:18.109 align:start position:0%

04:36:34.080 --> 04:36:37.530 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:36:37.530 --> 04:36:37.540 align:start position:0%

um

04:37:17.109 --> 04:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:19.629 --> 04:37:19.639 align:start position:0%
I I'll I'm sure I'll will find someone
 
04:37:22.029 --> 04:37:22.039 align:start position:0%
who will introduce it for
 
04:37:24.629 --> 04:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
you no problem I'm glad I called so we

right now so she's not going to be able
 
04:37:41.390 --> 04:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
to do it so Christy she was asking if
 
04:37:44.629 --> 04:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
you would be mine introducing or anybody
 
04:37:46.590 --> 04:37:46.600 align:start position:0%
who like we've had for those the new
 
04:37:48.429 --> 04:37:48.439 align:start position:0%
members we've had this pans somewhat
 
04:37:53.109 --> 04:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
issue around um from the past but um
 
04:37:54.551 --> 04:37:54.561 align:start position:0%
anybody anybody
 
04:37:57.189 --> 04:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
feel well informed enough to want to
 
04:38:01.349 --> 04:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:05.551 --> 04:38:05.561 align:start position:0%
it don't all jump at once sure oh I'm
 
04:38:10.230 --> 04:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
glad to do it okay great so we can wait
 
04:38:12.029 --> 04:38:12.039 align:start position:0%
three minutes I guess and see if anybody
 
04:38:12.039 --> 04:38:18.629 align:start position:0%
three minutes I guess and see if anybody
else

04:38:18.629 --> 04:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:18.639 --> 04:38:21.029 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:38:21.029 --> 04:38:21.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:23.070 --> 04:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
so you're a little bit early or you
 
04:38:28.189 --> 04:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
gonna start um little early I guess we
 
04:38:30.109 --> 04:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
can wait I don't know I can't believe I
 
04:38:33.510 --> 04:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
don't care I'm here that department
 
04:38:35.150 --> 04:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
should have only did 15 minutes for the
 
04:38:36.429 --> 04:38:36.439 align:start position:0%
Department bill
 
04:38:38.310 --> 04:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
but I
 
04:38:43.709 --> 04:38:43.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:46.869 --> 04:38:46.879 align:start position:0%
that and now I also
 
04:38:49.910 --> 04:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
have um that Tyler will speak and then
 
04:38:52.390 --> 04:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
Heidi will
 
04:38:56.150 --> 04:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
speak and I see Heidi is here and I
 
04:38:58.869 --> 04:38:58.879 align:start position:0%
assume Tyler Ty Tyler I never turned off
 
04:38:58.879 --> 04:39:02.070 align:start position:0%
assume Tyler Ty Tyler I never turned off
so

04:39:02.070 --> 04:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:05.269 --> 04:39:05.279 align:start position:0%
he's we ever let him leave when there
 
04:39:08.470 --> 04:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
Insurance bills no no he's
 
04:39:10.750 --> 04:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
not I don't know what we do without
 
04:39:13.670 --> 04:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
Tyler all right all right well why don't
 
04:39:16.230 --> 04:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
we just get going here so uh why don't
 
04:39:20.470 --> 04:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
you do the best you can Christine okay
 
04:39:23.310 --> 04:39:23.320 align:start position:0%
um uh for the record I'm representative
 
04:39:25.390 --> 04:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
Christy Bartlett I represent maram
 
04:39:29.670 --> 04:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
County District 19 which is located in
 
04:39:32.949 --> 04:39:32.959 align:start position:0%
the city of conquered um I'm not on this
 
04:39:35.990 --> 04:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
bill but I have worked on this issue for
 
04:39:40.310 --> 04:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
the last couple of terms um pandas which
 
04:39:45.190 --> 04:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
is the acronym for Pediatric AIO Auto
 
04:39:47.868 --> 04:39:47.878 align:start position:0%
autoimmune neuros
 
04:39:50.868 --> 04:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
psychiatric disorders sorry that's why
 
04:39:53.310 --> 04:39:53.320 align:start position:0%
we call it pandas
 
04:39:55.590 --> 04:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
um is a
 
04:39:55.600 --> 04:39:57.990 align:start position:0%
um is a
very

04:39:57.990 --> 04:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:40:01.270 --> 04:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
complicated difficult to diagnose
 
04:40:05.830 --> 04:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
condition and seems to affect
 
04:40:05.840 --> 04:40:07.270 align:start position:0%
condition and seems to affect
young

04:40:07.270 --> 04:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
young
 
04:40:10.590 --> 04:40:10.600 align:start position:0%
teenagers um right up through adulthood
 
04:40:14.110 --> 04:40:14.120 align:start position:0%
and we had lots and lots of testimony by
 
04:40:18.430 --> 04:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
various family members that have had to
 
04:40:21.670 --> 04:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
deal with this um over a period of years
 
04:40:22.628 --> 04:40:22.638 align:start position:0%
with their
 
04:40:27.510 --> 04:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
children so this bill we we actually did
 
04:40:30.470 --> 04:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
Implement a a bill I think it was two
 
04:40:33.830 --> 04:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
years ago that provides some limited
 
04:40:37.990 --> 04:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
coverage for the the pandas um
 
04:40:41.910 --> 04:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
syndrome and this bill uh requires the
 
04:40:44.190 --> 04:40:44.200 align:start position:0%
insurance commissioner to review the
 
04:40:46.190 --> 04:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
implementation of the requirement
 
04:40:48.150 --> 04:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
because and and report back to
 
04:40:50.030 --> 04:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
legislature because there was a sunset
 
04:40:52.590 --> 04:40:52.600 align:start position:0%
clause in there and now I don't remember
 
04:40:54.550 --> 04:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
how many years it was for I think it was
 
04:40:56.830 --> 04:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
for two years but it might have
 
04:40:59.550 --> 04:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
been might have been three years do you
 
04:41:03.628 --> 04:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
recall Connie or Joyce I think too yeah
 
04:41:05.990 --> 04:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
I think so too so we're coming up um
 
04:41:09.670 --> 04:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
onto that two-year limit and what we
 
04:41:11.990 --> 04:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
want to know is whether the insurance
 
04:41:14.708 --> 04:41:14.718 align:start position:0%
companies have been paying for uh well
 
04:41:17.070 --> 04:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
to see what the what
 
04:41:20.708 --> 04:41:20.718 align:start position:0%
the impact has been for covering um
 
04:41:24.150 --> 04:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
treatment for this rare and very very
 
04:41:24.160 --> 04:41:26.190 align:start position:0%
treatment for this rare and very very
expensive

04:41:26.190 --> 04:41:26.200 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
04:41:29.788 --> 04:41:29.798 align:start position:0%
treatment is that enough it's perfect
 
04:41:33.430 --> 04:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
okay so um so Tyler why don't you go
 
04:41:35.430 --> 04:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
ahead and tell us what's been going on
 
04:41:37.550 --> 04:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
in the department over this
 
04:41:40.990 --> 04:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
issue sure so um Tyler Brandon with the
 
04:41:42.910 --> 04:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
insurance department and thanks for that
 
04:41:45.030 --> 04:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
that the nice comments uh happy to be
 
04:41:49.590 --> 04:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
here as helpful as I can um so yes this
 
04:41:51.910 --> 04:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
legislation passed a couple of years ago
 
04:41:54.270 --> 04:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
it's a little unusual for an insurance
 
04:41:56.550 --> 04:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
requirement though just want to say a
 
04:41:59.110 --> 04:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
little about that it's um typically when
 
04:42:00.910 --> 04:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
you get your health insurance it covers
 
04:42:02.350 --> 04:42:02.360 align:start position:0%
a range of
 
04:42:04.990 --> 04:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
services if an insurer decides Ed they
 
04:42:07.510 --> 04:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
were not going to cover services for a
 
04:42:11.030 --> 04:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
particular disease State say diabetes or
 
04:42:13.948 --> 04:42:13.958 align:start position:0%
diabetics that would most likely be
 
04:42:15.788 --> 04:42:15.798 align:start position:0%
considered discriminatory and it would
 
04:42:15.798 --> 04:42:16.510 align:start position:0%
considered discriminatory and it would
be

04:42:16.510 --> 04:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:42:19.910 --> 04:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
prohibited um this one actually does say
 
04:42:21.750 --> 04:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
insurers will cover this particular
 
04:42:24.868 --> 04:42:24.878 align:start position:0%
treatment condition but the reason for
 
04:42:25.868 --> 04:42:25.878 align:start position:0%
that is because there's some
 
04:42:27.590 --> 04:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
disagreement in the medical community
 
04:42:30.430 --> 04:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
about the treatment and the condition so
 
04:42:32.708 --> 04:42:32.718 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a legislative um step
 
04:42:34.750 --> 04:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
forward or step backwards deping you're
 
04:42:36.628 --> 04:42:36.638 align:start position:0%
looking at it in the way that it's
 
04:42:38.390 --> 04:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
specifying coverage for particular
 
04:42:41.788 --> 04:42:41.798 align:start position:0%
disease condition that typically would
 
04:42:43.190 --> 04:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
be considered discriminatory if there
 
04:42:44.550 --> 04:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
was a lot more clarity around the
 
04:42:48.150 --> 04:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
disease condition um that being said New
 
04:42:50.190 --> 04:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has access to our allpay
 
04:42:52.830 --> 04:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
claims database or New Hampshire chis
 
04:42:55.230 --> 04:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
which is a detailed but Anonymous set of
 
04:42:57.070 --> 04:42:57.080 align:start position:0%
data that would normally allow the
 
04:43:00.070 --> 04:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
insurance department to and identify at
 
04:43:02.390 --> 04:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
least anonymously the number of people
 
04:43:04.230 --> 04:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
who had a particular diagnosis a
 
04:43:06.270 --> 04:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
particular condition and then the cost
 
04:43:08.270 --> 04:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
and healthare services associated with
 
04:43:08.280 --> 04:43:09.150 align:start position:0%
and healthare services associated with
that

04:43:09.150 --> 04:43:09.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:43:12.030 --> 04:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
condition this one's a little bit uh
 
04:43:13.470 --> 04:43:13.480 align:start position:0%
less straight forward because the
 
04:43:16.470 --> 04:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
diagnosis code that would be used is
 
04:43:19.788 --> 04:43:19.798 align:start position:0%
d89.89 and it's called it's described as
 
04:43:21.910 --> 04:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
other specified disorders involving the
 
04:43:24.670 --> 04:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
immune mechanism not elsewhere
 
04:43:28.030 --> 04:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
classified so this diagnosis code might
 
04:43:30.910 --> 04:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
be used for other conditions as well so
 
04:43:33.230 --> 04:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
the department the way that we would go
 
04:43:35.430 --> 04:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
to those claims dat be able to identify
 
04:43:37.510 --> 04:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
the people and the treatment and
 
04:43:39.948 --> 04:43:39.958 align:start position:0%
utilization so in order to satisfy the
 
04:43:41.270 --> 04:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
requirements that are in this
 
04:43:43.470 --> 04:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
legislation we'd actually have to
 
04:43:46.150 --> 04:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
specify what we expect the carriers to
 
04:43:47.830 --> 04:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
do in the way they're going to track the
 
04:43:50.628 --> 04:43:50.638 align:start position:0%
patients and report to the department
 
04:43:52.350 --> 04:43:52.360 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of substance in the
 
04:43:54.150 --> 04:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
legislation about what we would be
 
04:43:56.788 --> 04:43:56.798 align:start position:0%
looking for um except perhaps the number
 
04:43:58.750 --> 04:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
of patients and maybe something about
 
04:44:00.948 --> 04:44:00.958 align:start position:0%
the cost and treatment but we would have
 
04:44:02.910 --> 04:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
to tell the carriers to do this
 
04:44:05.510 --> 04:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
prospectively I think most of them based
 
04:44:07.628 --> 04:44:07.638 align:start position:0%
on the feedback I've gotten so far
 
04:44:09.550 --> 04:44:09.560 align:start position:0%
haven't established kind of an effective
 
04:44:11.510 --> 04:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
tracking mechanism because of this this
 
04:44:13.948 --> 04:44:13.958 align:start position:0%
wishy-washiness with a diagnosis code
 
04:44:15.910 --> 04:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
you might be able to look at um a couple
 
04:44:17.910 --> 04:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
of other services that are likely to be
 
04:44:20.150 --> 04:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
provided to these particular patients
 
04:44:21.990 --> 04:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
but you're however you approach it
 
04:44:23.230 --> 04:44:23.240 align:start position:0%
you're gonna end up I think with a lot
 
04:44:25.350 --> 04:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
of false positives so kind of a wider
 
04:44:28.670 --> 04:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
net than what you you really want um
 
04:44:30.310 --> 04:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
ironically perhaps one of the ways the
 
04:44:32.310 --> 04:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
carriers could identify these patients
 
04:44:33.750 --> 04:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
is if there were some sort of prior
 
04:44:36.830 --> 04:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
authorization for treatment but I won't
 
04:44:40.190 --> 04:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:43.470 --> 04:44:43.480 align:start position:0%
authoriz so um so I think maybe uh one
 
04:44:44.750 --> 04:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
of the things that could be considered
 
04:44:46.590 --> 04:44:46.600 align:start position:0%
if the legislation if there's interest
 
04:44:48.948 --> 04:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
in passing the legislation is moving the
 
04:44:51.310 --> 04:44:51.320 align:start position:0%
due date out from this November November
 
04:44:54.510 --> 04:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
1st 2021 to something further in the
 
04:44:56.510 --> 04:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
future so that we could tell the
 
04:44:58.670 --> 04:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
carriers um when the legislation becomes
 
04:45:00.270 --> 04:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
effective this is the kind of
 
04:45:01.868 --> 04:45:01.878 align:start position:0%
information we're going to look for from
 
04:45:04.590 --> 04:45:04.600 align:start position:0%
you um figure how to track it and we
 
04:45:06.110 --> 04:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
could obviously have some back and forth
 
04:45:07.670 --> 04:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not it's it's um going
 
04:45:10.788 --> 04:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
to be an effective way to do it um but
 
04:45:12.030 --> 04:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
uh but yeah that would be essentially
 
04:45:14.230 --> 04:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
the only guidance or suggestion I think
 
04:45:16.350 --> 04:45:16.360 align:start position:0%
I would provide um beyond what we could
 
04:45:18.910 --> 04:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
do internally happy to take any
 
04:45:22.750 --> 04:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
questions you have and uh thank you okay
 
04:45:23.990 --> 04:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions yes
 
04:45:24.000 --> 04:45:24.990 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions yes
representative

04:45:24.990 --> 04:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:45:27.788 --> 04:45:27.798 align:start position:0%
Herbert um I don't know if I understood
 
04:45:30.430 --> 04:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
everything that was just said but did I
 
04:45:33.430 --> 04:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
got the impression that uh Tyler the
 
04:45:35.430 --> 04:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
insurance department uh probably
 
04:45:38.190 --> 04:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind looking into the matter
 
04:45:40.110 --> 04:45:40.120 align:start position:0%
and getting some
 
04:45:43.150 --> 04:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
clarity uh uh and then we can consider
 
04:45:46.310 --> 04:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
legislation I don't I don't know I I
 
04:45:50.830 --> 04:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
heard a cautionary tone to his remarks
 
04:45:53.030 --> 04:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
in that there is this problem in regard
 
04:45:56.948 --> 04:45:56.958 align:start position:0%
to diagnosis I think and uh uh we need
 
04:45:58.990 --> 04:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
more information there
 
04:46:01.030 --> 04:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise they're kind of don't know
 
04:46:02.510 --> 04:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
what they've had what kind of data they
 
04:46:06.470 --> 04:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
want to collect until cleared up so this
 
04:46:07.948 --> 04:46:07.958 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like something we should
 
04:46:13.390 --> 04:46:13.400 align:start position:0%
retain but uh or or you know uh yeah
 
04:46:16.470 --> 04:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
retain or study whatever you want to use
 
04:46:18.150 --> 04:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
and ask the insurance department to get
 
04:46:20.990 --> 04:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
some clarity for
 
04:46:24.628 --> 04:46:24.638 align:start position:0%
us uh is could be a would you believe or
 
04:46:26.230 --> 04:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
you want to
 
04:46:29.390 --> 04:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
resp yeah would you believe you don't
 
04:46:32.470 --> 04:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
want to respond to that okay uh so
 
04:46:37.030 --> 04:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:38.510 --> 04:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
but you're
 
04:46:38.520 --> 04:46:47.430 align:start position:0%
but you're
muted

04:46:47.430 --> 04:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:49.910 --> 04:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
you're okay sorry I was just having a
 
04:46:52.670 --> 04:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
little problem um thank you Mr
 
04:46:55.510 --> 04:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
chairman Tyler do you remember from the
 
04:46:58.750 --> 04:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
original bill when we passed it to allow
 
04:47:02.510 --> 04:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
for coverage for this particular um
 
04:47:05.350 --> 04:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
issue what the the date was that it
 
04:47:07.150 --> 04:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
would expire because I have some
 
04:47:09.548 --> 04:47:09.558 align:start position:0%
concerns that if we push out the date
 
04:47:13.350 --> 04:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
for the reporting we may stop covering
 
04:47:17.070 --> 04:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
this um and I I don't I I
 
04:47:19.190 --> 04:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
remember us putting the bill through but
 
04:47:20.910 --> 04:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
I don't remember when that coverage was
 
04:47:23.030 --> 04:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
going to
 
04:47:25.030 --> 04:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
stop was it
 
04:47:28.628 --> 04:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
2025 I think it's
 
04:47:31.590 --> 04:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
2024 could you check there for uh
 
04:47:34.670 --> 04:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
representative MC Beth is is is on is is
 
04:47:38.110 --> 04:47:38.120 align:start position:0%
here so we'll let her pick it up thank
 
04:47:38.120 --> 04:47:39.430 align:start position:0%
here so we'll let her pick it up thank
you

04:47:39.430 --> 04:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:47:43.270 --> 04:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
Tyler so Bey you're on thank you I'm so
 
04:47:46.350 --> 04:47:46.360 align:start position:0%
sorry hello to my colleagues and I I
 
04:47:50.110 --> 04:47:50.120 align:start position:0%
really apologize for um being late we
 
04:47:53.070 --> 04:47:53.080 align:start position:0%
had on Judiciary we had a unnoticed um
 
04:47:56.788 --> 04:47:56.798 align:start position:0%
executive session so um I was in that um
 
04:47:58.548 --> 04:47:58.558 align:start position:0%
but it was a friendly one there were no
 
04:48:02.670 --> 04:48:02.680 align:start position:0%
objections um this bill this exact
 
04:48:04.910 --> 04:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
language I believe passed
 
04:48:07.390 --> 04:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
last year through the house Commerce
 
04:48:10.430 --> 04:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
Committee um 20 to zero and it's a
 
04:48:13.230 --> 04:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
followup to a bill that we had passed
 
04:48:15.350 --> 04:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
the house both Chambers passed and the
 
04:48:18.590 --> 04:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
governor actually signed it in July of
 
04:48:18.600 --> 04:48:19.788 align:start position:0%
governor actually signed it in July of
uh

04:48:19.788 --> 04:48:19.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:48:23.750 --> 04:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
2019 um so the bill in
 
04:48:28.590 --> 04:48:28.600 align:start position:0%
2019 um required New Hampshire licensed
 
04:48:31.990 --> 04:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
health insurance to cover the the pandis
 
04:48:34.590 --> 04:48:34.600 align:start position:0%
collection of pandis illnesses
 
04:48:38.110 --> 04:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
and um it sunsetted in five years so
 
04:48:39.948 --> 04:48:39.958 align:start position:0%
that would be in
 
04:48:43.788 --> 04:48:43.798 align:start position:0%
2024 I think 20 or 2023 John you you
 
04:48:45.990 --> 04:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
remember this stuff better than me but
 
04:48:49.510 --> 04:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
anyway this bill I'm sorry I can give
 
04:48:51.030 --> 04:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
you the date if you want I just looked
 
04:48:51.040 --> 04:48:52.230 align:start position:0%
you the date if you want I just looked
it

04:48:52.230 --> 04:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:48:57.708 --> 04:48:57.718 align:start position:0%
up July 1 2024 2024 so because of the
 
04:49:01.788 --> 04:49:01.798 align:start position:0%
fiveyear sunset this was um to collect
 
04:49:04.430 --> 04:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
the data on the bill to to determine
 
04:49:06.830 --> 04:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not you know citizens are
 
04:49:08.470 --> 04:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
making claims whether they're being
 
04:49:10.750 --> 04:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
covered you know whether or not this was
 
04:49:14.430 --> 04:49:14.440 align:start position:0%
a beneficial bill um and or a beneficial
 
04:49:18.190 --> 04:49:18.200 align:start position:0%
policy to cover that um in 2024 you know
 
04:49:20.430 --> 04:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
we need to have the information from the
 
04:49:23.270 --> 04:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
insurance um Department as to what
 
04:49:25.390 --> 04:49:25.400 align:start position:0%
claims had been filed and and how it had
 
04:49:29.230 --> 04:49:29.240 align:start position:0%
gone so it's really um it's just a
 
04:49:32.868 --> 04:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
collection of data um from the health
 
04:49:34.590 --> 04:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
insurance but again
 
04:49:37.270 --> 04:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
we need to request the New Hampshire
 
04:49:40.150 --> 04:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Health Insurance to
 
04:49:42.430 --> 04:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
collect and analyze and report back to
 
04:49:45.190 --> 04:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
us prior to that Sunset so I think that
 
04:49:46.948 --> 04:49:46.958 align:start position:0%
the bill says that it would be reported
 
04:49:49.910 --> 04:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
back you know in 2023 or something like
 
04:49:53.230 --> 04:49:53.240 align:start position:0%
that but um I I I just heard a little
 
04:49:57.030 --> 04:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
bit of Tyler's um I wasn't I mean the
 
04:49:57.040 --> 04:49:57.750 align:start position:0%
bit of Tyler's um I wasn't I mean the
the

04:49:57.750 --> 04:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:50:00.670 --> 04:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
bill had was not controversial and I if
 
04:50:02.110 --> 04:50:02.120 align:start position:0%
something's different and it needs to be
 
04:50:03.868 --> 04:50:03.878 align:start position:0%
changed I'd certainly leave that up to
 
04:50:07.150 --> 04:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
to the committee thank
 
04:50:07.160 --> 04:50:08.910 align:start position:0%
to the committee thank
you

04:50:08.910 --> 04:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:50:13.030 --> 04:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh so we got some hands up now it's
 
04:50:16.310 --> 04:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
um I see who who put their hand up first
 
04:50:18.910 --> 04:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
04:50:22.470 --> 04:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:25.708 --> 04:50:25.718 align:start position:0%
Chris there we go okay
 
04:50:30.910 --> 04:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
so sorry nothing go ahead oh um so Mr
 
04:50:33.830 --> 04:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
Brandon so what you are I'm trying to
 
04:50:36.350 --> 04:50:36.360 align:start position:0%
clarify here so you're saying that the
 
04:50:38.430 --> 04:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
insurance companies haven't been able to
 
04:50:41.150 --> 04:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
code this properly to be able to
 
04:50:43.830 --> 04:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
determine at this point anyway determine
 
04:50:47.110 --> 04:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
whether this treatment that the bill
 
04:50:49.948 --> 04:50:49.958 align:start position:0%
covered is actually one being utilized
 
04:50:52.868 --> 04:50:52.878 align:start position:0%
into two being effective is that correct
 
04:50:55.830 --> 04:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh not quite so the diagnosis gets coded
 
04:50:57.868 --> 04:50:57.878 align:start position:0%
by the health care provider and then
 
04:51:00.150 --> 04:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
submitted on the claim and typically the
 
04:51:02.868 --> 04:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
diagnosis used to justify the services
 
04:51:05.110 --> 04:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
being provided the problem is the
 
04:51:06.868 --> 04:51:06.878 align:start position:0%
diagnosis for this condition at least
 
04:51:08.868 --> 04:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
the one that is coded when patients have
 
04:51:10.990 --> 04:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
this condition is a bit of an all other
 
04:51:14.190 --> 04:51:14.200 align:start position:0%
diagnosis code so it could be that
 
04:51:16.030 --> 04:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
diagnosis code used could be used by a
 
04:51:18.948 --> 04:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
health care provider for something else
 
04:51:21.708 --> 04:51:21.718 align:start position:0%
so an company or the insurance
 
04:51:24.110 --> 04:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
department using claims data would
 
04:51:27.070 --> 04:51:27.080 align:start position:0%
identify potentially patients that are
 
04:51:29.948 --> 04:51:29.958 align:start position:0%
not actually um diagnosed with pandis
 
04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
the way uh it's described in the
 
04:51:32.760 --> 04:51:35.350 align:start position:0%
the way uh it's described in the
legislation

04:51:35.350 --> 04:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:51:38.430 --> 04:51:38.440 align:start position:0%
so can I follow up for the question
 
04:51:42.190 --> 04:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
thank you so if the in if the codes
 
04:51:45.030 --> 04:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
aren't giving the insurance companies
 
04:51:47.910 --> 04:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
enough specific
 
04:51:51.270 --> 04:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
information with this bill what would
 
04:51:54.788 --> 04:51:54.798 align:start position:0%
this bill do for us what would we gain
 
04:51:56.830 --> 04:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
from this
 
04:51:59.190 --> 04:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
bill well you would still require the
 
04:52:00.670 --> 04:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
legislation would require the insurance
 
04:52:02.430 --> 04:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
department to produce a report which
 
04:52:05.150 --> 04:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
means we would make you know best effort
 
04:52:06.708 --> 04:52:06.718 align:start position:0%
to work with the carriers to be able to
 
04:52:09.628 --> 04:52:09.638 align:start position:0%
identify these patients and uh and be
 
04:52:11.510 --> 04:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
able to report on them and it sounds
 
04:52:13.590 --> 04:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
like based on your your testimony that
 
04:52:15.070 --> 04:52:15.080 align:start position:0%
you're looking for really high level
 
04:52:16.788 --> 04:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
information just the number of patients
 
04:52:19.230 --> 04:52:19.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not um coverage was provided
 
04:52:21.110 --> 04:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
so I think that's good news I think if
 
04:52:22.548 --> 04:52:22.558 align:start position:0%
you want a lot of detail about the
 
04:52:24.788 --> 04:52:24.798 align:start position:0%
services they receive and the costs then
 
04:52:26.110 --> 04:52:26.120 align:start position:0%
it starts to get a little bit more
 
04:52:28.430 --> 04:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
challenging but regardless the carriers
 
04:52:30.510 --> 04:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
would have to develop a system for
 
04:52:33.230 --> 04:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
tracking those patients which um was my
 
04:52:34.948 --> 04:52:34.958 align:start position:0%
concern with the reporting due date if
 
04:52:36.990 --> 04:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
we are planning to produce a report this
 
04:52:39.030 --> 04:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
November that's not going to allow
 
04:52:41.310 --> 04:52:41.320 align:start position:0%
enough time to effectively work with the
 
04:52:42.510 --> 04:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
carriers to figure out how we're going
 
04:52:44.070 --> 04:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
to track these patients and then produce
 
04:52:46.628 --> 04:52:46.638 align:start position:0%
a report of value to
 
04:52:51.868 --> 04:52:51.878 align:start position:0%
you further question thank you
 
04:52:56.948 --> 04:52:56.958 align:start position:0%
so if the if the S sun sets July 1st of
 
04:52:59.350 --> 04:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
2024 which is approximately three and a
 
04:52:59.360 --> 04:53:00.390 align:start position:0%
2024 which is approximately three and a
half

04:53:00.390 --> 04:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
half
 
04:53:00.400 --> 04:53:02.548 align:start position:0%
half
years

04:53:02.548 --> 04:53:02.558 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:53:07.948 --> 04:53:07.958 align:start position:0%
how two and a half years how are we
 
04:53:12.390 --> 04:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
gonna meet the requirements of the
 
04:53:15.910 --> 04:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
bill and still be able to
 
04:53:18.510 --> 04:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
provide the specialized treatment for
 
04:53:20.310 --> 04:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
this rare
 
04:53:22.270 --> 04:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
condition well the good news is we're
 
04:53:24.590 --> 04:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
still only in 2021 so if you move the
 
04:53:26.670 --> 04:53:26.680 align:start position:0%
reporting due date out of year so
 
04:53:30.470 --> 04:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
November of 20122 you'd have it in time
 
04:53:33.628 --> 04:53:33.638 align:start position:0%
before the session to make it effective
 
04:53:36.110 --> 04:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
and continue the the
 
04:53:40.590 --> 04:53:40.600 align:start position:0%
coverage okay so what we go back to um
 
04:53:42.910 --> 04:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
representative MC Beth so you can think
 
04:53:45.590 --> 04:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
you want to finish your thoughts
 
04:53:49.230 --> 04:53:49.240 align:start position:0%
here thank you Mr chairman um one of the
 
04:53:51.750 --> 04:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
reasons why the early reporting was
 
04:53:54.150 --> 04:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
requested in the bill is because one of
 
04:53:55.750 --> 04:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
the problems that we've seen across the
 
04:53:57.590 --> 04:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
country and here in New Hampshire is
 
04:53:59.750 --> 04:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
that there are different codes for the
 
04:54:03.270 --> 04:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
treatment of this kind of myriad of of
 
04:54:06.628 --> 04:54:06.638 align:start position:0%
of illnesses or chronic disease so um
 
04:54:08.510 --> 04:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
having the uh New Hampshire Department
 
04:54:10.548 --> 04:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
of Insurance kind of watching that and
 
04:54:12.430 --> 04:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
then again they're not the education
 
04:54:14.548 --> 04:54:14.558 align:start position:0%
piece but the pandis network or other
 
04:54:16.390 --> 04:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
providers you know sharing information
 
04:54:18.670 --> 04:54:18.680 align:start position:0%
well this is the code that you use for
 
04:54:21.390 --> 04:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
this so it really is a you know in order
 
04:54:24.708 --> 04:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
to figure out whether or not pandis is
 
04:54:27.230 --> 04:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
being accessed you know for people's
 
04:54:30.070 --> 04:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage um we need that kind
 
04:54:32.150 --> 04:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
of incremental or stepped up you know
 
04:54:34.548 --> 04:54:34.558 align:start position:0%
not a complete analysis every year but
 
04:54:36.948 --> 04:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
some type of report back is like this is
 
04:54:39.150 --> 04:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
how it's being coded for this provider
 
04:54:42.510 --> 04:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
or this insurance company um I mean I
 
04:54:44.548 --> 04:54:44.558 align:start position:0%
know that Paula Rogers testified last
 
04:54:46.788 --> 04:54:46.798 align:start position:0%
year uh Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield
 
04:54:49.310 --> 04:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
they'd already been covering Panda so
 
04:54:51.628 --> 04:54:51.638 align:start position:0%
this wasn't a new requirement for them
 
04:54:53.110 --> 04:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
but one of the reasons they had a hard
 
04:54:55.990 --> 04:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
time telling us how many cases they had
 
04:54:59.548 --> 04:54:59.558 align:start position:0%
is because of the coding issue so um I
 
04:55:03.030 --> 04:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
agree with Tyler that it is a you know
 
04:55:05.070 --> 04:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
we're looking for kind of a high level
 
04:55:07.708 --> 04:55:07.718 align:start position:0%
in the beginning and some information so
 
04:55:10.510 --> 04:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
that then um you know the stakeholders
 
04:55:12.110 --> 04:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
can figure out what they want to do with
 
04:55:14.470 --> 04:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
that and then you know it'll it'll be
 
04:55:16.430 --> 04:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
another report you know the following
 
04:55:19.110 --> 04:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
year thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
04:55:23.990 --> 04:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:26.310 --> 04:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
Herbert you'll get it one of these times
 
04:55:28.670 --> 04:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
all right one of these days yeah um
 
04:55:32.670 --> 04:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman hunt um so I was I
 
04:55:34.070 --> 04:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
was under the Imp impression from
 
04:55:36.310 --> 04:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
earlier remarks that this bill was going
 
04:55:40.670 --> 04:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
to sunset in like a year and but that
 
04:55:44.070 --> 04:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
was not the case and uh and so I was
 
04:55:46.310 --> 04:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
that's when I got off into retention and
 
04:55:48.110 --> 04:55:48.120 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff but I don't
 
04:55:49.430 --> 04:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
understand now that what I'm hearing I
 
04:55:52.350 --> 04:55:52.360 align:start position:0%
don't understand why a bill is necessary
 
04:55:54.190 --> 04:55:54.200 align:start position:0%
in order to have the
 
04:55:58.548 --> 04:55:58.558 align:start position:0%
insurance uh Department uh do do that
 
04:56:00.990 --> 04:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
research uh because the bill is is not
 
04:56:03.708 --> 04:56:03.718 align:start position:0%
going to Sunset for over two years or
 
04:56:05.990 --> 04:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
three years maybe so it's always going
 
04:56:08.390 --> 04:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
to be an effect why are we passing
 
04:56:10.750 --> 04:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
legislation to get a study done I don't
 
04:56:12.708 --> 04:56:12.718 align:start position:0%
I don't quite understand that you want
 
04:56:14.708 --> 04:56:14.718 align:start position:0%
to answer that
 
04:56:14.718 --> 04:56:16.948 align:start position:0%
to answer that
Rebecca

04:56:16.948 --> 04:56:16.958 align:start position:0%
Rebecca
 
04:56:19.628 --> 04:56:19.638 align:start position:0%
Becky I'll defer to you Mr chairman
 
04:56:22.350 --> 04:56:22.360 align:start position:0%
thank you well that's good I mean well
 
04:56:24.470 --> 04:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
because we well I mean I would assume
 
04:56:26.310 --> 04:56:26.320 align:start position:0%
that we have limited resources in our
 
04:56:28.430 --> 04:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
department of insurance and they are not
 
04:56:31.948 --> 04:56:31.958 align:start position:0%
they're not constantly auditing every um
 
04:56:35.350 --> 04:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
coded condition I I mean and so why
 
04:56:37.230 --> 04:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
would they be reporting back to us I
 
04:56:39.190 --> 04:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
mean we need the information reported
 
04:56:42.270 --> 04:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
back at a certain time I mean I I I
 
04:56:44.150 --> 04:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
don't know that we have you know they do
 
04:56:45.868 --> 04:56:45.878 align:start position:0%
that we can ask Tyler but I I don't
 
04:56:47.470 --> 04:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
think we'll get this information unless
 
04:56:49.788 --> 04:56:49.798 align:start position:0%
we ask for it and certainly we won't get
 
04:56:52.750 --> 04:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
it so that we can try to help people be
 
04:56:55.110 --> 04:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
covered in this period of two and a half
 
04:56:57.510 --> 04:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
years before it
 
04:56:59.948 --> 04:56:59.958 align:start position:0%
sunsets do you want to take take tackle
 
04:57:03.310 --> 04:57:03.320 align:start position:0%
that Tyler sure yeah no it's um I I I
 
04:57:04.830 --> 04:57:04.840 align:start position:0%
think it's a good question because we do
 
04:57:07.430 --> 04:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
produce analyses that uh are hopefully
 
04:57:09.030 --> 04:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
insightful about the facts that are
 
04:57:11.230 --> 04:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
related to legislation and we do that
 
04:57:13.868 --> 04:57:13.878 align:start position:0%
within existing resources this is a bit
 
04:57:15.230 --> 04:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
different because we'd have to create a
 
04:57:17.270 --> 04:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
new reporting requirement for the
 
04:57:19.708 --> 04:57:19.718 align:start position:0%
carriers and I think for us to do that
 
04:57:21.548 --> 04:57:21.558 align:start position:0%
it would be very helpful to have uh
 
04:57:23.788 --> 04:57:23.798 align:start position:0%
clear legislative direction that it's
 
04:57:25.510 --> 04:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
important or it's felt important by the
 
04:57:27.390 --> 04:57:27.400 align:start position:0%
legislature for the insurance department
 
04:57:29.590 --> 04:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
to expend resources well both at the
 
04:57:31.030 --> 04:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
department and at the carriers to
 
04:57:32.190 --> 04:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
produce the
 
04:57:32.200 --> 04:57:33.830 align:start position:0%
produce the
information

04:57:33.830 --> 04:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:57:36.510 --> 04:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I I guess um I'm trying to drag my
 
04:57:36.520 --> 04:57:37.750 align:start position:0%
yeah I I guess um I'm trying to drag my
memory

04:57:37.750 --> 04:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
memory
 
04:57:40.350 --> 04:57:40.360 align:start position:0%
um because I feel like we this where we
 
04:57:42.350 --> 04:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
had to build twice and the first time we
 
04:57:45.030 --> 04:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
didn't do anything second time we came
 
04:57:48.390 --> 04:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
back and we had the department to try to
 
04:57:50.310 --> 04:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
tell us what there's a problem tell us
 
04:57:52.310 --> 04:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
what's out there how do we track it
 
04:57:54.350 --> 04:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
because it was clear that different
 
04:57:55.948 --> 04:57:55.958 align:start position:0%
insurance companies were treating it in
 
04:57:57.628 --> 04:57:57.638 align:start position:0%
a different fashion and terms of the
 
04:57:59.830 --> 04:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
diagnosis codes but just each one had
 
04:58:03.230 --> 04:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
their own way of looking at it and my
 
04:58:05.270 --> 04:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
memory the original bill was to mandate
 
04:58:07.910 --> 04:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
some medication that that was that and
 
04:58:09.750 --> 04:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
that was controversial to begin with so
 
04:58:14.190 --> 04:58:14.200 align:start position:0%
then um so I guess that the my best
 
04:58:16.470 --> 04:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
guess the reason why we did what we did
 
04:58:18.430 --> 04:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
was for you the department to come back
 
04:58:21.230 --> 04:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
and say well here's what we know know
 
04:58:24.230 --> 04:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
about whatever world of pandas that
 
04:58:26.830 --> 04:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
exists and whether there's coverages or
 
04:58:29.070 --> 04:58:29.080 align:start position:0%
whether there's issues that still can be
 
04:58:31.390 --> 04:58:31.400 align:start position:0%
up there but but here's what we know so
 
04:58:36.030 --> 04:58:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:38.670 --> 04:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
I don't recall that specific Dialogue on
 
04:58:40.110 --> 04:58:40.120 align:start position:0%
it but it may have taken place with
 
04:58:42.190 --> 04:58:42.200 align:start position:0%
somebody else from the Department okay
 
04:58:44.510 --> 04:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
all right uh representative MC Beth and
 
04:58:46.150 --> 04:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
then on representative
 
04:58:48.350 --> 04:58:48.360 align:start position:0%
Barlett so thank you for jogging my
 
04:58:50.350 --> 04:58:50.360 align:start position:0%
memory too yes the original bill which
 
04:58:52.110 --> 04:58:52.120 align:start position:0%
did one of there was an issue about the
 
04:58:54.110 --> 04:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
plasma there was expensive plasma
 
04:58:57.830 --> 04:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
exchange so it's a Tre a treatment um
 
04:59:01.628 --> 04:59:01.638 align:start position:0%
and um what was happening is that the
 
04:59:03.390 --> 04:59:03.400 align:start position:0%
original bill this passed and that
 
04:59:06.708 --> 04:59:06.718 align:start position:0%
Governor sonunu signed on his desk he
 
04:59:10.910 --> 04:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
supported it um um it required that
 
04:59:12.788 --> 04:59:12.798 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers Health in New
 
04:59:14.548 --> 04:59:14.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that they offer that that that
 
04:59:16.948 --> 04:59:16.958 align:start position:0%
be one of the tools that they allow
 
04:59:18.548 --> 04:59:18.558 align:start position:0%
providers to have I think that was one
 
04:59:20.628 --> 04:59:20.638 align:start position:0%
of the controversies that not that
 
04:59:23.510 --> 04:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
hadn't been authorized as a by all
 
04:59:25.628 --> 04:59:25.638 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers as a treatment for
 
04:59:25.638 --> 04:59:26.390 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers as a treatment for
this

04:59:26.390 --> 04:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:59:29.830 --> 04:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
pandis condition and so I think that was
 
04:59:31.788 --> 04:59:31.798 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons we wanted this track
 
04:59:34.628 --> 04:59:34.638 align:start position:0%
is how many how many pro medical
 
04:59:37.430 --> 04:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
providers are uh recommending that for
 
04:59:39.708 --> 04:59:39.718 align:start position:0%
their you know their their patients and
 
04:59:41.190 --> 04:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
how many people are actually getting it
 
04:59:43.628 --> 04:59:43.638 align:start position:0%
covered I think that was part of it um
 
04:59:46.310 --> 04:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
so that we could and then the code issue
 
04:59:48.590 --> 04:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
there were there were several confusing
 
04:59:52.270 --> 04:59:52.280 align:start position:0%
things about it but thank you great
 
04:59:52.280 --> 04:59:56.310 align:start position:0%
things about it but thank you great
representative

04:59:56.310 --> 04:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:59.110 --> 04:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
bartand uh oh she froze it certainly was
 
05:00:01.788 --> 05:00:01.798 align:start position:0%
could few years of very passionate um
 
05:00:03.788 --> 05:00:03.798 align:start position:0%
testimony from the families but I I
 
05:00:05.590 --> 05:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
think that um representative McBeth has
 
05:00:07.990 --> 05:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
got this right is that some of the
 
05:00:09.830 --> 05:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
carriers were willing to do a less
 
05:00:11.270 --> 05:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
expensive treatment but they weren't
 
05:00:13.350 --> 05:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
willing to do the really expensive
 
05:00:15.788 --> 05:00:15.798 align:start position:0%
treatment and that caused the
 
05:00:18.190 --> 05:00:18.200 align:start position:0%
controversy but the compromise on the
 
05:00:21.070 --> 05:00:21.080 align:start position:0%
bill that passed was that we would have
 
05:00:24.070 --> 05:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
a review of whether this
 
05:00:27.868 --> 05:00:27.878 align:start position:0%
expensive treatment was effective over
 
05:00:33.030 --> 05:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
time so my question to Tyler is if we
 
05:00:38.990 --> 05:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
put this out to say um November of
 
05:00:43.670 --> 05:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
2022 is that more doable do you
 
05:00:46.110 --> 05:00:46.120 align:start position:0%
think yeah that's what I was initially
 
05:00:48.628 --> 05:00:48.638 align:start position:0%
thinking although um the level of detail
 
05:00:51.030 --> 05:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
that you may actually be interested in
 
05:00:52.830 --> 05:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
would make the reporting requirement I
 
05:00:55.030 --> 05:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
think a little more complex assuming you
 
05:00:56.788 --> 05:00:56.798 align:start position:0%
are looking for for whether or not I
 
05:00:58.110 --> 05:00:58.120 align:start position:0%
guess the more expensive treatment is
 
05:01:00.868 --> 05:01:00.878 align:start position:0%
being provided that that level of detail
 
05:01:02.990 --> 05:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
um you don't think that would show
 
05:01:05.470 --> 05:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers because it is it's
 
05:01:09.430 --> 05:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
got to be a a huge line item when I mean
 
05:01:12.150 --> 05:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
we were talking 750,000 to a million
 
05:01:15.310 --> 05:01:15.320 align:start position:0%
dollars at the time that's gonna show up
 
05:01:17.070 --> 05:01:17.080 align:start position:0%
in in somebody's
 
05:01:21.670 --> 05:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
report even if it's miscellanous
 
05:01:23.548 --> 05:01:23.558 align:start position:0%
sure I don't know I thought it was just
 
05:01:26.150 --> 05:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
a handful of cases yeah it was just a
 
05:01:28.548 --> 05:01:28.558 align:start position:0%
handful of cases but it was so expensive
 
05:01:31.948 --> 05:01:31.958 align:start position:0%
and the alternative was in one family
 
05:01:33.948 --> 05:01:33.958 align:start position:0%
the child landed on up in jail because
 
05:01:38.750 --> 05:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:44.948 --> 05:01:44.958 align:start position:0%
symptoms uh well okay um so I do have I
 
05:01:48.868 --> 05:01:48.878 align:start position:0%

it's Heidi you're GNA get the last word
here

05:02:01.750 --> 05:02:01.760 align:start position:0%

Heidi

05:02:04.190 --> 05:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
Heidi
 
05:02:06.628 --> 05:02:06.638 align:start position:0%
there she is all right hope you enjoyed
 
05:02:08.430 --> 05:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
your time at Health and Human Services
 
05:02:11.910 --> 05:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
and H yes I was over in Senate energy
 
05:02:15.750 --> 05:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
energy okay I'm back um happy to be with
 
05:02:18.070 --> 05:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
you um for the record um my name is
 
05:02:20.270 --> 05:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
Heidi craw I work at Gallagher cahan in
 
05:02:22.590 --> 05:02:22.600 align:start position:0%
gartell and I represent um ahip which is
 
05:02:25.190 --> 05:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
America's health insurance plans um the
 
05:02:27.070 --> 05:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
trade Association for the health
 
05:02:30.270 --> 05:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers um so I've been
 
05:02:33.590 --> 05:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
following the discussion here and so
 
05:02:35.948 --> 05:02:35.958 align:start position:0%
here's what I understand the challenge
 
05:02:39.470 --> 05:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
to be and I'll I'll try to um be clear
 
05:02:42.310 --> 05:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
about this uh happy to try to answer
 
05:02:45.390 --> 05:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
questions but from what I understand
 
05:02:49.788 --> 05:02:49.798 align:start position:0%
there is not a specific diagnosis code
 
05:02:54.190 --> 05:02:54.200 align:start position:0%
for pandis so there is a lack of an
 
05:02:57.470 --> 05:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
icd10 code or specific diagnosis from
 
05:02:59.830 --> 05:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
the American Academy of
 
05:03:03.190 --> 05:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics um so
 
05:03:05.628 --> 05:03:05.638 align:start position:0%
that's part of the challenge is that we
 
05:03:08.310 --> 05:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
um we don't have a diagnosis code where
 
05:03:10.868 --> 05:03:10.878 align:start position:0%
we can clearly
 
05:03:17.070 --> 05:03:17.080 align:start position:0%
identify um who the pandis patients are
 
05:03:21.830 --> 05:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
um we know from the past um uh work on
 
05:03:24.150 --> 05:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
this bill that there were um a variety
 
05:03:27.708 --> 05:03:27.718 align:start position:0%
of treatments um I think uh OCD if I
 
05:03:29.990 --> 05:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
remember correctly kind of OCD symptoms
 
05:03:33.310 --> 05:03:33.320 align:start position:0%
were part of um this
 
05:03:36.628 --> 05:03:36.638 align:start position:0%
um uh disease I guess we'd call it and
 
05:03:38.548 --> 05:03:38.558 align:start position:0%
so you know that that was part of
 
05:03:40.270 --> 05:03:40.280 align:start position:0%
treatment sometimes I think the
 
05:03:42.110 --> 05:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
expensive treatment that was being
 
05:03:45.270 --> 05:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
referred to was the
 
05:03:51.390 --> 05:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
IVIG um the problem with that is that um
 
05:03:56.628 --> 05:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
the use of IVIG is uh used in other for
 
05:03:59.270 --> 05:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
other patients as well um it's used for
 
05:04:03.390 --> 05:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
different um uh rheumatoid diseases
 
05:04:08.628 --> 05:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
rtic diseases so um again there's if you
 
05:04:11.548 --> 05:04:11.558 align:start position:0%
depending on how you cast this net you
 
05:04:15.590 --> 05:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
are going to be capturing people who are
 
05:04:20.350 --> 05:04:20.360 align:start position:0%
not pandas patients so
 
05:04:23.310 --> 05:04:23.320 align:start position:0%
um you know we appreciate the
 
05:04:25.350 --> 05:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity potentially to get the date
 
05:04:28.868 --> 05:04:28.878 align:start position:0%
pushed out but I'm not sure that that's
 
05:04:31.708 --> 05:04:31.718 align:start position:0%
going to help us solve problem since
 
05:04:33.628 --> 05:04:33.638 align:start position:0%
it's it's not really
 
05:04:35.948 --> 05:04:35.958 align:start position:0%
the the carriers aren't really um
 
05:04:37.830 --> 05:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
standing in the way of identifying who
 
05:04:39.470 --> 05:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
these people are it's the lack of
 
05:04:42.350 --> 05:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
diagnosis codes um and the lack of a
 
05:04:45.670 --> 05:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
very specific treatment that's received
 
05:04:49.548 --> 05:04:49.558 align:start position:0%
um received only by these by these
 
05:04:53.110 --> 05:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
patients um the other thing I guess I'd
 
05:04:57.190 --> 05:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
mention is um you know I'm wondering if
 
05:04:58.990 --> 05:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
there potentially is another way to get
 
05:05:01.708 --> 05:05:01.718 align:start position:0%
at this um obviously we have the the
 
05:05:05.750 --> 05:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
mandate the coverage mandate um like all
 
05:05:08.470 --> 05:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
coverage mandates uh presumbly the
 
05:05:10.270 --> 05:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
carriers are covering that and I'm
 
05:05:12.750 --> 05:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's um have been any
 
05:05:14.990 --> 05:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
complaints um consumer complaints
 
05:05:16.750 --> 05:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
registered with the New Hampshire
 
05:05:19.590 --> 05:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
insurance department
 
05:05:23.030 --> 05:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
um over lack of coverage or concern
 
05:05:25.750 --> 05:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
because I think we did hear in Prior
 
05:05:28.948 --> 05:05:28.958 align:start position:0%
years testimony on this that um but the
 
05:05:30.590 --> 05:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
people had reached out to the insurance
 
05:05:32.868 --> 05:05:32.878 align:start position:0%
department and so you you know that
 
05:05:36.470 --> 05:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
would be at least one place to look um
 
05:05:38.430 --> 05:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
to see if they've received any
 
05:05:41.910 --> 05:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
complaints since the passage of of the
 
05:05:45.590 --> 05:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
bill um so I I don't really have a good
 
05:05:48.868 --> 05:05:48.878 align:start position:0%
answer for the solution here um I I'm
 
05:05:51.390 --> 05:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
only here to share the problem with you
 
05:05:54.270 --> 05:05:54.280 align:start position:0%
um which is just the the kind of
 
05:05:56.830 --> 05:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
challenges that this bill poses in terms
 
05:05:59.670 --> 05:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
of trying to track folks um to get you
 
05:06:01.510 --> 05:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
the information that you're interested
 
05:06:01.520 --> 05:06:04.910 align:start position:0%
the information that you're interested
in

05:06:04.910 --> 05:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:08.030 --> 05:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
okay any questions of Heidi yes Joyce
 
05:06:09.910 --> 05:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative Weston yes uh
 
05:06:12.350 --> 05:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
thank you heidy for your testimony um
 
05:06:16.430 --> 05:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
how does one get an icd10
 
05:06:19.750 --> 05:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
code I don't know I can try to find out
 
05:06:22.590 --> 05:06:22.600 align:start position:0%
for you but um I'm not sure but that's
 
05:06:24.070 --> 05:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
what I was told that there's a lack of
 
05:06:27.470 --> 05:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
an icd10 code or a specific diagnosis
 
05:06:29.670 --> 05:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
from the American Academy of
 
05:06:33.030 --> 05:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics um which makes tracking
 
05:06:37.548 --> 05:06:37.558 align:start position:0%
pandis difficult if not impossible
 
05:06:40.350 --> 05:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
exactly okay seems it needs to be
 
05:06:42.670 --> 05:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
rectified there well it because there
 
05:06:46.230 --> 05:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
was there's so it it it because it has
 
05:06:47.910 --> 05:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
so many different elements to it in
 
05:06:51.868 --> 05:06:51.878 align:start position:0%
terms of the symptoms that that it get
 
05:06:53.990 --> 05:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
usually gets whatever it's being
 
05:06:55.948 --> 05:06:55.958 align:start position:0%
addressed is usually being dressed for
 
05:06:57.788 --> 05:06:57.798 align:start position:0%
that other those other symptoms rather
 
05:07:01.310 --> 05:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
than defining it as pens right as Tyler
 
05:07:04.990 --> 05:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned there's a non-specific code um
 
05:07:07.670 --> 05:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
called a disorder involving the immune
 
05:07:07.680 --> 05:07:09.590 align:start position:0%
called a disorder involving the immune
mechanism

05:07:09.590 --> 05:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
05:07:12.430 --> 05:07:12.440 align:start position:0%
unspecified right um but of course there
 
05:07:15.590 --> 05:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
are other people who don't have pandas
 
05:07:18.788 --> 05:07:18.798 align:start position:0%
who are also coded that
 
05:07:21.470 --> 05:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
way right right exactly because it's a
 
05:07:25.150 --> 05:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
catch on exactly right uh let's see I
 
05:07:28.750 --> 05:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
have a couple hands up now uh so
 
05:07:28.760 --> 05:07:31.110 align:start position:0%
have a couple hands up now uh so
representative

05:07:31.110 --> 05:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:07:33.070 --> 05:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
Abramson thank thank you Mr chair and
 
05:07:35.708 --> 05:07:35.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I do
 
05:07:37.548 --> 05:07:37.558 align:start position:0%
have a uh question do you know what the
 
05:07:38.868 --> 05:07:38.878 align:start position:0%
cost of
 
05:07:41.190 --> 05:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:07:44.830 --> 05:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
sorry intravenous immune globulin
 
05:07:46.628 --> 05:07:46.638 align:start position:0%
treatment is is it going to vary from
 
05:07:49.510 --> 05:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
Patient to Patient how often I I would
 
05:07:51.430 --> 05:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
have to get back to you um I'm happy to
 
05:07:53.110 --> 05:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
look into that and get back to you I
 
05:07:55.590 --> 05:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to um speak out of hand um I
 
05:07:57.910 --> 05:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
do um as representative Bartlett
 
05:07:59.910 --> 05:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned I do recall that some of these
 
05:08:01.708 --> 05:08:01.718 align:start position:0%
treatments were were pretty expensive
 
05:08:04.110 --> 05:08:04.120 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure that that's always the
 
05:08:07.708 --> 05:08:07.718 align:start position:0%
case for every patient so I can um I can
 
05:08:10.270 --> 05:08:10.280 align:start position:0%
look into that and get back to
 
05:08:13.510 --> 05:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
you so there's not a real protocol in
 
05:08:15.750 --> 05:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
terms of the step system on how to deal
 
05:08:19.510 --> 05:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
with this because um it it really is uh
 
05:08:21.030 --> 05:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
symptom driven you know what are the
 
05:08:23.070 --> 05:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
symptoms that the person's having and
 
05:08:24.470 --> 05:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
that's what they're end up trying to
 
05:08:28.430 --> 05:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
trying to uh cure but uh representative
 
05:08:31.030 --> 05:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
Fargo um yes can everybody hear me this
 
05:08:35.430 --> 05:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
time yes we can thank you Mr chairman um
 
05:08:37.430 --> 05:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
is there a potential to perhaps see if
 
05:08:40.350 --> 05:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
there was an uptick in that particular
 
05:08:45.110 --> 05:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
Uniden U kind of uh blanket code after
 
05:08:46.868 --> 05:08:46.878 align:start position:0%
we passed the legislation that would
 
05:08:49.708 --> 05:08:49.718 align:start position:0%
indicate that there was um an abundance
 
05:08:52.270 --> 05:08:52.280 align:start position:0%
of pandas cases that would be affecting
 
05:08:54.548 --> 05:08:54.558 align:start position:0%
it because I think the original reason
 
05:08:56.868 --> 05:08:56.878 align:start position:0%
we wanted this reporting was to
 
05:08:58.670 --> 05:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
determine whether we wanted to continue
 
05:09:00.510 --> 05:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
to provide the coverage
 
05:09:04.190 --> 05:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
and so just I'm wondering Tyler if you
 
05:09:07.310 --> 05:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
could see whether there was any kind of
 
05:09:09.948 --> 05:09:09.958 align:start position:0%
um a change after we put that
 
05:09:12.670 --> 05:09:12.680 align:start position:0%
legislation through that would indicate
 
05:09:14.708 --> 05:09:14.718 align:start position:0%
some factor for
 
05:09:17.430 --> 05:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
us uh short answer is yes I mean to
 
05:09:20.190 --> 05:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
extent you're just looking for a rate uh
 
05:09:22.830 --> 05:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
build by that diagnosis code so you
 
05:09:24.948 --> 05:09:24.958 align:start position:0%
could um yeah and we could do that with
 
05:09:27.350 --> 05:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
existing resources I think so the
 
05:09:29.070 --> 05:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
existing claims database the department
 
05:09:33.910 --> 05:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
has access to and uh um and Consulting
 
05:09:37.030 --> 05:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
resources so uh representative MC Beth
 
05:09:39.830 --> 05:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
um what I'm thinking now is is that
 
05:09:41.708 --> 05:09:41.718 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe retaining this bill is the
 
05:09:43.948 --> 05:09:43.958 align:start position:0%
right idea but we would want from the
 
05:09:47.030 --> 05:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
insurance department Tyler is uh that by
 
05:09:49.868 --> 05:09:49.878 align:start position:0%
come come next Fall you guys can give us
 
05:09:52.230 --> 05:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
a preliminary report or give tell us
 
05:09:53.868 --> 05:09:53.878 align:start position:0%
where you guys are at with it what do
 
05:09:56.470 --> 05:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
you know what do we've learned you know
 
05:09:58.310 --> 05:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
just give us some tidbits so that you
 
05:10:02.390 --> 05:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
know we can then come September October
 
05:10:04.628 --> 05:10:04.638 align:start position:0%
when we take it review the bill again we
 
05:10:06.350 --> 05:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
can at least see where where we're at
 
05:10:09.230 --> 05:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
right at that time is that possible yes
 
05:10:11.868 --> 05:10:11.878 align:start position:0%
definitely okay you you okay with that
 
05:10:13.910 --> 05:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
megy move yes thank you thank you Mr
 
05:10:15.470 --> 05:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
chairman I would be okay with that thank
 
05:10:18.310 --> 05:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you Tyler all right
 
05:10:20.270 --> 05:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
I think that might be the right solution
 
05:10:25.110 --> 05:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
for now all right uh and I have no one
 
05:10:28.628 --> 05:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
else who wants to speak on this bill um
 
05:10:32.590 --> 05:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
I have oh Shane B oh yes Shane yes go
 
05:10:34.070 --> 05:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
ahead Jane
 
05:10:37.628 --> 05:10:37.638 align:start position:0%
sorry all right um this is my first you
 
05:10:40.830 --> 05:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
know um year on this committee I really
 
05:10:42.670 --> 05:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
haven't heard you know much about you
 
05:10:44.548 --> 05:10:44.558 align:start position:0%
know many of these uh issues but it
 
05:10:46.670 --> 05:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's a pretty
 
05:10:50.310 --> 05:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
invasive uh procedure if it's that
 
05:10:55.110 --> 05:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
costly it um because it sounds like
 
05:10:57.750 --> 05:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
maybe there are many doctors that don't
 
05:11:01.430 --> 05:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
approve of this treatment or am I could
 
05:11:04.788 --> 05:11:04.798 align:start position:0%
somebody sort of explain why it's so
 
05:11:07.230 --> 05:11:07.240 align:start position:0%
expensive uh well again it's that was
 
05:11:09.628 --> 05:11:09.638 align:start position:0%
the medication that that was being that
 
05:11:14.590 --> 05:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
was all right was very expensive but U
 
05:11:16.788 --> 05:11:16.798 align:start position:0%
but again that medication was more of
 
05:11:19.750 --> 05:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
the symptom that particular symptom that
 
05:11:22.590 --> 05:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
it was manifesting itself rather than
 
05:11:24.430 --> 05:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
that you know you you're you're
 
05:11:26.628 --> 05:11:26.638 align:start position:0%
diagnosed to having pens and and this is
 
05:11:29.350 --> 05:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
what we're going to give you all right
 
05:11:32.670 --> 05:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
so so it's it's it's a conundrum did I
 
05:11:34.990 --> 05:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
get that right Christie yeah
 
05:11:37.590 --> 05:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
thanks right I think what um you know
 
05:11:39.708 --> 05:11:39.718 align:start position:0%
somebody coming into this cold doesn't
 
05:11:41.270 --> 05:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
have a clue what the symptom was and
 
05:11:43.708 --> 05:11:43.718 align:start position:0%
it's a it's somebody what they have
 
05:11:46.350 --> 05:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
found out is that it's um from children
 
05:11:48.628 --> 05:11:48.638 align:start position:0%
that have had strep throat and it has
 
05:11:50.708 --> 05:11:50.718 align:start position:0%
some kind it's a neurological disease it
 
05:11:53.390 --> 05:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
affects the brain but it comes out in
 
05:11:56.310 --> 05:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
many different ways um and the
 
05:11:58.510 --> 05:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
treatments are are complicated and this
 
05:12:01.310 --> 05:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
particular treatment um is very
 
05:12:05.150 --> 05:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
expensive but it has shown according to
 
05:12:07.390 --> 05:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
many of those those that testified that
 
05:12:11.910 --> 05:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
were able to afford it that there was
 
05:12:15.070 --> 05:12:15.080 align:start position:0%
some efficacy on it so that's why we
 
05:12:17.750 --> 05:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
worked so hard to get it one I mean one
 
05:12:20.510 --> 05:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
lady lost her house because she spent
 
05:12:23.390 --> 05:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
all of her money for treatment um
 
05:12:25.430 --> 05:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
another one had the money it was a
 
05:12:28.350 --> 05:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
doctor's uh child and it goes on for
 
05:12:30.708 --> 05:12:30.718 align:start position:0%
years I mean it take it took I think in
 
05:12:32.548 --> 05:12:32.558 align:start position:0%
one case it took six or seven years to
 
05:12:36.830 --> 05:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
even diagnose it yeah but many different
 
05:12:38.788 --> 05:12:38.798 align:start position:0%
manifestations of the disease and it's
 
05:12:42.910 --> 05:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
really Insidious so doctors are grasping
 
05:12:44.788 --> 05:12:44.798 align:start position:0%
all right so represent MC Beth I'll let
 
05:12:47.510 --> 05:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
you have the the last word here so I
 
05:12:49.430 --> 05:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
just wanted to agree with everything
 
05:12:51.110 --> 05:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
that was said the immunog globan
 
05:12:53.230 --> 05:12:53.240 align:start position:0%
treatment what it's it's very similar to
 
05:12:54.750 --> 05:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
the treatment they give you if you are
 
05:12:56.948 --> 05:12:56.958 align:start position:0%
being treated for rabies and they have
 
05:12:59.110 --> 05:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
to take plasma from healthy people and
 
05:13:00.990 --> 05:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
they mix it with you know whatever
 
05:13:04.510 --> 05:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
they're doing to fight the rabies and so
 
05:13:08.150 --> 05:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
um it is a patient specific it's based
 
05:13:09.910 --> 05:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
on weight and and how much you know what
 
05:13:12.190 --> 05:13:12.200 align:start position:0%
your exposure is um but so it's not
 
05:13:14.310 --> 05:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
really that strange of a treatment it's
 
05:13:17.150 --> 05:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
just it's expensive I think that a
 
05:13:19.110 --> 05:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
rabies shot you know regimen can be
 
05:13:21.270 --> 05:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
about $10,000 if you do not have
 
05:13:23.150 --> 05:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
insurance so but that's what this
 
05:13:25.430 --> 05:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
immunoglobin is it's taking stuff you
 
05:13:27.350 --> 05:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
know blood product out of somebody else
 
05:13:30.070 --> 05:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
and it's injecting it into you know I
 
05:13:32.390 --> 05:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
mean that is such a scientific
 
05:13:34.150 --> 05:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
explanation but I just wanted you to
 
05:13:35.670 --> 05:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
understand it's not that weird of a
 
05:13:37.830 --> 05:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
concept it's something that we all might
 
05:13:39.708 --> 05:13:39.718 align:start position:0%
you know know somebody that's had that
 
05:13:40.788 --> 05:13:40.798 align:start position:0%
type of
 
05:13:44.150 --> 05:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
treatment fair enough okay so I have H
 
05:13:46.350 --> 05:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
Jennifer Jones uh who's a member of the
 
05:13:48.670 --> 05:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
public who's in support of the bill uh
 
05:13:52.430 --> 05:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
Eric wrathman and is also a member of
 
05:13:55.310 --> 05:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
the public and supports the bill
 
05:14:00.510 --> 05:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
and um and I have then Sabrina Dunlap
 
05:14:03.350 --> 05:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
from the from uh Anthem which is neutral
 
05:14:05.670 --> 05:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
on this legislation and with that we'll
 
05:14:09.548 --> 05:14:09.558 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on House Bill
 
05:14:14.708 --> 05:14:14.718 align:start position:0%
201 and it's 218 so we're gonna go right
 
05:14:18.310 --> 05:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
into another old
 
05:14:21.310 --> 05:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
favorite it's nice seeing you Becky take
 
05:14:25.830 --> 05:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
care all right uh representative Weston
 
05:14:27.910 --> 05:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
you know are you ready
 
05:14:32.510 --> 05:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
to I to revisit this one and this is an
 
05:14:34.310 --> 05:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
old favorite you're absolutely right
 
05:14:37.110 --> 05:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
been going on for about 10 years now I I
 
05:14:38.948 --> 05:14:38.958 align:start position:0%
I think I think I remember this going
 
05:14:40.548 --> 05:14:40.558 align:start position:0%
back when I first got on the committee
 
05:14:42.548 --> 05:14:42.558 align:start position:0%
this issue it's it's always it's always
 
05:14:44.750 --> 05:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
been around but well you you're the one
 
05:14:47.110 --> 05:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
who would know that right so chairman
 
05:14:49.150 --> 05:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
hunt Commerce Committee thank you for
 
05:14:51.948 --> 05:14:51.958 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to introduce this bill
 
05:14:53.628 --> 05:14:53.638 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name is Joyce
 
05:14:56.510 --> 05:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
Weston I represent Grafton 8 which is a
 
05:14:59.190 --> 05:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
towns of Hein holderness and
 
05:15:01.708 --> 05:15:01.718 align:start position:0%
Plymouth uh this deal deals with the
 
05:15:04.628 --> 05:15:04.638 align:start position:0%
problem of surprise billing uh a balance
 
05:15:08.470 --> 05:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
bill after an ambulance ride and a study
 
05:15:11.350 --> 05:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
from brigam Bram and Women's Hospital in
 
05:15:15.310 --> 05:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
Boston found that 71% of ambulance rods
 
05:15:18.670 --> 05:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
are likely to generate a surprise bill
 
05:15:22.430 --> 05:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
with an average cost to the patient of
 
05:15:25.350 --> 05:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
$450 uh ambulances have the highest out
 
05:15:28.788 --> 05:15:28.798 align:start position:0%
of network billing rate of any medical
 
05:15:31.310 --> 05:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
specialty and when you're in need of an
 
05:15:33.670 --> 05:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
amb ambulance you don't necessarily have
 
05:15:36.070 --> 05:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
the capacity to choose whether the
 
05:15:38.750 --> 05:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
ambulance is in or out of your network
 
05:15:40.910 --> 05:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
and you probably have no choice as to
 
05:15:43.590 --> 05:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
whether to accept the ride at all but
 
05:15:46.390 --> 05:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
you could be hit with a substantial bill
 
05:15:49.150 --> 05:15:49.160 align:start position:0%
which creates additional hard hardship
 
05:15:52.548 --> 05:15:52.558 align:start position:0%
both financially and emotionally on top
 
05:15:54.788 --> 05:15:54.798 align:start position:0%
of the injury or
 
05:15:57.990 --> 05:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
illness this bill bans this
 
05:16:00.948 --> 05:16:00.958 align:start position:0%
practice uh in New Hampshire local
 
05:16:03.270 --> 05:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
governments supported by our property
 
05:16:07.190 --> 05:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
taxes provide the majority of ambulance
 
05:16:10.230 --> 05:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
rides um via the fire departments or
 
05:16:12.270 --> 05:16:12.280 align:start position:0%
Standalone rescue
 
05:16:15.150 --> 05:16:15.160 align:start position:0%
squads the cost is a huge burden to our
 
05:16:19.350 --> 05:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
small towns um I live in one of them and
 
05:16:23.110 --> 05:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
our um and our property tax rate hovers
 
05:16:26.670 --> 05:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
around just under $30 on a
 
05:16:28.830 --> 05:16:28.840 align:start position:0%
thousand uh it's a
 
05:16:32.230 --> 05:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
cost um uh this is because the
 
05:16:34.750 --> 05:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates offered by in
 
05:16:37.110 --> 05:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
contract negotiations with insurance
 
05:16:39.510 --> 05:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
providers are woefully
 
05:16:41.750 --> 05:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
inadequate this bill requires the
 
05:16:43.350 --> 05:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers to offer a
 
05:16:45.590 --> 05:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
commercially reasonable payment and I'm
 
05:16:47.708 --> 05:16:47.718 align:start position:0%
sure we'll he hear from Tyler brenon
 
05:16:48.788 --> 05:16:48.798 align:start position:0%
about that
 
05:16:52.788 --> 05:16:52.798 align:start position:0%
wording um if there's a dispute the um
 
05:16:54.310 --> 05:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the New Hampshire
 
05:16:56.830 --> 05:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
insurance department will determine if
 
05:16:58.430 --> 05:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
the fee is
 
05:17:00.868 --> 05:17:00.878 align:start position:0%
appropriate one thing we added to this
 
05:17:02.430 --> 05:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
bill though is that they have to
 
05:17:05.750 --> 05:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
consider the higher costs in rural
 
05:17:08.590 --> 05:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
communities um reimbursement payments
 
05:17:11.628 --> 05:17:11.638 align:start position:0%
aside there's a ma National move against
 
05:17:15.910 --> 05:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
balance billing in December uh 2020
 
05:17:19.830 --> 05:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
Congress passed legislation to ban I
 
05:17:21.868 --> 05:17:21.878 align:start position:0%
have to turn off my phone excuse me to
 
05:17:25.430 --> 05:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
ban surprise um all surprise medical
 
05:17:29.070 --> 05:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
bills with one notable exception and
 
05:17:32.548 --> 05:17:32.558 align:start position:0%
that's ground ambulances in response to
 
05:17:34.628 --> 05:17:34.638 align:start position:0%
this Omission several states are trying
 
05:17:36.750 --> 05:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
to fill the Gap through
 
05:17:39.868 --> 05:17:39.878 align:start position:0%
legislation uh Maryland and Colorado
 
05:17:42.190 --> 05:17:42.200 align:start position:0%
have added ambulances to their surprise
 
05:17:45.070 --> 05:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
billing ban the Department of Insurance
 
05:17:48.708 --> 05:17:48.718 align:start position:0%
in Texas has recommended it New York and
 
05:17:50.948 --> 05:17:50.958 align:start position:0%
Illinois have similar bills to the one
 
05:17:54.430 --> 05:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
that we have here and Colorado insurers
 
05:17:58.150 --> 05:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
are now required to pay ambulances
 
05:18:02.310 --> 05:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
325 per of the Medicare rate
 
05:18:05.948 --> 05:18:05.958 align:start position:0%
Medicare uh does ban balance billing but
 
05:18:09.628 --> 05:18:09.638 align:start position:0%
it has absurdly low reimbursement rates
 
05:18:11.750 --> 05:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
in uh Plymouth it's around
 
05:18:13.670 --> 05:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
13.2% of the
 
05:18:17.070 --> 05:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
cost um they are they do have a program
 
05:18:18.910 --> 05:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
going on right now though which is
 
05:18:22.548 --> 05:18:22.558 align:start position:0%
reviewing its payment rates um under
 
05:18:23.830 --> 05:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
pressure from
 
05:18:27.070 --> 05:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
Congress um but this process is going to
 
05:18:27.080 --> 05:18:28.110 align:start position:0%
Congress um but this process is going to
take

05:18:28.110 --> 05:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
take
 
05:18:31.788 --> 05:18:31.798 align:start position:0%
years um I heard from one fire that it's
 
05:18:33.708 --> 05:18:33.718 align:start position:0%
going to be about five years before we
 
05:18:35.110 --> 05:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
actually get any
 
05:18:38.190 --> 05:18:38.200 align:start position:0%
change in the process of of working on
 
05:18:40.230 --> 05:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
this bill I talked to a lot of
 
05:18:42.670 --> 05:18:42.680 align:start position:0%
interested parties and I'm re very much
 
05:18:45.708 --> 05:18:45.718 align:start position:0%
aware that the ambulance services are
 
05:18:47.830 --> 05:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
underfunded and they're worried about a
 
05:18:50.628 --> 05:18:50.638 align:start position:0%
loss of Revenue I'm sure we'll hear
 
05:18:52.708 --> 05:18:52.718 align:start position:0%
testimony on that
 
05:18:55.590 --> 05:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
today but I also think it's important
 
05:18:58.510 --> 05:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
for you to know that this year because
 
05:19:01.310 --> 05:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
of the difficulty of our session we want
 
05:19:03.310 --> 05:19:03.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to keep this a simple Bill we
 
05:19:05.708 --> 05:19:05.718 align:start position:0%
didn't try to resolve all the problems
 
05:19:08.230 --> 05:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
of how to get
 
05:19:12.590 --> 05:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
reasonably um uh reasonable reinsured in
 
05:19:12.600 --> 05:19:14.310 align:start position:0%
reasonably um uh reasonable reinsured in
insurance

05:19:14.310 --> 05:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
05:19:16.830 --> 05:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so we T decided to really
 
05:19:19.590 --> 05:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
focus on balance billing and then I
 
05:19:21.070 --> 05:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
would like to work with some of the
 
05:19:23.948 --> 05:19:23.958 align:start position:0%
people I've been talking with to come up
 
05:19:26.788 --> 05:19:26.798 align:start position:0%
with a more comprehensive Bill to deal
 
05:19:29.670 --> 05:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
with the other issues in
 
05:19:33.470 --> 05:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
2022 so uh for now um this is about
 
05:19:36.390 --> 05:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
balance billing and uh I'm happy to take
 
05:19:36.400 --> 05:19:38.430 align:start position:0%
balance billing and uh I'm happy to take
some

05:19:38.430 --> 05:19:38.440 align:start position:0%
some
 
05:19:44.230 --> 05:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:48.628 --> 05:19:48.638 align:start position:0%
committee okay seeing none um chair
 
05:19:51.070 --> 05:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
we'll call on Tyler Tyler Brennan and
 
05:19:52.708 --> 05:19:52.718 align:start position:0%
Tyler so why don't you give us the
 
05:19:52.718 --> 05:19:56.070 align:start position:0%
Tyler so why don't you give us the
Department's

05:19:56.070 --> 05:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:58.390 --> 05:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
perspective so Tyler Brandon from the
 
05:20:00.350 --> 05:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire insurance department and
 
05:20:03.310 --> 05:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
we don't have a position on the bill but
 
05:20:04.830 --> 05:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
we would be very supportive of a
 
05:20:06.628 --> 05:20:06.638 align:start position:0%
legislative solution to ambulance
 
05:20:09.030 --> 05:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
balance billing this is seen by the
 
05:20:10.990 --> 05:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
department as a one of our bigger
 
05:20:13.470 --> 05:20:13.480 align:start position:0%
consumer concerns we do receive
 
05:20:15.670 --> 05:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
complaints from consumers who have been
 
05:20:17.788 --> 05:20:17.798 align:start position:0%
balance build by out of network
 
05:20:21.110 --> 05:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
ambulance companies and uh it's a very
 
05:20:23.830 --> 05:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
difficult sort of challenge to solve
 
05:20:26.110 --> 05:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
so luck we'd be very supportive of a
 
05:20:30.390 --> 05:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
legislative solution um the earlier
 
05:20:33.510 --> 05:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
legislation that passed in 2018 dealing
 
05:20:36.510 --> 05:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
with balance billing was specific to
 
05:20:38.230 --> 05:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
four different hospital-based
 
05:20:41.470 --> 05:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
professional providers anesthesiologists
 
05:20:43.750 --> 05:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
Radiologists Pathologists and emergency
 
05:20:46.830 --> 05:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
medicine physicians and the concept
 
05:20:49.350 --> 05:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
wasse if a patient or a member chose an
 
05:20:51.510 --> 05:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
in network Hospital made sure the
 
05:20:54.390 --> 05:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
surgeon was in network went there and
 
05:20:57.548 --> 05:20:57.558 align:start position:0%
received care from an add a network
 
05:20:59.350 --> 05:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist um that would be a
 
05:21:01.190 --> 05:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
surprise bill but the patient did
 
05:21:03.548 --> 05:21:03.558 align:start position:0%
everything they were supposed to so one
 
05:21:05.430 --> 05:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
of the overriding goals with that
 
05:21:07.830 --> 05:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
legislation was to keep the patient out
 
05:21:09.868 --> 05:21:09.878 align:start position:0%
of any dispute they should be protected
 
05:21:10.788 --> 05:21:10.798 align:start position:0%
in these
 
05:21:13.868 --> 05:21:13.878 align:start position:0%
circumstances the model proposed in uh
 
05:21:15.750 --> 05:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
in this legislation is actually very
 
05:21:18.548 --> 05:21:18.558 align:start position:0%
similar so um restrictions on what
 
05:21:20.670 --> 05:21:20.680 align:start position:0%
ambulance companies can bill and
 
05:21:22.948 --> 05:21:22.958 align:start position:0%
similarly an expectation that carriers
 
05:21:25.430 --> 05:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
pay a commercially reasonable amount one
 
05:21:27.110 --> 05:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
of the other goals with that earlier
 
05:21:28.990 --> 05:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
legislation and I will say that
 
05:21:31.270 --> 05:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
legislation followed a study committee
 
05:21:33.590 --> 05:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
that was chaired by Neil Kirk and in my
 
05:21:35.190 --> 05:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
experience at the department which is
 
05:21:37.510 --> 05:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
now close to 15 years I've never seen a
 
05:21:40.150 --> 05:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
study committee work so hard at hearing
 
05:21:41.430 --> 05:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
from all the different interested
 
05:21:43.110 --> 05:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
parties and trying to come up with a
 
05:21:45.110 --> 05:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
solution that really balanced interest
 
05:21:47.868 --> 05:21:47.878 align:start position:0%
as as best as possible I I don't think
 
05:21:49.590 --> 05:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
the legislation would have passed
 
05:21:52.430 --> 05:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
without that time investment and hearing
 
05:21:55.150 --> 05:21:55.160 align:start position:0%
everybody and really crafting a solution
 
05:21:57.270 --> 05:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
that um met the other goal which was to
 
05:21:59.430 --> 05:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
avoid any kind of rate setting by the
 
05:22:01.990 --> 05:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
state and rate setting can happen
 
05:22:03.350 --> 05:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
explicitly you could say they're going
 
05:22:06.708 --> 05:22:06.718 align:start position:0%
to pay 325 of Medicare like it sounds
 
05:22:09.590 --> 05:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
like Chicago has done or it could happen
 
05:22:12.110 --> 05:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
because there's a default that one party
 
05:22:14.990 --> 05:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
is better off under so in other words if
 
05:22:16.990 --> 05:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
uh there's no agreement met between the
 
05:22:20.670 --> 05:22:20.680 align:start position:0%
parties it defaults to Medicare plus 325
 
05:22:22.350 --> 05:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
per or something like that then each
 
05:22:23.510 --> 05:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
part is going to look at where they
 
05:22:25.590 --> 05:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
stand today whether not they're better
 
05:22:27.548 --> 05:22:27.558 align:start position:0%
off under the default and you're going
 
05:22:29.628 --> 05:22:29.638 align:start position:0%
to end up with a default fee schedule in
 
05:22:32.110 --> 05:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
those circumstances so one of the goals
 
05:22:33.788 --> 05:22:33.798 align:start position:0%
that representative Kirk had was let's
 
05:22:35.150 --> 05:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
put language in there around
 
05:22:37.510 --> 05:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
commercially reasonable let's make use
 
05:22:39.270 --> 05:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
of the insurance Department's access to
 
05:22:40.750 --> 05:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
the claims data to see what other
 
05:22:43.230 --> 05:22:43.240 align:start position:0%
providers are paid but let's not tell
 
05:22:46.190 --> 05:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
the carrier or the provider uh enough
 
05:22:47.670 --> 05:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
that a decision about what's
 
05:22:49.670 --> 05:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
commercially reasonable can be e can be
 
05:22:51.788 --> 05:22:51.798 align:start position:0%
made easily so in other words they've
 
05:22:53.868 --> 05:22:53.878 align:start position:0%
got a petition in the department it's a
 
05:22:55.750 --> 05:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
public hearing that basically have to
 
05:22:58.470 --> 05:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
come in and say this was my final offer
 
05:23:00.510 --> 05:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
and the other party wouldn't accept it
 
05:23:02.868 --> 05:23:02.878 align:start position:0%
so generally a pretty uncomfortable
 
05:23:05.708 --> 05:23:05.718 align:start position:0%
process and um the success of of that
 
05:23:07.948 --> 05:23:07.958 align:start position:0%
earlier legislation has been has been
 
05:23:10.030 --> 05:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
very high we haven't received any
 
05:23:11.628 --> 05:23:11.638 align:start position:0%
petitions from providers or from
 
05:23:13.548 --> 05:23:13.558 align:start position:0%
carriers and the number of balance
 
05:23:15.190 --> 05:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
billing complaints the department has
 
05:23:17.350 --> 05:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
received um in this context and in
 
05:23:19.670 --> 05:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
network Hospital provider is very low
 
05:23:21.590 --> 05:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
these days so I think it's been a
 
05:23:24.310 --> 05:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
success on a number of fronts but one of
 
05:23:26.590 --> 05:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
the big differences between ambulance
 
05:23:28.510 --> 05:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
companies and those hospital-based
 
05:23:30.990 --> 05:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
providers is at the time that legisl
 
05:23:33.230 --> 05:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
ation passed most of those providers
 
05:23:35.510 --> 05:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
were in network so you didn't want to
 
05:23:37.590 --> 05:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
create kind of a new Dynamic with the
 
05:23:39.868 --> 05:23:39.878 align:start position:0%
legislation that would encourage either
 
05:23:42.190 --> 05:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
party not to contract the way they had
 
05:23:45.070 --> 05:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
in the past my understanding of today's
 
05:23:46.470 --> 05:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
environment is that many of these
 
05:23:49.350 --> 05:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
ambulance companies are out of network
 
05:23:50.910 --> 05:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
so the likelihood that they would be
 
05:23:53.430 --> 05:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
petitioning the department to resolve a
 
05:23:55.390 --> 05:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
disagreement would be much higher so the
 
05:23:56.990 --> 05:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
department may have to play a much more
 
05:24:00.030 --> 05:24:00.040 align:start position:0%
significant role in in in resolving some
 
05:24:05.590 --> 05:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:08.310 --> 05:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
perfect Jeffrey represent gson you have
 
05:24:09.708 --> 05:24:09.718 align:start position:0%
a question
 
05:24:12.788 --> 05:24:12.798 align:start position:0%
for actually sorry uh thank you actually
 
05:24:14.548 --> 05:24:14.558 align:start position:0%
my question may be for you since you
 
05:24:17.070 --> 05:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
have a a lot more experience as you's
 
05:24:19.030 --> 05:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this bill has been around
 
05:24:24.270 --> 05:24:24.280 align:start position:0%
for eternity uh how has how is this bill
 
05:24:26.830 --> 05:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
compared to previous versions of the
 
05:24:29.548 --> 05:24:29.558 align:start position:0%
bill does this bill plug holes that
 
05:24:33.150 --> 05:24:33.160 align:start position:0%
other bills OB from other bills uh just
 
05:24:35.548 --> 05:24:35.558 align:start position:0%
I guess what makes this bill different
 
05:24:36.990 --> 05:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
from what's happened in the past that we
 
05:24:39.350 --> 05:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
would pass at this time and when it
 
05:24:42.470 --> 05:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
didn't pass in the past yeah well I mean
 
05:24:45.270 --> 05:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
basically um you know that as as Tyler
 
05:24:47.030 --> 05:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned there was another study
 
05:24:49.430 --> 05:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
committee dealing with a balance billing
 
05:24:52.708 --> 05:24:52.718 align:start position:0%
issue and uh that got a resolution so
 
05:24:54.350 --> 05:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
they took that language and lifted it
 
05:24:57.310 --> 05:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
and tried to apply it to the ambulance
 
05:24:59.150 --> 05:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
and as Tyler mentioned what the one
 
05:25:02.230 --> 05:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
downside the problem is is that uh most
 
05:25:04.548 --> 05:25:04.558 align:start position:0%
of these ambulance companies do not have
 
05:25:06.230 --> 05:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
are not in the network with the
 
05:25:08.270 --> 05:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
hospitals with the do with Excuse me
 
05:25:10.190 --> 05:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
with the insurance companies so by
 
05:25:12.510 --> 05:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
because they don't have those contracts
 
05:25:16.548 --> 05:25:16.558 align:start position:0%
um and and and we I do have Chris St was
 
05:25:20.070 --> 05:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
here he he will help you understand the
 
05:25:23.470 --> 05:25:23.480 align:start position:0%
the um ambulance company's point of view
 
05:25:25.628 --> 05:25:25.638 align:start position:0%
and if I may follow up Sir with you
 
05:25:28.110 --> 05:25:28.120 align:start position:0%
there a reason why these ambulances are
 
05:25:30.990 --> 05:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
no longer in network or they never work
 
05:25:32.270 --> 05:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
that was that's the thing they never
 
05:25:32.280 --> 05:25:33.390 align:start position:0%
that was that's the thing they never
were

05:25:33.390 --> 05:25:33.400 align:start position:0%
were
 
05:25:36.030 --> 05:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
okay so okay put your hand down that'd
 
05:25:38.750 --> 05:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
be great so now I'll call on Chris day
 
05:25:41.470 --> 05:25:41.480 align:start position:0%
was to
 
05:25:45.390 --> 05:25:45.400 align:start position:0%
uh offer up his opposition to this
 
05:25:49.030 --> 05:25:49.040 align:start position:0%

service or what in house he's going to
 
05:27:46.030 --> 05:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
give us his testimony what we'll get
 
05:27:48.150 --> 05:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
we'll get we'll get his testimony okay
 
05:27:49.830 --> 05:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I just want to make sure what the
 
05:27:51.990 --> 05:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
question he has to answer he's actually
 
05:27:53.470 --> 05:27:53.480 align:start position:0%
testifying this is not he's not being
 
05:27:55.990 --> 05:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
posed a question at this point okay he's
 
05:27:57.910 --> 05:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
testifying why he's in opposition to
 
05:27:57.920 --> 05:27:58.628 align:start position:0%
testifying why he's in opposition to
this

05:27:58.628 --> 05:27:58.638 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:28:00.990 --> 05:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
bill okay
 
05:28:02.990 --> 05:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
okay I think I'm back there you go that
 
05:28:07.830 --> 05:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
works okay thank you sorry about that
 
05:28:10.990 --> 05:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
folks uh we employ over 200 licensed New
 
05:28:12.750 --> 05:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire EMS providers operating from
 
05:28:14.110 --> 05:28:14.120 align:start position:0%
multiple locations throughout the
 
05:28:16.510 --> 05:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
granite state and transport over 40,000
 
05:28:18.430 --> 05:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
patients annually we share the
 
05:28:20.030 --> 05:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
legislative goal of providing our
 
05:28:21.948 --> 05:28:21.958 align:start position:0%
customers with the necessary information
 
05:28:23.470 --> 05:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
to make informed decisions about their
 
05:28:25.590 --> 05:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
healthc care choices we believe that New
 
05:28:27.628 --> 05:28:27.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house bill 343 is no longer
 
05:28:29.470 --> 05:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
required or in the public interest due
 
05:28:31.270 --> 05:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
to the recent Passage of the federal
 
05:28:34.708 --> 05:28:34.718 align:start position:0%
surprise medical billing act all EMS
 
05:28:36.628 --> 05:28:36.638 align:start position:0%
providers have a legal duty to respond
 
05:28:38.910 --> 05:28:38.920 align:start position:0%
to emergency service request regardless
 
05:28:41.230 --> 05:28:41.240 align:start position:0%
of the patient's ability to pay that
 
05:28:43.548 --> 05:28:43.558 align:start position:0%
Duty applies to Municipal providers like
 
05:28:45.548 --> 05:28:45.558 align:start position:0%
fire departments commercial providers
 
05:28:47.628 --> 05:28:47.638 align:start position:0%
like us as well as volunteer and
 
05:28:50.190 --> 05:28:50.200 align:start position:0%
hospital-based EMS providers New
 
05:28:52.070 --> 05:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire EMS providers generally
 
05:28:54.070 --> 05:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
receive payment only when a patient is
 
05:28:56.470 --> 05:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
transported to a hospital we are not
 
05:29:00.430 --> 05:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for our 27 our 247 readiness
 
05:29:02.430 --> 05:29:02.440 align:start position:0%
our response or even for the care
 
05:29:04.830 --> 05:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
provided to patients at a scene unless
 
05:29:06.990 --> 05:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
we also transport that patient to a
 
05:29:09.788 --> 05:29:09.798 align:start position:0%
hospital nearly one-third of emergency
 
05:29:11.948 --> 05:29:11.958 align:start position:0%
ambulance service responses do not
 
05:29:14.390 --> 05:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
result in a patient transport meaning
 
05:29:17.270 --> 05:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
EMS currently has no ability to pay for
 
05:29:19.548 --> 05:29:19.558 align:start position:0%
those services but still Bears the cost
 
05:29:21.270 --> 05:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
to provide the service
 
05:29:23.350 --> 05:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
247 interestingly enough there's
 
05:29:25.868 --> 05:29:25.878 align:start position:0%
actually a uh piece of legislation in
 
05:29:27.910 --> 05:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
the federal government right now as we
 
05:29:29.910 --> 05:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
speak was which believe was just
 
05:29:31.470 --> 05:29:31.480 align:start position:0%
introduced produced
 
05:29:34.670 --> 05:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday which would be a temporary Gap
 
05:29:37.350 --> 05:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
to that inability to receive service
 
05:29:40.590 --> 05:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
payment for treatment without transport
 
05:29:42.310 --> 05:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
I believe it was a Senate bill that was
 
05:29:44.990 --> 05:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
just introduced um literally
 
05:29:47.270 --> 05:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
yesterday but passage of this bill here
 
05:29:49.350 --> 05:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as written would
 
05:29:51.548 --> 05:29:51.558 align:start position:0%
essentially force all New Hampshire EMS
 
05:29:53.470 --> 05:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
providers to immediately become in
 
05:29:55.310 --> 05:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
network with all commercial insurance
 
05:29:57.670 --> 05:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
carriers without what we believe any
 
05:29:59.470 --> 05:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
factual justification of what a
 
05:30:01.750 --> 05:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
commercially reasonable value for the
 
05:30:05.030 --> 05:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
services they individually provide is
 
05:30:06.788 --> 05:30:06.798 align:start position:0%
this would have an immediate and likely
 
05:30:09.070 --> 05:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
devastating impact on numerous Municipal
 
05:30:11.430 --> 05:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
budgets across the state as the badly
 
05:30:12.830 --> 05:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
needed Revenue that so many New
 
05:30:14.590 --> 05:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cities and towns depend upon
 
05:30:16.830 --> 05:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
to fund their local EMS systems would
 
05:30:19.628 --> 05:30:19.638 align:start position:0%
suddenly drop the centers for Medicare
 
05:30:22.230 --> 05:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
and Medicaid services CMS recently
 
05:30:24.390 --> 05:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
instituted a national mandatory cost
 
05:30:26.868 --> 05:30:26.878 align:start position:0%
study for all ground EMS providers
 
05:30:28.910 --> 05:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
beginning this year with 20% of all the
 
05:30:30.708 --> 05:30:30.718 align:start position:0%
ambulance service providers years
 
05:30:32.628 --> 05:30:32.638 align:start position:0%
enrolled annually in the study for each
 
05:30:35.470 --> 05:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
year next five years we would suggest
 
05:30:37.350 --> 05:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
that in the absence of meaningful cost
 
05:30:39.270 --> 05:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
data that is impossible to determine
 
05:30:41.510 --> 05:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
what a commercially reasonable value for
 
05:30:43.510 --> 05:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
service truly is given the complex
 
05:30:45.868 --> 05:30:45.878 align:start position:0%
nature of New Hampshire's EMS provider
 
05:30:48.628 --> 05:30:48.638 align:start position:0%
demographics the cost of 247 Readiness
 
05:30:50.510 --> 05:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
for an ambulance provider in Berlin for
 
05:30:52.230 --> 05:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
instance varies significantly what the
 
05:30:54.590 --> 05:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
cost of Readiness would be for an
 
05:30:56.390 --> 05:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
ambulance service in conquer or
 
05:31:00.390 --> 05:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
Portsmith or Kean while House Bill 343
 
05:31:01.910 --> 05:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
makes excellent attempts to find
 
05:31:03.590 --> 05:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
Solutions and I think we all agree that
 
05:31:04.948 --> 05:31:04.958 align:start position:0%
patients should be held harmless
 
05:31:06.990 --> 05:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
whenever possible the United States
 
05:31:08.390 --> 05:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
Congress recently passed and the
 
05:31:10.190 --> 05:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
president signed Federal surprise
 
05:31:12.548 --> 05:31:12.558 align:start position:0%
medical billing act that we believe
 
05:31:14.430 --> 05:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
potentially usurps New Hampshire house
 
05:31:14.440 --> 05:31:15.708 align:start position:0%
potentially usurps New Hampshire house
bill

05:31:15.708 --> 05:31:15.718 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:31:18.750 --> 05:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
343 the new federal SMB Law requires
 
05:31:20.350 --> 05:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
among other things the creation of a
 
05:31:23.310 --> 05:31:23.320 align:start position:0%
National Ground EMS Advisory Group that
 
05:31:25.110 --> 05:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
group is charged with determining the
 
05:31:27.948 --> 05:31:27.958 align:start position:0%
safest and fairest possible path for
 
05:31:29.910 --> 05:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
Equitable payments to ground Ambulance
 
05:31:34.230 --> 05:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:36.470 --> 05:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
Nationwide the advisory committee is
 
05:31:38.350 --> 05:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
required to report solutions back to
 
05:31:40.910 --> 05:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
Congress within the next six months we
 
05:31:42.190 --> 05:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
believe that it would be better for
 
05:31:43.750 --> 05:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
patients if the state of New Hampshire
 
05:31:46.150 --> 05:31:46.160 align:start position:0%
did not place duplicative or burdensome
 
05:31:48.868 --> 05:31:48.878 align:start position:0%
regulations on its EMS providers these
 
05:31:50.670 --> 05:31:50.680 align:start position:0%
additional State compliance costs will
 
05:31:52.270 --> 05:31:52.280 align:start position:0%
inevitably have to be passed on to
 
05:31:54.110 --> 05:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire and May in the
 
05:31:56.190 --> 05:31:56.200 align:start position:0%
end conflict with the newly passed
 
05:31:59.390 --> 05:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
Federal SMB law even more pressing is
 
05:32:01.190 --> 05:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
yet another National Emergency
 
05:32:03.470 --> 05:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
stretching EMS to its limits especially
 
05:32:04.708 --> 05:32:04.718 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire which
 
05:32:06.390 --> 05:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
continues to struggle with an ongoing
 
05:32:09.310 --> 05:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
opioid epidemic as well as a worldwide
 
05:32:11.510 --> 05:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic ambulance services are a
 
05:32:12.990 --> 05:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
critical part of the front line of
 
05:32:15.868 --> 05:32:15.878 align:start position:0%
defense for the covid-19 pandemic as a
 
05:32:17.910 --> 05:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
profession our expenses have climbed
 
05:32:19.910 --> 05:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
significantly due to increased PPE
 
05:32:21.948 --> 05:32:21.958 align:start position:0%
requirements paying employees through
 
05:32:23.830 --> 05:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
required quarantine time as well as
 
05:32:26.430 --> 05:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
their own illness times our revenues
 
05:32:28.070 --> 05:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
have dropped dramatically due to lower
 
05:32:29.990 --> 05:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
call transport volume as people restrict
 
05:32:31.310 --> 05:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
restrict their movements And Delay
 
05:32:33.910 --> 05:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
seeking care adding additional State
 
05:32:35.990 --> 05:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
Legislative requirements now potentially
 
05:32:38.350 --> 05:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
puts the continued viability of many EMS
 
05:32:40.350 --> 05:32:40.360 align:start position:0%
providers throughout the state at risk
 
05:32:42.310 --> 05:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
during a time when we can least afford
 
05:32:45.030 --> 05:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
to do so so we respectfully ask that in
 
05:32:46.708 --> 05:32:46.718 align:start position:0%
the public interest you find this bill
 
05:32:48.750 --> 05:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate and allow the
 
05:32:52.150 --> 05:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
new federal SMB law to address the issue
 
05:32:53.430 --> 05:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
I thank you for your time and I'm more
 
05:32:55.350 --> 05:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
than happy to answer any questions that
 
05:32:57.548 --> 05:32:57.558 align:start position:0%
any members of the committee may have
 
05:32:59.190 --> 05:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
great because we do have a couple uh
 
05:33:01.830 --> 05:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
representative AB you're first thank you
 
05:33:03.470 --> 05:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:33:06.750 --> 05:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
question um do you have uh services that
 
05:33:09.310 --> 05:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
go across uh state lines transporting we
 
05:33:11.470 --> 05:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
have a lot of people live in seab Brook
 
05:33:13.310 --> 05:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
and uh a lot of people get transported
 
05:33:16.390 --> 05:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
down to Anna Jake in
 
05:33:19.110 --> 05:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that uh service area I
 
05:33:21.070 --> 05:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
believe in in those cases would be the
 
05:33:22.390 --> 05:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
Seabrook fire department that would
 
05:33:24.830 --> 05:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
handle those but I mean does does your
 
05:33:27.628 --> 05:33:27.638 align:start position:0%
do your uh uh paramedics transport
 
05:33:29.788 --> 05:33:29.798 align:start position:0%
people across state lines for transports
 
05:33:33.470 --> 05:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
oh oh yes yes they do um and followup F
 
05:33:35.990 --> 05:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
the question me inquire uh would this
 
05:33:38.628 --> 05:33:38.638 align:start position:0%
bill uh do you think have a have an
 
05:33:40.990 --> 05:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
impact uh in cases like that would that
 
05:33:43.190 --> 05:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
would that create additional problems
 
05:33:43.200 --> 05:33:44.470 align:start position:0%
would that create additional problems
for

05:33:44.470 --> 05:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:33:47.070 --> 05:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
them it's difficult to say I think it
 
05:33:50.990 --> 05:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
would add an additional layer of um uh
 
05:33:53.030 --> 05:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
something that each individual ambulance
 
05:33:55.190 --> 05:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
service provider would have to be able
 
05:33:57.708 --> 05:33:57.718 align:start position:0%
to examine in our case for instance at
 
05:33:59.510 --> 05:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
AMR we're we're in network with a number
 
05:34:00.548 --> 05:34:00.558 align:start position:0%
of different
 
05:34:02.270 --> 05:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh insurance carriers Anthem being
 
05:34:05.150 --> 05:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
obviously the largest so from that
 
05:34:06.910 --> 05:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
standpoint it wouldn't impact us but I
 
05:34:09.430 --> 05:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
know that many of the 911 providers in
 
05:34:11.750 --> 05:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
the state are not in network with
 
05:34:13.910 --> 05:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
anybody um simply due to the fact that
 
05:34:15.470 --> 05:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
the amount that the insurance carriers
 
05:34:17.910 --> 05:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
are willing to pay nowhere near meets
 
05:34:21.830 --> 05:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
the cost that the 911 providers incur uh
 
05:34:24.910 --> 05:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
and and to be forced into those um
 
05:34:27.628 --> 05:34:27.638 align:start position:0%
situations like that literally overnight
 
05:34:29.350 --> 05:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh as I said would have an incredible
 
05:34:30.868 --> 05:34:30.878 align:start position:0%
effect on a lot of fire department
 
05:34:34.070 --> 05:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
budgets and Municipal budgets across the
 
05:34:36.390 --> 05:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
state all right thank you uh
 
05:34:36.400 --> 05:34:37.590 align:start position:0%
state all right thank you uh
representative

05:34:37.590 --> 05:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:34:40.350 --> 05:34:40.360 align:start position:0%
burrow yes thank you for uh taking my
 
05:34:43.350 --> 05:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
question um I guess Chris what confuses
 
05:34:45.390 --> 05:34:45.400 align:start position:0%
me maybe you can help me is that they're
 
05:34:47.868 --> 05:34:47.878 align:start position:0%
not a lot of businesses that that I know
 
05:34:51.030 --> 05:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
of um that don't get paid for so much of
 
05:34:51.040 --> 05:34:51.788 align:start position:0%
of um that don't get paid for so much of
their

05:34:51.788 --> 05:34:51.798 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:34:53.830 --> 05:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
services um you know you said you don't
 
05:34:55.868 --> 05:34:55.878 align:start position:0%
get paid unless you transport some
 
05:35:00.310 --> 05:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
somebody so is have you as have EMTs
 
05:35:02.230 --> 05:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
either in in state or across the country
 
05:35:04.350 --> 05:35:04.360 align:start position:0%
have they looked at the business model
 
05:35:06.628 --> 05:35:06.638 align:start position:0%
and are there any ways that you can get
 
05:35:09.350 --> 05:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
compensated um either by you again this
 
05:35:11.948 --> 05:35:11.958 align:start position:0%
is all new to me so through the towns or
 
05:35:13.788 --> 05:35:13.798 align:start position:0%
or other means because it just seems
 
05:35:17.910 --> 05:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
like a um an unworkable system yeah well
 
05:35:19.830 --> 05:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
it's not unlike an emergency room for
 
05:35:22.590 --> 05:35:22.600 align:start position:0%
instance um many of the folks that go to
 
05:35:25.030 --> 05:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms are either underinsured
 
05:35:27.510 --> 05:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
not insured and you know most of us that
 
05:35:30.390 --> 05:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
are that are um have the luxury of being
 
05:35:32.548 --> 05:35:32.558 align:start position:0%
able to be on this call today probably
 
05:35:34.030 --> 05:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
have pretty good commercial insurance
 
05:35:35.510 --> 05:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing or we have a federal
 
05:35:38.230 --> 05:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
governmental product that in essence um
 
05:35:39.708 --> 05:35:39.718 align:start position:0%
in our system of Health Care in the
 
05:35:41.470 --> 05:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
United States today pays for those
 
05:35:43.990 --> 05:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
people who cannot afford for that care
 
05:35:45.750 --> 05:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
the ambulance service world is no
 
05:35:48.350 --> 05:35:48.360 align:start position:0%
different um in fact well I I shouldn't
 
05:35:50.150 --> 05:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
say that it is different because we
 
05:35:53.110 --> 05:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
don't have the luxury of obtaining a uh
 
05:35:54.910 --> 05:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
insurance card while you're on the side
 
05:35:57.150 --> 05:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
of the road or or having you know your
 
05:35:59.110 --> 05:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
your heart attack in your home we just
 
05:36:00.750 --> 05:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
provide the Serv and take you and look
 
05:36:02.910 --> 05:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
for the information later on so we're at
 
05:36:04.510 --> 05:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a disadvantage that many
 
05:36:07.270 --> 05:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
other medical providers are not at um
 
05:36:08.830 --> 05:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
yet we still have to provide that level
 
05:36:12.628 --> 05:36:12.638 align:start position:0%
of care followup really question yes
 
05:36:16.110 --> 05:36:16.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um well with an and and a
 
05:36:18.350 --> 05:36:18.360 align:start position:0%
disclosure my husband was an emergency
 
05:36:21.070 --> 05:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
um medical um physician for 30 years and
 
05:36:23.350 --> 05:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
in the hospital with with emergency
 
05:36:25.190 --> 05:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
departments so they get bailed out by
 
05:36:27.670 --> 05:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
the hospital by higher Revenue
 
05:36:30.390 --> 05:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
generating um services like you know
 
05:36:34.590 --> 05:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
Orthopedics and whatnot so do do these
 
05:36:36.948 --> 05:36:36.958 align:start position:0%
EMT groups ever align with hospitals so
 
05:36:39.030 --> 05:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
there could be a similar scenario where
 
05:36:41.750 --> 05:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
they could Finance the the the parts
 
05:36:43.390 --> 05:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
that that that aren't
 
05:36:46.990 --> 05:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
paid I think in years past in in my
 
05:36:49.510 --> 05:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
history of work I previously worked for
 
05:36:51.390 --> 05:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
a company called Rockingham ambulance
 
05:36:53.190 --> 05:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
which was part of St Joseph's healthcare
 
05:36:56.350 --> 05:36:56.360 align:start position:0%
in Nash for many many years uh St Joseph
 
05:36:58.990 --> 05:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
divested from Rockingham because of all
 
05:37:00.670 --> 05:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
of the other costs that they were
 
05:37:02.390 --> 05:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
burdened with as a healthcare
 
05:37:04.230 --> 05:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
organization they were no longer able to
 
05:37:05.708 --> 05:37:05.718 align:start position:0%
support the ambulance company and
 
05:37:09.430 --> 05:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
literally walked away from it um thank
 
05:37:12.110 --> 05:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you for for answering that
 
05:37:13.470 --> 05:37:13.480 align:start position:0%
right well but I think the answer to
 
05:37:15.310 --> 05:37:15.320 align:start position:0%
your question is is that's they do cost
 
05:37:18.030 --> 05:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
shift and they get to when they do
 
05:37:20.548 --> 05:37:20.558 align:start position:0%
actually carry a patient that they're
 
05:37:22.910 --> 05:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
going to be Bild in that bill whatever
 
05:37:24.990 --> 05:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
that bill is is going to be higher
 
05:37:27.350 --> 05:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
because of their underlying costs that
 
05:37:29.830 --> 05:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
they have you know they got to get their
 
05:37:32.110 --> 05:37:32.120 align:start position:0%
money somehow so it's just that's where
 
05:37:34.390 --> 05:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
the cost shifting is all right uh
 
05:37:37.548 --> 05:37:37.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:39.948 --> 05:37:39.958 align:start position:0%
hooton thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:37:42.708 --> 05:37:42.718 align:start position:0%
Chris for being here to testify I note
 
05:37:44.510 --> 05:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
that just about every reference to the
 
05:37:47.868 --> 05:37:47.878 align:start position:0%
word ambulance is preceded by the word
 
05:37:52.270 --> 05:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
ground is there a difference um both in
 
05:37:55.030 --> 05:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
how it is done locally and in the
 
05:37:57.670 --> 05:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
Congressional Bill to which you
 
05:38:00.030 --> 05:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
alluded I I referenced the ground
 
05:38:01.910 --> 05:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
because the other side of that is the
 
05:38:05.030 --> 05:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
air component and air is federally
 
05:38:07.750 --> 05:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
mandated because of the lures that are
 
05:38:11.470 --> 05:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
involved so states can cannot um have
 
05:38:13.510 --> 05:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
any regulations that they can impose on
 
05:38:15.910 --> 05:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
the air ambulance industry that all has
 
05:38:18.708 --> 05:38:18.718 align:start position:0%
to to come through Congress so we
 
05:38:20.830 --> 05:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
specifically reference that it's ground
 
05:38:23.628 --> 05:38:23.638 align:start position:0%
ambulance and not
 
05:38:26.628 --> 05:38:26.638 align:start position:0%
air yep so the Congressional bill that
 
05:38:28.628 --> 05:38:28.638 align:start position:0%
you referenced would cover both ground
 
05:38:31.070 --> 05:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
and air ambulance service am I
 
05:38:34.310 --> 05:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
correct it it does there's actually a
 
05:38:36.430 --> 05:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
piece in the bill that specifically
 
05:38:38.788 --> 05:38:38.798 align:start position:0%
talks to the air side of things um and
 
05:38:41.030 --> 05:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
then one that specifically talks to the
 
05:38:42.708 --> 05:38:42.718 align:start position:0%
ground side which is the Congressional
 
05:38:45.190 --> 05:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
committee that's been that's being put
 
05:38:47.868 --> 05:38:47.878 align:start position:0%
together thank you good to see you right
 
05:38:49.830 --> 05:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
so so you're saying they haven't really
 
05:38:52.110 --> 05:38:52.120 align:start position:0%
solved the ground problem they just set
 
05:38:54.270 --> 05:38:54.280 align:start position:0%
up a study committee to solve the ground
 
05:38:56.390 --> 05:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
problem they have because the difficulty
 
05:38:58.310 --> 05:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
quite frankly as I mentioned earlier is
 
05:39:01.990 --> 05:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
we don't know what the ual cost uh of of
 
05:39:04.548 --> 05:39:04.558 align:start position:0%
Readiness and what a fair compensation
 
05:39:07.990 --> 05:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
cost is and CMS has been tasked with
 
05:39:09.628 --> 05:39:09.638 align:start position:0%
determining what that is and until
 
05:39:12.350 --> 05:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
they've complete that cost study you're
 
05:39:14.110 --> 05:39:14.120 align:start position:0%
really taking a dart and throwing it at
 
05:39:17.070 --> 05:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
a board um and as I mentioned you know
 
05:39:19.070 --> 05:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
what um there's an ambulance service in
 
05:39:22.230 --> 05:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
our Northern uh most Community called
 
05:39:25.230 --> 05:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
the 45th parallel what their costs are
 
05:39:27.150 --> 05:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
up there are certainly not what our
 
05:39:29.430 --> 05:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
costs are in natural um there's a Lar
 
05:39:31.150 --> 05:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
larger territory to cover there's
 
05:39:32.670 --> 05:39:32.680 align:start position:0%
there's a tremendous amount of
 
05:39:35.590 --> 05:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
difference in the demographics and
 
05:39:38.310 --> 05:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
without a meaningful cost study of what
 
05:39:40.628 --> 05:39:40.638 align:start position:0%
a fair and Equitable payment rate would
 
05:39:43.310 --> 05:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
be as I said it's it's a it's a
 
05:39:46.070 --> 05:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
crapshoot um and it's you know speaking
 
05:39:48.750 --> 05:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
from what I do I don't want to take a
 
05:39:50.350 --> 05:39:50.360 align:start position:0%
crapshoot with my budget it's too
 
05:39:52.350 --> 05:39:52.360 align:start position:0%
important to the communities that we
 
05:39:54.270 --> 05:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
serve and the level of services that we
 
05:39:55.788 --> 05:39:55.798 align:start position:0%
provide and I don't think many other
 
05:39:57.310 --> 05:39:57.320 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers want to do that
 
05:40:00.150 --> 05:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
either now each community by the way can
 
05:40:00.160 --> 05:40:01.270 align:start position:0%
either now each community by the way can
also

05:40:01.270 --> 05:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
also
 
05:40:03.670 --> 05:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
instill its own Cost Containment
 
05:40:06.628 --> 05:40:06.638 align:start position:0%
controls for instance um in nsha and
 
05:40:09.708 --> 05:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
Manchester written into our contracts
 
05:40:12.708 --> 05:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
with those communities are caps on the
 
05:40:14.590 --> 05:40:14.600 align:start position:0%
amount of out-of-pocket billing that we
 
05:40:18.350 --> 05:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
can Bill our customers uh we're we're
 
05:40:20.030 --> 05:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
only allowed to out-of-pocket Bild
 
05:40:23.030 --> 05:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
Medicare plus 25% to anybody that we
 
05:40:24.468 --> 05:40:24.478 align:start position:0%
pick up under those contractual
 
05:40:27.150 --> 05:40:27.160 align:start position:0%
agreements in those communities and and
 
05:40:31.390 --> 05:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
that was those communities attempt to um
 
05:40:33.310 --> 05:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
provide price protection to their
 
05:40:35.510 --> 05:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
constituents now their volume allows
 
05:40:36.948 --> 05:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
them to be able to do that you know that
 
05:40:38.468 --> 05:40:38.478 align:start position:0%
certainly wouldn't be the same situation
 
05:40:39.948 --> 05:40:39.958 align:start position:0%
in some of the smaller communities but
 
05:40:41.788 --> 05:40:41.798 align:start position:0%
in those it works for them and they came
 
05:40:43.590 --> 05:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
up with a local
 
05:40:47.390 --> 05:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
solution so then if there's a c do you
 
05:40:52.150 --> 05:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
back build the city does pay any money
 
05:40:54.030 --> 05:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
no the city No in fact in those two
 
05:40:56.548 --> 05:40:56.558 align:start position:0%
communities we pay the city money for
 
05:40:59.310 --> 05:40:59.320 align:start position:0%
the services they provide to us um and
 
05:41:01.990 --> 05:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
dispatching fees so we actually pay the
 
05:41:03.708 --> 05:41:03.718 align:start position:0%
cities of Nashville and Manchester
 
05:41:07.310 --> 05:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
several hundred, a year to have them
 
05:41:09.468 --> 05:41:09.478 align:start position:0%
dispatch our ambulance as for us well
 
05:41:11.750 --> 05:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
this is a complicated one okay it is
 
05:41:14.868 --> 05:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
yeah right so Connie are you all set
 
05:41:17.150 --> 05:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
then yeah your head take your hand down
 
05:41:19.190 --> 05:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
okay uh Rich representative Abel did you
 
05:41:20.270 --> 05:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
have another
 
05:41:24.190 --> 05:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you um in the uh
 
05:41:28.070 --> 05:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
cities where or the uh areas where your
 
05:41:29.990 --> 05:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
company uh
 
05:41:33.310 --> 05:41:33.320 align:start position:0%
operates um do ambulance certain
 
05:41:36.830 --> 05:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
ambulance companies have an exclusive uh
 
05:41:38.990 --> 05:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
rangement in other words ises a City
 
05:41:42.788 --> 05:41:42.798 align:start position:0%
License them uh or the town uh or is
 
05:41:42.798 --> 05:41:43.750 align:start position:0%
License them uh or the town uh or is
there

05:41:43.750 --> 05:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:41:46.590 --> 05:41:46.600 align:start position:0%
competition uh so they could call you
 
05:41:49.070 --> 05:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
they could call someone
 
05:41:51.868 --> 05:41:51.878 align:start position:0%
else most communities where we operate
 
05:41:53.670 --> 05:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
we're under an agreement with those
 
05:41:56.270 --> 05:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
communities and the agreement specifies
 
05:41:58.270 --> 05:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
a number of different things from types
 
05:42:00.670 --> 05:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
of personnel their training levels their
 
05:42:04.150 --> 05:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
response time uh requirements um what
 
05:42:06.548 --> 05:42:06.558 align:start position:0%
our pricing structure is uh for instance
 
05:42:08.230 --> 05:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
we're required to be nationally
 
05:42:10.350 --> 05:42:10.360 align:start position:0%
accredited uh in both those communities
 
05:42:12.230 --> 05:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
so there's a whole list of things that
 
05:42:15.830 --> 05:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
that each Community um would require of
 
05:42:18.070 --> 05:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
of the uh ambulance provider before they
 
05:42:19.670 --> 05:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
would sign an agreement with them I
 
05:42:21.230 --> 05:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
don't know of very many communities
 
05:42:23.990 --> 05:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
where it's uh you know you you call and
 
05:42:26.590 --> 05:42:26.600 align:start position:0%
and you can choose from a list of of of
 
05:42:28.708 --> 05:42:28.718 align:start position:0%
folks uh there's standards that are out
 
05:42:30.948 --> 05:42:30.958 align:start position:0%
there that that most communities abide
 
05:42:30.958 --> 05:42:32.150 align:start position:0%
there that that most communities abide
by

05:42:32.150 --> 05:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
by
 
05:42:35.590 --> 05:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
thank great uh seeing nobody else so
 
05:42:37.750 --> 05:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
05:42:41.548 --> 05:42:41.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity yeah so uh
 
05:42:44.430 --> 05:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
last but not least uh least natch natch
 
05:42:47.430 --> 05:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
Grace from the municipal Association
 
05:42:50.150 --> 05:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
and good afternoon Mr
 
05:42:52.350 --> 05:42:52.360 align:start position:0%
chair good afternoon Mr chair and
 
05:42:55.030 --> 05:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um so I'm an
 
05:42:55.948 --> 05:42:55.958 align:start position:0%
attorney with the New Hampshire
 
05:42:55.958 --> 05:42:56.990 align:start position:0%
attorney with the New Hampshire
Municipal

05:42:56.990 --> 05:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
Municipal
 
05:42:58.830 --> 05:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
Association I just want to comment on
 
05:43:00.910 --> 05:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
the bill um because there are some
 
05:43:03.230 --> 05:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
things that we think are good and some
 
05:43:05.230 --> 05:43:05.240 align:start position:0%
things we are concerned about uh that
 
05:43:07.830 --> 05:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
our members have reached out to us on so
 
05:43:10.230 --> 05:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
beginning with the things that are good
 
05:43:12.670 --> 05:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
uh our communities have pretty much
 
05:43:14.548 --> 05:43:14.558 align:start position:0%
universally said and I think that those
 
05:43:16.468 --> 05:43:16.478 align:start position:0%
of you who've been on this committee and
 
05:43:19.230 --> 05:43:19.240 align:start position:0%
heard similar bills through the year
 
05:43:22.590 --> 05:43:22.600 align:start position:0%
have uh have already heard them say that
 
05:43:24.430 --> 05:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
providing payments directly to the
 
05:43:27.150 --> 05:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
ambulance provider rather than to the
 
05:43:29.910 --> 05:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
person transported and then expecting
 
05:43:32.788 --> 05:43:32.798 align:start position:0%
that person who's transported to then
 
05:43:36.830 --> 05:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
pass that money on to the provider is a
 
05:43:40.070 --> 05:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
good change um because there are
 
05:43:42.868 --> 05:43:42.878 align:start position:0%
instances many instances where uh
 
05:43:45.390 --> 05:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
persons are reimbursed by the insurance
 
05:43:48.150 --> 05:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
provider uh and then they do not
 
05:43:50.948 --> 05:43:50.958 align:start position:0%
actually pay the ambulance service um
 
05:43:52.310 --> 05:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
obviously you know they're having a
 
05:43:55.070 --> 05:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
medical issue so a lot of those costs
 
05:43:57.990 --> 05:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
end up going to other other medical
 
05:43:58.000 --> 05:43:59.510 align:start position:0%
end up going to other other medical
bills

05:43:59.510 --> 05:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
bills
 
05:44:03.110 --> 05:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
um but in terms of our concerns um the
 
05:44:06.070 --> 05:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
the concerns really center around the uh
 
05:44:09.670 --> 05:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
commercially reasonable language um and
 
05:44:11.548 --> 05:44:11.558 align:start position:0%
how exactly that's going to work
 
05:44:14.708 --> 05:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
out uh you know our our communities
 
05:44:16.708 --> 05:44:16.718 align:start position:0%
obviously don't own hospitals they don't
 
05:44:19.510 --> 05:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
operate uh emergency rooms um so they're
 
05:44:21.990 --> 05:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
not familiar with that
 
05:44:24.350 --> 05:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
experience uh and the concern is
 
05:44:26.910 --> 05:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
obviously that if you know uh a
 
05:44:31.230 --> 05:44:31.240 align:start position:0%
community runs a Ambulance Service um
 
05:44:34.788 --> 05:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
and then has disputes with insurance
 
05:44:36.350 --> 05:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
providers that they're constantly
 
05:44:36.360 --> 05:44:37.270 align:start position:0%
providers that they're constantly
running

05:44:37.270 --> 05:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
running
 
05:44:40.350 --> 05:44:40.360 align:start position:0%
to the insurance commissioner um and
 
05:44:43.788 --> 05:44:43.798 align:start position:0%
asking for Resolutions um for these for
 
05:44:46.468 --> 05:44:46.478 align:start position:0%
these fees and they're really in this
 
05:44:47.628 --> 05:44:47.638 align:start position:0%
kind of middle place where they're
 
05:44:49.468 --> 05:44:49.478 align:start position:0%
trying to figure where they're trying to
 
05:44:53.030 --> 05:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
mediate um what happens and what the
 
05:44:54.190 --> 05:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
costs are going to be that are going to
 
05:44:56.948 --> 05:44:56.958 align:start position:0%
be associated with that um so those are
 
05:44:58.270 --> 05:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns that we've that
 
05:44:59.628 --> 05:44:59.638 align:start position:0%
we've heard
 
05:45:00.910 --> 05:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
uh and I just want to share that with
 
05:45:03.270 --> 05:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
the committee and I'm happy to take any
 
05:45:05.830 --> 05:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
questions yeah great great for uh thank
 
05:45:07.628 --> 05:45:07.638 align:start position:0%
you for pointing out uh section seven
 
05:45:10.510 --> 05:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
and eight I was so busy looking at the
 
05:45:12.430 --> 05:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
the other ambulance issue I forgot all
 
05:45:12.440 --> 05:45:13.310 align:start position:0%
the other ambulance issue I forgot all
about

05:45:13.310 --> 05:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:45:16.390 --> 05:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
that yet another ambulance issue that we
 
05:45:18.830 --> 05:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
have which is that uh if someone's
 
05:45:21.868 --> 05:45:21.878 align:start position:0%
property in casual auto insurance that
 
05:45:23.670 --> 05:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
if they're using the med pay the money
 
05:45:26.230 --> 05:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
gets paid directly to the patient to the
 
05:45:29.468 --> 05:45:29.478 align:start position:0%
car the know the policy owner and not to
 
05:45:32.510 --> 05:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
the provider which uh we heard uh I
 
05:45:34.030 --> 05:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
guess one example I heard was that some
 
05:45:37.230 --> 05:45:37.240 align:start position:0%
people they actually had a $115,000 med
 
05:45:39.190 --> 05:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
pay and they took the check and went out
 
05:45:40.948 --> 05:45:40.958 align:start position:0%
and bought a boat
 
05:45:44.270 --> 05:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
trailer instead of paying the medical
 
05:45:46.868 --> 05:45:46.878 align:start position:0%
providers they to pill it and do
 
05:45:49.948 --> 05:45:49.958 align:start position:0%
services so uh any other questions from
 
05:45:52.590 --> 05:45:52.600 align:start position:0%
the committee for for
 
05:45:55.230 --> 05:45:55.240 align:start position:0%
NCH uh seeing then we thank you very
 
05:45:58.110 --> 05:45:58.120 align:start position:0%

some other hands up oh God Don all right
 
05:46:14.190 --> 05:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:17.070 --> 05:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
in and hey Don who are we representing
 
05:46:20.390 --> 05:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
today this afternoon oh let's
 
05:46:26.590 --> 05:46:26.600 align:start position:0%
see we um I'm I'm I'm here again um uh
 
05:46:26.600 --> 05:46:27.628 align:start position:0%
see we um I'm I'm I'm here again um uh
for

05:46:27.628 --> 05:46:27.638 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:46:30.390 --> 05:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
ahip um
 
05:46:33.270 --> 05:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
we we are pleased to uh support
 
05:46:37.110 --> 05:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative Weston's bill um as it
 
05:46:41.670 --> 05:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
relates to the prohibition on balance uh
 
05:46:46.070 --> 05:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
billing um unlike the last speaker
 
05:46:50.468 --> 05:46:50.478 align:start position:0%
though um we believe Mr Brennan's
 
05:46:52.830 --> 05:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
explanation is
 
05:46:58.110 --> 05:46:58.120 align:start position:0%
is persuasive and it and that is uh we
 
05:46:58.120 --> 05:46:59.430 align:start position:0%
is persuasive and it and that is uh we
support

05:46:59.430 --> 05:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
support
 
05:47:03.190 --> 05:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
parties uh being commercially reasonable
 
05:47:06.510 --> 05:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
as it relates to payment and their other
 
05:47:10.628 --> 05:47:10.638 align:start position:0%
U uh conduct uh so we we support that
 
05:47:12.070 --> 05:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
provision and the
 
05:47:15.468 --> 05:47:15.478 align:start position:0%
related um mechanism in the event of a
 
05:47:19.708 --> 05:47:19.718 align:start position:0%
dispute as well the only issue we have
 
05:47:23.510 --> 05:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
really with the bill is section
 
05:47:27.510 --> 05:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
seven and if that's one of the uh
 
05:47:29.910 --> 05:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
Provisions that representative Weston
 
05:47:33.590 --> 05:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
referred to earlier um as something that
 
05:47:36.868 --> 05:47:36.878 align:start position:0%
she was interested in working on um we
 
05:47:40.990 --> 05:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
certainly would be uh party to that U
 
05:47:42.590 --> 05:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
effort the
 
05:47:46.910 --> 05:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
reason we are concerned with it is the
 
05:47:50.468 --> 05:47:50.478 align:start position:0%
provision which is being requested that
 
05:47:50.478 --> 05:47:51.468 align:start position:0%
provision which is being requested that
you

05:47:51.468 --> 05:47:51.478 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:47:55.310 --> 05:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
delete um is one actually similar to the
 
05:47:59.468 --> 05:47:59.478 align:start position:0%
commercial reasonableness standard
 
05:48:04.510 --> 05:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
tends to encourage reasonable Behavior
 
05:48:05.868 --> 05:48:05.878 align:start position:0%
as opposed
 
05:48:09.590 --> 05:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
to less than that and and and the reason
 
05:48:12.270 --> 05:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
for that quite frankly is those of you
 
05:48:14.670 --> 05:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
that have ever dealt with a two-party
 
05:48:17.788 --> 05:48:17.798 align:start position:0%
check uh uh
 
05:48:22.750 --> 05:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
know um that uh if if people want to
 
05:48:27.270 --> 05:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
cash check they pretty much have to uh
 
05:48:29.788 --> 05:48:29.798 align:start position:0%
uh come to a mutual
 
05:48:32.788 --> 05:48:32.798 align:start position:0%
uh uh understanding in order to do that
 
05:48:36.590 --> 05:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
that's what's in the current law um we
 
05:48:38.468 --> 05:48:38.478 align:start position:0%
think that makes sense and for that
 
05:48:41.230 --> 05:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
reason we are pleased to support
 
05:48:43.910 --> 05:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative Weston's uh bill with the
 
05:48:47.628 --> 05:48:47.638 align:start position:0%
exception of section seven and uh I
 
05:48:53.110 --> 05:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:55.670 --> 05:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
and okay good to
 
05:49:00.350 --> 05:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
hear any questions uh for
 
05:49:04.070 --> 05:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
attorney funin seeing none we thank you
 
05:49:08.070 --> 05:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
all right uh next is I have
 
05:49:14.868 --> 05:49:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:18.030 --> 05:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
romanello so Justin where where do you
 
05:49:20.750 --> 05:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
fall on this issue so my name is Justin
 
05:49:22.910 --> 05:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
romanello I appreciate your time I'm the
 
05:49:24.750 --> 05:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
chief of the Bureau of Ems for the State
 
05:49:26.910 --> 05:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire um and I just kind of
 
05:49:29.190 --> 05:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh kind of bring some
 
05:49:30.990 --> 05:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
clarifying points as to what New
 
05:49:33.310 --> 05:49:33.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire EMS system looks like as far
 
05:49:38.070 --> 05:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
as Services um if I could so in the
 
05:49:41.868 --> 05:49:41.878 align:start position:0%
state we have 300 licensed EMS units and
 
05:49:43.750 --> 05:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
about half of those are transport and
 
05:49:46.350 --> 05:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
services where this was this bill would
 
05:49:47.868 --> 05:49:47.878 align:start position:0%
apply to so they're the one you know
 
05:49:48.910 --> 05:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
they have an ambulance and they
 
05:49:52.110 --> 05:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
transport patients to the scene and into
 
05:49:54.628 --> 05:49:54.638 align:start position:0%
the hospital um or inner facility so
 
05:49:56.628 --> 05:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
between medical facility and medical
 
05:49:58.990 --> 05:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
facility um of those
 
05:50:04.030 --> 05:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
those 167 is departments 2third are
 
05:50:07.030 --> 05:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
municipal Based Services so they are
 
05:50:10.030 --> 05:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
majority being fire uh services but they
 
05:50:14.110 --> 05:50:14.120 align:start position:0%
are municipal Based Services with about
 
05:50:18.990 --> 05:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
45ish um are either hospital-based or um
 
05:50:21.390 --> 05:50:21.400 align:start position:0%
like Chris said Chris was they're a
 
05:50:23.430 --> 05:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
private Ambulance Service and again
 
05:50:26.150 --> 05:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
they're providing service 911 services
 
05:50:28.788 --> 05:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
as well as inter facility transport um
 
05:50:30.750 --> 05:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to paint that picture I
 
05:50:32.910 --> 05:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
know there is some conversations as far
 
05:50:35.270 --> 05:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
as talking about ground ambulances um
 
05:50:38.110 --> 05:50:38.120 align:start position:0%
and talking about commercial ambulances
 
05:50:40.670 --> 05:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
um but it is it is a bit of a larger
 
05:50:42.868 --> 05:50:42.878 align:start position:0%
picture with that there are municipal
 
05:50:45.708 --> 05:50:45.718 align:start position:0%
Based Services there is only one service
 
05:50:47.750 --> 05:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
that I am aware of that does not build
 
05:50:49.788 --> 05:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
their residents uh in the state it is a
 
05:50:52.190 --> 05:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
municipal Service uh and they don't bill
 
05:50:54.788 --> 05:50:54.798 align:start position:0%
for any transports what whatsoever um
 
05:50:56.548 --> 05:50:56.558 align:start position:0%
but the majority of those departments
 
05:50:59.430 --> 05:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
that 167 transport Serv departments are
 
05:51:02.548 --> 05:51:02.558 align:start position:0%
in fact going to bill for their services
 
05:51:04.510 --> 05:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
and to a point that that Chris made as
 
05:51:06.948 --> 05:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
far as not billing for anything other
 
05:51:08.990 --> 05:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
than transports you know it does it does
 
05:51:12.070 --> 05:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
certainly raise the the issue that over
 
05:51:14.628 --> 05:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
half of our services that are licens in
 
05:51:17.910 --> 05:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
the state are providing uh life life uh
 
05:51:20.310 --> 05:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
saving functions uh that that never
 
05:51:22.430 --> 05:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
never build for that matter um but
 
05:51:23.948 --> 05:51:23.958 align:start position:0%
certain we can answer any questions I
 
05:51:25.110 --> 05:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
just wanted to kind of paint the
 
05:51:27.468 --> 05:51:27.478 align:start position:0%
landscape of of what units are out there
 
05:51:30.350 --> 05:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
05:51:33.548 --> 05:51:33.558 align:start position:0%
are you for or against this bill I am I
 
05:51:33.558 --> 05:51:35.910 align:start position:0%
are you for or against this bill I am I
am

05:51:35.910 --> 05:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
am
 
05:51:38.670 --> 05:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
neutral okay okay do we have any
 
05:51:40.310 --> 05:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee members
 
05:51:43.150 --> 05:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
05:51:50.708 --> 05:51:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:57.270 --> 05:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:57.280 --> 05:52:02.730 align:start position:0%
 
check

05:52:02.730 --> 05:52:02.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:02.740 --> 05:52:03.948 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:52:03.948 --> 05:52:03.958 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:52:06.468 --> 05:52:06.478 align:start position:0%
hello can you hear me there we go great
 
05:52:08.670 --> 05:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
yes we can hear on that side say could
 
05:52:10.070 --> 05:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
be easily
 
05:52:12.468 --> 05:52:12.478 align:start position:0%
T well thank you ladies and gentlemen
 
05:52:14.430 --> 05:52:14.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the opportunity for me
 
05:52:17.270 --> 05:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
to uh speak in opposition to House Bill
 
05:52:20.510 --> 05:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
343 um I do agree in lockstep with Chris
 
05:52:22.750 --> 05:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
dewas I've known Chris for many years
 
05:52:24.990 --> 05:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
he's a well-known very well-respected
 
05:52:27.030 --> 05:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
EMS administrator in the state of New
 
05:52:28.948 --> 05:52:28.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and again I agree with him
 
05:52:30.868 --> 05:52:30.878 align:start position:0%
completely so what I wanted to mention
 
05:52:33.628 --> 05:52:33.638 align:start position:0%
to you and make you aware of is I'm the
 
05:52:35.270 --> 05:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
EMS director for the dairy fire
 
05:52:36.948 --> 05:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
department I have been a paramedic for
 
05:52:39.430 --> 05:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
36 years and I've devoted my entire life
 
05:52:42.150 --> 05:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
to public service and as a EMS director
 
05:52:43.990 --> 05:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
I'm resp responsible for the billing
 
05:52:46.910 --> 05:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
aspect of our operation so I'm often
 
05:52:48.868 --> 05:52:48.878 align:start position:0%
asked by residents and why do they get a
 
05:52:50.548 --> 05:52:50.558 align:start position:0%
bill for ambulance transport when they
 
05:52:52.430 --> 05:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
pay taxes why doesn't the taxes cover
 
05:52:55.788 --> 05:52:55.798 align:start position:0%
that bill and my response is typically
 
05:52:58.990 --> 05:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
in Derry only 5% of of our residents
 
05:53:02.868 --> 05:53:02.878 align:start position:0%
actually use our service but 95% do not
 
05:53:04.910 --> 05:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
95% of people which is a good thing do
 
05:53:06.430 --> 05:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
not have a medical emergency that
 
05:53:08.830 --> 05:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
requires a call to 911 in our
 
05:53:11.390 --> 05:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
response so we look at it or I kind of
 
05:53:13.910 --> 05:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
look at it more as a user fee to pay for
 
05:53:15.948 --> 05:53:15.958 align:start position:0%
that service whether we go to the town
 
05:53:18.230 --> 05:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
tax base and ask for 100% to cover our
 
05:53:20.070 --> 05:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
operations or we build for our EMS
 
05:53:22.948 --> 05:53:22.958 align:start position:0%
Service uh is kind of a user fee because
 
05:53:25.910 --> 05:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
only 5% of the people use it so when I
 
05:53:27.430 --> 05:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
look at our payer mix and I wanted to
 
05:53:29.310 --> 05:53:29.320 align:start position:0%
kind of explain that to you and see just
 
05:53:30.548 --> 05:53:30.558 align:start position:0%
so you have an understanding of what
 
05:53:33.548 --> 05:53:33.558 align:start position:0%
we're up against here in EMS our current
 
05:53:34.990 --> 05:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
payer mix and dairy and these are all
 
05:53:37.590 --> 05:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
the payers 50% of our residents have
 
05:53:39.948 --> 05:53:39.958 align:start position:0%
Medicare but when you have Medicare we
 
05:53:42.310 --> 05:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
receive 80% of the fee scheduled the
 
05:53:44.270 --> 05:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
patient's responsible for
 
05:53:47.030 --> 05:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
20% so I agree with that completely and
 
05:53:49.590 --> 05:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
I I think we those that have Medicare I
 
05:53:51.590 --> 05:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
have no issue with collecting the 80%
 
05:53:53.270 --> 05:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
and if they have secondary insurance I
 
05:53:55.670 --> 05:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
will build their secondary insurance but
 
05:53:58.750 --> 05:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
as Chris alluded to CMS is is doing the
 
05:54:00.628 --> 05:54:00.638 align:start position:0%
mandatory National cost study and
 
05:54:01.948 --> 05:54:01.958 align:start position:0%
they've determined that the cost of
 
05:54:03.750 --> 05:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
providing the service is well below what
 
05:54:05.948 --> 05:54:05.958 align:start position:0%
CMS is reimbursing and we hope to see
 
05:54:07.990 --> 05:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
that change within the next four to five
 
05:54:11.150 --> 05:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
years our next payer group those with
 
05:54:12.948 --> 05:54:12.958 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and if you don't know anything
 
05:54:14.788 --> 05:54:14.798 align:start position:0%
about New Hampshire Medicaid we get a
 
05:54:17.310 --> 05:54:17.320 align:start position:0%
small stien from Medicaid for an EMS
 
05:54:19.310 --> 05:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
transport that doesn't even cost the
 
05:54:21.548 --> 05:54:21.558 align:start position:0%
cover of our response never mind the
 
05:54:24.230 --> 05:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
transport so people with Medicaid have
 
05:54:25.708 --> 05:54:25.718 align:start position:0%
zero financial
 
05:54:28.190 --> 05:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility and then about 22% of our
 
05:54:30.990 --> 05:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
residents have Commercial Insurance very
 
05:54:33.990 --> 05:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
few that I'm aware of um entertain
 
05:54:36.468 --> 05:54:36.478 align:start position:0%
participation agreements with insurance
 
05:54:38.750 --> 05:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
companies Anthem is pretty strong in
 
05:54:41.070 --> 05:54:41.080 align:start position:0%
this part of the state when I came on to
 
05:54:43.230 --> 05:54:43.240 align:start position:0%
Dairy 15 years ago dery had a
 
05:54:45.030 --> 05:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
participation agreement with Anthem and
 
05:54:46.310 --> 05:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
when I looked at their rates they were
 
05:54:48.990 --> 05:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
so low they were actually below Medicare
 
05:54:51.310 --> 05:54:51.320 align:start position:0%
rates which is illegal I couldn't accept
 
05:54:54.070 --> 05:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
those so myself with Town administrators
 
05:54:55.708 --> 05:54:55.718 align:start position:0%
and Fire Chiefs went to Anthem in an
 
05:54:57.468 --> 05:54:57.478 align:start position:0%
attempt to negotiate their rates they
 
05:54:59.030 --> 05:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
refused to negotiate and they
 
05:55:00.670 --> 05:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
essentially said good luck collecting
 
05:55:01.910 --> 05:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
from our patients because we're not
 
05:55:03.788 --> 05:55:03.798 align:start position:0%
going to pay you if you don't sign an
 
05:55:06.270 --> 05:55:06.280 align:start position:0%
agreement and then we have about 14% of
 
05:55:08.430 --> 05:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
patients who don't have insurance uh as
 
05:55:10.350 --> 05:55:10.360 align:start position:0%
a result of the pandemic a lot of people
 
05:55:11.548 --> 05:55:11.558 align:start position:0%
have lost their health insurance and
 
05:55:13.030 --> 05:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
we've seen an increase in patients with
 
05:55:15.310 --> 05:55:15.320 align:start position:0%
no health insurance and unfortunately if
 
05:55:17.030 --> 05:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
we were forced into a participation
 
05:55:18.628 --> 05:55:18.638 align:start position:0%
agreement the patient that would be left
 
05:55:20.670 --> 05:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
with the largest bill would be the
 
05:55:22.110 --> 05:55:22.120 align:start position:0%
patients with no insurance and that
 
05:55:25.070 --> 05:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
makes no sense so I agree with Chris
 
05:55:27.548 --> 05:55:27.558 align:start position:0%
staz and I'm in an opposition to this
 
05:55:29.990 --> 05:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
bill I would like to look at the uh
 
05:55:31.990 --> 05:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
Center for Medicaid services as they do
 
05:55:34.070 --> 05:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
their National cost study and I think we
 
05:55:36.310 --> 05:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
should use those numbers and I and I am
 
05:55:38.990 --> 05:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
fully aware of the surprise billing
 
05:55:40.990 --> 05:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
legislation is and we should probably
 
05:55:43.628 --> 05:55:43.638 align:start position:0%
weigh into that here as well so the town
 
05:55:47.708 --> 05:55:47.718 align:start position:0%
of Dair is opposed to House Bill 343
 
05:55:49.990 --> 05:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:55:54.390 --> 05:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
folks thank you very much any
 
05:55:57.990 --> 05:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
questions okay uh chair will call in
 
05:55:58.000 --> 05:55:59.190 align:start position:0%
questions okay uh chair will call in

Jeffrey
 
05:56:13.390 --> 05:56:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:16.468 --> 05:56:16.478 align:start position:0%
Jeffrey be helpful hi my name is Jeff
 
05:56:19.910 --> 05:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
Spencer and um I run a small company
 
05:56:21.670 --> 05:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
called medical Business
 
05:56:23.948 --> 05:56:23.958 align:start position:0%
Services um and I'll explain a little
 
05:56:26.468 --> 05:56:26.478 align:start position:0%
bit why I'm here and why I've been
 
05:56:28.390 --> 05:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
involved with this some folks probably
 
05:56:30.990 --> 05:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
remember hearing from me last year I
 
05:56:33.510 --> 05:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
will say that I am in Vermont not New
 
05:56:37.230 --> 05:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire although I uh spent you know
 
05:56:39.990 --> 05:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not a carpet bagger uh I was I've
 
05:56:42.548 --> 05:56:42.558 align:start position:0%
been well I've been an EMS since 1978 as
 
05:56:45.750 --> 05:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
a provider um to this day was nationally
 
05:56:48.868 --> 05:56:48.878 align:start position:0%
registered for 30 years so I've been out
 
05:56:52.548 --> 05:56:52.558 align:start position:0%
there in the field um in um Vermont and
 
05:56:54.548 --> 05:56:54.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and then I became way back
 
05:56:56.190 --> 05:56:56.200 align:start position:0%
in the Dark Ages and Assistant Attorney
 
05:56:58.990 --> 05:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
General in New Hampshire so I was
 
05:57:00.830 --> 05:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
involved with drafting legislation this
 
05:57:02.830 --> 05:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
is back in the I always say in the Pam
 
05:57:05.430 --> 05:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
smart era for those that remember it um
 
05:57:07.030 --> 05:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
so as an Assistant Attorney General in
 
05:57:08.390 --> 05:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and then I was appointed
 
05:57:10.628 --> 05:57:10.638 align:start position:0%
chief of fire standards and training in
 
05:57:12.830 --> 05:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire also when we built the
 
05:57:17.230 --> 05:57:17.240 align:start position:0%
fire academy um way back when
 
05:57:20.628 --> 05:57:20.638 align:start position:0%
um so my background is is is as a
 
05:57:22.750 --> 05:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
responder but also I am trained as a
 
05:57:24.990 --> 05:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
lawyer although very much a lot of what
 
05:57:26.990 --> 05:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
I do is not involved with the law I'm
 
05:57:30.548 --> 05:57:30.558 align:start position:0%
not here as a lawyer at all um but say
 
05:57:32.110 --> 05:57:32.120 align:start position:0%
as a matter back as a matter of
 
05:57:35.150 --> 05:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
background about nine years ago um in
 
05:57:37.030 --> 05:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
Vermont and New Hampshire working with
 
05:57:39.868 --> 05:57:39.878 align:start position:0%
the my EMS folks you know I saw a need
 
05:57:41.270 --> 05:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
for a billing company I credit our
 
05:57:41.280 --> 05:57:42.468 align:start position:0%
for a billing company I credit our
billing

05:57:42.468 --> 05:57:42.478 align:start position:0%
billing
 
05:57:44.788 --> 05:57:44.798 align:start position:0%
company it's more than a business though
 
05:57:46.670 --> 05:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you that the reason I say that
 
05:57:48.830 --> 05:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
is I'm in the thick of this all the
 
05:57:50.110 --> 05:57:50.120 align:start position:0%
stuff you're talking about I deal with
 
05:57:54.590 --> 05:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
every day we build 600,000 calls since
 
05:57:58.070 --> 05:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
we we started um I do this stuff every
 
05:57:59.948 --> 05:57:59.958 align:start position:0%
day I see what's going on in the
 
05:58:02.708 --> 05:58:02.718 align:start position:0%
reimbursement world that's all I do um
 
05:58:04.230 --> 05:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
so all these things you're talking about
 
05:58:06.788 --> 05:58:06.798 align:start position:0%
I'm that's that's my life blood and as a
 
05:58:08.350 --> 05:58:08.360 align:start position:0%
professional and as a person committed
 
05:58:08.360 --> 05:58:09.510 align:start position:0%
professional and as a person committed
to

05:58:09.510 --> 05:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:58:12.628 --> 05:58:12.638 align:start position:0%
EMS it's my legacy now you know I'm not
 
05:58:14.548 --> 05:58:14.558 align:start position:0%
out there saving lives like I was when I
 
05:58:16.868 --> 05:58:16.878 align:start position:0%
was 25 I'm not the chief of fire
 
05:58:19.390 --> 05:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
standard training you know all I can do
 
05:58:22.230 --> 05:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
right now is help the uh the EMS
 
05:58:25.390 --> 05:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
community and the taxpayers they serve
 
05:58:26.990 --> 05:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
on the reimbursement realm and that's
 
05:58:28.708 --> 05:58:28.718 align:start position:0%
what we do
 
05:58:28.718 --> 05:58:30.230 align:start position:0%
what we do
um

05:58:30.230 --> 05:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:32.750 --> 05:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
and a couple a couple of things so this
 
05:58:35.510 --> 05:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
is all these things I deal with all the
 
05:58:37.990 --> 05:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
time and I I'm committed to helping you
 
05:58:40.990 --> 05:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
all and the positives are I do think
 
05:58:44.150 --> 05:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
this problem can be solved I do think it
 
05:58:45.830 --> 05:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
can be solved I don't think this bill I
 
05:58:47.390 --> 05:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
think this bill starts and I know this
 
05:58:49.750 --> 05:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
has gone on a long way but I think it
 
05:58:52.788 --> 05:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
can be done and I do believe if
 
05:58:54.990 --> 05:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
everybody knew the realities of EMS
 
05:58:57.868 --> 05:58:57.878 align:start position:0%
which we've heard from Chris dewas um uh
 
05:59:01.390 --> 05:59:01.400 align:start position:0%
we just heard from uh M Bohemian um if
 
05:59:03.430 --> 05:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
you if everybody understood the
 
05:59:05.708 --> 05:59:05.718 align:start position:0%
realities I think the solution would
 
05:59:08.150 --> 05:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
become actually relatively clear I think
 
05:59:10.708 --> 05:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
90% of the battle is is sort of getting
 
05:59:14.310 --> 05:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
the realities of it um there's some
 
05:59:16.830 --> 05:59:16.840 align:start position:0%
undeniable truths amongst and my my
 
05:59:19.548 --> 05:59:19.558 align:start position:0%
customers are the the either nonprofit
 
05:59:20.910 --> 05:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
corporations and there are a couple of
 
05:59:23.310 --> 05:59:23.320 align:start position:0%
them nonprofits out there you know Tri
 
05:59:26.788 --> 05:59:26.798 align:start position:0%
down ambulance down in uh in in pemr um
 
05:59:28.150 --> 05:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
being one
 
05:59:30.628 --> 05:59:30.638 align:start position:0%
and the municipal Services all of which
 
05:59:33.310 --> 05:59:33.320 align:start position:0%
are taxpayer funded bottom line we're
 
05:59:35.270 --> 05:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
talking about the taxpayers here in the
 
05:59:37.990 --> 05:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
end this is all about the
 
05:59:40.868 --> 05:59:40.878 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um for at least my segment of
 
05:59:43.708 --> 05:59:43.718 align:start position:0%
that pie that um Justin was talking
 
05:59:45.350 --> 05:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
about and I can tell you I know
 
05:59:47.628 --> 05:59:47.638 align:start position:0%
everybody's rates I know all the rates I
 
05:59:49.070 --> 05:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
know the rates Nationwide of them in
 
05:59:51.390 --> 05:59:51.400 align:start position:0%
comparison every one of our customers
 
05:59:54.910 --> 05:59:54.920 align:start position:0%
loses money on every call and that's why
 
05:59:56.590 --> 05:59:56.600 align:start position:0%
they have to go to the taxpayers for
 
05:59:59.628 --> 05:59:59.638 align:start position:0%
subsidies you know up in Plymouth um
 
06:00:03.830 --> 06:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
that uh uh uh the representative fromp
 
06:00:05.590 --> 06:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
up there that I've chatted with every
 
06:00:08.110 --> 06:00:08.120 align:start position:0%
one of these Services loses money today
 
06:00:09.110 --> 06:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
with their
 
06:00:11.788 --> 06:00:11.798 align:start position:0%
reimbursement um and essentially any of
 
06:00:13.390 --> 06:00:13.400 align:start position:0%
those losses get transferred to the
 
06:00:16.150 --> 06:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayers it's a it's an undeniable
 
06:00:19.070 --> 06:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
truth um that the rates that are charged
 
06:00:21.070 --> 06:00:21.080 align:start position:0%
today do not cover
 
06:00:24.030 --> 06:00:24.040 align:start position:0%
cost they're not too high I would I
 
06:00:25.910 --> 06:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
would I would and I can support that
 
06:00:28.070 --> 06:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
with data they are not
 
06:00:31.150 --> 06:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
so if there's some belief that somehow
 
06:00:32.948 --> 06:00:32.958 align:start position:0%
ambulance services at least in Vermont
 
06:00:34.390 --> 06:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire I can't speak for
 
06:00:36.070 --> 06:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and everywhere else are
 
06:00:38.750 --> 06:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
just absolutely gouging people it's just
 
06:00:41.590 --> 06:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
not the case um it's just not the
 
06:00:43.868 --> 06:00:43.878 align:start position:0%
reality our rates are probably if
 
06:00:47.830 --> 06:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
anything too low and as what um um Mr
 
06:00:50.230 --> 06:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
heian said you know he is completely
 
06:00:52.708 --> 06:00:52.718 align:start position:0%
right this is and and there was a talk
 
06:00:55.230 --> 06:00:55.240 align:start position:0%
about cost shifts there's no cost
 
06:00:58.230 --> 06:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
shifting in EMS there just isn't of all
 
06:00:59.948 --> 06:00:59.958 align:start position:0%
of our customers just like what you miss
 
06:01:02.868 --> 06:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
Mr heian say probably 50 to 60% are
 
06:01:05.590 --> 06:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
Medicare patients those are the people
 
06:01:07.868 --> 06:01:07.878 align:start position:0%
that call the ambulance retirement age
 
06:01:10.070 --> 06:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
people fee schedule and the fee schedule
 
06:01:13.750 --> 06:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet cost 10 to 20% is Medicaid
 
06:01:15.868 --> 06:01:15.878 align:start position:0%
and Medicaid you know the Medicaid
 
06:01:19.230 --> 06:01:19.240 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate for a BLS emergency
 
06:01:23.910 --> 06:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
is um $145 in the state of New Hampshire
 
06:01:28.548 --> 06:01:28.558 align:start position:0%
it's um uh excuse $22.68 per mile
 
06:01:32.868 --> 06:01:32.878 align:start position:0%
um and a BLS base rate is
 
06:01:36.030 --> 06:01:36.040 align:start position:0%
$145. like I heard I think Mr heian
 
06:01:37.628 --> 06:01:37.638 align:start position:0%
called that doesn't even Co cover the
 
06:01:40.070 --> 06:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
cost to get the ambulance to the patient
 
06:01:42.110 --> 06:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
and that right there that's you know 50
 
06:01:45.670 --> 06:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
to 60% so there is no cost shifting
 
06:01:47.468 --> 06:01:47.478 align:start position:0%
available like in a hospital where they
 
06:01:50.350 --> 06:01:50.360 align:start position:0%
can get it from their MRIs you know
 
06:01:51.948 --> 06:01:51.958 align:start position:0%
these these municipalities they're
 
06:01:56.190 --> 06:01:56.200 align:start position:0%
running ambulance and that's it um and
 
06:01:59.948 --> 06:01:59.958 align:start position:0%
uh I can't say that the truth of the
 
06:02:02.948 --> 06:02:02.958 align:start position:0%
matter is the a lot of insurers out
 
06:02:06.150 --> 06:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
there are using this model right now
 
06:02:08.990 --> 06:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
they're repricing bills unilaterally and
 
06:02:11.548 --> 06:02:11.558 align:start position:0%
you know the bill will come in for $800
 
06:02:12.708 --> 06:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
and they'll say you know we think it
 
06:02:15.548 --> 06:02:15.558 align:start position:0%
should be $600 and they'll pay 600 and
 
06:02:18.750 --> 06:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
the patient ends up eating that and the
 
06:02:22.868 --> 06:02:22.878 align:start position:0%
reality is um the reality is that it's
 
06:02:24.590 --> 06:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
going to be that of the taxpayer there's
 
06:02:26.510 --> 06:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
no cost shifting we talked about the
 
06:02:28.708 --> 06:02:28.718 align:start position:0%
45th parall someone mentioned it great
 
06:02:30.990 --> 06:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
example one of my longtime friends and
 
06:02:34.030 --> 06:02:34.040 align:start position:0%
customers I think you may remember uh
 
06:02:37.110 --> 06:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
hearing um from Nate he testified before
 
06:02:39.468 --> 06:02:39.478 align:start position:0%
Val very eloquently their rates are
 
06:02:39.478 --> 06:02:41.030 align:start position:0%
Val very eloquently their rates are
astronomically

06:02:41.030 --> 06:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
astronomically
 
06:02:44.070 --> 06:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
high if anybody would look at it and the
 
06:02:46.030 --> 06:02:46.040 align:start position:0%
insurance companies look at it and say
 
06:02:48.990 --> 06:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
wow that's way too much but they're
 
06:02:50.990 --> 06:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
serving providing Paramount level
 
06:02:52.670 --> 06:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
service to and I remember his testimony
 
06:02:54.948 --> 06:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
to an area the size of Rhode Island
 
06:02:57.110 --> 06:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
their rates are really high and still he
 
06:02:59.190 --> 06:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
has to go back and ask for an incredible
 
06:03:01.030 --> 06:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
amount of money and I remember his what
 
06:03:02.830 --> 06:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
he said from four of the poorest towns
 
06:03:04.750 --> 06:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire the
 
06:03:08.150 --> 06:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
reality is coming up with sort of this
 
06:03:09.628 --> 06:03:09.638 align:start position:0%
let's look at what everybody else is
 
06:03:11.788 --> 06:03:11.798 align:start position:0%
paying unfortunately as a methodology
 
06:03:14.990 --> 06:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
isn't going to work and the reason why I
 
06:03:16.990 --> 06:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
know people might think wait why come
 
06:03:19.788 --> 06:03:19.798 align:start position:0%
they're not in the network it's exactly
 
06:03:21.670 --> 06:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
there's no motivation to go to a place
 
06:03:24.110 --> 06:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
like the 45th parallel the amount of
 
06:03:26.270 --> 06:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
discounts that were required to join the
 
06:03:29.230 --> 06:03:29.240 align:start position:0%
network made that situation even worse
 
06:03:30.948 --> 06:03:30.958 align:start position:0%
so most these municipalities aren't in
 
06:03:33.948 --> 06:03:33.958 align:start position:0%
network they simply can't afford to be
 
06:03:36.468 --> 06:03:36.478 align:start position:0%
um because of the the rates allowed but
 
06:03:39.030 --> 06:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
I guess I'd say there is a solution and
 
06:03:41.270 --> 06:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
I know I am absolutely more than happy
 
06:03:44.548 --> 06:03:44.558 align:start position:0%
to and I don't have a real stake in this
 
06:03:47.270 --> 06:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
um I am just here because I think it's
 
06:03:48.628 --> 06:03:48.638 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do and I'm concerned
 
06:03:51.708 --> 06:03:51.718 align:start position:0%
about the future of EMS from a fiscal
 
06:03:54.830 --> 06:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
standpoint um more than happy to uh uh
 
06:03:57.670 --> 06:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
work with Mr Brennan um and also the
 
06:03:59.510 --> 06:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
gentleman from the municipal Association
 
06:04:02.230 --> 06:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
because I do think I I can see some some
 
06:04:04.350 --> 06:04:04.360 align:start position:0%
sensitivity in this bill that there's a
 
06:04:06.070 --> 06:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
there some there's a solution that
 
06:04:08.030 --> 06:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
people are shooting for I think it can
 
06:04:11.270 --> 06:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
be done um I do believe that the
 
06:04:13.310 --> 06:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
methodology just when you step back and
 
06:04:14.230 --> 06:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
look at
 
06:04:16.750 --> 06:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
it if we want to
 
06:04:19.910 --> 06:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
protect the taxpayers and we want to
 
06:04:22.390 --> 06:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
protect the patient we have to somehow
 
06:04:24.868 --> 06:04:24.878 align:start position:0%
find a way to make sure the payment rate
 
06:04:29.390 --> 06:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
covers costs the C the reason for the
 
06:04:31.030 --> 06:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
balance billing problem when it comes to
 
06:04:33.110 --> 06:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
ambulance services and I'm going to only
 
06:04:35.990 --> 06:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
speak for Vermont and New Hampshire is
 
06:04:39.070 --> 06:04:39.080 align:start position:0%
because the rates are too low um and the
 
06:04:40.750 --> 06:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate is too low so the
 
06:04:43.628 --> 06:04:43.638 align:start position:0%
taxpayers have to keep subsidizing that
 
06:04:46.990 --> 06:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
operation and the answer to it is to get
 
06:04:50.910 --> 06:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
the rates to be consistent with costs
 
06:04:53.948 --> 06:04:53.958 align:start position:0%
and that's the solution um to that one
 
06:04:56.750 --> 06:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
so I am imposed the bill in its form
 
06:04:58.750 --> 06:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
although I think there's stuff that can
 
06:05:00.390 --> 06:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
be done and I know probably people's
 
06:05:02.590 --> 06:05:02.600 align:start position:0%
eyes are glazing over because you've
 
06:05:06.670 --> 06:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
heard this issue um for so many years I
 
06:05:10.310 --> 06:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
will stay to you as um a person that's
 
06:05:13.548 --> 06:05:13.558 align:start position:0%
in the thick of this and I do believe I
 
06:05:16.310 --> 06:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
sort of know my ranar around legislation
 
06:05:18.868 --> 06:05:18.878 align:start position:0%
you this can be solved I just not quite
 
06:05:21.628 --> 06:05:21.638 align:start position:0%
sure where they yet so thank you for
 
06:05:23.270 --> 06:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
letting me
 
06:05:27.670 --> 06:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
speak thank you um I don't see any
 
06:05:30.030 --> 06:05:30.040 align:start position:0%
questions from the members so thank you
 
06:05:34.750 --> 06:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
very much I now I now have three names
 
06:05:37.390 --> 06:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
so I would say all these people didn't
 
06:05:39.830 --> 06:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
sign up ahead of time but
 
06:05:43.270 --> 06:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
um but I certainly not GNA send them
 
06:05:49.788 --> 06:05:49.798 align:start position:0%
away so uh the next up is Jerry
 
06:05:54.670 --> 06:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
Stringham and there you go uh thank you
 
06:05:57.670 --> 06:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm Jerry stman I'm former State
 
06:05:59.510 --> 06:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
Rep from Lincoln and Woodstock New
 
06:06:01.750 --> 06:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh it's nice to see many of
 
06:06:04.110 --> 06:06:04.120 align:start position:0%
you again and
 
06:06:06.830 --> 06:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative ham who uh currently
 
06:06:08.990 --> 06:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
serves the area on the committee uh nice
 
06:06:11.830 --> 06:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
to see you as well I was asked to
 
06:06:14.830 --> 06:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
express concerns about HB 343 from
 
06:06:17.350 --> 06:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
Lynwood ambulance to this committee
 
06:06:18.948 --> 06:06:18.958 align:start position:0%
ambulance services in rural New
 
06:06:20.510 --> 06:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a critical part of the health
 
06:06:23.150 --> 06:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
structure and emergency response system
 
06:06:25.590 --> 06:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
for our residents and also the out of
 
06:06:27.468 --> 06:06:27.478 align:start position:0%
state visitors who enjoy enjoy the White
 
06:06:29.510 --> 06:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
Mountains up here and often get involved
 
06:06:32.110 --> 06:06:32.120 align:start position:0%
with rescues uh you know what I have to
 
06:06:33.910 --> 06:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
say isn't isn't much different from what
 
06:06:36.750 --> 06:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
you heard uh you know certainly we agree
 
06:06:38.430 --> 06:06:38.440 align:start position:0%
that the Bill's goals of removing
 
06:06:41.590 --> 06:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
balanced billing is laudable and uh
 
06:06:43.270 --> 06:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
there's been considerable thought that's
 
06:06:45.670 --> 06:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
going into its planning uh but rural
 
06:06:47.948 --> 06:06:47.958 align:start position:0%
ambulance services like lywood ambulance
 
06:06:50.548 --> 06:06:50.558 align:start position:0%
have concerns uh they feel they have no
 
06:06:53.350 --> 06:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
no leverage over insurers uh in terms of
 
06:06:55.510 --> 06:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
setting Fair rates uh they're generally
 
06:06:58.190 --> 06:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
not under contract uh the rates uh will
 
06:06:59.868 --> 06:06:59.878 align:start position:0%
not take into account the very high
 
06:07:02.150 --> 06:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
Readiness costs in rural areas all
 
06:07:04.150 --> 06:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
things you've heard uh and they are too
 
06:07:06.430 --> 06:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
small a player uh for the insurance
 
06:07:10.270 --> 06:07:10.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner to be of much help uh so um
 
06:07:12.628 --> 06:07:12.638 align:start position:0%
the simple ask here is that the concerns
 
06:07:14.990 --> 06:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
of critical services like Lynwood which
 
06:07:17.468 --> 06:07:17.478 align:start position:0%
is you know really almost a central
 
06:07:20.310 --> 06:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
element of uh of our Health Care system
 
06:07:23.030 --> 06:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
in here be taken into account uh before
 
06:07:25.670 --> 06:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
finalizing the bill and I know a lot of
 
06:07:27.190 --> 06:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of good work has been done done
 
06:07:31.230 --> 06:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
today um I know that uh David uh Tober
 
06:07:34.628 --> 06:07:34.638 align:start position:0%
the uh Chief uh of lywood ambulance was
 
06:07:37.510 --> 06:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
planning on listening in on this hearing
 
06:07:39.670 --> 06:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh and probably be better uh to answer
 
06:07:42.030 --> 06:07:42.040 align:start position:0%
any questions that you have uh but thank
 
06:07:45.190 --> 06:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
you for this opportunity to speak and uh
 
06:07:48.310 --> 06:07:48.320 align:start position:0%

moment Justin are you
 
06:08:17.990 --> 06:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
there I saw a SC Square pop up for him
 
06:08:21.510 --> 06:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:23.788 --> 06:08:23.798 align:start position:0%
happen I see a square and it doesn't
 
06:08:27.430 --> 06:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
seem to be muted yeah it just just
 
06:08:29.990 --> 06:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's he's there but not
 
06:08:32.110 --> 06:08:32.120 align:start position:0%
there there he
 
06:08:35.350 --> 06:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
goes I think he had
 
06:08:40.670 --> 06:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:43.430 --> 06:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
off there you go there we go sorry about
 
06:08:44.670 --> 06:08:44.680 align:start position:0%

thank you all for your time thank you Mr
 
06:08:51.070 --> 06:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I will tell you that to the
 
06:08:52.708 --> 06:08:52.718 align:start position:0%
best of my recollection it's been at
 
06:08:54.750 --> 06:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
least a decade because my daughter was
 
06:08:56.310 --> 06:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
born in the first one of the first
 
06:08:57.948 --> 06:08:57.958 align:start position:0%
hearings I was involved in on this and
 
06:09:00.390 --> 06:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
she just turned 10 uh so at least for my
 
06:09:01.948 --> 06:09:01.958 align:start position:0%
involv I think you were chairing it back
 
06:09:04.270 --> 06:09:04.280 align:start position:0%
then my name is Justin vanett and I live
 
06:09:06.150 --> 06:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
in holderness New Hampshire I'm the head
 
06:09:08.070 --> 06:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
of Stewart's ambulance which is one of
 
06:09:10.150 --> 06:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
the largest ambulance services in the
 
06:09:11.948 --> 06:09:11.958 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we are also
 
06:09:14.190 --> 06:09:14.200 align:start position:0%
headquartered in here in New Hampshire
 
06:09:17.830 --> 06:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
and we have been for 40 years um I'm
 
06:09:19.750 --> 06:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
just going to try and touch on a couple
 
06:09:22.110 --> 06:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
of issues that people haven't mentioned
 
06:09:25.110 --> 06:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
um first and foremost I will tell you we
 
06:09:26.788 --> 06:09:26.798 align:start position:0%
as a company our corporate policy it's
 
06:09:29.030 --> 06:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
been this way for three or four years we
 
06:09:30.990 --> 06:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
do not balance bill for anything other
 
06:09:33.468 --> 06:09:33.478 align:start position:0%
than co-pays and deductibles um we do
 
06:09:34.830 --> 06:09:34.840 align:start position:0%
this because I live in the communities
 
06:09:37.750 --> 06:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
we serve and it seems like every time we
 
06:09:39.110 --> 06:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
sent out a balance bill they were a
 
06:09:41.310 --> 06:09:41.320 align:start position:0%
friend of my mother-in-laws and I would
 
06:09:43.548 --> 06:09:43.558 align:start position:0%
hear about it and I got lots of angry
 
06:09:45.788 --> 06:09:45.798 align:start position:0%
people in my community so we went to our
 
06:09:49.390 --> 06:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
towns uh in order to not balance Bill we
 
06:09:52.030 --> 06:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
had to almost double what we charge UPF
 
06:09:53.948 --> 06:09:53.958 align:start position:0%
front so we went to all of our towns we
 
06:09:56.110 --> 06:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
we represent about nine towns and said
 
06:09:58.150 --> 06:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
this is what we're going to do and so we
 
06:10:00.270 --> 06:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
haven't balance build and and that has
 
06:10:03.190 --> 06:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
worked out really well for us um we
 
06:10:04.670 --> 06:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
would comply I was talking to
 
06:10:06.310 --> 06:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative Weston and representative
 
06:10:07.868 --> 06:10:07.878 align:start position:0%
Marsh about this you know we would
 
06:10:10.670 --> 06:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
comply with this bill um which is a good
 
06:10:14.230 --> 06:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
thing um but I have real concerns about
 
06:10:15.948 --> 06:10:15.958 align:start position:0%
the power that this would hand to the
 
06:10:19.310 --> 06:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
insurance companies um because one of
 
06:10:21.070 --> 06:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
the problems as I understand it and
 
06:10:22.708 --> 06:10:22.718 align:start position:0%
chairman you probably understand this
 
06:10:25.190 --> 06:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
better than I do but insurance companies
 
06:10:27.070 --> 06:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
are required to have a certain number of
 
06:10:29.390 --> 06:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
primary care physicians or eye doctors
 
06:10:31.910 --> 06:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
or orthopedic surgeons in every region
 
06:10:34.788 --> 06:10:34.798 align:start position:0%
they don't have yeah they don't have to
 
06:10:36.708 --> 06:10:36.718 align:start position:0%
have that for ambulance so they have
 
06:10:40.310 --> 06:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely no motivation to uh contract
 
06:10:42.190 --> 06:10:42.200 align:start position:0%
with us that's why nobody's in network
 
06:10:44.910 --> 06:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
with them and you know I know from my
 
06:10:46.468 --> 06:10:46.478 align:start position:0%
discussions because I also serve on the
 
06:10:48.070 --> 06:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
board of Massachusetts as largest
 
06:10:50.190 --> 06:10:50.200 align:start position:0%
Ambulance Company I would get paid the
 
06:10:52.948 --> 06:10:52.958 align:start position:0%
exact same rate in downtown Boston that
 
06:10:55.670 --> 06:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
I would in the northernmost reaches of
 
06:10:58.150 --> 06:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and it's that way because
 
06:11:00.110 --> 06:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
again there are no requirements of
 
06:11:02.910 --> 06:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
network adequacy uh on insurance plans
 
06:11:06.708 --> 06:11:06.718 align:start position:0%
here in the state um the next thing and
 
06:11:08.390 --> 06:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
part of that challenge uh Chris
 
06:11:10.788 --> 06:11:10.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned this when it comes to cost
 
06:11:13.150 --> 06:11:13.160 align:start position:0%
studies I work in urban areas in New
 
06:11:15.390 --> 06:11:15.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I work in very very rural
 
06:11:18.750 --> 06:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
areas in New Hampshire in my very rural
 
06:11:21.430 --> 06:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
areas I did the math yesterday it cost
 
06:11:22.270 --> 06:11:22.280 align:start position:0%
me about
 
06:11:26.270 --> 06:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
$1,100 every time I transport a patient
 
06:11:28.708 --> 06:11:28.718 align:start position:0%
and urban areas it cost me between $3
 
06:11:31.510 --> 06:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
and $400 every time I transport a
 
06:11:34.868 --> 06:11:34.878 align:start position:0%
patient um and so there are huge swings
 
06:11:38.910 --> 06:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
in my cost and every time I have seen an
 
06:11:41.510 --> 06:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
insurance com uh a study out of the
 
06:11:43.190 --> 06:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
insurance commissioner's office and
 
06:11:44.430 --> 06:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
they've been great studies but they've
 
06:11:47.310 --> 06:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
never focused on the cost of providing
 
06:11:50.190 --> 06:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
this service and you've heard for 45th
 
06:11:52.190 --> 06:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
parallel the costs are
 
06:11:55.390 --> 06:11:55.400 align:start position:0%
stratospheric um so I say all of this
 
06:11:57.990 --> 06:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
because I can certainly understand the
 
06:11:59.708 --> 06:11:59.718 align:start position:0%
problem and challenge of balance billing
 
06:12:01.628 --> 06:12:01.638 align:start position:0%
like I told you I live here so I've
 
06:12:03.948 --> 06:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
gotten yelled at for many a balance bill
 
06:12:05.230 --> 06:12:05.240 align:start position:0%
that we've sent out it's why we no
 
06:12:08.670 --> 06:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
longer do it um but I think there has to
 
06:12:11.430 --> 06:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
be some fairness because otherwise with
 
06:12:13.190 --> 06:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies I suspect will
 
06:12:15.070 --> 06:12:15.080 align:start position:0%
do is next year they'll pay me two and a
 
06:12:17.150 --> 06:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
half percent less and am I really going
 
06:12:18.590 --> 06:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
to appeal it is the insurance
 
06:12:20.350 --> 06:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner going to support me and you
 
06:12:22.390 --> 06:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
know it's it's a hard battle and then
 
06:12:25.110 --> 06:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
the year after that it'll be 2.1% less
 
06:12:26.510 --> 06:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
and then the year after that it'll be
 
06:12:30.468 --> 06:12:30.478 align:start position:0%
1.6% less and it'll quickly make EMS in
 
06:12:32.990 --> 06:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh simply not work it
 
06:12:36.150 --> 06:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
barely works today so if you're going to
 
06:12:38.230 --> 06:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
move forward with something like this
 
06:12:40.110 --> 06:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
two suggestions that I would ask you to
 
06:12:43.190 --> 06:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
consider is one it shouldn't be solely
 
06:12:45.070 --> 06:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
the insurance commissioner's uh
 
06:12:46.990 --> 06:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
prerogative there should also be a
 
06:12:48.510 --> 06:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
representative from the commissioner of
 
06:12:51.270 --> 06:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
safety uh because Mr romanello
 
06:12:52.468 --> 06:12:52.478 align:start position:0%
understands that there's huge
 
06:12:54.910 --> 06:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
differences in the cost of Readiness for
 
06:12:56.990 --> 06:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
Rural communities versus urban
 
06:12:58.590 --> 06:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
communities and I don't think that is
 
06:13:00.390 --> 06:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
understood necessarily by the insurance
 
06:13:01.788 --> 06:13:01.798 align:start position:0%
department they're wonderful people it's
 
06:13:04.708 --> 06:13:04.718 align:start position:0%
just not what they do uh and secondly I
 
06:13:06.230 --> 06:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
think you would have to put a provision
 
06:13:08.708 --> 06:13:08.718 align:start position:0%
in a bill like this that requires
 
06:13:10.510 --> 06:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
insurance companies to have some level
 
06:13:12.910 --> 06:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
of adequacy throughout the state so that
 
06:13:14.910 --> 06:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
they do have to have some sort of a
 
06:13:17.030 --> 06:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
contract with people in The Lakes Region
 
06:13:21.150 --> 06:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
and and you know in Coos County so that
 
06:13:23.150 --> 06:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
right now when we negotiate with these
 
06:13:25.390 --> 06:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
insurance companies it's all me sitting
 
06:13:26.948 --> 06:13:26.958 align:start position:0%
there going you know please will you
 
06:13:28.910 --> 06:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
give me and they don't care if you
 
06:13:30.788 --> 06:13:30.798 align:start position:0%
required them to have a network they're
 
06:13:32.230 --> 06:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
going to have to come to the table and
 
06:13:34.548 --> 06:13:34.558 align:start position:0%
they're going to be motivated to to work
 
06:13:36.708 --> 06:13:36.718 align:start position:0%
with us too so that's it it's a snowy
 
06:13:38.628 --> 06:13:38.638 align:start position:0%
day I'll cut my comments off at that for
 
06:13:39.868 --> 06:13:39.878 align:start position:0%
all of you but thank you all for your
 
06:13:41.910 --> 06:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
time I greatly appreciate it yeah but
 
06:13:44.510 --> 06:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
before I let you go you you really are
 
06:13:46.030 --> 06:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
balance billing you're balance billing
 
06:13:47.750 --> 06:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
the towns
 
06:13:50.750 --> 06:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
not yeah that is absolutely true so the
 
06:13:53.150 --> 06:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
the town it's a good point the towns
 
06:13:56.948 --> 06:13:56.958 align:start position:0%
that cost me over $1,000 a call
 
06:13:59.110 --> 06:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
like the Lakes Region towns where I live
 
06:14:01.150 --> 06:14:01.160 align:start position:0%
they pay me annual subsidies of about
 
06:14:03.788 --> 06:14:03.798 align:start position:0%
$600,000 a year so the taxpayers are
 
06:14:06.350 --> 06:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
balance billing it in communities like
 
06:14:08.430 --> 06:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
say summersworth which is a city with a
 
06:14:11.830 --> 06:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
high degree of call volume um they have
 
06:14:14.030 --> 06:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
the volume that like Manchester and
 
06:14:16.590 --> 06:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
nashaa we don't charge summersworth a
 
06:14:18.670 --> 06:14:18.680 align:start position:0%
subsidy they get that service for free
 
06:14:19.990 --> 06:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
so you're absolutely right chairman
 
06:14:21.510 --> 06:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
there is balance billing but it's the
 
06:14:24.548 --> 06:14:24.558 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that get balance built right
 
06:14:26.868 --> 06:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
06:14:30.750 --> 06:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
uh see no questions okay last last
 
06:14:33.548 --> 06:14:33.558 align:start position:0%
person up David talber and I see that
 
06:14:36.948 --> 06:14:36.958 align:start position:0%
you got yourself all ready and raring to
 
06:14:40.310 --> 06:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
go uh thank you Mr chairman uh my name
 
06:14:42.670 --> 06:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
is David tabber I am the chief of
 
06:14:44.670 --> 06:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
Lynnwood ambulance in Lincoln and
 
06:14:47.150 --> 06:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
Woodstock uh I thank the former
 
06:14:48.830 --> 06:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative for speaking on our
 
06:14:52.590 --> 06:14:52.600 align:start position:0%
behalf earlier I'm a 30-year resident of
 
06:14:56.868 --> 06:14:56.878 align:start position:0%
Conway and used to work with Dr baros uh
 
06:14:59.548 --> 06:14:59.558 align:start position:0%
providing EMS in the Conway area for
 
06:15:03.788 --> 06:15:03.798 align:start position:0%
many many years um there is a huge
 
06:15:03.798 --> 06:15:05.270 align:start position:0%
many many years um there is a huge
disparity

06:15:05.270 --> 06:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
disparity
 
06:15:09.150 --> 06:15:09.160 align:start position:0%
between uh the cost of service between
 
06:15:11.590 --> 06:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
the various services in the state and
 
06:15:13.948 --> 06:15:13.958 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm very concerned as the last
 
06:15:17.150 --> 06:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
speaker said about simply the insurance
 
06:15:20.750 --> 06:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
companies having all the power to set
 
06:15:23.628 --> 06:15:23.638 align:start position:0%
the rates uh we are a volunteer
 
06:15:26.868 --> 06:15:26.878 align:start position:0%
nonprofit service so we get a a small
 
06:15:29.708 --> 06:15:29.718 align:start position:0%
small subsidy from the Two Towns we do
 
06:15:33.708 --> 06:15:33.718 align:start position:0%
not balance bill um State residents uh
 
06:15:36.468 --> 06:15:36.478 align:start position:0%
but we're also a huge tourist town and
 
06:15:40.030 --> 06:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
when we pick up 130 40 people from the
 
06:15:43.190 --> 06:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
two skas in our jurisdiction every year
 
06:15:45.190 --> 06:15:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh and they happen to live out of state
 
06:15:47.468 --> 06:15:47.478 align:start position:0%
we often collect nothing because the
 
06:15:51.390 --> 06:15:51.400 align:start position:0%
insurance companies pay them pay the uh
 
06:15:53.670 --> 06:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
policy owner and a policy owner Pockets
 
06:15:56.670 --> 06:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
it and we have no uh way to go
 
06:15:58.390 --> 06:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
go after them out of
 
06:16:01.070 --> 06:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
state uh so there's a huge issue there
 
06:16:03.390 --> 06:16:03.400 align:start position:0%
too when you talk about how we cost
 
06:16:05.948 --> 06:16:05.958 align:start position:0%
shifting it's cost shifted onto our
 
06:16:08.270 --> 06:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
volunteers um our volunteers who stand
 
06:16:12.430 --> 06:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
by to respond to these calls um that and
 
06:16:14.830 --> 06:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
and these huge Readiness costs of having
 
06:16:18.910 --> 06:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
standby ambulances we have a 26 27 mile
 
06:16:21.430 --> 06:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
oneway run to each of our hospitals it
 
06:16:23.150 --> 06:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
makes for a two-hour run for our
 
06:16:24.910 --> 06:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
volunteers round
 
06:16:27.948 --> 06:16:27.958 align:start position:0%
trip uh a long dead leg where the
 
06:16:30.350 --> 06:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
ambulance is out of service so we have
 
06:16:32.390 --> 06:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
second and even a third ambulance here
 
06:16:34.468 --> 06:16:34.478 align:start position:0%
in a town that really doesn't justify it
 
06:16:36.390 --> 06:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
for the call volume because there's no
 
06:16:38.670 --> 06:16:38.680 align:start position:0%
nearby Mutual Aid
 
06:16:41.430 --> 06:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
geographically uh and and we don't have
 
06:16:44.548 --> 06:16:44.558 align:start position:0%
the call volume to put in an AMR or a
 
06:16:46.070 --> 06:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
service that's actually going to make
 
06:16:49.230 --> 06:16:49.240 align:start position:0%
money by volume uh so we have huge
 
06:16:54.030 --> 06:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:57.030 --> 06:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
this great thank you
 
06:16:59.788 --> 06:16:59.798 align:start position:0%
uh any questions from committee
 
06:17:02.270 --> 06:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
members see none we thank you very much
 
06:17:03.628 --> 06:17:03.638 align:start position:0%
for your testimony I appreciate you
 
06:17:07.030 --> 06:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
coming on and I have no more hands up so
 
06:17:10.590 --> 06:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
I guess that's a good sign um and I know
 
06:17:12.468 --> 06:17:12.478 align:start position:0%
you guys are all interested to hear
 
06:17:15.910 --> 06:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
what's happened on the blue list so uh
 
06:17:17.708 --> 06:17:17.718 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of names here and I I
 
06:17:21.430 --> 06:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
would say chy they're all 603 so we
 
06:17:23.430 --> 06:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about out of state
 
06:17:25.510 --> 06:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
people they're all on there there's a
 
06:17:29.190 --> 06:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
handful of other Oddball um area codes
 
06:17:30.670 --> 06:17:30.680 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the one way I get to
 
06:17:32.150 --> 06:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
track to see if where they're really
 
06:17:33.990 --> 06:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
calling from but or where they're where
 
06:17:36.708 --> 06:17:36.718 align:start position:0%
they're coming from but uh the upshot is
 
06:17:42.230 --> 06:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
there are uh 38 people in support 25
 
06:17:46.910 --> 06:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
opposed and four neutral and that
 
06:17:50.788 --> 06:17:50.798 align:start position:0%
is what blue sheet has um having no more
 
06:17:52.590 --> 06:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
testimony we will close the public
 
06:17:57.390 --> 06:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 343
 
06:18:01.910 --> 06:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:06.350 --> 06:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
day okay um so uh any questions or
 
06:18:09.070 --> 06:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
comments or anybody um want to reflect
 
06:18:11.230 --> 06:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
before we we say goodbye and do this
 
06:18:13.670 --> 06:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
again tomorrow and nine
 
06:18:16.990 --> 06:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
o'clock uh yes representative abson yeah
 
06:18:19.948 --> 06:18:19.958 align:start position:0%
Mr chair are we going to um break all of
 
06:18:21.190 --> 06:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
these bills up into their various
 
06:18:22.708 --> 06:18:22.718 align:start position:0%
subcommittees or are some just going to
 
06:18:25.548 --> 06:18:25.558 align:start position:0%
be do you think well as I said before
 
06:18:27.590 --> 06:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
we're really don't have time for
 
06:18:30.150 --> 06:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittees um you we're not so at
 
06:18:33.590 --> 06:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
this point uh unless the bill is just
 
06:18:35.190 --> 06:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
needs a little tweaking here or there I
 
06:18:37.948 --> 06:18:37.958 align:start position:0%
mean a bill like this I mean um the best
 
06:18:40.350 --> 06:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
we can do is retain it and um and and
 
06:18:43.150 --> 06:18:43.160 align:start position:0%
work on it come September um you know
 
06:18:46.310 --> 06:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
that you in terms of we you you got to
 
06:18:48.390 --> 06:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
vote either up or down or or we're
 
06:18:50.030 --> 06:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
retaining and so any bill that's going
 
06:18:51.948 --> 06:18:51.958 align:start position:0%
to need amendments or something I really
 
06:18:53.990 --> 06:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
think we're g to just end up retaining
 
06:18:57.350 --> 06:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
it fair enough so uh representative
 
06:18:59.830 --> 06:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
burrow yes thank you just a house quick
 
06:19:02.788 --> 06:19:02.798 align:start position:0%
housekeeping question just curious on um
 
06:19:05.150 --> 06:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
Commerce do you ever Institute time
 
06:19:07.468 --> 06:19:07.478 align:start position:0%
limits for people
 
06:19:11.030 --> 06:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
testifying um I generally have said you
 
06:19:14.830 --> 06:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
know myself I'm I I'm pretty good never
 
06:19:17.030 --> 06:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
perfect I'm pretty good of scheduling
 
06:19:19.548 --> 06:19:19.558 align:start position:0%
enough time so that we don't have a
 
06:19:22.628 --> 06:19:22.638 align:start position:0%
problem um I would say there have been
 
06:19:25.350 --> 06:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
times where I would say to people uh
 
06:19:27.628 --> 06:19:27.638 align:start position:0%
please don't repeat the testimony that
 
06:19:29.548 --> 06:19:29.558 align:start position:0%
we've already heard so if you got
 
06:19:32.030 --> 06:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
something new to say great uh but that
 
06:19:34.750 --> 06:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
you know and and that and I and and I
 
06:19:37.708 --> 06:19:37.718 align:start position:0%
would say you know over my my many years
 
06:19:40.548 --> 06:19:40.558 align:start position:0%
of being a chairman it usually time it
 
06:19:42.070 --> 06:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
time it pretty closely I got it PR you
 
06:19:43.830 --> 06:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
know pretty good but there have been
 
06:19:45.868 --> 06:19:45.878 align:start position:0%
times where I've had to tell people to
 
06:19:48.708 --> 06:19:48.718 align:start position:0%
to uh please be a model of brevity or
 
06:19:51.510 --> 06:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
just submit written testimony but hasn't
 
06:19:54.510 --> 06:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
thanks for that yeah yes representative
 
06:19:57.990 --> 06:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
pus also uh in a lot of cases where we
 
06:20:02.190 --> 06:20:02.200 align:start position:0%
have received testimony via email uh
 
06:20:04.628 --> 06:20:04.638 align:start position:0%
when we have we were when we were in 302
 
06:20:06.110 --> 06:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of the people who come in to
 
06:20:09.350 --> 06:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
testify want to read the exact same
 
06:20:11.150 --> 06:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
thing that we've already been emailed
 
06:20:14.670 --> 06:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
and I know the chairman tries to push
 
06:20:16.910 --> 06:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
them off from doing that
 
06:20:19.430 --> 06:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
also right well I would say that um
 
06:20:23.150 --> 06:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
another feature of the um of the card we
 
06:20:26.788 --> 06:20:26.798 align:start position:0%
had was um the hum the person says how
 
06:20:29.110 --> 06:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
much time they're going to have and I
 
06:20:30.510 --> 06:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
would say this the sheet that I'm
 
06:20:34.030 --> 06:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
getting uh it is there um it's a very
 
06:20:37.830 --> 06:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
small print so but fortunately uh I have
 
06:20:41.070 --> 06:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
biocal contact lenses so I can see and
 
06:20:42.708 --> 06:20:42.718 align:start position:0%
and most people were you know say five
 
06:20:44.708 --> 06:20:44.718 align:start position:0%
or two minutes or they just say zero
 
06:20:46.750 --> 06:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
minutes and I know that that that ain't
 
06:20:50.070 --> 06:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
true but uh but I I I would say whenever
 
06:20:51.590 --> 06:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
I would see someone who put in a big
 
06:20:54.350 --> 06:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
long you know 10 15 I would I would tell
 
06:20:58.708 --> 06:20:58.718 align:start position:0%
them to cut it so are you all set max or
 
06:20:59.948 --> 06:20:59.958 align:start position:0%
you just haven't taken your hand down or
 
06:21:01.230 --> 06:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
do you have something else you want to
 
06:21:01.240 --> 06:21:03.310 align:start position:0%
do you have something else you want to
ask

06:21:03.310 --> 06:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
ask
 
06:21:06.990 --> 06:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
me okay perfect okay we'll see you all
 
06:21:16.990 --> 06:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:17.000 --> 06:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
byebye
