billion
 
00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:10.719 align:start position:0%
665 million and as you see
 
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
federal funds are a very big piece
 
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
normally they run around 30 percent this
 
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
year they went up to 31.5 some of this
 
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
was the cares act recovery funds
 
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
that are coming in we don't have all the
 
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
american recovery act
 
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
um funds yet and we so we can't put them
 
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
in the budget we don't know the strings
 
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
on them we don't know
 
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
all that details but this is because
 
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
something you may have heard of fnap
 
00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
assistance percentage it went up a
 
00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
little bit on several categories
 
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
due to the cares act bringing it to 31.5
 
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
then education trust fund again is a big
 
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.229 align:start position:0%
then education trust fund again is a big
piece

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 align:start position:0%
piece
 
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
15 and a half percent add that to the
 
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.430 align:start position:0%
15 and a half percent add that to the
general

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
fund of 25.3 they're also
 
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
a major part of this budget other funds
 
00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 align:start position:0%
there's too many to mention but this
 
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
includes the
 
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
tuition in the community colleges it's
 
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
fines and fees in some cases it's a lot
 
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.429 align:start position:0%
fines and fees in some cases it's a lot
of

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 align:start position:0%
200 separate different little things
 
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
including interest on
 
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
on the monies the treasurer holds and so
 
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.950 align:start position:0%
on the monies the treasurer holds and so
on

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh liquor fund that's that's the
 
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
profit from selling liquor in our state
 
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 align:start position:0%

sweepstakes fund for
 
00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
a point two percent so those are the
 
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
sources that help make up this 13
 
00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
the operating budget
 
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
of unrestricted revenue again we're back
 
00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
to the general funds
 
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
to show you where we collected them and
 
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
what our major
 
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
sources of funds are business profits
 
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.830 align:start position:0%

tax
 
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
being the biggest one at 27.8 percent
 
00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 align:start position:0%
next would in the business enterprise
 
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
tax we usually group those together when
 
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
we're doing total revenue
 
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
that's only 2.7 about 10 percent of the
 
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
business profits tax
 
00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
liquor sales 8.1 percent

court fines and fees 0.7 percent
 
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
securities revenue those are the
 
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
registration fees for
 
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
mutual funds that want to be sold in our
 
00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 align:start position:0%
state have to pay a registration fee
 
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
that brings in two and a half percent of
 
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
the revenue about 84 million
 
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
insurance tax brings in 262 million
 
00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
7.7 there's a tax on every insurance
 
00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
policy sold

communications tax that's on your phone
 
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
bill there's a couple places
 
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
that brings in 77.6 million 2.3 percent
 
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
the beer tax it's pretty obvious where
 
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
that comes from
 
00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
26 million medicaid recoveries
 
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's a complicated uh
 
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
formula run through hhs and we get about
 
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
6.2 million back from that real estate
 
00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
transfer tax
 
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
at seven percent you'll hear about that
 
00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
on your county budgets
 
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax brings in eight percent that
 
00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 align:start position:0%
had a pretty big year this last year
 
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
and then meals and rooms tax another
 
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
major one 20
 
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
of the revenue that comes in so
 
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
i like these pie charts because they
 
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
give you a pretty good idea of
 
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
how all the different pieces fit
 
00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 align:start position:0%
together and
 
00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
where they all come from and where they
 
00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
all go out so now
 
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask the division chairs to
 
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.509 align:start position:0%

in the sections of the budgets that were
 
00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 align:start position:0%

from the division one that's up there
 
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
we have made a number of changes the
 
00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
first bullet point
 
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
talks about 1.7 million dollars
 
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
of errors that were in the das budget
 
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
they were double budgeted for 600 plus
 
00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of maintenance to
 
00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:28.790 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of maintenance to
buildings

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
if you look at the third bullet point
 
00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 align:start position:0%
cyber security was budgeted in error in
 
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
their budget which was another 600 plus
 
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and if you look at the
 
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
fourth bullet point
 
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
there was 517 thousand dollars that was
 
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.510 align:start position:0%
there was 517 thousand dollars that was
double

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
double
 
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
budgeted prematurely for the law
 
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement commission
 
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
once we corrected all of those we were
 
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
able to restore the 20 positions that
 
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
had been laid off
 
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
because of the double budgeting the last
 
00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
bullet point talks about the lakeshore
 
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
redevelopment planning commission that
 
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
has been
 
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
working for a long time on the lakeshore
 
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
region facility which the state wishes
 
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:07.670 align:start position:0%
region facility which the state wishes
to

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
sell and which would save over five
 
00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars a year
 
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
in doit we restored four positions
 
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
that would provide support to conflict
 
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
in dra we funded two we're working on
 
00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
another class
 
00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
positions that will collect an
 
00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
additional three million
 
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
in state revenue but there's a stream
 
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
going on
 
00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
fully fund flood control programs which
 
00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:37.350 align:start position:0%
fully fund flood control programs which
is

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
1.8 million this goes to our towns
 
00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
and cities state treasury distributes
 
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 align:start position:0%

this was an increase of 15 million over
 
00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
the prior biennium
 
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
for this statutory district distribution
 
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 align:start position:0%

because of the pandemic where we were
 
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
expecting really low revenues
 
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
all of the vocational training and the

branch
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
and the reason we did that it is the
 
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
judicial branch that determines
 
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
when prisoners are transferred and how
 
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
much security they need
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
in each courthouse at the same time the

state law says
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
that the money budgeted will be spent
 
00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
and if it more money is needed then they
 
00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
prorate the amount given to the
 
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
counties we did not want to cut the
 
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
county budgets this will allow the
 
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.830 align:start position:0%

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
branch
 
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
that does the spending to allocate and
 
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
watch the budget we also provided
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
the supreme court the authority to
 
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
transfer funds within the judicial

branch's budget as
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
deemed necessary this has worked well
 
00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
in the past such transfers in excess of
 
00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand dollars
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
will require approval of the fiscal
 
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:10.840 align:start position:0%

agencies
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
we fully funded the department of
 
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
military affairs and veteran services
 
00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
including new staff
 
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
we also provided that they will start to

we also provided that they will start to
coordinate

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
coordinate
 
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
mental health programs and will
 
00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
collaborate with the va
 
00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:27.919 align:start position:0%
there are some new programs being
 
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
proposed by the va
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
that would benefit veterans in our

the department of agriculture and
 
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
markets and food was also fully funded
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
and in addition the house passed a bill
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
creating a database for animal records
 
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
for transferring money from certain
 
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.310 align:start position:0%
for transferring money from certain
funds

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
this budget makes the required
 
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the maintenance of
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
this database
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
in the department of justice we
 
00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:55.670 align:start position:0%
in the department of justice we
recognize

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
general fund savings of 278 000
 
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
by delaying the start of a new program
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
and two new attorney positions
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
in many cases the department of justice
 
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
is not able to hire
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
all new attorney positions at the
 
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
beginning of the fiscal year i.e july
 
00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:15.910 align:start position:0%
beginning of the fiscal year i.e july
1st

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
1st
 
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
this allows them time to create all of
 
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
those job descriptions
 
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
get the paperwork done and bring them on
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
at the beginning
 
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
of january however it does give us the
 
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.389 align:start position:0%
of january however it does give us the
savings

00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
savings
 
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
the banking department also fully funded
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
ask that we
 
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
change the charge for the public deposit
 
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
investment pool because there was a
 
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.790 align:start position:0%
investment pool because there was a
conflict

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
for the department's role in regulating
 
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
state chartered entities
 
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner's role in
 
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
supporting the public deposit
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
investment pool we did support that
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
in the liquor commission we amended the
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
state liquor laws i have to thank
 
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative peter leishman who did a
 
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
lot of work in this area
 
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to change the enforcement
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
division from a quote-unquote police
 
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.550 align:start position:0%
division from a quote-unquote police
division

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
division
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
to a licensing and education division
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
which is what we intended them to be
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
the uniform positions will end on
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
december 31st 2021
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
and that provides six months for the
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
officers to join other police entities
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
while fully funding all the positions
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
that have to be paid for paying
 
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
accumulated leave
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
and other termination costs as mentioned
 
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
the department of energy
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
was formed using osi
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
and the puc this proposes an energy
 
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
department which combines not only the
 
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
puc and osi but also the consumer
 
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.310 align:start position:0%
puc and osi but also the consumer
advocate

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
and has long been supported by the
 
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate is the best way
 
00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
to go for the consumers in our state
 
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee work will be
 
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
done by this agency
 
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
and the house finance amendment makes
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
technical corrections
 
00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
to the proposed language and move some
 
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920 align:start position:0%

area
 
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
it also eliminates some positions
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
in the department of corrections we
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
restored the transitional housing

in manchester traditional housing costs
 
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
significantly less to operate than
 
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
keeping a person
 
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
in a prison bed without this resource
 
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
there is no way for our prisoners to

there is no way for our prisoners to

transition
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
back to normal living make sure that
 
00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839 align:start position:0%
they get a job
 
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
take care of themselves this will reduce

take care of themselves this will reduce
recidivism

recidivism
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
it restores the transitional housing

these long-standing educational programs
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
at the state prisons have reduced
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
recidivism and contributed to a person's

is critical
 
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
because we frequently have a high staff

was

also support
 
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240 align:start position:0%

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
years in advance exactly how much
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
funding they will need so they can come
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
to fiscal committee to get more funding
 
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
in the department of business and
 
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
economic affairs we increase the funding
 
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
small business development center they
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
will now have 225 thousand dollars in

each of the two years
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
the last year for which they we they
 
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
spent money
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
they spent 160 000 so we funded them
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
at more than they last spent
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
we did this by reducing for 400 000
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
from the money which was 17 million that
 
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
was budget for
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
for travel and tourism in the

department of environmental services
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
we reluctantly suspended the state aid
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
grants for the biennium
 
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
however we think
 
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
that the economy is going to be stronger
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
than the revenue plan
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
that was presented to the house by the
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
house ways and meats
 
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
so we added a section in house bill
 
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
that will allow the des commissioner to
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
come to the fiscal committee every six
 
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.750 align:start position:0%
come to the fiscal committee every six

00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:38.959 align:start position:0%
and request unrestrict unrestricted

revenue above the revenue plan
 
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
and pay for these grants it was our
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
intention to show
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
that the legislature supports these
 
00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:49.519 align:start position:0%
grants and supports payment of these
 
00:14:49.519 --> 00:14:50.949 align:start position:0%
grants and supports payment of these

revenue estimates we fully fund
 
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
highway block grants this is money that
 
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
goes to cities and towns
 
00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839 align:start position:0%
and this was budgeted at 68.1 million

again the pandemic had an impact on
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
enrollments but it allows the doe
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
to make certain adjustments to the free
 
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640 align:start position:0%

calculating adequate education grants
 
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
this would provide approximately 6.

one position
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
in the forensic lab these positions will
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
help to
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
meet demand and prevent delays and

healthier than it's been
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
in years we provided approximately 1.2
 
00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:15.830 align:start position:0%
in years we provided approximately 1.2
million

in general funds over the biennium
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
and this money 100 000 per year
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
it excuse me is for non-game species
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
and 500 000 per year for
 
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh to help with the enforcement
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
and the fish and game fund is projected
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
to have a surplus
 
00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:41.400 align:start position:0%

2023
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not exactly sure how far back you'd
 
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
have to go
 
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
to find fish and game with a surplus

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
we supported the governor's recommended

funding levels
 
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
including 210 000 over the biennium for
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
purposes of providing

and again this was a recommendation out
 
00:25:10.159 --> 00:25:10.630 align:start position:0%
and again this was a recommendation out
of

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%

00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:18.559 align:start position:0%
finally although not agency specific
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
uh we me we made no changes to the

00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
also we are forming a commission to
 
00:25:53.279 --> 00:25:54.830 align:start position:0%
also we are forming a commission to
develop

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%

00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
to fund the proposed entity in
 
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh division three
 
00:26:41.909 --> 00:26:41.919 align:start position:0%
let's start stop there and note that
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
division three starts with a table and
 
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
the reason we start with the table
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
is because this table tells a huge
 
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
part of our overall story of what we've
 
00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.269 align:start position:0%
part of our overall story of what we've
done

00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh in division three this uh term uh
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
if you if you look to the left you'll
 
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
see in the 2018 and 19 budget
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
where we ended at about 723 million
 
00:27:05.279 --> 00:27:06.470 align:start position:0%
where we ended at about 723 million
dollars

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
and then in the current budget that
 
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
we're in
 
00:27:14.669 --> 00:27:14.679 align:start position:0%
there was a massive unsustainable
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
unrealistic growth rate of 17.4 percent
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
so one of the first strategic decisions
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
that we took was how do we get this
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
unsustainable growth under control
 
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
and when you take a look at what we did
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
in fy 22
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
and 23 it's still growing
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
at 3.7 percent but we did bend the cost
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
curve down
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
considerably dramatically but for some
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
of you who aren't happy with a 3.7
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
percent increase
 
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
let me just put that into perspective
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
we've had a large number
 
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
of new clients enter into
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
the health and social services arena of
 
00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.510 align:start position:0%
the health and social services arena of
our

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
state due to the pandemic and so if you
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
take a look at
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
client increases throughout the system
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
you'll see that there's more demand for
 
00:28:11.919 --> 00:28:13.190 align:start position:0%
you'll see that there's more demand for
services

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
so so the three percent the 3.7 percent
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
i think is
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
a responsible provision of direct
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
health care services to the residents of
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%
so overall the compound growth rate went
 
00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
up 4.9 percent
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
per year so if you go back to the
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
previous budget
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
go through the current budget and go to
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
the end of the proposed budget
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
the growth rate overall on a compounded
 
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
basis is 4.9 percent
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
i think that's still unsustainable but
 
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
it's a good start
 
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
in just one budget so on the next
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
page if we could scroll down to
 
00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
yeah there we go thank you the
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
first paragraph provides a lot of those
 
00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:06.559 align:start position:0%
same percentages we just went over using
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
words so i won't
 
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
re-state all that to you the second
 
00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.230 align:start position:0%
re-state all that to you the second
bullet

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
bullet
 
00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799 align:start position:0%
down where it talks about incorporating
 
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
a back of the budget reduction of 30
 
00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.149 align:start position:0%
a back of the budget reduction of 30
million

00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh even after that 30 million
 
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
we still funded a growth rate of 3.7
 
00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.149 align:start position:0%
we still funded a growth rate of 3.7
percent

00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
so what we've done though is we've
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
set some very clear priorities on what
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
parts of the department ought to come
 
00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:35.990 align:start position:0%
parts of the department ought to come
first

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
and we listed them and you can read them
 
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
there yourselves
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
they are direct service provision
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
so we ex exempt developmental services
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
including the acquired brain disorder
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
services and children's
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
income support services the children's
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
health insurance program and county
 
00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:55.909 align:start position:0%
health insurance program and county
programs

00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
to include the state share of funding
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
for nursing homes
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
so so we've set some real priorities on
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
on where this money and personnel ought
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
to go
 
00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:09.919 align:start position:0%
and for those who are concerned that
 
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
we haven't given adequate guidance to
 
00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
the department uh i would just want to
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
point out
 
00:30:18.789 --> 00:30:18.799 align:start position:0%
that if you go through the briefing
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
books that we've been provided
 
00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
there's probably a hundred federal and
 
00:30:24.159 --> 00:30:25.110 align:start position:0%
there's probably a hundred federal and
state

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:30:28.269 --> 00:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
laws that they have to comply with
 
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
dhhs is not suffering from a lack of
 
00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:32.950 align:start position:0%
dhhs is not suffering from a lack of
guidance

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
and and that's before you start to get
 
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
to the regulations
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
so so what this back of the budget cut
 
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
does is it says to the leadership
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
in the department of health and human
 
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
services we trust you
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
we think you're competent we think
 
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
you're leaders
 
00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
we want you to go through and
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
reprioritize using the
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
growth and resources that we've given
 
00:30:59.120 --> 00:30:59.909 align:start position:0%
growth and resources that we've given
you

00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
so that we do the most care for the most
 
00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:06.559 align:start position:0%
number of our residents you get to the
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
next line
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
the next line down starts to talk about
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
a second back of the budget cut
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
this is a a reduction
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
on paper it's a paper reduction
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
otherwise known as a paper cut
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
and paper cuts they don't hurt as much
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
as they
 
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
actually feel at the moment but
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
let's let's talk about some numbers that
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
aren't on here so if you're at home
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
with a pen i want you to write down that
 
00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.110 align:start position:0%
with a pen i want you to write down that
in

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
fy 19
 
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
the department was authorized 2
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
951 people
 
00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:48.799 align:start position:0%
as of 11 march of this year
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
they had on staff
 
00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
2 651.
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
so that's really simple math they were
 
00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:58.870 align:start position:0%
so that's really simple math they were
authorized

00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
300 more people than they've been able
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
to hire
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
so so we we can start to see immediately
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
that the reality of workforce shortages
 
00:32:13.509 --> 00:32:13.519 align:start position:0%
around the state and combined with the
 
00:32:13.519 --> 00:32:14.149 align:start position:0%
around the state and combined with the
pandemic

00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
of course and the governor's hiring
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
freeze has made it
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
so that the department is
 
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
understaffed to the tune of about 300
 
00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
people based on the fy 19
 
00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
levels so so
 
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
the governor had proposed raising that
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
to 3226
 
00:32:36.149 --> 00:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
and it just seemed to me unrealistic
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
because we still have a workforce
 
00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:38.789 align:start position:0%
because we still have a workforce
shortage

00:32:38.789 --> 00:32:38.799 align:start position:0%
shortage
 
00:32:42.549 --> 00:32:42.559 align:start position:0%
so we reduced the maximum to
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
3 000. so that's 350 people
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
that the department can still hire on a
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
priority basis
 
00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:55.519 align:start position:0%
that's 350 people that represents 13
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
growth in the number of people working
 
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
in the department
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
i'm telling you if you go to any company
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
in the united states and tell them
 
00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
that you're going to let them hire 13
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
percent more people
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
it's an absolutely unheard of level of
 
00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.509 align:start position:0%
it's an absolutely unheard of level of
growth

00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
growth
 
00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
there is no cut there is no cut this is
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
a 13
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
growth in the number of people okay
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
so um next bullet down and i can start
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
moving from here because those are
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
really the two big things or three big
 
00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:26.630 align:start position:0%
really the two big things or three big
things

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
so we we uh we recognize that
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
um the department is asking for just an
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely enormous amount of money
 
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
to replace their i.t systems
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
and um and one of the reasons they need
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
so much money
 
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
is because they have a legacy system
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
that dates back to the early 2000s
 
00:33:52.149 --> 00:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
and it's and it's just out of date it's
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
out of
 
00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
maintenance and it's becoming a security
 
00:33:55.279 --> 00:33:56.070 align:start position:0%
maintenance and it's becoming a security
threat

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
threat
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
so they're going to have to run some
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
systems in parallel for a couple years
 
00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
in order to uh replace and modernize
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
so so there's money for that we
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
received very late in the process
 
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
a recommendation from alvarez and
 
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:20.079 align:start position:0%
do some management changes that would
 
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
result in some growth
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
the department had this for two weeks
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
longer than what they were able to
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
give it to us so in the last week we saw
 
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
the recommendation four of them jumped
 
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
out as making a lot of
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
sense because the payback period on
 
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
those was
 
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
over 3x the investment in
 
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
payback in two-year period so that was
 
00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:43.430 align:start position:0%
payback in two-year period so that was
smart

00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
smart
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
we deferred other parts of that study
 
00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:47.349 align:start position:0%
we deferred other parts of that study
because

00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
it was uh we just didn't have time to
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
redo the
 
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
their work and take a look at it so
 
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
with the dcyf um
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
the big decision is that we
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh in this budget are forcing the
 
00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.589 align:start position:0%
uh in this budget are forcing the
closure

00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
closure
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
of the sununu center in the second year
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
of the budget
 
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
that's going to free up over 12 million
 
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
we asked the department to provide us
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
with some recommendations on how we
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
could cut
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
the expenses this facility was initially
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
built for 144 people and we have a
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
census averaging between 10 and 16
 
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
with a recidivism rate of 60 percent
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
and so uh so this is expensive and not
 
00:35:33.599 --> 00:35:34.710 align:start position:0%
and so uh so this is expensive and not
effective

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
effective
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
um so we need to change what we're doing
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
and um and so one thing we did was and
 
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
we included an hb2
 
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
one of the house bills that came out of
 
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
children and family law i think either
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
unanimously or nearly unanimously
 
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
that would change the census even lower
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
to perhaps half
 
00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
as many kids and when asked the
 
00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:58.470 align:start position:0%
as many kids and when asked the
department

00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
um did not provide what their new
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
expense rates would be on a much lower
 
00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.150 align:start position:0%
expense rates would be on a much lower
census

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
census
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
and so um so we're just we're just going
 
00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:11.599 align:start position:0%
to have to try to force their hands
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
to shut sununu in the second year
 
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
now this was a moment of high
 
00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
bipartisanship in the committee
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
it was really kind of the highlight i
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
think of our getting along and
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
trying to do what's right for the
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
community so
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
so the division of economic and housing
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
stability there
 
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
um there's some federal money
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
called temporary assistance to needy
 
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:38.790 align:start position:0%
called temporary assistance to needy
families

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
and so we have some parents trying to go
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
back to work
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
and there's a wait list for people who
 
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
have employer-based
 
00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:50.079 align:start position:0%
problems with getting daycare
 
00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
so so this would authorize those
 
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
lists to be reduced by using the federal
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
tanf money
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that's good to get people
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
back to work
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
so uh the next one down on medicaid
 
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
business and policy
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
we fully recommend fully funded
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommendations on the
 
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
amount of money that we spend on managed
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
care and fee for service and children's
 
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
health insurance plans
 
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
so back to the personnel item for a
 
00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:22.710 align:start position:0%
so back to the personnel item for a
moment

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
moment
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
if you hear somebody saying that there's
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
not enough people at dhhs just remember
 
00:37:27.119 --> 00:37:27.510 align:start position:0%
not enough people at dhhs just remember
that

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
almost all the direct care gets
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
contracted out
 
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
the there's an enormous workforce that
 
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
you don't see
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
it's those people providing care
 
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
through contracts and and we're not
 
00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
cutting that at all
 
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
we're funding that at a very high level
 
00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.710 align:start position:0%
we're funding that at a very high level
um

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
let's see what else jumps out i'm going
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
to go down to elderly and adult services
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
this was a major policy move for us the
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
governor's budget came across
 
00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
it showed that the amount of money that
 
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
the counties would have to
 
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
pay for the nursing homes was going to
 
00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.870 align:start position:0%
pay for the nursing homes was going to
increase

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
their spending year to year by about 18
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
and when we asked rockingham county and
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county to tell us
 
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
the impact of that rockingham county
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
said that without a doubt
 
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
that would raise the force them to raise
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
the proper
 
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
the county share of their property taxes
 
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
to seven percent
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
or up seven percent so in order to
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
avoid a property tax increase we
 
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
ended up funding this aggressively to
 
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
where there's only a two percent
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh growth rate instead of the historic
 
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
three percent
 
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
that had been negotiated in other
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
budgets so this is one of those hidden
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
property tax cuts
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
that the legislature should claim credit
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
for but
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
um it's probably going to get lost in
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
the noise just know that
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
you're you're helping your taxpayers
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
right there
 
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
is it's fully funding the developmental
 
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
services it's fully funding
 
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
the acquired brain disorder services all
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
of these are coming across
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
at the governor's recommended levels so
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
so no cuts it it funds the children
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
in home support services that the
 
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended level two
 
00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
so there's no cuts then when we get to
 
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
the public health
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
the the big issue here really came
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
through in house bill 2 where
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
for years there's been a week
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
effort to make sure that our family
 
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:42.079 align:start position:0%
planning money
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
goes to council couples
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
on family planning and and that there's
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
there's meant to be a a prohibition of
 
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
using state
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
family planning money for any abortion
 
00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.390 align:start position:0%
family planning money for any abortion
services

00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
so while that provision has been in
 
00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:01.510 align:start position:0%
so while that provision has been in
place

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
the pro-life community has pointed out
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
that money is fungible
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
and it once you start paying these
 
00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.069 align:start position:0%
and it once you start paying these
centers

00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
centers
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
the money is going to help on the
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
abortion side of the clinic as well
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
and this has been denied every time the
 
00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:24.069 align:start position:0%
and this has been denied every time the
argument

00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
argument
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
comes up and there's a claim that
 
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
abortion doesn't receive a dime from the
 
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
family planning money
 
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
well so what an amendment does uh is
 
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
says that okay fine
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
we believe you let's just say that every
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
family planning program must have a
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
physical and financial separation from
 
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
the abortion services
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
that way we know that you're right and
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
what we've heard instead is that it's
 
00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely impossible
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're gonna hurt poor and
 
00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
underprivileged women because
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh we're gonna uh separate the family
 
00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:01.589 align:start position:0%
uh we're gonna uh separate the family
planning

00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
planning
 
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
from the abortion center and it just
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
can't be done well
 
00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
so which is it we've heard two stories
 
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
with equal passion
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
so which is it and i
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna i'm gonna skip on from
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
there there's more i could say
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
but because we're expecting
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
that there may be a change in who's
 
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
providing family planning services
 
00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
we've put fifty thousand dollars in
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
there to pay up to ten thousand dollar
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
bonuses for new awardees
 
00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
so uh so every every clinic
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
that's new and get to the family
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
planning contract
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
is eligible for up to ten thousand
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
dollars that'll help them with one-time
 
00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.430 align:start position:0%
dollars that'll help them with one-time
expenses

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
or um it just may be a bonus incentive
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
to compete
 
00:41:49.589 --> 00:41:49.599 align:start position:0%
now we've grown the family planning
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
money this is another thing you're going
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
to hear that we're cutting all these
 
00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:53.510 align:start position:0%
to hear that we're cutting all these
services

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
no in fy 19
 
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
we spent 596 000
 
00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
this year we're following the governor's
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
recommended budget of eight hundred and
 
00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
twelve thousand dollars that's a ten
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
percent per year
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
growth rate so we are fully funding we
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
are aggressively funding we are
 
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
happily funding family planning programs
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
we love our families we love our
 
00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:20.079 align:start position:0%
children and we want to help these young
 
00:42:20.079 --> 00:42:21.109 align:start position:0%
children and we want to help these young
families

00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh bring their families into existence
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
and to and to raise them well so that's
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
how we
 
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
we've invested in this budget
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
on the state mental health system
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
we supported the recommendation
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
to have some work for uh workforce
 
00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.589 align:start position:0%
to have some work for uh workforce
enhancements

00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
enhancements
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
to re to recruit and retain
 
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh more workers because they have such a
 
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
high vacancy rate there
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
we've uh also removed from hb2
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
um a paragraph that basically would have
 
00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:58.630 align:start position:0%
um a paragraph that basically would have
authorized

00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
a new 60 bed forensic mental health
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
hospital to be built on the grounds of
 
00:43:05.829 --> 00:43:05.839 align:start position:0%
the concord hospital
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
and this hadn't gone to public works it
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
hadn't gone to
 
00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
health and human services as a policy
 
00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:12.550 align:start position:0%
health and human services as a policy
issue

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
so since it was such a big deal and
 
00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
because it raised the
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
bed count from 25 to 60 with no
 
00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.430 align:start position:0%
bed count from 25 to 60 with no
explanation

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
and it included some bonding in there
 
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
that really is
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
beyond the scope of what we should be
 
00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
doing with
 
00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839 align:start position:0%
uh operating money we we pulled that out
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
and we're going to on the 12th have a
 
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh integrated meeting where hhs and
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
public works is going to come and listen
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
and we're going to spend the morning you
 
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
know trying to really understand
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
what's been going on and the extent to
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
which it's been coordinated with the
 
00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:46.390 align:start position:0%
which it's been coordinated with the
concord

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
concord
 
00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:50.230 align:start position:0%
concord
community

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
and in order to take care of our vets
 
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
we fully funded their expected
 
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
census of residents and and then that
 
00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
concludes it i guess i in conclusion
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
this is a realistic budget it's got
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
real growth in it it's got real
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
priorities in it
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
and it really respects the fact that we
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
have a great management team at dhhs
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
that knows how to establish priorities
 
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
and knows how to lead
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
because there's more than enough
 
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
resources for them to get the job done
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman edwards and now we're
 
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
going to move on to the surplus
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
statement this is a little bit technical
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
and complicated
 
00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
so we're going to call on the genius of
 
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.829 align:start position:0%
mike kane to explain page 19 and
subsequent

00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
subsequent
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
mr kane thank you representative
 
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is michael cain
 
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
i'm the legislative budget assistant
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
i'll just go through very quickly the
 
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
purpose of a
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
surplus statement for the general and
 
00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
education trust fund as well as the
 
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
highway and fish and game fund
 
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
is to illustrate that the legislatures
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
be at the house or the senate's budget
 
00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:11.839 align:start position:0%
is balanced uh pursuant to rsa 98
 
00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
b so right here in front of you
 
00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
it's a combined general education trust
 
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
fund in 21
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
the governor in house finance began with
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
a negative balance forward from 20 of
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
about 54.4 million dollars
 
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
a majority of that due to the revenue
 
00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:29.510 align:start position:0%
a majority of that due to the revenue
loss

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
loss
 
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
in fy 820 to the pandemic so a negative
 
00:45:36.309 --> 00:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
balance did carry forward into 21.
 
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
estimated revenues based on the latest
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
estimates provided by house ways and
 
00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.670 align:start position:0%
estimates provided by house ways and
means

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
means
 
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh in march i believe was march 18th
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
as well as a revenue adjustment which is
 
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
a restricted
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
revenue from the education trust fund to
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
fund the one-time
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity and foreign
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
youth lunch bump
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
that was provided for the last budget so
 
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
total revenues of about 2.78
 
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in the house finance
 
00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:05.829 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in the house finance
estimates

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:05.839 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
working with ways and means as far as
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
budget appropriations
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
in total uh approximately two billion
 
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
seven hundred twenty one
 
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
thousand seven hundred twenty seven
 
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
dollars in
 
00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
appropriations that includes about two
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
billion seven hundred and ninety six
 
00:46:21.839 --> 00:46:22.309 align:start position:0%
billion seven hundred and ninety six
million

00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:46:24.309 --> 00:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
in section one which is the large
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
portion or your state totals in house
 
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
bill one
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
as well as appropriation adjustments
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
which are in the subsequent schedule 2
 
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
again largest one being the offset of
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
the revenue of the 62.5 above
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
for the one-time education aim from the
 
00:46:41.589 --> 00:46:41.599 align:start position:0%
last biennium
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
that leads the current year balance of
 
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
about 66.47
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars across both the general
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
and education trust fund
 
00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
a cumulative ending balance of about
 
00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:53.990 align:start position:0%
a cumulative ending balance of about
12.066

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
12.066
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
million however uh the that is
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh split between the education trust
 
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
fund which has a positive 19
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
um million 896 million dollar balance
 
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
it is non-lapsing but 21 based on the
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
revenues just based on
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
today uh it's it's assumed that there'll
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
be a general fund
 
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
shortfall of about 7.8 million dollars
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
if revenues do come in under plan
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
there's an automatic
 
00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
or two two triggers that need to be met
 
00:47:25.589 --> 00:47:25.599 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
or two instances one being an operating
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
budget deficit the second being that
 
00:47:30.319 --> 00:47:31.270 align:start position:0%
budget deficit the second being that
revenues

00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh for the current biannual below the
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
planned revenues
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
and if that were to record that would
 
00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:38.079 align:start position:0%
require a draw on the rainy day
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
fund um of about 7.8 million dollars
 
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
again a little too early
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
to predict just based on the estimates
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
we have today
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
and the appropriations as well as the
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
estimated lapse
 
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
updated uh we do believe sitting here
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
today there could be a drop of about 7.8
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
million but obviously the senate
 
00:47:59.670 --> 00:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh ways and means committee and the
 
00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
house wage means committee will continue
 
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
to look at the performance of general
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
education trust fund revenue in march
 
00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
and april
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
as they develop their estimates for the
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
next biennium
 
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
the balance forward into 22 that's all
 
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund as it is
 
00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:15.589 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund as it is
non-lapsing

00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing
 
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
of about 19.9 million rounded uh carried
 
00:48:19.119 --> 00:48:20.069 align:start position:0%
of about 19.9 million rounded uh carried
forward

00:48:20.069 --> 00:48:20.079 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
estimated revenues including revenue
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
adjustments from the tax changes
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
proposed in the bill which were briefly
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
discussed in the previous by the
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
previous presenters
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
results in total revenues about 2.749
 
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
in 22 appropriations
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
from both sources including a lapse
 
00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
estimate of about 71 million dollars
 
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
based on the actions taken by the
 
00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.230 align:start position:0%
based on the actions taken by the
divisions

00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
divisions
 
00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
our appropriations about 2.7 billion
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
dollars for current year
 
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
balance of 47.2 billion
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
of that 60 cent and if you add the
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
balance forward
 
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
the 22 current cumulative ending balance
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
is 67.1 million
 
00:49:02.069 --> 00:49:02.079 align:start position:0%
being the middle of the biennium any
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
balance at the close of fiscal year 22
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
will carry forward into the following
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
year so you can see
 
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
in the final column uh the beginning
 
00:49:14.829 --> 00:49:14.839 align:start position:0%
balance in 23 of about 67.1 million
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
dollars uh estimated revenues again
 
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
based on the house ways and means
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
estimates uh provided for in march
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
is about two point eight billion dollars
 
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh revenue adjustments are reduction of
 
00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
those revenues of about 118
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
million dollars across both funds the
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
largest being the reduction
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
of 100 million dollars in the statewide
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
property tax the total revenues in 23
 
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
estimated about 2.682 billion dollars
 
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh budget appropriations about 2.830 uh
 
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in house bill one and
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
then positive adjustments of about 17.9
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
um and that offsets appropriations that
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
includes the back of the budget
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh adjustments that representative
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
edwards had just discussed
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
including an estimated lapse in the
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
second year of the biennium of about
 
00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
98.2 million dollars
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
brings the total appropriations for that
 
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to about 2.71415 billion
 
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:08.950 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to about 2.71415 billion
dollars

00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:50:10.829 --> 00:50:10.839 align:start position:0%
our current year balance is a negative
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
32.2 largely due to the
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
one-time reduction of the statewide
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
property tax of 100 million dollars
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
and then the cumulative ending balance
 
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
is 34.934
 
00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
that 34.934 is all general fund balance
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
at the end of the biennium any excess
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
general funds will be transferred to the
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund so that would result
 
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
right as we sit here today based on this
 
00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:36.710 align:start position:0%
right as we sit here today based on this
proposal

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
a transfer to the rainy day fund of
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
about 34.9 million
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
i'm bringing the balance up to 142.6
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the biennium and if
 
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
we could scroll down to the next
 
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
couple pages i'll just show you really
 
00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
quick on the general
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
that was the total combined general
 
00:50:56.069 --> 00:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
education trust fund if you want to see
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
00:50:59.430 --> 00:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
general fund versus the education trust
 
00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:00.549 align:start position:0%
general fund versus the education trust
fund

00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:00.559 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
here's the general fund if you look in
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
the final column you can see that uh
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
cumulative ending balance of about 34.9
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars which is then
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
transferred to the um
 
00:51:13.109 --> 00:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund and if you could scroll
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
down please
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you these are the revenue
 
00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:17.750 align:start position:0%
thank you these are the revenue
estimates

00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:19.839 align:start position:0%
uh for the general funds specifically uh
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
based on those estimates provided by
 
00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
house waste means these are your base
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
estimates and then if we could scroll
 
00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
you can keep going there are two
 
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
sections on schedule two
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
one are revenue adjustments as well as
 
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
appropriation adjustments so it goes
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
into detail everything that was
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
presented to you
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
in the previous 45 minutes has been
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
outlined and accounted for
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
so that all the adjustments are included
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
and if we move forward to schedule three
 
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
this is the education trust fund
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
and if we look into 23 there is a
 
00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
current year balance in negative 92.38
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
and again the reason for that is the
 
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
one-time reduction in the statewide
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
education property tax which is offset
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
by a general fund appropriation and
 
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
transfer of about 65.4 million dollars
 
00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
which brings the balance to the
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
education trust one to zero
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
um at the end of 23. and if we went
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
through the next couple of
 
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
schedules we have the education trust
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
fund portion
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
of revenue estimates governor versus
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
house finance
 
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
and if we scroll to the next schedule
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
four this is similar to your schedule
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
two for the general fund or all the
 
00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.630 align:start position:0%
two for the general fund or all the
adjustments

00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
adjustments
 
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
for the revenues and appropriations that
 
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
are listed
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
i mean you can see the 100 million
 
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
dollars on row 11 kind of jumps out at
 
00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:40.549 align:start position:0%
dollars on row 11 kind of jumps out at
you

00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
and if we could go forward to the next
 
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
item this is the highway fund
 
00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
it's on a smaller scale than the
 
00:52:49.599 --> 00:52:52.230 align:start position:0%
it's on a smaller scale than the
previous

00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
but this is a an illustration of the
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
highway fund to show that
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
it is balanced based on the house
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
finance proposal
 
00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
you can see on row 34 uh 27 about 27
 
00:53:08.069 --> 00:53:08.079 align:start position:0%
000 is the so-called the gaap basis and
 
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
cash on hand is on road 29
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
that's about 22.5 in cash on hand 32 of
 
00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
your gap adjustments for the highway
 
00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
fund which the comptroller
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
and the agencies work on and those are
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh due to timing or any other revenues
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
on how they fall within the fiscal year
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
but about row 34 you
 
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
usually want to see a positive or a zero
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
on that line after you account for gap
 
00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
adjustments and if we move forward to
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
the fishing game
 
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
surplus statement again this is a
 
00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
document showing that the house finance
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
plan and the fish and game fund
 
00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
is also balanced with an ending balance
 
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
of about
 
00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
um 6.027
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
million dollars at the end of 23 for the
 
00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
fishing game fund
 
00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
is this just a state aid schedule
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
something we'll we'll be creating
 
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
um we'll be creating this
 
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
throughout the session to show what the
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
actual state aid for 2821 as well as the
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
governor recommended
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
house finance uh senate as well as the
 
00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
final pass
 
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
on state aid on a summary level
 
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
and that's all i have for my
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
presentation i know that
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
kevin ripple is man and mickey are
 
00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:25.990 align:start position:0%
kevin ripple is man and mickey are
managing

00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
managing
 
00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
um the zoom call right now
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative weiler and
 
00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
if the attendees the house members have
 
00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
they would like to ask if they could
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
raise their hand and we could pull them
 
00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:38.309 align:start position:0%
raise their hand and we could pull them
over

00:54:38.309 --> 00:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
as a panelist and so that the members of
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
the committee can answer their questions
 
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
i can answer any technical question
 
00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
relative to the surplus statement i
 
00:54:47.349 --> 00:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
think the members of the chairs as you
 
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
have just seen will be able to answer a
 
00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
lot of the other
 
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
questions you have uh specific to the
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
budget and so
 
00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
i'll end my presentation and turn it
 
00:54:58.150 --> 00:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
over to uh represent weiler
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
and kevin's going to notify you of who
 
00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr cain and we're grateful for
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
your staff members that
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
stood by us in every division and every
 
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
change and kept track of all these
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
things so that
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
we could finally total it all up and
 
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
know what we did
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
so we're open now for any questions from
 
00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
the house members raise your hand and
 
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh mr kane will recognize you and bring
 
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
you in
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
it looks like the first person who had
 
00:55:29.109 --> 00:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
their hand up was representative stacey
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
marie lawton
 
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
and she's a panelist and should be able
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
to speak now
 
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
thank you my question is um
 
00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
is there anything in the budget for peer
 
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
i believe there is representative
 
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
edwards peer support group is
 
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
are are you saying peer p e e
 
00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
r yeah it would be in with the
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
i you know uh honestly in a
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
5.9 billion dollar budget i i don't
 
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
recall that line item
 
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
so um i i i'd taken assist from mr
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
ripple if he can tell me that we had a
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
there is a peer support line item i off
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
the top of my head i don't recall
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
what did that
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
but i can i can get that information and
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
get back to you representative yeah
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
so if you'll send me an email uh i'll
 
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
i'll get a
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:47.349 --> 00:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
the next question i believe the next
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
person with their hand up was
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative michael cahill
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you my question is for
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative ober
 
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
about the liquor enforcement slash
 
00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:02.309 align:start position:0%
about the liquor enforcement slash
education

00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
who will be doing the inspection of our
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
thousands of
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
alcohol serving institutions and the
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
convenience stores selling cigarettes
 
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
as i said represent peter leishman
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
worked on this extensively there is
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
still a great deal of staff
 
00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
in there to do inspections licensing
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
and education so we did not
 
00:57:30.789 --> 00:57:30.799 align:start position:0%
defund the entire group we removed the
 
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
ones who are acting as police officers
 
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
left the licensors
 
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
i know that the department had been
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
looking for more people to do
 
00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:42.789 align:start position:0%
looking for more people to do
inspections

00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
inspections
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
was that addressed the department did
 
00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
not ask for more staffing in the budget
 
00:57:54.549 --> 00:57:54.559 align:start position:0%
thank you representative what we found
 
00:57:57.510 --> 00:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
represented cahill there was a 300 page
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
uh audit that we all read on this
 
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
specific division and they were with
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
even that 21 people
 
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
they were doing less than half of the
 
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
inspections they should have been doing
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
so they were doing other activities
 
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
what we assumed was the purpose of the
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
inspection division
 
00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
so that's why we made the change thank
 
00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:20.950 align:start position:0%
so that's why we made the change thank
you

00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:26.799 align:start position:0%
and the next question and i apologize in
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
advance if i butcher anybody's name here
 
00:58:28.559 --> 00:58:28.950 align:start position:0%
advance if i butcher anybody's name here
it's

00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
i think it's bound to happen is
 
00:58:34.829 --> 00:58:34.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:34.839 --> 00:58:38.870 align:start position:0%
 
grote

00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you that was correct um
 
00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
this is a question regarding uh division
 
00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:45.990 align:start position:0%
this is a question regarding uh division
three

00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
i believe um the modernizing
 
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
of the i.t struck infrastructure within
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
um how much can you speak up please
 
00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:58.870 align:start position:0%
um how much can you speak up please
representative

00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
yes is this better not much
 
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
no i'll speak louder
 
00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
can you please tell me how much money
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
how much money is being provided for the
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
funding to upgrade the
 
00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
um i.t infrastructure mentioned
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
i believe it was for division three in
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
services how much
 
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
the the totality of the funding for
 
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
items services and support in division
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
iii is spread out amongst many different
 
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.109 align:start position:0%
iii is spread out amongst many different
lines

00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
lines
 
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
the the biggest chunk was related to the
 
00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:43.829 align:start position:0%
the the biggest chunk was related to the
medicaid

00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
management information system
 
00:59:45.839 --> 00:59:47.270 align:start position:0%
management information system
replacement

00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
and we moved that into hb2
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
and when we moved that i believe it was
 
00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
on the order
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
of 35 million dollars over the two years
 
01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
and and mr ripple feel free to correct
 
01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
me if i'm wrong it could have been as
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
high as 43 million
 
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
but it was it was a lot of money and
 
01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:07.750 align:start position:0%
but it was it was a lot of money and
then

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:00:11.109 --> 01:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
they the i.t
 
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
budget is bigger than that because they
 
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:14.630 align:start position:0%
budget is bigger than that because they
have

01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:00:18.069 --> 01:00:18.079 align:start position:0%
personnel lines uh for it
 
01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
and they have also uh regular
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
operating costs associated with with
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
running and licensing their i.t
 
01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
services so so all together
 
01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
if all the different line items were
 
01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:32.390 align:start position:0%
if all the different line items were
aggregated

01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
aggregated
 
01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
and i never saw it all aggregated in one
 
01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:36.470 align:start position:0%
and i never saw it all aggregated in one
place

01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
if if we were spending 60 to 65 million
 
01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
over the two years just for dhhsit
 
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
i i would say that would be kind of on
 
01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
the low range
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
and it could it could be as high as 75
 
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
million when
 
01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:54.559 align:start position:0%
all combined does that help
 
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
yes i was interested in the medicare
 
01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
medicaid um
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
part of it so you answered my question i
 
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
have another quick question
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's up to the chairman and i it really
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
is hard to hear you by the way
 
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
okay is this better the uh
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
the it is is present in every department
 
01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:19.670 align:start position:0%
the it is is present in every department
across

01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
across
 
01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
state government and the employees
 
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
are assigned to i.t although they might
 
01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
be permanently in all the different
 
01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.069 align:start position:0%
be permanently in all the different
departments

01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
departments
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
so that it can have a universal and
 
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
common procedures that they all follow
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
there's also help desks and things like
 
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
that that some of the smaller agencies
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
that don't have
 
01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
someone internally can call a help desk
 
01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
and so all those funds are transferred
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
in and around government
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
and so it's difficult to track them
 
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
by that one department i'm sure we have
 
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
the total somewhere but it it's going to
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
take a little homework to
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
to add it all up and uh if you uh
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
send a query to lba they can probably
 
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
get that for you
 
01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you if i may mr sheriff
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
if i could receive all of the questions
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
and then i'll coordinate them with lba
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
so it's it's to uh jess edwards
 
01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your email i just want to
 
01:02:23.029 --> 01:02:23.039 align:start position:0%
make sure all the representatives get
 
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
their full
 
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
thank you are you hearing me yes
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i am interested in a
 
01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:49.510 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i am interested in a
bill

01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
and i wish i could remember the name
 
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
that was passed last year
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
in the last session it was some of the
 
01:02:55.839 --> 01:02:56.710 align:start position:0%
in the last session it was some of the
lead

01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
lead
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
bill and a rather massive health care
 
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
bill that we passed
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
the opening bill was i believe it was 13
 
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
59 or 69 something like that
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
which is a bill i sponsored and it was
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
about medicaid in and out this would
 
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
affect division three
 
01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
and it was to correct the thirty year
 
01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
old problem that existed in
 
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
the early 90s this program
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
under medicaid was brought into play for
 
01:03:24.309 --> 01:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
individuals whose income was well above
 
01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:26.079 align:start position:0%
the income that qualified them for
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
medicaid but they had such extensive
 
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
medical problems that for example
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
somebody on that earned ten thousand
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
and had uh dialysis on a regular basis
 
01:03:42.549 --> 01:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
their costs out-of-pocket costs
 
01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
without any insurance would have brought
 
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
their income
 
01:03:49.349 --> 01:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
way down below and what this bill
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
allowed them to do
 
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
is if the spend down was reached so the
 
01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
spend down brought them down
 
01:03:58.069 --> 01:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
to the federal poverty level of at that
 
01:03:59.470 --> 01:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
time it was
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
591 dollars a month
 
01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
they they would then begin receiving
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
medicaid for the balance of the month to
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
pay the additional costs
 
01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:10.839 align:start position:0%
this was supposed to be brought into
 
01:04:10.839 --> 01:04:12.069 align:start position:0%
this was supposed to be brought into
effect

01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
effect
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
it was that poverty level that it was
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
brought down to
 
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
was 591 dollars certainly the cost of
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
living has increased significantly
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
since the early 1990s 30 years ago
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
and the intent of this bill was to bring
 
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
it up to the current level
 
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
so that individuals with these extensive
 
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
medical expenses
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
once they reached the federal poverty
 
01:04:35.589 --> 01:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
level now the balance
 
01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:37.839 align:start position:0%
of the expenses they ran that month
 
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
would be covered by medicaid
 
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
and up until then they'd have to spend
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
their own funds to meet
 
01:04:44.309 --> 01:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
but they wouldn't have to go beyond
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
which brought them down to the level
 
01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
that qualified them for policy
 
01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
this is a long explanation does that
 
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
make sense does anybody remember this
 
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:52.789 align:start position:0%
make sense does anybody remember this
bill

01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
and why was this not why were no funds
 
01:04:59.029 --> 01:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
included in this particular bill in
 
01:04:59.829 --> 01:04:59.839 align:start position:0%
order to
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
bring this into being was it even
 
01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:05.029 align:start position:0%
bring this into being was it even
considered

01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
representative snow it's so good to hear
 
01:05:08.549 --> 01:05:08.559 align:start position:0%
your voice i hope you're doing well sir
 
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
i'm doing very well and thank you i i
 
01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:11.829 align:start position:0%
i'm doing very well and thank you i i
was

01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
on ways and means last term and and not
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
paying attention to all the
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
hhs bills um we missed you
 
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
too but if it passed last term
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
then i'm confident that the department
 
01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:25.990 align:start position:0%
then i'm confident that the department
has

01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
factored in whatever eligibility
 
01:05:32.789 --> 01:05:32.799 align:start position:0%
requirements that law lays out in
 
01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
in that the governor's process of coming
 
01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
up with the proposed budget
 
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
made sure that there were funds adequate
 
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
to cover that new
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
eligibility category and in general
 
01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
in all direct health care we accepted
 
01:05:50.549 --> 01:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget so
 
01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
so without being able to be specific
 
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh i i think we're probably okay
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
and if if you'll send me an email sir i
 
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
i will
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
work to to find out um what i need to
 
01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
about the eligibility and get your goods
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
i will i should just for further
 
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
information when i did check
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
with the department uh and the medic the
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
personnel the medicaid
 
01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
they did say that they understood it
 
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
they had a plan in place
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
but they did say that as far as they
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
knew there was nothing included in the
 
01:06:21.599 --> 01:06:22.230 align:start position:0%
knew there was nothing included in the
budget

01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
to cover whatever additional cost there
 
01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
would be which is
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
i don't remember the exact amount of
 
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
what it was but it's it's not
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
significant but
 
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
their understanding was there was no
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
money included in the budget to cover
 
01:06:33.119 --> 01:06:33.589 align:start position:0%
money included in the budget to cover
the

01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
additional cost for this to bring these
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
people back from
 
01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
a 30 year old threshold to qualify for
 
01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
care but
 
01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
i will be glad to send you a memo with
 
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
that kind of information
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
in if you can do anything to expedite
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
moving that along it would be a big help
 
01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's very important for people of
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
these chronic medical conditions it's
 
01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:56.470 align:start position:0%
these chronic medical conditions it's
also

01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
a help for people with conditions like
 
01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
neurological conditions mental health
 
01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:01.510 align:start position:0%
neurological conditions mental health
conditions

01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
where they have ongoing expenses that
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
are pretty extraordinary and they don't
 
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
mr ripple do you know any of the history
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
i believe uh the representative snow is
 
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
correct and that it's not funded in the
 
01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:16.870 align:start position:0%
correct and that it's not funded in the
budget

01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
if that's the case it also funded in the
 
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
um but i would have to go back and check
 
01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
with the department on the history of it
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i appreciate it
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
next next is representative timothy
 
01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:34.069 align:start position:0%
next next is representative timothy
horrigan

01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
horrigan
 
01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
well can you hear me um i can i could
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
my question is the governor's budget
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
included a significant increase in the
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
legislative branch's budget which
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
i think is a good idea given um
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
given i think we've been understaffed
 
01:07:50.309 --> 01:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
despite the great work you do mr ripple
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
and all the legislative staffers i think
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
we don't have
 
01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
enough staff for enough resources but
 
01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of surprised that
 
01:07:58.950 --> 01:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
he would be increasing the resources so
 
01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
that was he
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
is that an operational increase or is
 
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
that just to pay for
 
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
like the things like building new
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
entrants the lob and then
 
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
also i haven't heard anything about this
 
01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.950 align:start position:0%
also i haven't heard anything about this
issue

01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:08:15.029 --> 01:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative oregon the legislative
 
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
budget by state law
 
01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
is handled by the facilities committee
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
and not the finance committee
 
01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
all right and do you have any
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
input on what they're planning to do
 
01:08:29.759 --> 01:08:32.470 align:start position:0%
input on what they're planning to do
here

01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
i do not sit on the facilities committee
 
01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
sir i do not know
 
01:08:39.669 --> 01:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
okay i mean i i do not either i mean i
 
01:08:41.349 --> 01:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
try as best i can to keep track of what
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
they're doing but um they you know they
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
don't publish
 
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of information about what they're
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
doing most of the time so
 
01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
um so you so there's no comment on what
 
01:08:51.829 --> 01:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
that was all about or what our
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
whether uh when we would be investing
 
01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:54.870 align:start position:0%
whether uh when we would be investing
more

01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
to knowledge and um you know upgrading
 
01:08:59.829 --> 01:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
our we we had to do like
 
01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
i think about 13 years worth of change
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
in a few months this year which cost a
 
01:09:04.829 --> 01:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
lot of money but
 
01:09:07.749 --> 01:09:07.759 align:start position:0%
um you're not coming through very
 
01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
clearly here
