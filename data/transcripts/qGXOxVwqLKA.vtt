00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
and cities from the first of a number of
 
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
these expected settlements and judgments
 
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
so senate bill 275 makes several
 
00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
changes to the current law
 
00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
one it updates
 
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
the census reference from
 
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
the 2010
 
00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
this way we can distribute money based
 
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
on population changes
 
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
without having to reopen the statute
 
00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 align:start position:0%
every time there's a new census the bill
 
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
also changes the appointment of one of
 
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
the members that member representing
 
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
county nursing homes to be appointed by
 
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
their association
 
00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 align:start position:0%
instead of from the governor because no
 
00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.190 align:start position:0%
instead of from the governor because no
appointment

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
and it's an important
 
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.309 align:start position:0%
and it's an important
member

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
member
 
00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
three we
 
00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 align:start position:0%
add prevention and school programs to
 
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
the list of programs eligible to apply
 
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
for the funding
 
00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
and we also then add a school
 
00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
superintendent to the
 
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
members of the commission
 
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
and finally the duties of this
 
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
commission are clarified to
 
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
explicitly include evidence-based
 
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
prevention efforts as an eligible use of
 
00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 align:start position:0%
the money to mitigate opioid harm
 
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
and additionally the annual report looks
 
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
to collect measures of success
 
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
on the programs funded
 
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
to the extent that these measures are
 
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.390 align:start position:0%
to the extent that these measures are
available

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 align:start position:0%

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 align:start position:0%

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
questions about the ongoing litigation
 
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 align:start position:0%

it's uh
 
00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
i i i was emailed last night and a
 
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment for this bill and i
 
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
wonder if you have been consulted about
 
00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 align:start position:0%
any amendments
 
00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
and if so if you have any opinion on
 
00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:09.830 align:start position:0%
and if so if you have any opinion on
them

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.949 align:start position:0%
them
i

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
did see
 
00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.069 align:start position:0%
an amendment
um

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
a couple of days ago by email
 
00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:19.749 align:start position:0%
a couple of days ago by email
and

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:19.759 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
my plan was to bring that language
 
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
to the commission
 
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
we're meeting on monday next week so i
 
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's the same proposed
 
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
amendment but i've added that subject
 
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
matter to
 
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.390 align:start position:0%
matter to
our

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.510 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.550 align:start position:0%
representative
shapiro

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
shapiro
 
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
question please thank you mr chair thank
 
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question i'm not sure
 
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.230 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question i'm not sure
that

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 align:start position:0%
of what the
 
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
previously spoken about amendment
 
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
involves but i know that um
 
00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
the city of keene where i'm from
 
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
are concerned about the allocation
 
00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 align:start position:0%
of funds for the
 
00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
municipalities that originally went in
 
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
on the um
 
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
on these suits
 
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
and i guess there was another bill i
 
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
think it was house bill 1565
 
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
that would have changed the allocation
 
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
for from 15 to 40 percent
 
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm not i'm i'm not as knowledgeable
 
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
about this as i should be talking about
 
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
us but i guess my question is
 
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.430 align:start position:0%
is there any
room

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
room
 
00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 align:start position:0%
as far as your concern to change the
 
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
allocation for the municipalities that
 
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.590 align:start position:0%
allocation for the municipalities that
originally

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
originally
 
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
went in on these suits
 
00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
because they have invested a lot and
 
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
because they've also done a lot of
 
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
thinking ahead of time of what kind of
 
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
programming they would use the money for
 
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question mr befetti is
 
00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:57.759 align:start position:0%
probably better suited to talk about
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
the specifics of
 
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
who's done what in litigation but i'd
 
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
say that
 
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
um to my way of thinking it's
 
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
not exactly correct to say these cities
 
00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
only get 15
 
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
they get 15
 
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
it's not only cities it's
 
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
23 i think jurisdictions
 
00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
they get 15
 
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
is immediately distributed
 
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
as the funds come in to the treasurer
 
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.430 align:start position:0%
as the funds come in to the treasurer
but

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
any program
 
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
is eligible
 
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
to apply for
 
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.629 align:start position:0%
to apply for
funding

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
of the balance of the 85 percent the
 
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
state is keeping
 
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
zero percent of the money
 
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
so if you hear that the state is keeping
 
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
85 that's really not accurate so um
 
00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
we are setting up uh
 
00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
rules and a process
 
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.710 align:start position:0%
rules and a process
for

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
how the commission would evaluate grant
 
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.550 align:start position:0%
how the commission would evaluate grant
applications

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
applications
 
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
but any city any county any program
 
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
is able to apply for
 
00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
follow up um
 
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um i yes i underst i
 
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
understand that they're not um limited
 
00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
to the 15 but
 
00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:32.870 align:start position:0%
to the 15 but
um

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
from your response i would i would just
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
guess that you're not in favor of
 
00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
changing the percentage of allocation
 
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
as i said mr buffetti is better able to
 
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
give you the history of how that was
 
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
arrived at thank you thank you
 
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you senator
 
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.629 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you senator
um

00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 align:start position:0%
i'm not familiar with this
 
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
program at all it's great news that
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
we're getting some money back from the
 
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
people who helped make this happen
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh but could you explain just in
 
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
layman's terms
 
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.629 align:start position:0%
layman's terms
uh

00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
what this what is the implication of the
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
cities that actually
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh sued first
 
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
from what i read it sounded like their
 
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
people were concerned they weren't gonna
 
00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:26.309 align:start position:0%
people were concerned they weren't gonna
get

00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
they weren't going to get the same kind
 
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.110 align:start position:0%
they weren't going to get the same kind
of

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
funds that people who didn't participate
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
in the suit
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
mr maffetti will probably correct me
 
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
however my understanding is
 
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
a number of lawsuits were filed
 
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
but then they were consolidated
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
and perhaps after the filing
 
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
the department of justice
 
00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
really took the lead
 
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
on these suits
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
because the local
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
the local litigation was consolidated
 
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
but again he can he can explain that
 
00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.030 align:start position:0%
but again he can he can explain that
better

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
we are talking about
 
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
tens of millions of dollars
 
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
over the next 20 years
 
00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000 align:start position:0%

sponsor of uh hb 1565
 
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
which sought to also make some changes
 
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
to these
 
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:30.640 align:start position:0%

opioid abatement
statutes

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
we were looking to
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of allocation
 
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
to from 15 percent to 40 percent we had
 
00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
negotiated down maybe to 30 percent
 
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
but i'm not seeking that kind of change
 
00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.910 align:start position:0%
but i'm not seeking that kind of change
today

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:56.959 align:start position:0%
what i'm coming to you today with

and which i emailed you last night
 
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh is a suggested amendment to this sb
 
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.190 align:start position:0%
uh is a suggested amendment to this sb
275

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
275
 
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
um to this this particular bill
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
presented by senator rosenwald which i
 
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.150 align:start position:0%
presented by senator rosenwald which i
support

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.670 align:start position:0%
support
i

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
is is basically some housekeeping
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
changes and
 
00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
as you hear this bill i'd like you to
 
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
consider making a few additional changes
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
to this statute
 
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
first and foremost
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to consider eliminating
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
what we call the population penalty
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
which is levied upon our counties
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
with regard to the 23 entities which
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
were the original litigants in these
 
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
opioid lawsuits
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
eight of our ten counties are penalized
 
00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.269 align:start position:0%
eight of our ten counties are penalized
now

00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
by eliminating the population of any
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
municipality within that county
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
that were also litigants in the original
 
00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
national opioid lawsuit
 
00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:55.839 align:start position:0%
as a result
 
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
each county receives less money from the
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
settlement distributions if any
 
00:13:04.829 --> 00:13:04.839 align:start position:0%
municipality within it joined in in the
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
litigation the fact is
 
00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
that the counties and municipalities
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
have vastly different programs which
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
they offer
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
and which stand to be funded by these
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
distributions going forward
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
the county should not be penalized just
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
because a municipality within that
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
county decided to join in the original
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
national lawsuits
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
sullivan county would be penalized the
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
population of claremont
 
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
yet sullivan county still serves the
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
people of claremont in their county
 
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.189 align:start position:0%
people of claremont in their county
programs

00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
the county opioid abatement programs
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
that they offer
 
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
so the population penalty isn't fair in
 
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:47.519 align:start position:0%
this respect and i have attached
 
00:13:47.519 --> 00:13:49.030 align:start position:0%
this respect and i have attached
language

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
which i
 
00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:52.959 align:start position:0%
have passed out to you
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
fix that
 
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
it would it would be an amendment to fix
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
that and that is shown
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
on the page that says suggested a minute
 
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
amendment to sb 275
 
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.350 align:start position:0%
amendment to sb 275
i

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
put in
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
that paragraph
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
which which describes the distribution
 
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
according to a file the formula of the
 
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
following formula that the distribution
 
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
shall be calculated by multiplying the
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
settlement amount by the population
 
00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.750 align:start position:0%
settlement amount by the population
factor

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
factor
 
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
and the allocation factor where the
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
population factor is derived by dividing
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
each qualifying counties and
 
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities population by the state's
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
total population and the allocation
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
factor is set at 15 percent it's 15
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
percent now so i'm not making any
 
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
changes to that and you can see on the
 
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that i sent out also
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
i used the example of the mckinsey
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
settlement which was the first
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
settlement that came through
 
00:14:58.949 --> 00:14:58.959 align:start position:0%
and you can see in column h
 
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
what the actual distribution was
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
and that actual distribution included
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
this population penalty
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
in column i
 
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
i show what the county would have
 
00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.389 align:start position:0%
i show what the county would have
received

00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
received
 
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
without the population penalty
 
00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
in other words
 
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
9565.87 thirteen thousand seven hundred
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
and seventy dollars and four cents
 
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
because in
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
the column i
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
i did not take out the population of
 
00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:37.990 align:start position:0%
i did not take out the population of
claremont

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
claremont
 
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
so i think this is important
 
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.430 align:start position:0%
so i think this is important
um

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to write up the
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
amendment through ols to do this for you
 
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.069 align:start position:0%
amendment through ols to do this for you
um

00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
i've also so i
 
00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:53.839 align:start position:0%
did provide a spreadsheet that shows the
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
difference yes
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
is there an extra copy of the
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet so i can follow along please
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:05.759 align:start position:0%
thank you representative merchant sorry
 
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
so i've provided the spreadsheet which
 
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
shows the difference in allocation
 
00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.990 align:start position:0%
shows the difference in allocation
distribution

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
of the settlement dollars for this
 
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
mckinsey settlement which should have
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
meant to the counties had the population
 
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
penalty not been in effect so again if
 
00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
you compare columns h and i to see the
 
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
difference for some counties the
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
difference is quite meaningful because
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
the population penalty
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
which is shown in column g
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
is substantial for instance
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
stratford and hillsborough county suffer
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
a 49 percent population penalty because
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
of the municipalities in their counties
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
that decided to be a part of the
 
00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0%
original national litigation
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
and you should also know that the 13
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities who were original
 
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
litigants represent
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
roughly 50 percent of the opioid problem
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
they recognized early on the problem
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
which is why they decided to join in on
 
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
the national litigation
 
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
and i must add too that if it wasn't for
 
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
these 23 entities participating in the
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
litigation new hampshire may not have
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
received anything from these lawsuits
 
00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.029 align:start position:0%
received anything from these lawsuits
additionally

00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
i've also uh proposed some language
 
00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.270 align:start position:0%
i've also uh proposed some language
uh

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
well basically this the the language
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
that i'm proposing for this new the
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
allocation calculation
 
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
should be spelled out and clarified in
 
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.590 align:start position:0%
should be spelled out and clarified in
statute

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
you you brought up the point before that
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
there was a no in in
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
rsa 126 a colon 84 6 which mentions
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
november 1st 2020
 
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
so what i've done is i've
 
00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.510 align:start position:0%
so what i've done is i've
i've

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
i've
 
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
changed rsa 126
 
00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.669 align:start position:0%
changed rsa 126
a

00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
colon 84
 
00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.630 align:start position:0%
colon 84
uh

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 4 and roman numeral 6
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
needing to be changed to reflect annual
 
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
reporting and remove the 2020 year
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the current statute
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to entertain any questions
 
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.950 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to entertain any questions
about

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
what i'm proposing
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
i think the the um
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
okay we'll hold it there then
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
recognize representative weber sure
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you very
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
much for taking my question
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh without having been familiar with the
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
formula before
 
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
what i am wondering is why it is that
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
when when you
 
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
we already have the the 15 percent
 
00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.830 align:start position:0%
we already have the the 15 percent
that

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
has been taken out
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
what your formula does it seems to me is
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
double dipping on the cities because not
 
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
only does claremont continue to get the
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds for claremont but then
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
sullivan county also gets the funds that
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
would be allocated to claremont so
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't that
 
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
result in a double dip well some people
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
would suggest that that is the case but
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
it is not really the case because our
 
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.549 align:start position:0%
it is not really the case because our
counties

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
counties
 
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
um they still
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
include the citizens of say in sullivan
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
county of claremont in their
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
programs that they work that they do
 
00:19:21.919 --> 00:19:22.830 align:start position:0%
programs that they work that they do
and

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
so the the the programs that the
 
00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
counties are offering are
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
way different
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
and different in scope and different in
 
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
how they operate than what a
 
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
municipality would offer
 
00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.110 align:start position:0%
municipality would offer
so

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
no they're not really double dipping
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
because they're doing different
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
functions follow-up
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
but if we're allocating the funds on the
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
basis of population we're counting the
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
population of the cities twice are we
 
00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.630 align:start position:0%
population of the cities twice are we
not

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
under your formula
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
you could suggest that that's the case
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
but i would i would counter and say that
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
whether the the municipality
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
participated in the original lawsuit or
 
00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.390 align:start position:0%
participated in the original lawsuit or
not

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
there still should be funding coming to
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
this to the county
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
to help them pay for the programs that
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
serve those people in those
 
00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.590 align:start position:0%
serve those people in those
municipalities

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative kanark
 
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
mine is very much along the same line
 
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
not taking the attack of looking to see
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
if it's double dipping but instead since
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
lines 8 through 10 of the original bill
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
say the population of any
 
00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
political subdivision so that would mean
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
both the municipality and the county
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
that receives funds shall not be
 
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
included in the population of the county
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
so if if they are getting it all it
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
means is they're going to keep it equal
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
is that not how you read lines 8 through
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
10 is that
 
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
it is simply going to be the population
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
of the county and it doesn't get counted
 
00:20:48.559 --> 00:20:50.549 align:start position:0%
of the county and it doesn't get counted
twice

00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
twice
 
00:20:50.559 --> 00:20:51.750 align:start position:0%
twice
which

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
lines eight through ten of the original
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
bill i'm sorry the bill as amended by
 
00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
the senate not your amendment right okay
 
00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
so the population of any political
 
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
subdivision which receives funds under
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
this section shall not be included in
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
the population of the county
 
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
well that that's again that's the
 
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
population penalty i'm talking about
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
that they are removing
 
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
the population of for example claremont
 
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
from sullivan county follow up and the
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
county gets punished for it
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
follow up but doesn't that only occur if
 
00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.070 align:start position:0%
follow up but doesn't that only occur if
claremont

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
claremont
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
is already getting the funds i mean this
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
precisely what it says is that if
 
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
claremont gets the funds
 
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
that the county doesn't get their funds
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
and the other funds isn't that what it's
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
saying which is not a penalty it's not a
 
00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.230 align:start position:0%
saying which is not a penalty it's not a
bonus

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
and i've been referring to the bill as
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
amended by the senate
 
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
i see it i see it as the the population
 
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
not being included
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
and just so i'm clear about where we are
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
procedurally my understanding is that
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
your original bill
 
00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.549 align:start position:0%
your original bill
which

00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:22:00.559 --> 00:22:01.669 align:start position:0%
which
had

00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:22:03.909 --> 00:22:03.919 align:start position:0%
great consideration in another committee
 
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
has been referred for interim study is
 
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
that correct yes
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
but that had a change in the allocation
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
of increasing the amount of money coming
 
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
you know instead of 15
 
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
going to 30 or 40
 
00:22:17.679 --> 00:22:18.789 align:start position:0%
going to 30 or 40
but

00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:18.799 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
a follow-up but isn't it true that that
 
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
that is the committee that deals with
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
the money issues and we are the
 
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
committee that deals with the health
 
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
issues is that not correct
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
well it's still a matter of policy of
 
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
how much money you want to
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh you know how how the money is
 
00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.270 align:start position:0%
uh you know how how the money is
allocated

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
allocated
 
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
 
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:22:44.159 --> 00:22:45.029 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the columns and i know
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
there's different
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
bills we're talking about but under
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
column e and column f
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
they don't add up to the same ones 133
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
percent once 100
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
why is there such a delta
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
well because um in the
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
why would they both add up to 100
 
00:23:06.559 --> 00:23:07.750 align:start position:0%
why would they both add up to 100
because

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
in in the column e
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
you are not including
 
00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:15.919 align:start position:0%
in column e you are subtracting out the
 
00:23:15.919 --> 00:23:17.909 align:start position:0%
in column e you are subtracting out the
municipalities

00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:23:17.919 --> 00:23:19.350 align:start position:0%
municipalities
from

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry in in
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
column e you are not
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
including the population penalty you
 
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
will have the full population
 
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:29.919 align:start position:0%
of the um
 
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
of each county
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
and then you have the the population of
 
00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.350 align:start position:0%
and then you have the the population of
the

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
uh the municipalities
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
in column f
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
you would be removing say for instance
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
claremont's population from
 
00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:48.799 align:start position:0%
uh sullivan county and so that's why
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
that comes out to 100 percent
 
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
the other would come out to 133 percent
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
because you have 33 percent
 
00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.669 align:start position:0%
because you have 33 percent
um

00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
the 10 counties represents 100 of the
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
population of the state
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
and one more follow-up thank you mr
 
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.269 align:start position:0%
and one more follow-up thank you mr
chair

00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
so when i look at the column and so
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
forth what i'm hearing is the fact go
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
back to prior comment
 
00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:13.039 align:start position:0%
that there's some double dipping going
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
on when counting the population twice
 
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
you can suggest that it is counting the
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
population twice but it is because the
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
counties programs are different than the
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities programs and the county
 
00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:30.559 align:start position:0%
is still providing programs for members
 
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
of the municipalities that are included
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
okay representative gay
 
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'll be brief how much
 
00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
did claremont this is just an example
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
because obviously several towns must
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
have gotten a settlement and that's why
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
they're being taken out of this where
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
can we see how much those towns got to
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
justify why they're being left out of
 
00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:03.039 --> 00:25:03.830 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
for some reason the towns are being
 
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
penalized so i assume that means they
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
already got
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
a settlement
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
the if they did not this makes no sense
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
to penalize them but it just sounds like
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
for this double dipping concern
 
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
apparently the town's already got some
 
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
kind of settlement point of order mr
 
00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.789 align:start position:0%
kind of settlement point of order mr
chair

00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
point of order the language says clearly
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
on line nine receives funds under this
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
section it does not refer to any other
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
funds received under any other pro uh
 
00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.230 align:start position:0%
funds received under any other pro uh
program

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
we we're spending a lot of time on a mis
 
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
it says uh line nine funds under this
 
00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
section so it's not talking about other
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
funds so we don't need to dwell on that
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
all right well we'll stipulate that we
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
have a difference of opinion on the
 
00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:53.919 align:start position:0%
interpretation of this bill
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative aaron and what we want to
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
do is to hear as recommended by senator
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
rosenwald uh from mr buffet who can give
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh specific technical
 
00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
updates for us
 
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
so if we could uh with your in
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
understanding we could move on
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
sure to that and we know this bill would
 
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
require additional work thank you so
 
00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
like to recognize uh
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
oh in that case representative velma you
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
everything's under appeal right now so
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
representative susan elmi grafton 13
 
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of the motion which was
 
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
interim study which passed unanimously
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
in our committee
 
00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:57.400 align:start position:0%
we spent a great deal of time on
 
00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.190 align:start position:0%
we spent a great deal of time on
1365

00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
1365
 
00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.149 align:start position:0%
1365
on

00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
and we went through a lot of
 
00:27:02.159 --> 00:27:03.909 align:start position:0%
and we went through a lot of
spreadsheets

00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:03.919 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
i just wanted on to make clear some of
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
the reasons that we voted to interim
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
study this
 
00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.430 align:start position:0%
study this
on

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.870 align:start position:0%
on
first

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
on we're talking about 23 entities which
 
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
would get more money than anybody else
 
00:27:24.549 --> 00:27:24.559 align:start position:0%
in the state because they signed up for
 
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
one of the lawsuits
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
on which mr befetti will probably be
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:27:31.919 --> 00:27:33.350 align:start position:0%
talking about
on

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
those 23 or the 10 counties
 
00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.789 align:start position:0%
those 23 or the 10 counties
which

00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
would cover the whole state
 
00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799 align:start position:0%
and 13 municipalities 12 of which are
 
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
cities one of which
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
the one city that didn't sign on was
 
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
mine agreeing with what the commission
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
was doing
 
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.110 align:start position:0%
was doing
and

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
those um the rest of the
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
towns in the state
 
00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.310 align:start position:0%
towns in the state
include

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.430 align:start position:0%
include
salem

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
salem
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
and bedford and a number a large number
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
of other towns that are bigger than some
 
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
of the ones in the 20 in the 13
 
00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:21.750 align:start position:0%
of the ones in the 20 in the 13
municipalities

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
we looked at
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
the death data
 
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
for the last
 
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
two and a half years couldn't get
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
get it since
 
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
the second half of last year
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
on and the deaths are occurring all over
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
in very small places in very large
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
places the most of them are in
 
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
manchester uh
 
00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
and and nashua because of the
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
populations and the population
 
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
concentration probably
 
00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.950 align:start position:0%
concentration probably
but

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
that is one factor that what we would be
 
00:28:59.590 --> 00:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
doing would be
 
00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:00.549 align:start position:0%
doing would be
putting

00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
putting
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
most of
 
00:29:01.679 --> 00:29:02.789 align:start position:0%
most of
on

00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:02.799 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
more of the money originally it was over
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
50 percent of the money
 
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh in the hands of the litigants
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
that signed on to this particular
 
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.149 align:start position:0%
that signed on to this particular
lawsuit

00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
on and
 
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
less available
 
00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.389 align:start position:0%
less available
for

00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:29:21.269 --> 00:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
a statewide initiative
 
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
to try to control opioid
 
00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.470 align:start position:0%
to try to control opioid
abuse

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.830 align:start position:0%
in this state
and

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
we felt
 
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh the policy part of that is yours but
 
00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.190 align:start position:0%
uh the policy part of that is yours but
the

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh the money part of it was ours
 
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
and we felt that it was more important
 
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
to do it from the state level
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
the other factor that was involved in
 
00:29:47.669 --> 00:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
this is that
 
00:29:47.679 --> 00:29:48.470 align:start position:0%
this is that
on

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
has been as you know it takes a long
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
time to get things through jail car
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
and if they're going to jail car right
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
now until they do
 
00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
they have not made votes on discussions
 
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
they have had about where the money
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
would be first spent
 
00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.389 align:start position:0%
would be first spent
and

00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:09.919 align:start position:0%
we have heard
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh allegations that
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh one of the first priorities would be
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
that the money would go to the jails for
 
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
jail treatment because it's extremely
 
00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.990 align:start position:0%
jail treatment because it's extremely
important

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
in this process it's one of the key
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
points where
 
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
where that starts opioid
 
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.549 align:start position:0%
where that starts opioid
overdose

00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:30.559 align:start position:0%
overdose
 
00:30:30.559 --> 00:30:31.430 align:start position:0%
overdose
but

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
on they haven't taken votes yet
 
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
and uh until then
 
00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
this uh hype and and we also know that
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
there are quite a few towns that have
 
00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:44.470 align:start position:0%
there are quite a few towns that have
been

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
taking action within their towns about
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
drug overdose but are not among those 13
 
00:30:50.399 --> 00:30:52.710 align:start position:0%
drug overdose but are not among those 13
litigants

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
litigants
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
so on
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
we voted partly because
 
00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
interim study because we don't know yet
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
we won't know until after they've taken
 
00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
those votes which should be very soon
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
after jail car finally meets
 
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh on this
 
00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.269 align:start position:0%
uh on this
on

00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:31:09.279 --> 00:31:11.029 align:start position:0%
on
whether

00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:13.039 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
how the distributions
 
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
would be likely to
 
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
occur and you won't know either
 
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
until that happens
 
00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh and then
 
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
in your policy position you could second
 
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
guess something but
 
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
that would end up
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
next year
 
00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:34.549 align:start position:0%
next year
and

00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:35.750 align:start position:0%
and
on

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.430 align:start position:0%
on
the

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
and we felt that it's it's important
 
00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:41.919 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of money but it's a lot of
 
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
money that when you divvy it up
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
among all
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
all of those places if you did it that
 
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.029 align:start position:0%
all of those places if you did it that
way

00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:49.039 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:31:50.799 --> 00:31:51.750 align:start position:0%
that uh
helps

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
helps
 
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
if you do it
 
00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:55.519 align:start position:0%
with the population penalty
 
00:31:55.519 --> 00:31:56.470 align:start position:0%
with the population penalty
you

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
help a little bit more places like
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
claremont and and manchester
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh but you
 
00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.830 align:start position:0%
uh but you
penalize

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
penalize
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
all the other towns
 
00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:08.789 align:start position:0%
all the other towns
that

00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
did not sign up for this lawsuit
 
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
all right representative bellamy then uh
 
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
your recommendation on the bill
 
00:32:16.399 --> 00:32:17.590 align:start position:0%
your recommendation on the bill
on

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:19.519 align:start position:0%
well i
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
i think i looked at it i felt that the
 
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
bill was was very reasonable i
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
especially like the fact that they're
 
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
getting the county association to
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
appoint the county person
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:35.430 align:start position:0%
and uh
but

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
that's just my personal opinion so
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
you're in favor of the bill as presented

um and these cases are in a variety of
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%

presented
 
00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:42.559 align:start position:0%
uh we
 
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
are in opposition to the amendment as
 
00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
proposed this morning by representative
 
00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.149 align:start position:0%
proposed this morning by representative
aaron

00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
aaron
 
00:33:48.159 --> 00:33:49.110 align:start position:0%
aaron
um

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
and i can i'm happy to talk through the
 
00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.470 align:start position:0%
and i can i'm happy to talk through the
issues

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of the amendment
 
00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
um and we had a vigorous debate in ways
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
and means about this issue i think i
 
00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
testified five times in front of the
 
00:34:03.039 --> 00:34:04.710 align:start position:0%
testified five times in front of the
committee

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
there is a reason why the current
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
statute uh counts population the way it
 
00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:11.109 align:start position:0%
statute uh counts population the way it
does

00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:34:11.119 --> 00:34:12.149 align:start position:0%
does
uh

00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative aaron calls it a
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
population penalty it is not a
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
population penalty it is a protection
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
against double counting
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
and so you don't get to to you get 15 of
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
the funds to be distributed
 
00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:26.950 align:start position:0%
the funds to be distributed
to

00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
those 23 subdivisions who
 
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
who filed lawsuits
 
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
and that's that's what you have 15 the
 
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
question is how do you distribute that
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
money fairly
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
and so if you don't deduct the
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
population from those cities in a county
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
that filed these lawsuits then you
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
double count them so for instance in
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county both manchester and
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
nashua filed lawsuits if you do not
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
deduct their populations then
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county essentially gets a
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
windfall and you don't get to a hundred
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
percent you don't get to
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
because there's just not enough money
 
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
there's no way that math works it just
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't work that way and let me just
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
say you know we've had a a lot of
 
00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:15.430 align:start position:0%
say you know we've had a a lot of
discussion

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
about these 23 subdivisions
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
so let me explain to you as clearly as i
 
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
can exactly what they did
 
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
they hired outside contingency fee
 
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
council right these outside lawyers from
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
outside of new hampshire came in made a
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
pitch to them and said we can get you a
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
lot of money just sign on the dotted
 
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
line these law firms
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
are filed essentially generic
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
lawsuits in all of these counties and
 
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
these 13 cities and towns
 
00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
those count those cases were all
 
00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.349 align:start position:0%
those count those cases were all
filed

00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
filed
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
or removed to federal court
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
all of those federal court cases were
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
consolidated in a court in cleveland a
 
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
federal court called a multi-district
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
litigation court where those those cases
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
have stayed dormant for years
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
they have not litigated anything in
 
00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
those cases they have not filed any
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
motions they have not done any
 
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
depositions they have not exchanged any
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
discovery they simply went there to die
 
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
for for 23
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
of these subdivisions who who were
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
pitched something by these outside
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
counsel and
 
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
for them to get 40 percent of the money
 
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
under the under that proposal in hb 1565
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
made no sense to us because it excludes
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
all of those other cities and towns
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
those 200 or so cities and towns that
 
00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:45.990 align:start position:0%
those 200 or so cities and towns that
didn't

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
hire these outside lawyers
 
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:49.510 align:start position:0%
hire these outside lawyers
so

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
i you know i i drafted a lengthy
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
objection to hb 1565 that i gave to ways
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
and means i'm happy to leave a copy of
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
that with with the chair if that's of
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
help to anyone but it lays out exactly
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
what the objections to hb 1565 was by
 
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
the department of justice
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
i would say this the the current statute
 
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
is a good statute it's a good way of
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with this money it's a fair way
 
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
of dealing with this money
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
all of the money will be used for opioid
 
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
abatement all of it that was a first
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
principle and so now
 
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
85 of the money goes into this opioid
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
abatement trust fund a dedicated trust
 
00:37:35.109 --> 00:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
fund that has to be used for abatement
 
00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:36.630 align:start position:0%
fund that has to be used for abatement
purposes

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
and a commission which is a wide-ranging
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
commission made up of all sorts of
 
00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
people county
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
city town
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
police fire
 
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
we will and i'm a member of the
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
commission we will
 
00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
consider different proposals for how
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
best to spend the money in this state to
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
abate the crisis so that we stop people
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
from dying every day of opioid overdoses
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
which is what's happening right now and
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
so we should come together as a
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
community of a state to figure out the
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
best way to spend this money
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
have to have the best effect and this
 
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
should not be a fight over over trying
 
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
to get more money for certain for
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
certain subdivisions that simply hired
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
outside council and by the way this
 
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
outside council it's a national firm
 
00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:26.630 align:start position:0%
outside council it's a national firm
right

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
we have a case against j and j
 
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to trial against j and j
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
so i contacted them and said
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
you should move to remand your cases out
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
of the mdl that cleveland court bring it
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
back to new hampshire and try it
 
00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
their lawyer said to me we don't want to
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
do that because there's not enough money
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
in it for them not for the state for
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
them they they didn't feel it was worth
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
their while to to to actually have these
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
cases brought back for trial
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
so i mean it tells you that we're
 
00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
dealing with a very different dynamic
 
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
here of outside counsel who by the way
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
are going to make millions of dollars
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
out of these settlements
 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
these people are not going to be hurt
 
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:11.589 align:start position:0%
these people are not going to be hurt
but

00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
my objective is to bring the most money
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
we can into new hampshire as a state
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
with working with all of us county
 
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
cities towns figure out the best way to
 
00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
spend it now somebody mentioned about
 
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
about spending the money for uh for
 
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
people who are incarcerated right
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
because one of the most effective ways
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
of dealing with opioid addiction is
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
through medication-assisted treatment
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
all right everybody that deals in this
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
field will tell you that and so the
 
00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:41.839 align:start position:0%
jails are spending money
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
every day for m a t
 
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
i i'm only one member of the commission
 
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
but i have said at the commission
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
meetings and i'll say this publicly and
 
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
i will say to the commission
 
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
we should be funding mat
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
for every county that spends the money
 
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
we should encourage them to
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
to to distribute these drugs to people
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
in their custody who are suffering from
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
opioid use disorder we should uh we
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
should support the programs that they
 
00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
have for people in the jail who are
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
struggling with substance use disorder
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
that is a good use of our money and so i
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
i think that we will get there but i'm
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
certainly going to be one voice saying
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
this is a good use of the money and we
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
should make a commitment that we will
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
take this money that comes in every year
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
and we will use it to to offset the cost
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
that the counties currently have for m a
 
00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.230 align:start position:0%
that the counties currently have for m a
t

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
t
 
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
thank you attorney befetti do we have
 
00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:36.079 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative weber and
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
then representative gay
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
i have two if i may mr chairman the
 
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
first one was simply would you be
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
willing to email that memo that you
 
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
presented to ways and means to all of us
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
as well sure just so that we don't have
 
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
to use all that paper yes
 
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
thank you happy to do that because some
 
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
of us are drowning um and i and i can
 
00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
just say and i'll put it in my email but
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
there was at the time that i that i
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
wrote the email that there were these
 
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
annual reports that are submitted by the
 
00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
counties we talked about it so
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
sullivan county had had had submitted it
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
but i had not received it because it
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
went over to hhs and got lost somewhere
 
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
so i just want to make sure that that
 
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
sullivan county
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
has submitted a report and by the way
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
all of the reports
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
of all these counties are on a website
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
that hhs hhs has on their main page and
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
it has the opioid abatement trust fund
 
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
so you can find all those letters there
 
00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
that show how counties are using the
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
money or what they've done with the
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
money they've received so far
 
00:41:36.079 --> 00:41:37.190 align:start position:0%
money they've received so far
follow-up

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
and my second question would be would
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
you agree with me that
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
the important thing to do with this
 
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
money is to distribute it according to
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
patient need rather than who filed first
 
00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.589 align:start position:0%
patient need rather than who filed first
yes

00:41:53.589 --> 00:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gay
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
um i'm still would like the
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
basic numbers of money that's already
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
going to the towns
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
and going because it's a
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
you know i hear the 30 and
 
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
well whatever percentages so it would
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
really be nice to understand
 
00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:17.839 align:start position:0%
how that because to me the simple thing
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
would put all the money in a plot
 
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
divided by population and need and let's
 
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
treat the whole state i want to
 
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
understand the restrictions that the
 
00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
that apparently this 40 going to the
 
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
ones who sued
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
number one how much did they cost so
 
00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
that could be subtracted that could be
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
added back to whatever they are due
 
00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
i just don't understand
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
how what money they already are getting
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
because they participated in the suit
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
how do you balance that out with even
 
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
distribution so i can send you in in
 
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
addition to the to the copy of the
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
letter i can send you a the copy of the
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
chat that shows how much money those 23
 
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
subdivisions got in the first settlement
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
we had a small settlement last year
 
00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
um and there was approximately 414
 
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that were distributed
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
to those 23 and i can show you the
 
00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:13.670 align:start position:0%
to those 23 and i can show you the
amounts

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
amounts
 
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
that were given so for instance in
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
sullivan county if i may tony just send
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
the information that's fine and we'll do
 
00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
it that way any further questions
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
i'd like to follow up thank you for
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
taking my question follow up on the
 
00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
question asked by uh represent weber
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
it sounds like we have based upon
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
population of some determination but i
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
think the need is probably more critical
 
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
as far as the allocation is there any
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
way in which the commission is looking
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
at the need factor versus strictly the
 
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
population factor
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
well sure i think that that that's going
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
to be one of one of the basis for
 
00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
for evaluating these grant applications
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
is going to be the need so that's one of
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
the first things in the rules in terms
 
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
of how we do it is going to be need
 
00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.750 align:start position:0%
of how we do it is going to be need
based

00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
based
 
00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.349 align:start position:0%
based
okay

00:43:59.349 --> 00:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
i'll say representative knuck just a
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
quick one you mentioned the initial uh
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
settlement of 414 000 and you said you
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
sent us information on what the 23 got
 
00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
but did that go to only those 23 or did
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
that go to the counties as well or was
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
it to go to all the political
 
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
subdivisions or was that unique to the
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
23. so it went to the 10 counties and 13
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
cities and towns who hired outside
 
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
contingency council thank you
 
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:44:25.109 --> 00:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
attorney yep

like to recognize uh
 
00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee my

back in this room um
 
00:44:51.069 --> 00:44:51.079 align:start position:0%
i am in here to speak in support of
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
sb275 i will say right now i'm i am not
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
taking a position on the formula but i
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
would like to agree what's been said
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
about the um
 
00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:01.839 align:start position:0%
ideal opportunity here is that we have
 
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
to understand that this money will go to
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
um opiate abatement and to
 
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
make up for
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
um just the dangerous situations we were
 
00:45:14.309 --> 00:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
in when people were um
 
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
with the opiate epidemic and so i
 
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
applaud that whereas um we have an
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
alcohol fund where very little of that
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
money goes to actually um prevention
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
treatment and recovery mri you indicate
 
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
you have copies of written testimony
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
is that in your hand right now yeah yeah
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
you just distribute that and just give
 
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
the quick overview because
 
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
so i will be two minutes based on that
 
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
i'm in support of the bill especially
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
around um the aspect of the bill that
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
and um adds prevention programs for
 
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
funding for the opiate abatement trust
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
fund um we appreciate representative
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald and representative
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
acton putting in this bill right now if
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
you look at the projects that can be
 
00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
funded under the opiate abatement trust
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
fund it's outlined about recovery and
 
00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
treatment and we really feel the full
 
00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
continuum of care is necessary
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
when you talk about um
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
um uh opiate abatement um the damage
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
that was done and and what the trust
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
fund can go to so we are in support of
 
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
the bill but in particular the section
 
00:46:26.069 --> 00:46:26.079 align:start position:0%
that adds prevention to um what the fund
 
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
short and sweet
 
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.240 align:start position:0%

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
good morning committee members my name
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
is catherine heck i represent the new
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipal association and i
 
00:46:58.710 --> 00:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
did not plan to comment today as we are
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
mostly following this legislation
 
00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
however based on testimony and the
 
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
recent development of an amendment i
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
felt it prudent that i raised some
 
00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.109 align:start position:0%
felt it prudent that i raised some
concerns

00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
so i won't repeat any previous testimony
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
i'll be brief
 
00:47:14.309 --> 00:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
we're not taking a firm position on the
 
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
bill as you know because we don't
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
support some members over others however
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
we and we agree that the counties have a
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
very different function and different
 
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
programs and municipalities would have
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
we have not seen the amendment
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
and we have been in contact with the 13
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities that originally signed in
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
to the original settlement which are
 
00:47:38.549 --> 00:47:38.559 align:start position:0%
belmont berlin claremont concord dairy
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
dover franklin keene laconia londonderry
 
00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
manchester nashua and rochester and
 
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
they would not like to see any change in
 
00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.230 align:start position:0%
they would not like to see any change in
allocation

00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
allocation
 
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
they already have programs in place to
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
treat educate and mitigate the ongoing
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
battle with this crisis
 
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
however communities that are not part of
 
00:48:00.549 --> 00:48:00.559 align:start position:0%
the original sentiment based on the 2020
 
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
legislation might not have signed on
 
00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
because they also have or will be
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
developing programs and agreed with the
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
allocations in currently in legislation
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
our members are concerned about any
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
change and formula and they would like
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
to see the original language stand
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
unless a further study and input could
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
be made possible and that's all i have
 
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:24.559 align:start position:0%
unless you have questions sir thank you
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
ms hack questions for ms heck
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
no we're clear thank you very much
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
the last person that we have signed up
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
is uh ms kate
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
is that her guy
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire association of counties
 
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
and you have a a handout
 
00:48:48.309 --> 00:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
and and uh two minutes to provide the
 
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
overview yes mr chairman thank you i
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
will be very brief uh the association of
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
counties does support senate bill 275
 
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
primarily because the nursing home
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
administrator position was left vacant
 
00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
for nearly two years i was informed last
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
week that the governor finally did make
 
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
an appointment um to the commission for
 
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
the nursing home administrator however
 
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
we feel that the nursing homes
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
administers have an extremely important
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
voice on the study commission or on the
 
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
opioid trust fund i apologize and that
 
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
they uh deserve to have that position
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
filled so and we had someone ready to go
 
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
two years ago so
 
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
i will say just on the amendment we did
 
00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
support house bill
 
00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.670 align:start position:0%
support house bill
1565

00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
1565
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
primarily because counties are the only
 
00:49:41.589 --> 00:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
entity that is statutorily required to
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
pay for mat funding in addition to the
 
00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
state prison obviously
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
but just to give the committee an idea
 
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
on the cost it's a little over 2 million
 
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
for the 10 counties to run an m.a.t
 
00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:54.150 align:start position:0%
for the 10 counties to run an m.a.t
program

00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
questions for ms hogan
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%

00:50:11.119 --> 00:50:12.790 align:start position:0%
chair pearson you may exit the building

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:12.800 align:start position:0%

will
 
00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
ensure that the new secure psychiatric
 
00:50:55.829 --> 00:50:55.839 align:start position:0%
unit that's going to be built on the
 
00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
grounds of new hampshire hospital
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
will be managed and operated by the
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
and not be privatized
 
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
some months ago um about probably six
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
months now
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner chevinette announced
 
00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:15.030 align:start position:0%
commissioner chevinette announced
publicly

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
publicly
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
plan for operation of the as new spu
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
would be the case we would be
 
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
running it
 
00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
operating it
 
00:51:31.109 --> 00:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
with oversight by the department
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
but this bill will place the state's
 
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.589 align:start position:0%
but this bill will place the state's
responsibility

00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
for the care of individuals not guilty
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
by reason of insanity incompetent to
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
stand trial or civilly committed into
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
statute so this will be the
 
00:51:47.119 --> 00:51:48.710 align:start position:0%
statute so this will be the
legislature's

00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
legislature's
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
policy making opportunity
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
the bill does permit the department to
 
00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
follow the model that's currently in
 
00:51:56.319 --> 00:51:57.349 align:start position:0%

00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
entity
 
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
such as dartmouth hitchcock
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
for the provision of clinical services
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
this is what we are doing at this state
 
00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:14.630 align:start position:0%
this is what we are doing at this state
hospital

00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
it's working well and it's what the
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
senate believes
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
we should be doing with the secure
 
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
psychiatric unit that we're
 
00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:25.030 align:start position:0%
psychiatric unit that we're
planning

00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
planning
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to try and answer questions
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative kanark thank you very
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
much uh thank you senator rosenwald that
 
00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
we we received a letter
 
00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:36.390 align:start position:0%
we we received a letter
um

00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
from uh neil kirk uh who
 
00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
had raised concerns that that we'd be
 
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
hiring very highly paid executives to
 
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
oversee the contractor's operation
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like what you're saying is
 
00:52:51.359 --> 00:52:52.309 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like what you're saying is
that

00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
we'd be doing the same as you're already
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
doing that is to hire clinicians outside
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
and that the goal is that we would uh
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
the department would still
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
run it and manage it which they again
 
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
they already do with the with the
 
00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital correct
 
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
that's correct and um just to to expand
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
on that as you know the state is
 
00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
in the process of acquiring hampstead
 
00:53:17.359 --> 00:53:18.710 align:start position:0%
in the process of acquiring hampstead
hospital

00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:20.470 align:start position:0%
hospital
and

00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
we have approved through the fiscal
 
00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:24.390 align:start position:0%
we have approved through the fiscal
committee

00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:25.790 align:start position:0%
committee
six

00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
administrative positions
 
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
one of which is
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
a ceo
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
i or ceo i believe
 
00:53:39.790 --> 00:53:39.800 align:start position:0%
and we have appropriated something like
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
165 thousand dollars you will not find a
 
00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:45.430 align:start position:0%
165 thousand dollars you will not find a
hospital

00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
a private hospital
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
manager for anywhere close to that
 
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
amount of money i mean at dartmouth the
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
president makes over a million dollars
 
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
in nashua i think they make
 
00:53:59.430 --> 00:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
three quarters of that so
 
00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
the state does not
 
00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:02.710 align:start position:0%
the state does not
overpay

00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
overpay
 
00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:05.670 align:start position:0%
overpay
executives

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
and representative snow gets to turn on
 
00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
representative k mckay's mike he never
 
00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
can get this to work
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
there's a bad corner over there
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
am i correct uh senator
 
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
my good friend
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
that uh there really will be two
 
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
secure psychiatric units
 
00:54:37.829 --> 00:54:37.839 align:start position:0%
one under department of correction and
 
00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
one under health and human services
 
00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
is that an accurate statement there
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:48.549 --> 00:54:48.559 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that there will be
 
00:54:48.559 --> 00:54:49.750 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that there will be
one

00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
but that
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
the individuals who are currently
 
00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
in the secure psych unit which is
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
presently located in the men's prison
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
would be moved to the new
 
00:55:04.829 --> 00:55:04.839 align:start position:0%
facility when it
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
opens and if if i'm incorrect i'm sure
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
i'll be correct senator from the
 
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
oversight committee that's what i
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative snow
 
00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
it was my understanding
 
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
that several of the people that are in
 
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
the secure psychiatric unit that's now
 
00:55:29.109 --> 00:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
operated at new hampshire prison are
 
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
incarcerated patients and that the
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
incarcerated patients could not be moved
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
to the new forensic hospital for
 
00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
security reasons so that that operation
 
00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
at least for the incarcerated patients
 
00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
would continue
 
00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
i guess under the department of
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
corrections and the reason for moving
 
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
towards the forensic hospital was
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
currently people who are
 
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
hot who are at new hampshire hospital
 
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
who become assaultive or commit other
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
offenses that require greater
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
control are now switched to the prison
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
even though they've never been to court
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
so that was one of the underlying
 
00:56:06.309 --> 00:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
reasons for developing the forensic
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
hospital so people that are not
 
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
convicted of a crime do not get mixed in
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
with the prison population but those
 
00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
that have already been convicted of a
 
00:56:15.839 --> 00:56:17.829 align:start position:0%
that have already been convicted of a
prison

00:56:17.829 --> 00:56:17.839 align:start position:0%
prison
 
00:56:20.309 --> 00:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
would remain at that same unit and it
 
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
would operate as a forensic unit and i
 
00:56:23.829 --> 00:56:23.839 align:start position:0%
assume it would continue to be under the
 
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
department of corrections
 
00:56:28.069 --> 00:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
am i wrong about that
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh i don't
 
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative i don't know what you've
 
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
been told by the department of
 
00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:35.670 align:start position:0%
been told by the department of
corrections

00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
corrections
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
point of voter representative weber
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
is there perhaps somebody here from the
 
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
who could tell us exactly what the
 
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
answer to that question is the cherubs
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
accepts your second
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
we're doing it
 
00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
and would that person please come
 
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
forward thank you
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%

am the director of medical and forensic

department of corrections
 
00:57:24.789 --> 00:57:24.799 align:start position:0%
and we had this exact same question
 
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
posed us when the bill was heard in in
 
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
00:57:30.789 --> 00:57:30.799 align:start position:0%
and for purposes of just clarification
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
to revisit mckays and represent snow's
 
00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:34.230 align:start position:0%
to revisit mckays and represent snow's
question

00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
the population currently being served at
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire state prison currently
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
being served includes those who arrived
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
there by virtue of the criminal process
 
00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
there was a crime committed they were
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
adjudicated and they ended up there and
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's just a very short um a version of
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
it you can hear the longer version by ms
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
mattis when i'm done with a high level
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
and then also the shorter version as
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
well is that there's a population that
 
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
were considered
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
or found to be forensically dangerous
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
and needed to be
 
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
transferred from the probate court
 
00:58:07.589 --> 00:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
process which is different for an
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
involuntary admission to the state
 
00:58:12.309 --> 00:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
hospital this is a very high level
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
summary of where things are currently
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
the direction that was provided by the
 
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
legislature in terms of policy for
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
developing a new secured psychiatric
 
00:58:24.069 --> 00:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
facility was primarily focused on the
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
population that was coming into the
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
process through the probate court
 
00:58:29.829 --> 00:58:29.839 align:start position:0%
through involuntary admissions
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
i am sure that ms mattis may be able to
 
00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
further clarify but my understanding
 
00:58:36.069 --> 00:58:36.079 align:start position:0%
would be that that would be the
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
population that would be served by the
 
00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
new hospital that the legislature has
 
00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:42.559 align:start position:0%
already set forth uh the bill in front
 
00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
of you
 
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
deals with refining uh allowing us the
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
flexibility to doing the current process
 
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
of hiring our clinicians from dartmouth
 
00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:51.190 align:start position:0%
of hiring our clinicians from dartmouth
hospital

00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
through our contract with them to
 
00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:54.559 align:start position:0%
provide those clinical services for the
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
hospital so that is very high level and
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
i hope that made sense to everybody and
 
00:58:59.910 --> 00:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
if not this mattis will certainly make
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
much more sense than i
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
don't know about that yes representative
 
00:59:03.599 --> 00:59:05.270 align:start position:0%
don't know about that yes representative
weber

00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
weber
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
before we go on so that we might do this
 
00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:10.309 align:start position:0%
before we go on so that we might do this
quickly

00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:12.789 --> 00:59:12.799 align:start position:0%
i think we all know how we got here the
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
question was simply
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
after the forensic hospital is built
 
00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
will the people who were
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
incarcerated criminally continue to be
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
treated at
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
the prison or will those people go over
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
to the forensic hospital so i don't care
 
00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
which one of you answers that that's the
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
question that i think we're trying to
 
00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
get at
 
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
we will continue to provide inpatient
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
psychiatric services for those
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
incarcerated residents at the new
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of corrections
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
i would
 
00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
i would ask going forward that any
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee and any
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
statements from those testifying address
 
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
to the bill exactly literally and while
 
00:59:58.950 --> 00:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
the other information is valuable we are
 
01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
on a tight schedule understood thank you
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions
 
01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
okay representative cushman
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:00:10.319 --> 01:00:11.349 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman

01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
your question is of whom
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
i was going to ask mr williams um but i
 
01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:18.559 align:start position:0%
don't even know if he's the one that i
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
should ask okay look at the bill is it
 
01:00:24.549 --> 01:00:24.559 align:start position:0%
about the bill yes okay um so
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
it sounds like we're hearing an example
 
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
that the state would contract with
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
dartmouth hitchcock is is
 
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
how do we how is that contract going to
 
01:00:35.109 --> 01:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
be determined is that going to go out to
 
01:00:35.119 --> 01:00:36.150 align:start position:0%
be determined is that going to go out to
bid

01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
bid
 
01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.670 align:start position:0%
bid
um

01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:00:42.309 --> 01:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
okay it's going out to bid um
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
do we know if it's it's absolutely
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
necessary to hire administrators i know
 
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
that you said that they're not paid or
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
the last speaker said that they're not
 
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
paid you know an exorbitant amount
 
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
compared to the private sector um but is
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
it necessary to hire such administrative
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
staff as a ceo or is there um is it
 
01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:01.839 align:start position:0%
similar to like where you hire a
 
01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
staffing agency they don't send a co
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
they just send the clinicians you know
 
01:01:08.829 --> 01:01:08.839 align:start position:0%
the nurses the the physicians and and
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
such is it necessary to hire
 
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
administrative staff the bill says the
 
01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
department may do this
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's what we have that's what we're
 
01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
i see no further questions relating is
 
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
this related to the bill we have before
 
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
us okay representative gay
 
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
hi we're all trying to speak and think
 
01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.349 align:start position:0%
hi we're all trying to speak and think
quickly

01:01:31.349 --> 01:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
01:01:31.359 --> 01:01:32.230 align:start position:0%
quickly
uh

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
the the immediate question was
 
01:01:37.109 --> 01:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
does this contract
 
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
does this say that we are contracting
 
01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
for a co and this just says it may
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
contract with private medical
 
01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
organization for clinical services so
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
that opens a door to a big
 
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
interpretation personally i would think
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
you need a co if you have a certain
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
number of people not jermaine they'll we
 
01:01:59.029 --> 01:01:59.039 align:start position:0%
are giving them permission to run a
 
01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
hospital we'll trust how they do it
 
01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.190 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
um

01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
the chair would like to invite
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative leon into the room she is
 
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
next door babysitting
 
01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
and before we go forward to see if
 
01:02:20.549 --> 01:02:20.559 align:start position:0%
there's no other questions on this and i
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
see none
 
01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:25.839 align:start position:0%
then i will close the hearing on senate
 
01:02:30.549 --> 01:02:30.559 align:start position:0%
bill 391 and open the exact session on
 
01:02:32.829 --> 01:02:32.839 align:start position:0%

01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
i would move out to pass
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
representative weber moves ought to pass
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
somebody from
 
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
the other side
 
01:02:48.549 --> 01:02:48.559 align:start position:0%
representative acton

01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
representative not our opponent you're
 
01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
in different places from where you well
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
this this seat was available well of
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
course it was it was yours
 
01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
and we're friends oh i know anyway okay
 
01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
having worked at new hampshire hospital
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
and interned there 25 years ago
 
01:03:23.829 --> 01:03:23.839 align:start position:0%
the arrangement with dartmouth
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
works very well and if this psychiatric
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
facility is going to be built
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
very near there
 
01:03:33.029 --> 01:03:33.039 align:start position:0%
is that true
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
the facility i believe will be attached
 
01:03:37.029 --> 01:03:37.039 align:start position:0%
to the hospital
 
01:03:37.039 --> 01:03:37.670 align:start position:0%
to the hospital
and

01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
so i had heard private well
 
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
conversations that having
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
the same organization you know uh
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
oversee hospital staff you know so a
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
doctor could do a little bit in one
 
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
hospital and in the other they wouldn't
 
01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
have to hire a whole new set of people
 
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
if this hospital had been built you know
 
01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
20 miles away so i think it's a good
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
arrangement and i think we should pass
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none and thank you so much
 
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
everybody would the clerk or one of them
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
the motion is ought to pass on senate
 
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%

everybody's going to get a turn today i
think

01:05:55.349 --> 01:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:05:58.230 --> 01:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
just a point about 275 which we heard a
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
minute ago
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
it is due out next week
 
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
and there's no point in executing it
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
because we've got all kinds of emails
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
coming our way to read it will be exact
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
it is an early bill
 
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
it is i believe the only early bill we
 
01:06:19.349 --> 01:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
have today but we get a slew of them
 
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
next week
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
open the hearing on senate bill 229 an
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
act relative to pharmacist
 
01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
administration of vaccines
 
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
and she's ready to go thank you
 
01:06:35.109 --> 01:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to still be here
 
01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
for the record cindy rosenwald from
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
senate district 13 in nashua
 
01:06:43.549 --> 01:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
and i'm pleased to bring you senate bill
 
01:06:43.559 --> 01:06:45.349 align:start position:0%
and i'm pleased to bring you senate bill
229.

01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
229.
 
01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
um this bill is a request of the
 
01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:50.870 align:start position:0%
um this bill is a request of the
pharmacists

01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
pharmacists
 
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
and it will add certified pharmacy
 
01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
technicians to the list of health care
 
01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.150 align:start position:0%
technicians to the list of health care
professionals

01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
who are authorized to administer flu
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
and covet vaccines under the direct
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
supervision of a licensed pharmacist
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
so this
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
is allowed under the current federal
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
emergency order it was also authorized
 
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
under governor sununu's emergency orders
 
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
but because the state's emergency orders
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
have expired the board of pharmacy
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
believes our statute overrides the still
 
01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
existing federal emergency order
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
so the change to state law to allow this
 
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
group of individuals to give limited
 
01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:43.029 align:start position:0%
group of individuals to give limited
vaccinations

01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
vaccinations
 
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
i believe is a member of the board of
 
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
pharmacy if not its chair
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
he probably could
 
01:07:59.599 --> 01:08:00.710 align:start position:0%
he probably could
speak

01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
speak
 
01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:02.390 align:start position:0%
speak
on

01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.910 align:start position:0%
on
why

01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:06.390 align:start position:0%
why
certain

01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
certain vaccines
 
01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
don't require
 
01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:11.990 align:start position:0%
don't require
higher

01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
higher
 
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
levels of
 
01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
licensed or certified professionals but
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
this is a request of pharmacists
 
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
and the board of pharmacy i believe
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
helped the senate with some language
 
01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.470 align:start position:0%
helped the senate with some language
changes

01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator

our society continues to be in the midst
 
01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
of a truly unprecedented time and we
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
have the tremendous privilege as
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%

patients as they are going through
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
some of the most vulnerable times
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
um with the rapid expansion of clinical
 
01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
pharmacy services across the industry
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
it's ushered in a new era for pharmacy
 
01:09:56.709 --> 01:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
certified pharmacy technicians for their
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
roles to advance
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the guidance under the prep
 
01:10:02.709 --> 01:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
act as well as the emergency order
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire number 79 this allowed
 
01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
pharmacy certified pharmacy technicians
 
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
to administer covet vaccines
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
and then with the passing of senate bill
 
01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:16.310 align:start position:0%
and then with the passing of senate bill
155

01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
155
 
01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
they continued to allow that even once
 
01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
so the new hampshire board of pharmacy
 
01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
voted unanimously to support senate bill
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
229 allowing our certified technicians
 
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
to expand to flu vaccines
 
01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
this the certified technician does need
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
certified to start so they do go through
 
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:44.080 align:start position:0%

becoming certified to administer
 
01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
vaccines which is the same program the
 
01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
will you take questions oh absolutely
 
01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:13.520 align:start position:0%

01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
we had a similar bill last session um hb
 
01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
572 that came through and it was passed
 
01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:21.350 align:start position:0%
572 that came through and it was passed
um

01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
by the senate and the house and signed
 
01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
by the governor can you just explain how
 
01:11:28.149 --> 01:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
this bill is different from that one and
 
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
um so what changes are made between the
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
law that was passed by that bill and and
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
what makes this one necessary please yes
 
01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
i believe that is a license yes
 
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
so that bill allowed licensed advanced
 
01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
pharmacy technicians which is a new
 
01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
um role that is still
 
01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
kind of being rolled out in the state we
 
01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
don't actually have any licensed
 
01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
advanced pharmacy technicians yet um and
 
01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:57.990 align:start position:0%
with the
that

01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
licensee class had kind of started well
 
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
before covid hit
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
so with covid and justine how beneficial
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
having these technicians that are
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
certified so they're not licensed
 
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
advanced yet
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh certified being
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
able to give the coveted vaccines
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
it has just
 
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
helped pharmacy and community pharmacies
 
01:12:19.679 --> 01:12:20.870 align:start position:0%
helped pharmacy and community pharmacies
specifically

01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
tremendously and as you know the cdc
 
01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
recommends getting your covet shot or
 
01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
booster along with your flu shot so a
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
lot of times it would cause confusion
 
01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
when they were in the room getting their
 
01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
covered vaccine
 
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
by a technician and then all of a sudden
 
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
they say oh no i want my flu shot and
 
01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
they go hold on now i need to go get the
 
01:12:38.239 --> 01:12:39.830 align:start position:0%
they go hold on now i need to go get the
pharmacist

01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
pharmacist
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
and um all the clinical
 
01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
oversight is done by the pharmacist
 
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
we've checked
 
01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
you know their consent form their health
 
01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
anything is done and then we're
 
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
basically handing over the active
 
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.350 align:start position:0%
basically handing over the active
administration

01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
administration
 
01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
to the certified technician
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
so i think especially come the fall this
 
01:12:59.590 --> 01:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
will really alleviate stresses in the
 
01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.910 align:start position:0%
will really alleviate stresses in the
pharmacy

01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
pharmacy
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative nutter upham
 
01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question a quick
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
question who else can administer
 
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
shots um
 
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
lnas are
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
like nurses
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted i wondered who else so
 
01:13:26.229 --> 01:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
with much less training than probably
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
your pharmacists have
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
what's my point i don't know yeah i know
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
um just from myself being you know going
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
to a clinton clinic um pretty much
 
01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
anyone the medical assistants the
 
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
lnas the nurses
 
01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
have been giving them as far as flu you
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
know i don't know the others right um in
 
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy so far we have pharmacists
 
01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
and interns giving them
 
01:13:53.189 --> 01:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
um interns can give
 
01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
pretty much any of the ones that
 
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
pharmacists can as well
 
01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
so okay thank you very much
 
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
representative cushman thank you mr
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
chairman so um
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to fix the fact that
 
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
they they couldn't um administer flu
 
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
shots but they had a narrow means of
 
01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
administering coveted vaccines under rsa
 
01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
318 colon 16-f which are repealing in
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
line 16 of this bill
 
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
section of law required
 
01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
particular conditions that would permit
 
01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
them to administer coveted vaccines such
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
as the the vaccination is ordered by the
 
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
supervising pharmacist the supervising
 
01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
pharmacist was ready readily and
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
immediately available um
 
01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
that the cova vaccine was fda authorized
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
or fda licensed that the vaccine was
 
01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
ordered and administered according to
 
01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
the advisory committee on immunization
 
01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:46.640 align:start position:0%
practices recommendations
 
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
that the registered you know there's a
 
01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
list of of um things in place to make
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
sure that they're administered safely um
 
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
that proper training is in place and you
 
01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
know that it meets some certain
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
standards um before it can be
 
01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:00.149 align:start position:0%
standards um before it can be
administered

01:15:00.149 --> 01:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
administered
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
is there can you um speak to why you're
 
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
repealing that that that sect or why the
 
01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:06.229 align:start position:0%
repealing that that that sect or why the
sponsor

01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
and why you guys support repealing that
 
01:15:08.239 --> 01:15:09.270 align:start position:0%
and why you guys support repealing that
section

01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
so yes
 
01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:11.990 align:start position:0%
so yes
most

01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
most
 
01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.030 align:start position:0%
most
the

01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
most basic answer is so that we can
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
include flu vaccines because that
 
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
strictly prohibits them from doing
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
anything more than the covet
 
01:15:23.189 --> 01:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
again the certified technicians
 
01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
and certainly if approved the board of
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
pharmacy will
 
01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
you know formulate rules around just as
 
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
we have for pharmacists
 
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
around administering vaccinations
 
01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.510 align:start position:0%
around administering vaccinations
um

01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
one follow-up
 
01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:41.030 align:start position:0%
one follow-up
um

01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
so i mean without repealing the section
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
though they could still administer the
 
01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
flu shots with just the the addition in
 
01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
section one of adding certified pharmacy
 
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
technicians um there's no need to repeal
 
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
this section if that's the only reason
 
01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
and and i you know i have some
 
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
discomfort with taking it out of statute
 
01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
and just leaving it up to rules
 
01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:00.149 align:start position:0%
and just leaving it up to rules
um

01:16:00.149 --> 01:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
and and i i do have another you know
 
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
my follow-up is
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
um i noticed that this also takes out
 
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
the requirement to
 
01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:10.390 align:start position:0%
the requirement to
um

01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
report adverse event events
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
to the vares
 
01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
database that was in the original build
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
miss sheriff i mean
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
is this jermaine specifically to what
 
01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
she just asked because you've got a few
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
heads it really is oh then absolutely go
 
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
for it okay
 
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
if you go back and look at
 
01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
the rsa 318
 
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
16b all the things that you're referring
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
to representative cushman are in that
 
01:16:39.189 --> 01:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
statute as well
 
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
so when the repeal 318
 
01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:43.030 align:start position:0%
so when the repeal 318
f

01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
f
 
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
which is redundant to 318 b
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
we're still maintaining the same
 
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
yeah and so what i'll take a look okay
 
01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
take a look if you don't thank you thank
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
you and now
 
01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
with his mic on and ready to go
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
representative snow
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
so i know i'm the leader well
 
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
i'm in charge of a microphone and i'm
 
01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
the least competent microphone operator
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
in the entire world but you did well
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
this time i did i did well i just want
 
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
to confirm i think she answered my
 
01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:17.510 align:start position:0%
to confirm i think she answered my
question

01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:17:18.790 --> 01:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
this bill would
 
01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
allow the
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh what is
 
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
the new pharmacy technician to only do
 
01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
covert and influenza nothing else and
 
01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming also that this technician
 
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
would never be giving shots to somebody
 
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18. is that correct
 
01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:35.669 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18. is that correct
no

01:17:35.669 --> 01:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:17:35.679 --> 01:17:36.630 align:start position:0%
no
no

01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:37.430 align:start position:0%
no
no

01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
this would
 
01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
yes allow only flu and covet
 
01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
but it would be
 
01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:45.350 align:start position:0%
but it would be
um

01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.470 align:start position:0%
um
below

01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
below
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
it does say
 
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
yes it does say at the end it says
 
01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
which have been approved
 
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
to individuals
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
18 years of age or older as ordered by
 
01:18:06.630 --> 01:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
the immunizing pharmacy
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
oh okay but i am sorry i i thought that
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
had been
 
01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:18:13.110 --> 01:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:18:15.189 --> 01:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair and thank you snow
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
basically the way the statue is written
 
01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
they are only
 
01:18:26.149 --> 01:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
allowed to give to the general public
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
the flu vaccine and covet vaccine
 
01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
any other vaccine has to be done by
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
somebody 18 and older the reality is
 
01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
this and talking to this
 
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
is the fact that children under the age
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
of 18 qualify for the universal
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
immunization program vaccine program so
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
when you talk to community pharmacies
 
01:18:46.229 --> 01:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
they do not participate in that program
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
so even though a law allows them to do
 
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
it the reality is they can't because
 
01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
they don't get the vaccine from the
 
01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:51.990 align:start position:0%
they don't get the vaccine from the
state

01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
so that's just a clarification point on
 
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
that as well
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
so representative weber
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
wave off
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
and seeing no further questions on this
 
01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:19:16.750 --> 01:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
this closes the hearing on senate bill
 
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
229 i know there were some
 
01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
questions earlier representative cushman
 
01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:23.910 align:start position:0%
questions earlier representative cushman
um

01:19:23.910 --> 01:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh are you good to go
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
do you want to write amendments or
 
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh i may be interested in well we're
 
01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
going to we're going to go to an exec so
 
01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
it's got to be a you really do you want
 
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
that fast okay so no okay i do have an
 
01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
amendment to submit to the committee to
 
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
this bill yes do you have it with you
 
01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:44.550 align:start position:0%
this bill yes do you have it with you
yes

01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
well then we will need to open an exact
 
01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:48.830 align:start position:0%
well then we will need to open an exact
session

01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
right i think we closed 229 if we didn't
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
we just did
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
mr careful well he's distributing can i
 
01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
clarify uh for representing snow that
 
01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:58.229 align:start position:0%
clarify uh for representing snow that
question

01:19:58.229 --> 01:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:19:59.830 --> 01:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
just when he's distributing oh well
 
01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
actually we're not in anything so let's
 
01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:02.950 align:start position:0%
actually we're not in anything so let's
open

01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
open
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
the exec session on senate bill 229
 
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
representative canarch yes the language
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's already currently in statute
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
below is the issue about 18 and under
 
01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
and that is only for the uh
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:20:18.310 --> 01:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
diseases listed in line seven through uh
 
01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:19.189 align:start position:0%
diseases listed in line seven through uh
nine

01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
nine
 
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
the point is that the
 
01:20:23.189 --> 01:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
phraseology in line five to the general
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
public has to do again with only the flu
 
01:20:26.629 --> 01:20:26.639 align:start position:0%
and the covenant
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
so the point is it is to the general
 
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
public which would be a fifteen-year-old
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
for covet for example or for flu because
 
01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
they do get it there but the other ones
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
are still for only over 18. it was
 
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
what representing merchants said is
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
correct but i just want to make it a
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
little easier that the statutory
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
information this breaks into the two
 
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:26.830 --> 01:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
and representative merchant if you would
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
like to
 
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
introduce your amendment
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
i should be careful how i say this
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
because it's really kind of a
 
01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:48.310 align:start position:0%
because it's really kind of a
housekeeping

01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
you know and our history with
 
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
housekeeping has not been the last time
 
01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
that led to some really good stuff sure
 
01:21:57.990 --> 01:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
did so so what i have before you is the
 
01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.030 align:start position:0%
did so so what i have before you is the
amendment

01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
which is amendment 2022
 
01:22:04.149 --> 01:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
13 12 h
 
01:22:04.159 --> 01:22:05.350 align:start position:0%
13 12 h
and

01:22:05.350 --> 01:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
why i'm amending it is if you look at
 
01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
the current bill
 
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
under the pharmacy intern in line three
 
01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
which goes into line four refers to rsa
 
01:22:16.629 --> 01:22:16.639 align:start position:0%
318 b 15b
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
and also licensed advanced pharmacy
 
01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
technician under rsa
 
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.709 align:start position:0%
technician under rsa
318-15c

01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
318-15c
 
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
however when you talk about the
 
01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
certified technician directly with the
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
board there's no reference to an rsa so
 
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
all this does is reference it back to
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
the rsa which is 318.
 
01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:34.629 align:start position:0%
the rsa which is 318.
um

01:22:34.629 --> 01:22:34.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:34.639 --> 01:22:35.430 align:start position:0%
um
b

01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
b
 
01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:38.719 align:start position:0%
sorry 38 3 18 15 a so we're being
 
01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
consistent throughout the the bill the
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
statute that we're anchoring everything
 
01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
would you like to move your amendment
 
01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
please i would like to
 
01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
you may ask a question representative
 
01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:54.709 align:start position:0%
you may ask a question representative
weber

01:22:54.709 --> 01:22:54.719 align:start position:0%
weber
 
01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
i want to be sure i understand what this
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
is doing because it looks to me like
 
01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:01.830 align:start position:0%
is doing because it looks to me like
uh

01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
section one as inserted by section one
 
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
are you not replacing all of section one
 
01:23:14.310 --> 01:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
of the bill by that language and
 
01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
therefore you're losing a great deal of
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:27.189 --> 01:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
that's a good question representative
 
01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:28.639 align:start position:0%
i think you're going to lose a great
 
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
deal of content if you pass this as it
 
01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:33.430 align:start position:0%
deal of content if you pass this as it
is

01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
wow uh representative kanark i had the
 
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
same question at first i thought it
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
replaced all of them but since it says
 
01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
only the part that is the 318
 
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
scott 16 be
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
roman 1 as inserted by section 1 it only
 
01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
takes the lines 13 through 15.
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
so it does it might was my worry is it
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
replaced all of section 1 but it says
 
01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
right the the the 3 18 16 be called
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
roman 1 as inserted by section 1. so i
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
think it's okay okay
 
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
okay agree this
 
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
because you i wouldn't have drafted it
 
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
that way but okay
 
01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
representative those who know the
 
01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
subject area better or comfortable with
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
it all differ we have not a motion
 
01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
before the floor we're clarifying to see
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
whether this motion for the amendment
 
01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
should be put
 
01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:31.510 align:start position:0%
should be put
so

01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:32.229 align:start position:0%
so
okay

01:24:32.229 --> 01:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
i want to point out that i'm not
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
clarified yet uh on the insertion of
 
01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
the reference to reporting to bears
 
01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
and when
 
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
when you gave uh the explanation of
 
01:24:50.550 --> 01:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
duplication between f and
 
01:24:52.229 --> 01:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
whatever the other one is
 
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
i i want to make sure before i vote on
 
01:24:57.189 --> 01:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
this i want to make sure that it does
 
01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
include the two points that
 
01:25:02.229 --> 01:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative cushman
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
pointed out if mr fma yes uh
 
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative merchant this is under
 
01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:08.629 align:start position:0%
representative merchant this is under
318

01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
318
 
01:25:08.639 --> 01:25:10.390 align:start position:0%
318
16b

01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
16b
 
01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
if you look at the number seven it says
 
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
submit reports of any vaccine adverse
 
01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
reactions following vaccinations to the
 
01:25:16.159 --> 01:25:17.830 align:start position:0%
reactions following vaccinations to the
cdc

01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
cdc
 
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
first via theirs
 
01:25:22.229 --> 01:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
okay so we're retaining
 
01:25:24.149 --> 01:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
retaining that correct
 
01:25:24.159 --> 01:25:24.950 align:start position:0%
retaining that correct
okay

01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
and as far as looking for the issue of
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
um training and so forth it's also if
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
you look at
 
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
that section
 
01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
we're looking for it
 
01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
two three four five six and seven remain
 
01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:47.669 --> 01:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
01:25:47.679 --> 01:25:48.870 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
so

01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
there is some that's repetitive between
 
01:25:53.669 --> 01:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
that section that um section two of the
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
bill seeks to repeal um it's uh rsa 318
 
01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
colon 16f but there are some pieces of
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
it that are not in in
 
01:26:04.629 --> 01:26:04.639 align:start position:0%
318 b
 
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
um including that the certified pharmacy
 
01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
technician shall complete um
 
01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:13.030 align:start position:0%

01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
that they shall review the vaccine
 
01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
registry or other vaccination records
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
before ordering
 
01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
the registered or certified pharmacy
 
01:26:32.470 --> 01:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
technician to administer the vaccination
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
that the supervising pharmacist shall
 
01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
comply with any applicable requirements
 
01:26:38.229 --> 01:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
or conditions of use as set forth in the
 
01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
cdc's copen 19 vaccination provider
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
agreement and any other federal
 
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
requirements that apply to
 
01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
administration of the vaccine that the
 
01:26:48.149 --> 01:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
vaccine is fda authorized or licensed
 
01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
that it's ordered you know there's
 
01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of things that are in
 
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
318 16f that we will lose that were
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
there to protect the consumers of these
 
01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:00.070 align:start position:0%
there to protect the consumers of these
products

01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
products
 
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
knowing that they were
 
01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
new and
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
experimental so
 
01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
especially the you know the cpr
 
01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
and making sure that there's no
 
01:27:11.189 --> 01:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
duplication um
 
01:27:13.110 --> 01:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
i think those were important
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
um guidelines you know
 
01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:18.719 align:start position:0%
and i i i would rather see
 
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
i mean i have no issue with the bill
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
besides section two that repeals that
 
01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
part really um there is still the verse
 
01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
um requirement because that's in section
 
01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:28.790 align:start position:0%
um requirement because that's in section
one

01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh section roman numeral one of 16b but
 
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
but with section
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
two repealing um these safeguards that
 
01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i i do
 
01:27:47.110 --> 01:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
understand that as a newer vaccine it
 
01:27:48.629 --> 01:27:48.639 align:start position:0%
may make sense to have a lot more of
 
01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:50.719 align:start position:0%
these i'm curious if we would look at
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
putting a sunset provision onto that to
 
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
not repeal it now or repeal it two years
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
out or three or four years out if that
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
might be a way to prevent it from
 
01:28:00.310 --> 01:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
needing to come before the committees
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
again but still allow those protections
 
01:28:03.430 --> 01:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
for what
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
is a better understood but truly still
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
new vaccine so that we can
 
01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
so that we can keep that for now
 
01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
and then phase it out over time
 
01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
not sure if that would be something that
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
would address that concern
 
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that would be definitely
 
01:28:20.709 --> 01:28:20.719 align:start position:0%
meeting the issue in the middle i think
 
01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
that you know that would be appropriate
 
01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
after some time
 
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
um i also just have concerns about these
 
01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines being administered to children
 
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
under 18 i don't know i don't i'm not
 
01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
particularly comfortable with that
 
01:28:33.669 --> 01:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
exception i know that's not the content
 
01:28:36.709 --> 01:28:36.719 align:start position:0%
of this bill right now um but i i think
 
01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
it's something important to think about
 
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
if we're doing an amendment
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me we are going to be
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
preparing some amendments to this
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
we are in an executive session i've not
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
called for any motions from the floor
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
that's where we are in this
 
01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:57.270 --> 01:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
well it's up to you mr chair as to
 
01:28:59.110 --> 01:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
whether we continue with the executive
 
01:29:01.030 --> 01:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
session or just close the executive
 
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
session and let people go and get
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
whatever amendments they want to get
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
that is what i'm about to do thank you
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
and watch me do it
 
01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
this closes the exact session on 229 it
 
01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:13.510 align:start position:0%
this closes the exact session on 229 it
is

01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
due out the door by the end of the month
 
01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
it is not an early bill and we will kick
 
01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
it down the road to
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
two weeks from today and take a look at
 
01:29:27.189 --> 01:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
the amendments now
 
01:29:30.070 --> 01:29:30.080 align:start position:0%

01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
from senate district 13
 
01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
in nashua
 
01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
and i am pleased to bring before you
 
01:29:57.709 --> 01:29:57.719 align:start position:0%
sena pill
 
01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
454 this is a study committee bill
 
01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
and its purpose is to study the
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
information collected by the division of
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
vital records
 
01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
when a woman gives birth in new
 
01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:12.790 align:start position:0%
when a woman gives birth in new
hampshire

01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
as you know
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
vital records is part of the secretary
 
01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
of state's office and new hampshire is
 
01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
the only state
 
01:30:25.030 --> 01:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
that does not house vital records in the
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
we did
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
up until 2003
 
01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:33.270 align:start position:0%
up until 2003
and

01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
in that year it was moved to the
 
01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
department of state as part of the
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
budget trailer bill
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
i asked senate research to see if they
 
01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
could find out the reasons
 
01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
for moving um
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
for moving this division
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
out of health and human services which
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
49 other states plus the district of
 
01:30:58.950 --> 01:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
columbia do
 
01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
they could only point to one sentence in
 
01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
the trailer bill
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
that said it was to consolidate vital
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
records with other records maintained by
 
01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
so we really don't have any records of
 
01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:13.590 align:start position:0%
so we really don't have any records of
discussion

01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
surrounding the impact of moving these
 
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.270 align:start position:0%
surrounding the impact of moving these
records

01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
records
 
01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
with some extremely private information
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
in them
 
01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
at the hearing on house bill 2 and that
 
01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
back then
 
01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:28.189 align:start position:0%
back then
the

01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
aclu did mention they had some privacy
 
01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:33.189 align:start position:0%
aclu did mention they had some privacy
concerns

01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
i would also point out that the move
 
01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:36.870 align:start position:0%
i would also point out that the move
from

01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
health and human services to the
 
01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
department of state
 
01:31:43.830 --> 01:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
was made before the hipaa privacy rule
 
01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
was enacted
 
01:31:48.629 --> 01:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
with its standards and guidelines and
 
01:31:48.639 --> 01:31:50.629 align:start position:0%
with its standards and guidelines and
stiff

01:31:50.629 --> 01:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
stiff
 
01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
fines for
 
01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:54.390 align:start position:0%
fines for
violations

01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
violations
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
so the department of health and human
 
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
services is covered by hipaa but the
 
01:32:02.790 --> 01:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
department of state is not covered by
 
01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:04.870 align:start position:0%
department of state is not covered by
hip

01:32:04.870 --> 01:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
hip
 
01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
every birth in new hampshire is recorded
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
by the secretary of state
 
01:32:13.189 --> 01:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
and they issue a birth certificate
 
01:32:16.149 --> 01:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
this includes details such as when and
 
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
where the birth occurred the name of the
 
01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:19.270 align:start position:0%
where the birth occurred the name of the
baby

01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
baby
 
01:32:21.510 --> 01:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
who the parents are and this makes
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
complete sense to be housed in the
 
01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
department of state
 
01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
however much more information is
 
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
collected from the hospital
 
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
or birthing center
 
01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
and the mother
 
01:32:38.709 --> 01:32:38.719 align:start position:0%
and is transmitted to the secretary of
 
01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
state although it is only used
 
01:32:45.110 --> 01:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
in eventually de-identified form by the
 
01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
division of public health which
 
01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
is in dhhs
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
public health regularly de-identifies
 
01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
protected health information
 
01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
for important projects for example
 
01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
tracking low birth weight babies covered
 
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
by medicaid maternal substance abuse
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
issues the department of state does not
 
01:33:11.110 --> 01:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
use this information although they
 
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
maintain it in totally identified form
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
so the
 
01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
information that is collected by the
 
01:33:22.709 --> 01:33:22.719 align:start position:0%
secretary of state from hospitals and
 
01:33:22.719 --> 01:33:25.189 align:start position:0%
secretary of state from hospitals and
mothers

01:33:25.189 --> 01:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
mothers
 
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
is done on a worksheet i am not going to
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
hand out the worksheet because
 
01:33:32.870 --> 01:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
the vital records division doesn't
 
01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
actually make it public
 
01:33:38.550 --> 01:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
but it's covered in rsa 5
 
01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
c colon 19
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to share the worksheet
 
01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:45.430 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to share the worksheet
privately

01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
privately
 
01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:46.390 align:start position:0%
privately
with

01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
anyone on this committee but out of
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
respect for vital records i'm not going
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
to distribute
 
01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
this worksheet so it doesn't become part
 
01:33:58.149 --> 01:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
of the bill's record
 
01:34:00.870 --> 01:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
mothers are asked however to fill out a
 
01:34:02.709 --> 01:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
form which is transmitted to the
 
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
she is required
 
01:34:10.149 --> 01:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
under rsa 5c to provide her medical
 
01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
record number
 
01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
her height
 
01:34:14.310 --> 01:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
her weight
 
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
both before she got pregnant
 
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
and at the time of delivery
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
whether she drank alcohol while she was
 
01:34:24.629 --> 01:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
pregnant and how much
 
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
whether she smoked before and during
 
01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and how much she smoked she is
 
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
not given the opportunity to opt out of
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
answering these personal questions it is
 
01:34:39.669 --> 01:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
required by statute and she has warned
 
01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
on the form that if she lies it is a
 
01:34:44.550 --> 01:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
class b felony
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
in addition to this
 
01:34:49.109 --> 01:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
extremely personal information that we
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
require women to tell the secretary of
 
01:34:52.159 --> 01:34:53.030 align:start position:0%
require women to tell the secretary of
state

01:34:53.030 --> 01:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
the facility where the birth takes place
 
01:34:59.350 --> 01:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
is also sending confidential health
 
01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
information there including the date of
 
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
the woman's last period
 
01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
the number of previous live births the
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
number of previous pregnancy losses
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
whether she is breastfeeding
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
what medical procedure she had
 
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
during childbirth her medical conditions
 
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
and health risks and whether she was
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
using drugs
 
01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know about you
 
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
but i am extremely
 
01:35:30.870 --> 01:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with the idea of all this
 
01:35:33.990 --> 01:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
private medical information being held
 
01:35:36.709 --> 01:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
by the secretary of state
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
they do
 
01:35:40.149 --> 01:35:40.159 align:start position:0%
not use it
 
01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
and they certainly shouldn't
 
01:35:45.229 --> 01:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
they state that they have strict
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
confidentiality rules and i'm sure
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's the case but they are not covered
 
01:35:52.629 --> 01:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
by hipaa so they are not
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
subject to the really very stiff fines
 
01:35:57.750 --> 01:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
that can be
 
01:36:01.669 --> 01:36:01.679 align:start position:0%
levied federally and enforced by the
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
attorney general of the states
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
and as we know breaches can and do occur
 
01:36:11.669 --> 01:36:11.679 align:start position:0%
even in new hampshire and once sensitive
 
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
information is exposed it's very hard to
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
undo it
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
so i believe and the senate believes we
 
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
need to take a good long look
 
01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
at what's being collected
 
01:36:27.030 --> 01:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
and where it goes there are options
 
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
before us
 
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
we could move vital records back to dhhs
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
and then we'd be like all other states
 
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
we could split up this birth information
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
and have the hospitals transmit the
 
01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
information that becomes their part of
 
01:36:46.709 --> 01:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
the birth certificate
 
01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
to the department of state
 
01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:49.990 align:start position:0%
to the department of state
and

01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
all of the public health and medical
 
01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
information could be transmitted
 
01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
directly to dhhs
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
we could leave everything it the way it
 
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:00.950 align:start position:0%
we could leave everything it the way it
is

01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
and make the health information sections
 
01:37:04.719 --> 01:37:05.590 align:start position:0%
and make the health information sections
uh

01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
optional or voluntary for the for the
 
01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
mother to release
 
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
but i don't believe we should do nothing
 
01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
and all of the options that i just
 
01:37:20.550 --> 01:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned have both pros and cons
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
both on policy but also cost so
 
01:37:26.709 --> 01:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
i think before we should act we should
 
01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
be prudent and and take a look at our
 
01:37:32.709 --> 01:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
options over the summer and the fall and
 
01:37:34.629 --> 01:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm before you today with the
 
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
study committee thank you mr chair
 
01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:40.310 align:start position:0%
study committee thank you mr chair
i

01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:37:42.149 --> 01:37:42.159 align:start position:0%
i hardly agree
 
01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
with what you've said
 
01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:45.510 align:start position:0%
with what you've said
however

01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
i have a message from the speaker's
 
01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:48.950 align:start position:0%
i have a message from the speaker's
office

01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
who wants this bill killed
 
01:37:52.629 --> 01:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
not on its merits
 
01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
but we've run pretty much running out of
 
01:37:57.270 --> 01:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
people to put on study committees
 
01:37:59.109 --> 01:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
and i know because i work with the
 
01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
speaker's office not just for health and
 
01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
human services issues but many other
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
issues and believe me
 
01:38:07.590 --> 01:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
it is increasingly increasingly
 
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
difficult what i've suggested to a few
 
01:38:11.669 --> 01:38:11.679 align:start position:0%
other people
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
with bills not just before this
 
01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
committee but others
 
01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:16.790 align:start position:0%
committee but others
is

01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:38:19.030 --> 01:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
someone and usually it's this prime
 
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
could pull together an ad hoc group of
 
01:38:24.870 --> 01:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
people over the summer and do much the
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:26.810 align:start position:0%
same thing
and

01:38:26.810 --> 01:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:27.910 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:38:32.229 --> 01:38:32.239 align:start position:0%
therefore submit an lsr in the fall
 
01:38:34.470 --> 01:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
with the conclusions that group has come
 
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
up with so what we would wind up having
 
01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
next year is a bill
 
01:38:41.189 --> 01:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
that is the message i'm the messenger of
 
01:38:41.199 --> 01:38:42.629 align:start position:0%
that is the message i'm the messenger of
it

01:38:42.629 --> 01:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
um i heard thee would you believe in
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
your question that wasn't a question
 
01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
here's what i would say about that i did
 
01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
consider it but
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
i think any bill that makes any change
 
01:39:03.109 --> 01:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
suggested to how state government
 
01:39:06.070 --> 01:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
operates is likely to have
 
01:39:08.950 --> 01:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
opposition from one department or
 
01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:10.070 align:start position:0%
opposition from one department or
another

01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:14.159 align:start position:0%
and if it has not had the gravitas of an
 
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
official act of the legislature to
 
01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:17.510 align:start position:0%
official act of the legislature to
compel

01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
compel
 
01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:18.629 align:start position:0%
compel
their

01:39:18.629 --> 01:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:39:18.639 --> 01:39:19.750 align:start position:0%
their
input

01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
input
 
01:39:22.709 --> 01:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
i think it is
 
01:39:22.719 --> 01:39:23.750 align:start position:0%
i think it is
uh

01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
easier to
 
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
argue against and kill an eventual an
 
01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
eventual bill i know what i would do
 
01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
information but i'm only one of 424
 
01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.030 align:start position:0%
information but i'm only one of 424
people

01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:41.679 align:start position:0%
and that as you know
 
01:39:44.709 --> 01:39:44.719 align:start position:0%
sir the senate is always reluctant to
 
01:39:44.719 --> 01:39:45.990 align:start position:0%
sir the senate is always reluctant to
studies

01:39:45.990 --> 01:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
studies
 
01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.270 align:start position:0%
studies
particularly

01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
in the second year
 
01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
but this was a a voice vote
 
01:39:54.629 --> 01:39:54.639 align:start position:0%
and um it was unanimous out of a
 
01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
committee it was a voice vote it's a
 
01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill
 
01:39:58.239 --> 01:39:59.189 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill
and

01:39:59.189 --> 01:39:59.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
i think it's
 
01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
worth acting
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
with the gravitas of the legislature
 
01:40:09.109 --> 01:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
senator i anticipated your response and
 
01:40:10.790 --> 01:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
already delivered it to the speaker's
 
01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:11.830 align:start position:0%
already delivered it to the speaker's
office

01:40:11.830 --> 01:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:13.030 align:start position:0%
office
and

01:40:13.030 --> 01:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:15.910 --> 01:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
i'm just the ping-pong ball in the game
 
01:40:28.629 --> 01:40:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
i'm still constrained by the questions
 
01:40:33.109 --> 01:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
so would you believe representative
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
rosenwald that i came in
 
01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
here today fully prepared to vote
 
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
against this bill
 
01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:41.189 align:start position:0%
against this bill
but

01:40:41.189 --> 01:40:41.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:40:44.270 --> 01:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
that your explanation of the privacy
 
01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
considerations and i had no idea of the
 
01:40:48.159 --> 01:40:49.590 align:start position:0%
considerations and i had no idea of the
extent

01:40:49.590 --> 01:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
extent
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
of the worksheet because of course
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
nobody can see the worksheet because
 
01:40:57.030 --> 01:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
it's apparently a private worksheet
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that the extent of the
 
01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:01.830 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that the extent of the
invasion

01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
invasion
 
01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:02.830 align:start position:0%
invasion
of

01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:04.470 align:start position:0%
of
private

01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
private
 
01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:05.830 align:start position:0%
private
personal

01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
personal
 
01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
information which we have a
 
01:41:10.229 --> 01:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment saying we're
 
01:41:12.229 --> 01:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
going to preserve and be very careful
 
01:41:12.239 --> 01:41:13.750 align:start position:0%
going to preserve and be very careful
about

01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:16.639 align:start position:0%
really changes my mind about what to do
 
01:41:19.109 --> 01:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
with this bill and
 
01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
had you brought a bill to
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
change the system i probably would have
 
01:41:26.870 --> 01:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
voted for that too but
 
01:41:29.590 --> 01:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
would you believe that i now am
 
01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
more than willing to change my vote to
 
01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
pass this
 
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
no matter what the speaker wants because
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
i think it's a really important thing to
 
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
be working on
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
would you believe it's easy for the
 
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
speaker to want it i'm the one that has
 
01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
to go do the recruiting
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
anybody else yes representative gay
 
01:41:50.229 --> 01:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
thank you would you believe the speaker
 
01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
might be amenable if three of us
 
01:41:55.669 --> 01:41:55.679 align:start position:0%
volunteered to be contribute
 
01:41:58.870 --> 01:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
wow that is i would believe i'll fall in
 
01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
good work that this committee does
 
01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:04.390 align:start position:0%
good work that this committee does
gosh

01:42:04.390 --> 01:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
gosh
 
01:42:06.870 --> 01:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative weber
 
01:42:08.229 --> 01:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
would you believe that my other
 
01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
suggestion was to appoint three senators
 
01:42:17.109 --> 01:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:17.119 --> 01:42:18.629 align:start position:0%
 
i

01:42:18.629 --> 01:42:18.639 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:21.679 align:start position:0%
i have another study committee bill in a
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
different different
 
01:42:26.229 --> 01:42:26.239 align:start position:0%
house committee now and the senate
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
already took off the second senator that
 
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
i had proposed
 
01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
in that bill but there are fewer of us i
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
i mean really in all seriousness
 
01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
um i
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
think that if our constituents really
 
01:42:44.070 --> 01:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
thought about this
 
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
they would be
 
01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:46.950 align:start position:0%
they would be
um

01:42:46.950 --> 01:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
very supportive of doing a study in my
 
01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
own family
 
01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
i have a seven-month-old grandson who
 
01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
was born in dover
 
01:42:59.590 --> 01:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
and his parents are both
 
01:43:01.990 --> 01:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
lawyers and both have
 
01:43:05.350 --> 01:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
experience in the criminal system
 
01:43:09.189 --> 01:43:09.199 align:start position:0%
and even they were afraid to not fill
 
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
out this incredibly
 
01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
intrusive form
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%

we're not going to use june as the end
 
01:49:01.669 --> 01:49:01.679 align:start position:0%
month so
 
01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
we were going to lose it was six weeks
 
01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
it was a lot of money most people in new
 
01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire die with about 30 35 000 if
 
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
they're lucky so it's a significant
 
01:49:11.830 --> 01:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
amount of money when they take 18 you're
 
01:49:14.709 --> 01:49:14.719 align:start position:0%
paying for a funeral uh everything that
 
01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
goes along with that and um taking care
 
01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
of it
 
01:49:20.070 --> 01:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
whatever there's not much money left for
 
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
most people and
 
01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:23.189 align:start position:0%
most people and
so

01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
i was fortunate enough to be in a
 
01:49:26.629 --> 01:49:26.639 align:start position:0%
position that i could
 
01:49:28.149 --> 01:49:28.159 align:start position:0%
probably put more pressure than most
 
01:49:29.589 --> 01:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
people could and i got a little of it
 
01:49:29.599 --> 01:49:30.550 align:start position:0%
people could and i got a little of it
back

01:49:30.550 --> 01:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
but it was a very unfair thing and did i
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
sign it yes i did but they're in a very
 
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
strong bargaining position you walk in
 
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
and there's no beds available and so
 
01:49:42.550 --> 01:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
should i have read every word and maybe
 
01:49:44.709 --> 01:49:44.719 align:start position:0%
negotiated that contract i probably
 
01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
should have but most people are
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
certainly not even in my position that
 
01:49:50.229 --> 01:49:50.239 align:start position:0%
they would have the background to even
 
01:49:51.750 --> 01:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
read the contract
 
01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:52.790 align:start position:0%
read the contract
so

01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
they were going to keep 18 000. i think
 
01:49:57.189 --> 01:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
in the end i settled when i got like six
 
01:49:57.199 --> 01:49:57.990 align:start position:0%
in the end i settled when i got like six
back

01:49:57.990 --> 01:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
but most people are not they're going to
 
01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
so would say 30 days and it was
 
01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
they also were enforcing me two extra
 
01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
weeks so i thought this was very unfair
 
01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
and i did not want other people falling
 
01:50:12.229 --> 01:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
after me my parents are gone but
 
01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
i'm getting up there in age my kids will
 
01:50:16.550 --> 01:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
deal with it your kids will deal with it
 
01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
we all every single family in new
 
01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire is dealing with this and then
 
01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
by the thousands and thousands every
 
01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:22.310 align:start position:0%
by the thousands and thousands every
year

01:50:22.310 --> 01:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:50:24.790 --> 01:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
so right now it's at 30 days
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
again i was in a situation where they
 
01:50:28.709 --> 01:50:28.719 align:start position:0%
tried to tack on two additional weeks
 
01:50:30.070 --> 01:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not they had a right to do
 
01:50:32.550 --> 01:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
that that's one thing so i looked at the
 
01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
law the law says 30 days from date of
 
01:50:37.830 --> 01:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
death and um i don't like taxing dead
 
01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
people especially because there's no
 
01:50:41.430 --> 01:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
weight at these facilities it isn't like
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to have a 30-day period
 
01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
they can't do it
 
01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
you leave you take your
 
01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
few possessions and they're very meager
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
at most of these nursing homes at the
 
01:50:53.350 --> 01:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
very end are facilities
 
01:50:55.830 --> 01:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
and so from the date that you take the
 
01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
last piece of furniture out you have
 
01:51:00.470 --> 01:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
they have 10 days
 
01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
and that's they probably can find
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
someone in two or three days paint the
 
01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
room put a new carpet in and that's
 
01:51:07.669 --> 01:51:07.679 align:start position:0%
about it so none of the facilities are
 
01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
complaining that the
 
01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
10-day period is a
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
burden on them or anything it's a very
 
01:51:15.589 --> 01:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
fair time period in case you maybe they
 
01:51:18.070 --> 01:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
don't have someone to move right in um
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
maybe the room maybe somebody really
 
01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
damaged the room and just wall damaged i
 
01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
can understand that you got time to fix
 
01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
the room so giving them time
 
01:51:29.669 --> 01:51:29.679 align:start position:0%
a 10-day period which all the nursing
 
01:51:31.510 --> 01:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
homes seem to agree as a fair period of
 
01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:32.310 align:start position:0%
homes seem to agree as a fair period of
time

01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
so we're cutting back um most nursing
 
01:51:36.629 --> 01:51:36.639 align:start position:0%
homes we'll say they're in the vicinity
 
01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
of 12 000 a month
 
01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
so if you go from 30 days down to 10
 
01:51:42.709 --> 01:51:42.719 align:start position:0%
you're giving every family in new
 
01:51:44.709 --> 01:51:44.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire has to deal with this 8 000
 
01:51:44.719 --> 01:51:45.669 align:start position:0%
hampshire has to deal with this 8 000
more

01:51:45.669 --> 01:51:45.679 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
to deal with their family affairs
 
01:51:50.229 --> 01:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
we got to move along will you take
 
01:51:52.470 --> 01:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
questions i will so this seemed very
 
01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
good my only one thing there is a very
 
01:51:57.589 --> 01:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
good a lobbyist who's going to testify
 
01:51:59.669 --> 01:51:59.679 align:start position:0%
after me with an amendment to move it
 
01:52:02.629 --> 01:52:02.639 align:start position:0%
from 10 to 15 because in new england
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
their nursing home groups have tend to
 
01:52:07.350 --> 01:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
have a 15 day period
 
01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's new hampshire
 
01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
if it's a little more paperwork for the
 
01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
nursing homes to make it 10 days it's a
 
01:52:16.070 --> 01:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
2 000 are you okay with this amendment i
 
01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
am not because it's gonna take two
 
01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars out of every new
 
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire family that has to deal with
 
01:52:21.910 --> 01:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
the death
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
so i would rather it stay ten days is 15
 
01:52:27.030 --> 01:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
better than 30 sure it is
 
01:52:28.470 --> 01:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
but when i have a bill that everyone
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
thinks is good at ten days
 
01:52:32.790 --> 01:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
i know it may be in the financial
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
interest of the nursing homes to keep
 
01:52:36.310 --> 01:52:36.320 align:start position:0%
another two thousand of your money i
 
01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
don't think it's fair
 
01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gay
 
01:52:41.669 --> 01:52:41.679 align:start position:0%
after having dealt with this with two
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
parents um i would like to specify
 
01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:48.639 align:start position:0%
be more specific in the date how much
 
01:52:50.950 --> 01:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
you owe or how many days you're charged
 
01:52:54.390 --> 01:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
for because it says i i love this bill i
 
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify
 
01:53:00.149 --> 01:53:00.159 align:start position:0%
that uh with the day of death
 
01:53:01.189 --> 01:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
to me
 
01:53:04.229 --> 01:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
10 days after that ought to be enough 10
 
01:53:06.310 --> 01:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
days after you empty the room
 
01:53:09.510 --> 01:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:11.589 --> 01:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
this is kind of just says the month in
 
01:53:13.030 --> 01:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
which the resident died shall be
 
01:53:15.750 --> 01:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
considered the last month of residency
 
01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
that sounds like you would have to pay
 
01:53:19.589 --> 01:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
for that entire month is there any way
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
to say you pay pro rated up to 10 days
 
01:53:25.109 --> 01:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
after you clear the room the attorneys
 
01:53:26.629 --> 01:53:26.639 align:start position:0%
who have looked at this
 
01:53:28.950 --> 01:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
told me that it means 10 days so the 10
 
01:53:30.870 --> 01:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
days would be but it would be after so
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
if you left a ton of furniture and the
 
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
nurse you know you really occupied that
 
01:53:36.629 --> 01:53:36.639 align:start position:0%
room and you painted murals and did it
 
01:53:38.070 --> 01:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
and takes them
 
01:53:39.510 --> 01:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
we're giving them time to clear it up
 
01:53:41.589 --> 01:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
but it'd be so if you died on a monday
 
01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
your family had the stuff cleared out on
 
01:53:45.109 --> 01:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
thursday it would be 10 days totaling
 
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
from that that thursday when you had
 
01:53:49.109 --> 01:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
your furniture gone could we make
 
01:53:50.950 --> 01:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
spell that out because right now it just
 
01:53:53.189 --> 01:53:53.199 align:start position:0%
says you're obligated for the last month
 
01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
there's nothing about pro rating it
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
almost sounds like you could stretch it
 
01:53:59.589 --> 01:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
and say oh you paid to the whole month
 
01:54:01.990 --> 01:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
and then you have to pay for another 10.
 
01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
make it a question thank you
 
01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:05.510 align:start position:0%
make it a question thank you
representative

01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:54:08.310 --> 01:54:08.320 align:start position:0%
kanark uh yes just a kind of quick
 
01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
question when this
 
01:54:12.870 --> 01:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
on uh line four it says for which
 
01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
residents are paying out of pocket
 
01:54:16.870 --> 01:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
and i was curious why this would not
 
01:54:19.109 --> 01:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
also apply to residents covered by their
 
01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
medicaid or insurance or is that are
 
01:54:23.910 --> 01:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
they covered by different statutes
 
01:54:25.589 --> 01:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's different statutes i
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
was only concerned with your personal
 
01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
money i wasn't really concerned with the
 
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
government medicaid medicare so i could
 
01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
see where that could apply though um and
 
01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
as to your question
 
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative gay i think it's i don't
 
01:54:41.189 --> 01:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
have that a numbered script in front of
 
01:54:42.149 --> 01:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
me i just
 
01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't have lines on my thing but
 
01:54:49.189 --> 01:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
the nursing home assisted facility shall
 
01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
be entitled to rent and fees for not
 
01:54:54.629 --> 01:54:54.639 align:start position:0%
more than 10 days from the date of the
 
01:54:56.470 --> 01:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
resident's death provided that the
 
01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
room's clear i think that makes it clear
 
01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
that it's you get the date of death and
 
01:55:02.310 --> 01:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
then however much time to clear i don't
 
01:55:04.070 --> 01:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
think it needs to be more specific but
 
01:55:06.629 --> 01:55:06.639 align:start position:0%
if this committee does i'd entertain
 
01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
whatever you thought made it more clear
 
01:55:11.589 --> 01:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
representative folsom that's gannon okay
 
01:55:14.790 --> 01:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
um thank you in response a bit thank you
 
01:55:18.950 --> 01:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um senator um
 
01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
where it says or other responsible party
 
01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
at the end
 
01:55:25.510 --> 01:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
does that help include the medicaid
 
01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:28.229 align:start position:0%
does that help include the medicaid
medicare

01:55:28.229 --> 01:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:29.669 --> 01:55:29.679 align:start position:0%
no okay
 
01:55:31.109 --> 01:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
just wanted to
 
01:55:32.470 --> 01:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
i don't think so that's just the
 
01:55:35.350 --> 01:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
material anybody else with a question
 
01:55:37.589 --> 01:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
for the senator seeing
 
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
none um thank you and the chair
 
01:55:42.310 --> 01:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
recognizes brendan williams from the new
 
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire healthcare association
 
01:55:46.629 --> 01:55:46.639 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
01:55:54.310 --> 01:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:56.470 --> 01:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman honorable members
 
01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record i'm
 
01:56:00.070 --> 01:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
brendan williams i'm the president of
 
01:56:01.750 --> 01:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire health care
 
01:56:04.149 --> 01:56:04.159 align:start position:0%
association i'm not the very good
 
01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:06.719 align:start position:0%
lobbyist that uh senator gannon
 
01:56:06.719 --> 01:56:07.990 align:start position:0%
lobbyist that uh senator gannon
referenced

01:56:07.990 --> 01:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
referenced
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
however i do think that this is a very
 
01:56:11.830 --> 01:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
good bill
 
01:56:12.790 --> 01:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
we are
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
seeking a change
 
01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
we think that the bill was
 
01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:17.510 align:start position:0%
we think that the bill was
improved

01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
improved
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
in the senate
 
01:56:23.189 --> 01:56:23.199 align:start position:0%
to provide for the 10-day period
 
01:56:25.510 --> 01:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
we would seek to make that a 15-day
 
01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:26.470 align:start position:0%
we would seek to make that a 15-day
period

01:56:26.470 --> 01:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:56:29.189 --> 01:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
and let me back up and just say that
 
01:56:31.589 --> 01:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
we represent various types of facilities
 
01:56:32.870 --> 01:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
we represent
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh most of the state's private nursing
 
01:56:37.350 --> 01:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
homes with a few exceptions a county
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
nursing home a pediatric care facility
 
01:56:42.070 --> 01:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh continuing care retirement
 
01:56:43.990 --> 01:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
communities and also assisted living
 
01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:45.669 align:start position:0%
communities and also assisted living
facilities

01:56:45.669 --> 01:56:45.679 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
the idea of not charging beyond a
 
01:56:51.109 --> 01:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
resident's death is the norm in nursing
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
homes that wouldn't change the status
 
01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
quo even the 10-day period really
 
01:56:59.510 --> 01:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be necessary for nursing homes
 
01:57:01.750 --> 01:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
with respect to assisted living assisted
 
01:57:03.189 --> 01:57:03.199 align:start position:0%
living is more
 
01:57:06.550 --> 01:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
analogous to living in a residential
 
01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
setting clearly by its definition
 
01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
more analogous to living in say an
 
01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:12.229 align:start position:0%
more analogous to living in say an
apartment

01:57:12.229 --> 01:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
apartment
 
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
the idea that you could somehow
 
01:57:16.950 --> 01:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
turn an assisted living residence in
 
01:57:19.350 --> 01:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
just a couple of days just simply isn't
 
01:57:21.669 --> 01:57:21.679 align:start position:0%
the case particularly now
 
01:57:25.589 --> 01:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
at a time of an acute staffing shortfall
 
01:57:28.229 --> 01:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
throughout our long-term care system
 
01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic
 
01:57:33.189 --> 01:57:33.199 align:start position:0%
there were over 400 000 more employees
 
01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
working for
 
01:57:36.070 --> 01:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and assisted living
 
01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
facilities in our country than there are
 
01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:39.510 align:start position:0%
facilities in our country than there are
today

01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:57:41.350 --> 01:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:57:43.109 --> 01:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
staffing has become very very
 
01:57:44.950 --> 01:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
challenging and
 
01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
facilities assisted living facilities
 
01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
are budgeting in advance
 
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
when they have a resident in order to
 
01:57:54.550 --> 01:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
meet that resident's needs
 
01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639 align:start position:0%
and uh because the
 
01:57:58.790 --> 01:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
setting of an assisted living facility
 
01:58:01.109 --> 01:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
is more residential
 
01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
it's not analogous to say a hospital
 
01:58:06.629 --> 01:58:06.639 align:start position:0%
room which a nursing home room might be
 
01:58:08.310 --> 01:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
deemed analogous to
 
01:58:10.870 --> 01:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
it is something more than that so
 
01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
we think making it 15 days would uh be
 
01:58:17.430 --> 01:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
similar to what connecticut does
 
01:58:19.030 --> 01:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
connecticut is the only other new
 
01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
england state
 
01:58:22.709 --> 01:58:22.719 align:start position:0%
with this type of good consumer
 
01:58:25.270 --> 01:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
protection and we would just simply
 
01:58:28.149 --> 01:58:28.159 align:start position:0%
respectfully suggest that
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
we not go any further than
 
01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
connecticut in establishing this sort of
 
01:58:35.990 --> 01:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
consumer protection because we do have
 
01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:38.320 align:start position:0%
providers that do uh business in other
 
01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
states uh finally i would say that there
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
was a question about uh the second
 
01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:44.390 align:start position:0%
was a question about uh the second
sentence

01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
01:58:46.070 --> 01:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh the month in which the resident
 
01:58:48.629 --> 01:58:48.639 align:start position:0%
passes shall be considered i would
 
01:58:50.550 --> 01:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
respectfully suggest that that sentence
 
01:58:52.950 --> 01:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
just simply be struck because i think it
 
01:58:55.669 --> 01:58:55.679 align:start position:0%
creates a bit of ambiguity and i think
 
01:58:58.470 --> 01:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
that the rest of the
 
01:59:00.790 --> 01:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
language in the bill is clear on its
 
01:59:03.030 --> 01:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
face and with that i would happily take
 
01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:10.229 --> 01:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:12.790 --> 01:59:12.800 align:start position:0%
have you contacted any
 
01:59:15.109 --> 01:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
member of this committee to prepare an
 
01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
amendment such as you advocate
 
01:59:19.830 --> 01:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
i know that uh our lobbyist has shared
 
01:59:22.790 --> 01:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
an email with you uh mr chairman uh with
 
01:59:25.109 --> 01:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
respect to the language of the amendment
 
01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
and has spoken to the
 
01:59:30.310 --> 01:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors of the legislation regarding
 
01:59:32.629 --> 01:59:32.639 align:start position:0%
the idea of an amendment
 
01:59:34.709 --> 01:59:34.719 align:start position:0%
we know that senator gannon has a
 
01:59:36.310 --> 01:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
difference of opinion which i certainly
 
01:59:36.320 --> 01:59:37.910 align:start position:0%
difference of opinion which i certainly
respect

01:59:37.910 --> 01:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
respect
 
01:59:39.910 --> 01:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
with your lead mr chairman i think
 
01:59:46.470 --> 01:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:48.629 --> 01:59:48.639 align:start position:0%
oh yes uh representative gay the uh
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
sentence set begins on line five and
 
01:59:54.070 --> 01:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
goes to line six uh beginning the month
 
01:59:56.390 --> 01:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
i think that that should be str stricken
 
01:59:58.390 --> 01:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
because i i don't think it adds anything
 
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
to the bill and it seems to create a
 
02:00:02.470 --> 02:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
little bit of ambiguity i think the bill
 
02:00:04.709 --> 02:00:04.719 align:start position:0%
itself is very clear on its face in
 
02:00:06.550 --> 02:00:06.560 align:start position:0%
terms of what it's trying to accomplish
 
02:00:08.229 --> 02:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
without that sentence
 
02:00:10.709 --> 02:00:10.719 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
02:00:11.910 --> 02:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:00:13.910 --> 02:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question what's the
 
02:00:16.070 --> 02:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate right now for nursing home
 
02:00:17.350 --> 02:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
or assisted living facility in new
 
02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:18.550 align:start position:0%
or assisted living facility in new
hampshire

02:00:18.550 --> 02:00:18.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
well the vacancy rate in nursing homes
 
02:00:23.030 --> 02:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
is pretty appalling i think that we're
 
02:00:25.350 --> 02:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
probably at a and i have to look at the
 
02:00:27.270 --> 02:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
latest data reported to the federal
 
02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
government we're probably at a 75
 
02:00:33.990 --> 02:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
occupancy rate in nursing homes uh prior
 
02:00:37.189 --> 02:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
to the pandemic we were in excess of 85
 
02:00:40.149 --> 02:00:40.159 align:start position:0%
percent uh probably and uh so we were
 
02:00:40.159 --> 02:00:41.350 align:start position:0%
percent uh probably and uh so we were
actually

02:00:41.350 --> 02:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:42.149 align:start position:0%
actually
uh

02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
pretty full uh prior to the pandemic
 
02:00:46.629 --> 02:00:46.639 align:start position:0%
right now the problem in nursing homes
 
02:00:47.589 --> 02:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
is not
 
02:00:50.149 --> 02:00:50.159 align:start position:0%
a lack of people willing to move into
 
02:00:52.629 --> 02:00:52.639 align:start position:0%
the facilities it's a lack of staff
 
02:00:54.709 --> 02:00:54.719 align:start position:0%
to take in admissions and so the state
 
02:00:56.310 --> 02:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
as you're aware
 
02:00:58.070 --> 02:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
has entered into contracts with some
 
02:01:00.709 --> 02:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
nursing homes in order to provide
 
02:01:02.229 --> 02:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
extra staffing
 
02:01:04.149 --> 02:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
in order to relieve that pressure upon
 
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
the hospitals but
 
02:01:09.109 --> 02:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
that's a admirable uh
 
02:01:10.629 --> 02:01:10.639 align:start position:0%
endeavor on the part of the state but
 
02:01:12.870 --> 02:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
it's a piecemeal approach uh facilities
 
02:01:14.550 --> 02:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
really just can't admit now in many
 
02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:16.550 align:start position:0%
really just can't admit now in many
cases

02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
cases
 
02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
the other part of the question was
 
02:01:19.830 --> 02:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
assisted living facilities i think
 
02:01:22.070 --> 02:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
assisted living facilities are in better
 
02:01:24.229 --> 02:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
shape for the most part assisted living
 
02:01:26.070 --> 02:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
facilities and this kind of gets to a
 
02:01:28.070 --> 02:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
question too that was asked
 
02:01:30.470 --> 02:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
typically in our state do not take
 
02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:31.990 align:start position:0%
typically in our state do not take
medicaid

02:01:31.990 --> 02:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
02:01:34.390 --> 02:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
medicare does not pay for
 
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
assisted living care hardly pays for
 
02:01:38.709 --> 02:01:38.719 align:start position:0%
nursing home care and so
 
02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh i think assisted living facilities
 
02:01:42.950 --> 02:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
are doing better however again you know
 
02:01:45.030 --> 02:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
if you look at the the national data
 
02:01:47.830 --> 02:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
where you know over 400 000 fewer
 
02:01:49.189 --> 02:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
workers now
 
02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
are serving uh residential care in
 
02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
nursing homes uh the federal government
 
02:01:55.910 --> 02:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
lumps those two things together
 
02:01:57.750 --> 02:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
i would say probably three-fifths of the
 
02:02:00.390 --> 02:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
losses in nursing homes but two-fifths
 
02:02:02.550 --> 02:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
would be in assisted living facilities
 
02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:03.350 align:start position:0%
would be in assisted living facilities
so

02:02:03.350 --> 02:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:02:05.189 --> 02:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
everyone's seeing the consequences of
 
02:02:06.629 --> 02:02:06.639 align:start position:0%
the pandemic when it comes to their
 
02:02:06.639 --> 02:02:08.310 align:start position:0%
the pandemic when it comes to their
staffing

02:02:08.310 --> 02:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
staffing
 
02:02:10.149 --> 02:02:10.159 align:start position:0%
representative canark thank you very
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
much for taking my question uh whether
 
02:02:14.229 --> 02:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
we stuck with either 10 days or 15 days
 
02:02:16.470 --> 02:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
either one can you see any reason why
 
02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
this should not apply to all payers and
 
02:02:20.470 --> 02:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
not just to those who are paying out of
 
02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:21.910 align:start position:0%
not just to those who are paying out of
pocket

02:02:21.910 --> 02:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
pocket
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
i really don't see any reason for that
 
02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:25.990 align:start position:0%
i really don't see any reason for that
beyond

02:02:25.990 --> 02:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
02:02:28.709 --> 02:02:28.719 align:start position:0%
whatever complexities might exist
 
02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
or at the federal government level with
 
02:02:35.830 --> 02:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
respect to medicaid and medicare payment
 
02:02:38.070 --> 02:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
and my my sense representative canaric
 
02:02:39.910 --> 02:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
and i cannot answer this definitively
 
02:02:41.350 --> 02:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
for you is that that's probably already
 
02:02:43.350 --> 02:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
taken care of i don't think that the
 
02:02:45.270 --> 02:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
state is paying for
 
02:02:48.390 --> 02:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
empty beds through its medicaid rate
 
02:02:50.790 --> 02:02:50.800 align:start position:0%
if anybody here from the department
 
02:02:52.310 --> 02:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
is here they could they could correct me
 
02:02:54.390 --> 02:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
on that but i wouldn't think so
 
02:02:57.350 --> 02:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
02:02:59.510 --> 02:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
i had essentially the same question as
 
02:03:01.270 --> 02:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
representative knurk only coming from
 
02:03:04.070 --> 02:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
the other direction
 
02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
i was going to ask you how long medicaid
 
02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
pays after somebody dies
 
02:03:11.669 --> 02:03:11.679 align:start position:0%
i i just don't think it probably pays at
 
02:03:14.950 --> 02:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
all after they die medicare
 
02:03:17.109 --> 02:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
i think people have a misapprehension in
 
02:03:19.350 --> 02:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
the general public that it pays for
 
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
nursing home care it does after a
 
02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
qualifying three-day hospital stay
 
02:03:28.470 --> 02:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
in full for 20 days in part for 80 days
 
02:03:30.709 --> 02:03:30.719 align:start position:0%
so while it's a significant source of
 
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
revenue for nursing homes that are
 
02:03:35.189 --> 02:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
engaged in rehabilitation
 
02:03:36.790 --> 02:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't apply at all when it comes to
 
02:03:39.189 --> 02:03:39.199 align:start position:0%
assisted living facilities
 
02:03:43.510 --> 02:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:45.109 --> 02:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much thank you
 
02:03:46.550 --> 02:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
02:03:49.589 --> 02:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
and the chair calls alex
 
02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
kutrubis did i get the name right
 
02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
it was your phonetic spelling that
 
02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:55.350 align:start position:0%
it was your phonetic spelling that
helped

02:03:55.350 --> 02:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
helped
 
02:03:58.229 --> 02:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:59.750 --> 02:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
and if you have written testimony could
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
you start it around uh i do not but i
 
02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
can email it to you if that is
 
02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
acceptable it is acceptable so thank you
 
02:04:07.589 --> 02:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
mr chair and members of the committee uh
 
02:04:09.430 --> 02:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
my name is alex kutrubis i'm here
 
02:04:10.950 --> 02:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
representing the new hampshire
 
02:04:13.510 --> 02:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
association of residential care homes
 
02:04:15.510 --> 02:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
we are in support of the bill
 
02:04:16.870 --> 02:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
just to give you a little quick history
 
02:04:19.030 --> 02:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
we did have some concerns
 
02:04:21.189 --> 02:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
with the bill as introduced however in
 
02:04:23.109 --> 02:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
working with the sponsor in the senate
 
02:04:24.550 --> 02:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
we were able to amend it into something
 
02:04:27.189 --> 02:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
that we can support
 
02:04:29.109 --> 02:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
the issue that we had with the bill was
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
clarifying that personal property and
 
02:04:33.669 --> 02:04:33.679 align:start position:0%
articles need to be removed from the
 
02:04:35.189 --> 02:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
unit before
 
02:04:37.270 --> 02:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
rental fees would end
 
02:04:39.189 --> 02:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
and that issue has been clarified if you
 
02:04:40.790 --> 02:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
look at the bill as amended by the
 
02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
senate in lines eight through ten we
 
02:04:45.189 --> 02:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
feel that that adequately addresses the
 
02:04:45.199 --> 02:04:46.069 align:start position:0%
feel that that adequately addresses the
issue

02:04:46.069 --> 02:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:04:48.550 --> 02:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
in most cases this is not a concern and
 
02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
the family or the responsible party does
 
02:04:53.270 --> 02:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
clear the unit uh very quickly you heard
 
02:04:56.470 --> 02:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
senator gannon had the unit empty uh two
 
02:04:59.669 --> 02:04:59.679 align:start position:0%
days after the passing of his mom
 
02:05:01.589 --> 02:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
so it's it's generally not an issue but
 
02:05:03.350 --> 02:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
occasionally there is an uncooperative
 
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
situation and um we're happy that this
 
02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:07.510 align:start position:0%
situation and um we're happy that this
language

02:05:07.510 --> 02:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:09.679 align:start position:0%
was included in the senate version
 
02:05:12.069 --> 02:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
uh so again we do support the bill
 
02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
and the senate amendment takes care of
 
02:05:16.229 --> 02:05:16.239 align:start position:0%
our concerns i wasn't
 
02:05:18.550 --> 02:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh prepared to speak to brendan's
 
02:05:20.629 --> 02:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
brandon williams's amendment however we
 
02:05:22.629 --> 02:05:22.639 align:start position:0%
certainly would support
 
02:05:25.109 --> 02:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
moving it from 10 to 15 days
 
02:05:26.629 --> 02:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
and i do agree with him i've read this
 
02:05:29.910 --> 02:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
bill many many times and
 
02:05:32.310 --> 02:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
the the sentence
 
02:05:33.990 --> 02:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
the month which the resident died shall
 
02:05:35.430 --> 02:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
be considered for the purposes of rent
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
and fees the last month of residency
 
02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
that sentence has always confused me in
 
02:05:42.550 --> 02:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
this bill too uh so i i definitely think
 
02:05:43.990 --> 02:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
if you remove it it would it would
 
02:05:46.709 --> 02:05:46.719 align:start position:0%
eliminate any ambiguity or confusion um
 
02:05:48.629 --> 02:05:48.639 align:start position:0%
because i think it's it's inconsistent
 
02:05:50.629 --> 02:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
potentially with the remainder of the
 
02:05:50.639 --> 02:05:51.430 align:start position:0%
potentially with the remainder of the
bill

02:05:51.430 --> 02:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:05:53.350 --> 02:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
uh i haven't again we did support it in
 
02:05:54.790 --> 02:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
full disclosure we did support it with
 
02:05:57.669 --> 02:05:57.679 align:start position:0%
the 10 days in the senate however 15
 
02:05:59.510 --> 02:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
days if connecticut's doing that we
 
02:06:01.189 --> 02:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
certainly would not oppose that and i
 
02:06:02.790 --> 02:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
think mr williams made some excellent
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
points of of why we should uh
 
02:06:06.629 --> 02:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
potentially consider moving it to 15
 
02:06:09.030 --> 02:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
days so so with that uh mr chairman i'll
 
02:06:10.950 --> 02:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
um would you take any questions of
 
02:06:14.229 --> 02:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
course any questions
 
02:06:15.830 --> 02:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so much you're welcome
 
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:06:18.870 --> 02:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
i am not
 
02:06:20.709 --> 02:06:20.719 align:start position:0%
in a position to
 
02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
put this amendment in given my horrific
 
02:06:26.790 --> 02:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
schedule uh both of my day jobs are on
 
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
maximum the next two weeks if there is
 
02:06:32.709 --> 02:06:32.719 align:start position:0%
anybody in this committee who is
 
02:06:35.270 --> 02:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
interested enough in doing that
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
02:06:39.830 --> 02:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i would be delighted to get
 
02:06:41.510 --> 02:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
an amendment that removes the
 
02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:43.679 align:start position:0%
troublesome sentence on lines five and
 
02:06:45.750 --> 02:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
six i'm not willing to change the the
 
02:06:48.950 --> 02:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
number of days so if somebody is
 
02:06:50.629 --> 02:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
concerned about the number of days then
 
02:06:53.350 --> 02:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
they need to do it
 
02:06:55.030 --> 02:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
but otherwise i'd be glad to get one
 
02:06:57.189 --> 02:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
that just removes that sentence is there
 
02:07:00.310 --> 02:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
anybody here who is likely to move to
 
02:07:02.709 --> 02:07:02.719 align:start position:0%
present an amendment to move the number
 
02:07:05.669 --> 02:07:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:07.189 --> 02:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
i don't see any
 
02:07:09.109 --> 02:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
representative canarque no but i would
 
02:07:10.709 --> 02:07:10.719 align:start position:0%
want to bring up whether representative
 
02:07:12.149 --> 02:07:12.159 align:start position:0%
weber would be willing to take as a
 
02:07:14.229 --> 02:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
friendly addition the just changing it
 
02:07:15.669 --> 02:07:15.679 align:start position:0%
to all payers
 
02:07:17.669 --> 02:07:17.679 align:start position:0%
if but we have to check out the hhs i
 
02:07:20.069 --> 02:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
would not okay because i'm pretty sure
 
02:07:21.990 --> 02:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
that it's not needed and it's going to
 
02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
cause enormous confusion
 
02:07:25.669 --> 02:07:25.679 align:start position:0%
got it
 
02:07:27.350 --> 02:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
so it looks like the amendment that is
 
02:07:30.069 --> 02:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
being prepared will take out that bad
 
02:07:32.550 --> 02:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
sentence but will not change the number
 
02:07:34.870 --> 02:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
of days from the senate
 
02:07:37.350 --> 02:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
so with that i close the hearing on
 
02:07:39.669 --> 02:07:39.679 align:start position:0%
senate bill 281 and we will bump this
 
02:07:43.669 --> 02:07:43.679 align:start position:0%
down the road two weeks to the 5 and 14
 
02:07:45.430 --> 02:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
the 19th
 
02:07:48.149 --> 02:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
and the amendment will come in at that
 
02:07:48.159 --> 02:07:54.629 align:start position:0%
and the amendment will come in at that
point

02:07:54.629 --> 02:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:56.950 --> 02:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
opening the hearing on senate bill
 
02:07:56.960 --> 02:07:58.470 align:start position:0%
opening the hearing on senate bill
414

02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
414
 
02:07:58.480 --> 02:07:59.350 align:start position:0%
414
fn

02:07:59.350 --> 02:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
fn
 
02:08:01.910 --> 02:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
a relative to the definition of
 
02:08:04.709 --> 02:08:04.719 align:start position:0%
alzheimer's disease and related orders
 
02:08:04.719 --> 02:08:05.990 align:start position:0%
alzheimer's disease and related orders
disorders

02:08:05.990 --> 02:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
disorders
 
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
i was privileged to sit in on a one-hour
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
zoom session on march 29th
 
02:08:14.709 --> 02:08:14.719 align:start position:0%
and also a person-to-person
 
02:08:14.719 --> 02:08:15.669 align:start position:0%
and also a person-to-person
meeting

02:08:15.669 --> 02:08:15.679 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
02:08:19.669 --> 02:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
with the speaker and majority leader and
 
02:08:22.550 --> 02:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
numbers of people who work to care for
 
02:08:25.510 --> 02:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
folks with alzheimer's the next day
 
02:08:27.910 --> 02:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:08:30.229 --> 02:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
i've done my homework and who is going
 
02:08:32.790 --> 02:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
to present this bill
 
02:08:40.470 --> 02:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:46.229 --> 02:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:48.470 --> 02:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
for the record uh jerry knerk
 
02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:49.910 align:start position:0%
for the record uh jerry knerk
uh

02:08:49.910 --> 02:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
carol three and i'm i'm introducing this
 
02:08:54.390 --> 02:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
on behalf of senator kavan
 
02:08:58.229 --> 02:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
kevin avard um i i also was in on the
 
02:09:00.790 --> 02:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
phone call uh conference that we talked
 
02:09:02.950 --> 02:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
about and since i prepared this for that
 
02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
i just volunteered to him that i would
 
02:09:06.390 --> 02:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
do this so that he would not need to be
 
02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
coming over and it turns out he has a
 
02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:09.589 align:start position:0%
coming over and it turns out he has a
conflict

02:09:09.589 --> 02:09:09.599 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
02:09:11.830 --> 02:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
so what sb 414 and i've passed along
 
02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
testimony everybody should have it by
 
02:09:15.430 --> 02:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
now it broadens the definition of
 
02:09:16.870 --> 02:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
alzheimer's disease and related
 
02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
disorders or adrd
 
02:09:22.950 --> 02:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
in rsa 161 f66 to include individuals
 
02:09:24.790 --> 02:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
who demonstrate adrd to an extent that
 
02:09:26.390 --> 02:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
their symptoms interfere with activities
 
02:09:28.310 --> 02:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
of daily living even if that formal
 
02:09:30.950 --> 02:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
diagnosis has yet been made
 
02:09:32.950 --> 02:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
the meeting this definition is necessary
 
02:09:35.589 --> 02:09:35.599 align:start position:0%
to be eligible for respite services
 
02:09:38.149 --> 02:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
under 166 f-67
 
02:09:39.750 --> 02:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
the related disorders are things like
 
02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
vascular disease lewy body dementia
 
02:09:43.750 --> 02:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
frontotemporal and parkinson's
 
02:09:45.430 --> 02:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
the point is that the respite program is
 
02:09:47.750 --> 02:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
in place to support family caregivers
 
02:09:49.830 --> 02:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
therefore that supports care in a less
 
02:09:53.510 --> 02:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
costly home setting rather than um being
 
02:09:55.990 --> 02:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
institutionalized but family caregivers
 
02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
really suffer greatly because of the
 
02:09:59.350 --> 02:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
time commitment when they're taking care
 
02:10:01.109 --> 02:10:01.119 align:start position:0%
of their loved one at home that leads to
 
02:10:03.030 --> 02:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
their own difficulties with mental
 
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
health and physical health we sort of
 
02:10:06.950 --> 02:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
need to provide or support these
 
02:10:08.629 --> 02:10:08.639 align:start position:0%
caregivers before they burn out not and
 
02:10:10.229 --> 02:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
wait until after they've already burned
 
02:10:11.990 --> 02:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
out and put their loved one into a
 
02:10:14.069 --> 02:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
nursing home so the expansion this
 
02:10:16.069 --> 02:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
definition is important to be able to
 
02:10:17.430 --> 02:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
capture those
 
02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
individuals that have become so
 
02:10:21.189 --> 02:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
symptomatic they need a lot of care but
 
02:10:22.790 --> 02:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
they've not yet received the formal
 
02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
diagnosis or when individuals have
 
02:10:26.709 --> 02:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
significant symptoms but they're afraid
 
02:10:28.629 --> 02:10:28.639 align:start position:0%
to go to the provider because they fear
 
02:10:30.470 --> 02:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
the diagnosis or because of things like
 
02:10:31.990 --> 02:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
lack of access
 
02:10:33.510 --> 02:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
there's often a delay of about two to
 
02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
three years between the onset of
 
02:10:37.270 --> 02:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
symptoms and the time of diagnosis
 
02:10:39.830 --> 02:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
clinical diagnosis is easy when you have
 
02:10:42.229 --> 02:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
a simple test that you can do that says
 
02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
yes or no but it's really a lot harder
 
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
when you have a spectrum of disease
 
02:10:48.709 --> 02:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
presentation and also when the early
 
02:10:50.550 --> 02:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
symptoms can be really subtle like who
 
02:10:52.310 --> 02:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
of us in here has not had a time we've
 
02:10:53.830 --> 02:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
been a wee bit forgetful and kind of
 
02:10:55.270 --> 02:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
wondered whether we're going down that
 
02:10:56.629 --> 02:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
road too
 
02:10:59.030 --> 02:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
never happens now you're right um now so
 
02:11:00.950 --> 02:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
the definitive diagnosis of alzheimer's
 
02:11:03.270 --> 02:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
and other related diseases is occur is
 
02:11:04.950 --> 02:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
down at autopsy that's when you examine
 
02:11:06.310 --> 02:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
the brain and you say yep that's for
 
02:11:08.069 --> 02:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
sure what it was but the clinical
 
02:11:10.069 --> 02:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
diagnosis can be fairly accurate if
 
02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
carefully done but carefully done as a
 
02:11:13.589 --> 02:11:13.599 align:start position:0%
key word it takes time
 
02:11:15.430 --> 02:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
the clinical diagnosis you have to do a
 
02:11:18.069 --> 02:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
careful history of the patient and the
 
02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
family and have to take into account
 
02:11:22.310 --> 02:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
that the patient's history often is
 
02:11:24.310 --> 02:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
colored a bit by some of the coping
 
02:11:26.950 --> 02:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
mechanisms that the family and the pa
 
02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:31.350 align:start position:0%
mechanisms that the family and the pa
prov

02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:33.189 align:start position:0%
 
hi

02:11:33.189 --> 02:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
hi
 
02:11:33.199 --> 02:11:35.270 align:start position:0%
hi
okay

02:11:35.270 --> 02:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:11:38.709 --> 02:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
i got you covered welcome okay
 
02:11:42.050 --> 02:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
come back when you can stay longer okay
 
02:11:42.060 --> 02:11:44.149 align:start position:0%
come back when you can stay longer okay
[Laughter]

02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:11:45.510 --> 02:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
all right so um
 
02:11:46.470 --> 02:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
for those who don't know that was
 
02:11:48.870 --> 02:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
senator edward um anyway so take care of
 
02:11:51.510 --> 02:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
the copy mechanism may hide it also you
 
02:11:53.109 --> 02:11:53.119 align:start position:0%
need to do some cognitive mental status
 
02:11:54.950 --> 02:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
screening tests sometimes you have to do
 
02:11:56.950 --> 02:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
advanced imaging like an mri to rule out
 
02:11:58.870 --> 02:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
tumors vascular disease
 
02:12:01.830 --> 02:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
and some times neuropsychiatric testing
 
02:12:04.149 --> 02:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
so as with any diagnosis some providers
 
02:12:05.669 --> 02:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
will have a fairly low threshold for
 
02:12:07.350 --> 02:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
making a diagnosis others may have a
 
02:12:09.430 --> 02:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
high threshold and require advanced
 
02:12:11.030 --> 02:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
testing before they're even going to
 
02:12:13.189 --> 02:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
make the actual diagnosis but other
 
02:12:16.149 --> 02:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
barriers that come in stigma stigma of
 
02:12:17.669 --> 02:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
the diagnosis and the part of both the
 
02:12:19.669 --> 02:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
patient and the provider the provider
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
may be hesitant to make the diagnosis
 
02:12:23.510 --> 02:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
they may be concerned about the
 
02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
diagnosis being distressing to the
 
02:12:27.910 --> 02:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
patient or the family and the patient or
 
02:12:29.910 --> 02:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
family may be in denial again that
 
02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
moment of forgetfulness how many of us
 
02:12:34.390 --> 02:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
go oh my god i hope it's not alzheimer's
 
02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:35.350 align:start position:0%
go oh my god i hope it's not alzheimer's
so

02:12:35.350 --> 02:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:37.109 --> 02:12:37.119 align:start position:0%
they're all there are other systemic
 
02:12:39.030 --> 02:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
things as well like the provider not
 
02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
having enough time to really go into
 
02:12:43.270 --> 02:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
this in detail when they have other
 
02:12:45.030 --> 02:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
medical problems that need attention in
 
02:12:47.350 --> 02:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
that short time and it can often be very
 
02:12:49.109 --> 02:12:49.119 align:start position:0%
difficult for the family to discuss
 
02:12:51.669 --> 02:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
mom's you know problems right in front
 
02:12:52.629 --> 02:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
of her
 
02:12:55.030 --> 02:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
so there's also last as always for those
 
02:12:57.030 --> 02:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
of us particularly rural areas lack of
 
02:12:59.430 --> 02:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
problems or lack of access due to lack
 
02:13:02.149 --> 02:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
of specialist access and there's always
 
02:13:03.910 --> 02:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
the usual cost barriers to obtaining
 
02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
care so what this does
 
02:13:07.830 --> 02:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
it improves the respite program by
 
02:13:10.069 --> 02:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
increasing the eligibility to capture
 
02:13:13.270 --> 02:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
the the caregivers before they burn out
 
02:13:15.270 --> 02:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
and end up having to put somebody
 
02:13:17.589 --> 02:13:17.599 align:start position:0%
into a nursing home that's really what
 
02:13:20.870 --> 02:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:24.709 --> 02:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:26.229 --> 02:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
mr president
 
02:13:31.109 --> 02:13:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:33.030 --> 02:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'll try to be
 
02:13:34.149 --> 02:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
very brief
 
02:13:36.470 --> 02:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
um i went through this i cared for my
 
02:13:37.990 --> 02:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
mother at home
 
02:13:40.149 --> 02:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
and it was a very long process seven
 
02:13:42.870 --> 02:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
years make sure it goes to a question
 
02:13:44.790 --> 02:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
so who makes the determination when
 
02:13:46.870 --> 02:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
there's no clinical diagnosis i mean
 
02:13:49.510 --> 02:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
could i have said oh my mom's got
 
02:13:52.709 --> 02:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
dementia so therefore i i qualify for
 
02:13:54.550 --> 02:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
whatever program
 
02:13:57.030 --> 02:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
i actually had that exact same question
 
02:13:59.510 --> 02:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
and i posed that when i was asked to be
 
02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
a sponsor i think um
 
02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:02.950 align:start position:0%
a sponsor i think um
the

02:14:02.950 --> 02:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:14:04.550 --> 02:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
alzheimer's association may be able to
 
02:14:05.910 --> 02:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
tell us a bit more about it or somebody
 
02:14:07.189 --> 02:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
from the department who does the rest
 
02:14:09.109 --> 02:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
but as i understand the caregiver's
 
02:14:11.589 --> 02:14:11.599 align:start position:0%
self-report if the medical provider has
 
02:14:14.629 --> 02:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
said that the person has uh qualifies as
 
02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
having had that diagnosis but they do
 
02:14:18.550 --> 02:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
not have a form for the medical provider
 
02:14:20.470 --> 02:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
to fill out that is my understanding we
 
02:14:22.470 --> 02:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
can get clarification from them
 
02:14:26.069 --> 02:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
02:14:28.149 --> 02:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
and isn't the point of the change in the
 
02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
disease that we are linking the
 
02:14:34.149 --> 02:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
the entitlement to care not to an actual
 
02:14:34.159 --> 02:14:35.910 align:start position:0%
the entitlement to care not to an actual
diagnosis

02:14:35.910 --> 02:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
diagnosis
 
02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:36.870 align:start position:0%
diagnosis
but

02:14:36.870 --> 02:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:37.669 align:start position:0%
but
to

02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:14:40.229 --> 02:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
a condition in which the symptoms
 
02:14:42.310 --> 02:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
interfere with the activities of daily
 
02:14:43.990 --> 02:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
living so you don't have to have a
 
02:14:47.750 --> 02:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
diagnosis the qualifier is that there's
 
02:14:49.990 --> 02:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
a substantial
 
02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:51.189 align:start position:0%
a substantial
impairment

02:14:51.189 --> 02:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
impairment
 
02:14:52.950 --> 02:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
of the activities of daily living so
 
02:14:55.350 --> 02:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
that more people would qualify yes
 
02:14:56.870 --> 02:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
exactly i mean that's because the point
 
02:14:58.950 --> 02:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
is they may not carry that you know gold
 
02:15:01.109 --> 02:15:01.119 align:start position:0%
card diagnosis as i have alzheimer's but
 
02:15:03.830 --> 02:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
they are so disabled that that's they
 
02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
they need it because of the activities
 
02:15:07.350 --> 02:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
daily living that's really what this
 
02:15:09.270 --> 02:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
build does it expands the definition
 
02:15:11.189 --> 02:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
representative conner did i share with
 
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
you earlier when we discussed this
 
02:15:16.390 --> 02:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
that my father had parkinsonian dementia
 
02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:17.350 align:start position:0%
that my father had parkinsonian dementia
yes

02:15:17.350 --> 02:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:18.550 align:start position:0%
yes
which

02:15:18.550 --> 02:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:15:21.030 --> 02:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
is not alzheimer's disease right but
 
02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
while the symptoms sure are running
 
02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
parallel with it
 
02:15:26.069 --> 02:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
that's the related disorders that's why
 
02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
it's alzheimer's disease and related
 
02:15:29.270 --> 02:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
disorders because there are a number of
 
02:15:31.350 --> 02:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
other related disorders that are in that
 
02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
like as i said it's a spectrum it's a
 
02:15:36.950 --> 02:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
broad diagnosis um and in this case it's
 
02:15:38.550 --> 02:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
a leisure if you have parkinson's you
 
02:15:39.990 --> 02:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
develop it it's probably likely to be
 
02:15:43.270 --> 02:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
the parkinson's dementia but in terms of
 
02:15:45.109 --> 02:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
parsing that out it's the impact on your
 
02:15:47.589 --> 02:15:47.599 align:start position:0%
life that matters it's not the exact
 
02:15:50.149 --> 02:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
diagnosis that matters
 
02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative delemus
 
02:15:55.109 --> 02:15:55.119 align:start position:0%
sorry to beat this one um
 
02:15:57.510 --> 02:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
so is it the caregiver i mean i noticed
 
02:15:59.990 --> 02:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
that my mother was declining and
 
02:16:01.830 --> 02:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
she was definitely you know was a
 
02:16:04.709 --> 02:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
problem so would it have been myself
 
02:16:07.830 --> 02:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
saying hey she's not doing well now can
 
02:16:09.030 --> 02:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
you know she's got
 
02:16:10.870 --> 02:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
i think from what i've read she's got
 
02:16:13.830 --> 02:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
dementia how does this who gets to say
 
02:16:15.510 --> 02:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
that you've got a decline if it doesn't
 
02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
need a diagnosis as best i understand if
 
02:16:19.990 --> 02:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
you would if you were this again it's
 
02:16:21.430 --> 02:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
only having to do with this respite
 
02:16:22.709 --> 02:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
program it has nothing to do with
 
02:16:24.550 --> 02:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
anything else that if you're going to
 
02:16:26.550 --> 02:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
apply for it you were to self-attest
 
02:16:28.470 --> 02:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
they may have some questions about what
 
02:16:31.189 --> 02:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
the impact does on activities daily
 
02:16:32.870 --> 02:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
living if all they require is some very
 
02:16:34.389 --> 02:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
minimal supervision of finance they
 
02:16:35.910 --> 02:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
probably say that doesn't really count
 
02:16:38.070 --> 02:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
but if you're 24 7 caring for them
 
02:16:39.990 --> 02:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's going to count clearly do you
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
wish to follow up
 
02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:43.429 align:start position:0%
wish to follow up
welcome

02:16:43.429 --> 02:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
02:16:45.270 --> 02:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
thank you so would it would have been
 
02:16:46.950 --> 02:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
myself or the the
 
02:16:50.549 --> 02:16:50.559 align:start position:0%
i.e the caregiver who would
 
02:16:52.309 --> 02:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
be the one to determine
 
02:16:53.990 --> 02:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
well they would be the one to apply as
 
02:16:56.230 --> 02:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
far again i will defer to the
 
02:16:58.709 --> 02:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
the alzheimer's association behind me
 
02:17:00.950 --> 02:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
may know the exact answer but likewise
 
02:17:02.070 --> 02:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
if there's anybody here from the
 
02:17:03.990 --> 02:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
department that does that program
 
02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to tell you once it's
 
02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
applied for how do they do the
 
02:17:09.589 --> 02:17:09.599 align:start position:0%
verification i do not know that part
 
02:17:12.230 --> 02:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
we i suggest that we call upon them
 
02:17:13.750 --> 02:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for making your
 
02:17:16.070 --> 02:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
presentation because the people coming
 
02:17:18.070 --> 02:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
up next will probably better answer the
 
02:17:21.030 --> 02:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
questions that have not yet been asked
 
02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:21.830 align:start position:0%
questions that have not yet been asked
call

02:17:21.830 --> 02:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
call
 
02:17:24.870 --> 02:17:24.880 align:start position:0%

care services for persons caring with
 
02:17:59.910 --> 02:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
individuals with alzheimer's and related
 
02:18:01.509 --> 02:18:01.519 align:start position:0%
disorders and making an appropriation
 
02:18:01.519 --> 02:18:02.709 align:start position:0%
disorders and making an appropriation
therefore

for your question um so
 
02:18:19.110 --> 02:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire there are an estimated
 
02:18:20.870 --> 02:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
26 000 individuals living with
 
02:18:23.429 --> 02:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
alzheimer's or dementia and another 58
 
02:18:25.509 --> 02:18:25.519 align:start position:0%
000 or so granite staters
 
02:18:27.910 --> 02:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
caring providing care to those folks
 
02:18:30.309 --> 02:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
caregiving of those living with
 
02:18:31.589 --> 02:18:31.599 align:start position:0%
alzheimer's and dementia can be
 
02:18:31.599 --> 02:18:39.270 align:start position:0%
alzheimer's and dementia can be
incredible

02:18:39.270 --> 02:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:44.309 --> 02:18:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:46.629 --> 02:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
apologies apologies
 
02:18:48.469 --> 02:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
um so caregiving of those living with
 
02:18:50.549 --> 02:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
alzheimer's and dementia uh
 
02:18:52.150 --> 02:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
they have incredibly difficult jobs and
 
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
they often insist assist their loved
 
02:18:55.429 --> 02:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
ones with one or more activities of
 
02:18:57.429 --> 02:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
daily living um including bathing
 
02:18:59.349 --> 02:18:59.359 align:start position:0%
dressing eating things like that and as
 
02:19:01.110 --> 02:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
well as multiple instrumental activities
 
02:19:02.950 --> 02:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
of daily living such as paying bills
 
02:19:04.389 --> 02:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
shopping transportation that kind of
 
02:19:04.399 --> 02:19:05.429 align:start position:0%
shopping transportation that kind of
thing

02:19:05.429 --> 02:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:19:07.509 --> 02:19:07.519 align:start position:0%
83 percent of the help provided to older
 
02:19:09.669 --> 02:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
adults in the united states
 
02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:11.519 align:start position:0%
came from family members in the past
 
02:19:15.190 --> 02:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
year friends or other unpaid caregivers
 
02:19:16.790 --> 02:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
and in new hampshire more than 82
 
02:19:18.629 --> 02:19:18.639 align:start position:0%
million hours of unpaid care to loved
 
02:19:20.790 --> 02:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
ones experiencing alzheimer's or
 
02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:22.389 align:start position:0%
ones experiencing alzheimer's or
dementia

02:19:22.389 --> 02:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
dementia
 
02:19:25.190 --> 02:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
alone happened in 2020 at an estimated
 
02:19:28.469 --> 02:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
economic value of 1.4 billion dollars
 
02:19:29.910 --> 02:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
in order to provide the care for this
 
02:19:31.589 --> 02:19:31.599 align:start position:0%
loved one many caregivers report needing
 
02:19:33.270 --> 02:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
to cut back hours take a leave of
 
02:19:35.429 --> 02:19:35.439 align:start position:0%
absence or leave the workforce entirely
 
02:19:37.669 --> 02:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
they also experience depleted income and
 
02:19:39.429 --> 02:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
finances due to
 
02:19:40.870 --> 02:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
paying for the health care services that
 
02:19:42.389 --> 02:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
their loved one needs
 
02:19:44.150 --> 02:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
the lifetime cost of caring for someone
 
02:19:46.629 --> 02:19:46.639 align:start position:0%
with dementia was estimated at over 370
 
02:19:48.630 --> 02:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in 2020
 
02:19:51.030 --> 02:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
70 of that lifetime cost is borne by
 
02:19:52.630 --> 02:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
family caregivers in the forms of this
 
02:19:54.230 --> 02:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
unpaid caregiving and out-of-pocket
 
02:19:56.070 --> 02:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
expenses for items ranging from
 
02:19:57.750 --> 02:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
medications to food for the person with
 
02:19:57.760 --> 02:19:59.429 align:start position:0%
medications to food for the person with
dementia

02:19:59.429 --> 02:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
dementia
 
02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
in addition to the economic burden place
 
02:20:02.389 --> 02:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
on these caregivers
 
02:20:03.990 --> 02:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
as the person with dementia symptoms
 
02:20:06.389 --> 02:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
worsen caregivers often experience their
 
02:20:08.150 --> 02:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
own increased emotional stress
 
02:20:10.150 --> 02:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
depression and newer exacerbated health
 
02:20:10.160 --> 02:20:11.349 align:start position:0%
depression and newer exacerbated health
problems

02:20:11.349 --> 02:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
problems
 
02:20:14.630 --> 02:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
74 of caregivers or p of people with
 
02:20:16.630 --> 02:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
alzheimer's or dementia reported that
 
02:20:18.230 --> 02:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
they were somewhat concerned to very
 
02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
concerned about maintaining their own
 
02:20:22.389 --> 02:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
health since becoming a caregiver
 
02:20:24.070 --> 02:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
evidence also suggests that providing
 
02:20:25.349 --> 02:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
dementia care
 
02:20:27.110 --> 02:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
can increase their susceptibility to a
 
02:20:29.270 --> 02:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
multiple a multitude of
 
02:20:38.870 --> 02:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
02:20:42.389 --> 02:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
don't look at your text and just
 
02:20:44.389 --> 02:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
summarize your points please sure so i
 
02:20:46.469 --> 02:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
think that representative knurk summed
 
02:20:48.389 --> 02:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
up very well why medical providers may
 
02:20:50.550 --> 02:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
be hesitant to make a diagnosis
 
02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
so i won't i won't pull that out for you
 
02:20:54.710 --> 02:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
but we know that starting respite as
 
02:20:56.790 --> 02:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
soon as possible is beneficial because
 
02:20:58.309 --> 02:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
it helps reduce that burden off of those
 
02:20:59.990 --> 02:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
caregivers the sooner the better
 
02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
obviously um and so the reason that
 
02:21:04.070 --> 02:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
we're changing the definition of
 
02:21:05.349 --> 02:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
alzheimer's to include folks who are
 
02:21:05.359 --> 02:21:06.550 align:start position:0%
alzheimer's to include folks who are
symptomatic

02:21:06.550 --> 02:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
symptomatic
 
02:21:08.469 --> 02:21:08.479 align:start position:0%
to expand this population and get folks
 
02:21:10.150 --> 02:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
who are earlier on in the disease
 
02:21:12.710 --> 02:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
process is why we're doing this last
 
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
thing i'll say which is separate from
 
02:21:16.469 --> 02:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
sort of the facts and figures about this
 
02:21:18.070 --> 02:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
is just a little personal story is that
 
02:21:19.990 --> 02:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
this is personal for me
 
02:21:21.429 --> 02:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
my mom experiences some sort of
 
02:21:22.870 --> 02:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
alzheimer's or dementia we don't know
 
02:21:24.230 --> 02:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
what it is
 
02:21:26.550 --> 02:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
my father who was her primary caregiver
 
02:21:29.349 --> 02:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh takes care of her he for one for one
 
02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
reason or another he doesn't push her to
 
02:21:32.710 --> 02:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
explore a diagnosis he doesn't push her
 
02:21:32.720 --> 02:21:33.910 align:start position:0%
explore a diagnosis he doesn't push her
doctors

02:21:33.910 --> 02:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
doctors
 
02:21:36.550 --> 02:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
very admirable but uh to that same front
 
02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
he needs help he's in over her you know
 
02:21:41.190 --> 02:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
his head with her care um and i believe
 
02:21:42.550 --> 02:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
you know having access to a respite
 
02:21:44.070 --> 02:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
grant could gratefully help him not only
 
02:21:46.469 --> 02:21:46.479 align:start position:0%
him but the 26 000 plus or more
 
02:21:47.670 --> 02:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
individuals who are living in the
 
02:21:49.670 --> 02:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
granite state with alzheimer's dementia
 
02:21:51.590 --> 02:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
so um with that i'm happy to take any
 
02:21:51.600 --> 02:21:54.230 align:start position:0%
so um with that i'm happy to take any
questions

02:21:54.230 --> 02:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:21:54.240 --> 02:21:55.910 align:start position:0%
questions
questions

02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:21:58.070 --> 02:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative merchant thank you mr
 
02:21:59.670 --> 02:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:00.710 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
question

02:22:00.710 --> 02:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:22:01.830 --> 02:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
if we
 
02:22:03.910 --> 02:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
expand the program which i think makes
 
02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:04.950 align:start position:0%
expand the program which i think makes
sense

02:22:04.950 --> 02:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
sense
 
02:22:07.030 --> 02:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
um i saw a note in here that
 
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
it could possibly cause a problem with
 
02:22:11.110 --> 02:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
current recipients because there's not
 
02:22:13.030 --> 02:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
enough money in the budget to
 
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
accommodate that so are we placing
 
02:22:17.670 --> 02:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
people in jeopardy who currently have
 
02:22:20.389 --> 02:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
receiving respect care through the state
 
02:22:20.399 --> 02:22:21.429 align:start position:0%
receiving respect care through the state
funds

02:22:21.429 --> 02:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:22:22.950 --> 02:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
that we don't have enough to take care
 
02:22:24.389 --> 02:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
of everyone who may be
 
02:22:24.399 --> 02:22:25.910 align:start position:0%
of everyone who may be
reclassified

02:22:25.910 --> 02:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
reclassified
 
02:22:26.710 --> 02:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
02:22:28.309 --> 02:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
representative merchant i believe that
 
02:22:29.910 --> 02:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
the department has
 
02:22:31.429 --> 02:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
everything that they need to expand the
 
02:22:33.030 --> 02:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
program right now including an increase
 
02:22:34.870 --> 02:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
in the grant amount think thanks to
 
02:22:37.110 --> 02:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
american rescue plan act funds
 
02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
but when wendy altman is here from the
 
02:22:39.750 --> 02:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
department she may be able to better
 
02:22:41.910 --> 02:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
answer that question for you
 
02:22:45.190 --> 02:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:47.190 --> 02:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:22:48.790 --> 02:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:22:50.950 --> 02:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
um i'm curious about the inclusion of
 
02:22:53.030 --> 02:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
the word irreversible
 
02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:54.309 align:start position:0%
the word irreversible
and

02:22:54.309 --> 02:22:54.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:22:55.590 --> 02:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
i've just been through this with my
 
02:22:59.910 --> 02:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
father so i i'm aware that it's not
 
02:23:01.830 --> 02:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
there's not necessarily an optimistic
 
02:23:04.070 --> 02:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
situation but i guess there's a part of
 
02:23:06.309 --> 02:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
me that wants to be optimistic about the
 
02:23:07.830 --> 02:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
long term
 
02:23:09.830 --> 02:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
dr dale bredesen and others i think have
 
02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:10.950 align:start position:0%
dr dale bredesen and others i think have
explored

02:23:10.950 --> 02:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
explored
 
02:23:10.960 --> 02:23:12.230 align:start position:0%
explored
um

02:23:12.230 --> 02:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:14.389 --> 02:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
you know have have some successes there
 
02:23:14.399 --> 02:23:15.190 align:start position:0%
you know have have some successes there
so

02:23:15.190 --> 02:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:16.870 --> 02:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
02:23:19.429 --> 02:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
does does the is the
 
02:23:23.030 --> 02:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
inclusion of the word irreversible
 
02:23:25.910 --> 02:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
is it is it necessary in your opinion
 
02:23:28.389 --> 02:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
um would it potentially put some people
 
02:23:30.830 --> 02:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
at risk of of not
 
02:23:34.950 --> 02:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
qualifying um as advances are made and
 
02:23:37.190 --> 02:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps there is some
 
02:23:39.750 --> 02:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
new hope for people with alzheimer's
 
02:23:40.950 --> 02:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and i
 
02:23:43.349 --> 02:23:43.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate your optimism um i don't have
 
02:23:44.870 --> 02:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
the bill text in front of me so i can't
 
02:23:46.550 --> 02:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
speak to that line but i will say that
 
02:23:47.990 --> 02:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
alzheimer's and dementia are ultimately
 
02:23:49.910 --> 02:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
fatal diseases as of right now and i
 
02:23:51.190 --> 02:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
look forward to those advances in
 
02:23:52.950 --> 02:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
science where one day we might not get
 
02:23:54.469 --> 02:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
to a place where things are reversible
 
02:23:56.469 --> 02:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
but as it stands right now alzheimer's
 
02:23:58.150 --> 02:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
and dementia are irreversible and fatal
 
02:23:58.160 --> 02:24:00.309 align:start position:0%
and dementia are irreversible and fatal
diseases

02:24:00.309 --> 02:24:00.319 align:start position:0%
diseases
 
02:24:01.990 --> 02:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
um let me ask you a question that
 
02:24:04.550 --> 02:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
follows up on his question
 
02:24:06.870 --> 02:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
if for some reason
 
02:24:08.790 --> 02:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
my dad came out of his parkinsonian
 
02:24:08.800 --> 02:24:10.550 align:start position:0%
my dad came out of his parkinsonian
dementia

02:24:10.550 --> 02:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
dementia
 
02:24:13.190 --> 02:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
he wouldn't need the extra care
 
02:24:16.389 --> 02:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
that he did need when he had it
 
02:24:18.630 --> 02:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
so it becomes a moot point
 
02:24:20.870 --> 02:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
that was a question i would believe it
 
02:24:22.870 --> 02:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you any other questions
 
02:24:26.150 --> 02:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:28.389 --> 02:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
would you believe that as as i read the
 
02:24:32.230 --> 02:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
bill the word irreversible only applies
 
02:24:34.950 --> 02:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
when there isn't actually
 
02:24:37.670 --> 02:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
an alzheimer's diagnosis it's the other
 
02:24:40.070 --> 02:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
conditions that it applies to
 
02:24:40.080 --> 02:24:40.870 align:start position:0%
conditions that it applies to
so

02:24:40.870 --> 02:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:24:43.830 --> 02:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
it might um
 
02:24:47.110 --> 02:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
eliminate for example a traumatic brain
 
02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:48.389 align:start position:0%
eliminate for example a traumatic brain
injury

02:24:48.389 --> 02:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
injury
 
02:24:51.190 --> 02:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
for which recovery was expected
 
02:24:51.200 --> 02:24:52.309 align:start position:0%
for which recovery was expected
but

02:24:52.309 --> 02:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:24:54.550 --> 02:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't apply if if there's actually
 
02:24:56.710 --> 02:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
an alzheimer's diagnosis i would believe
 
02:24:56.720 --> 02:24:58.469 align:start position:0%
an alzheimer's diagnosis i would believe
it

02:24:58.469 --> 02:24:58.479 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:25:00.630 --> 02:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:25:03.270 --> 02:25:03.280 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
02:26:17.590 --> 02:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
and i have hearing aids actually so it's
 
02:26:18.950 --> 02:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
almost ringing in my ear with the
 
02:26:20.870 --> 02:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
microphone but that's okay i can hear
 
02:26:24.070 --> 02:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:24.080 --> 02:26:25.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:26:25.190 --> 02:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:27.990 --> 02:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
so we support we support the definition
 
02:26:31.190 --> 02:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
um the expansion of the definition this
 
02:26:33.830 --> 02:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
is twofold
 
02:26:37.190 --> 02:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
experience and observe the need for
 
02:26:40.309 --> 02:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
individuals to have access to supports
 
02:26:43.429 --> 02:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
and access to information prior to a
 
02:26:43.439 --> 02:26:45.190 align:start position:0%
and access to information prior to a
diagnosis

02:26:45.190 --> 02:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
diagnosis
 
02:26:49.510 --> 02:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
and we also know that many people
 
02:26:51.990 --> 02:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
hesitate to
 
02:26:54.469 --> 02:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
see a physician or a doctor to receive
 
02:26:59.030 --> 02:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:01.750 --> 02:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
we do have resources that have been
 
02:27:05.110 --> 02:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
earmarked to support additional dollars
 
02:27:07.830 --> 02:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
that would go to respite grants
 
02:27:09.990 --> 02:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
as well as to address
 
02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:11.270 align:start position:0%
as well as to address
expansion

02:27:11.270 --> 02:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
02:27:13.830 --> 02:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
of the definition
 
02:27:16.710 --> 02:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
if if that results in additional people
 
02:27:19.110 --> 02:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
being eligible for the program we
 
02:27:22.710 --> 02:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
currently have older americans act arpa
 
02:27:25.590 --> 02:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
funding that will go to support family
 
02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:26.950 align:start position:0%
funding that will go to support family
caregivers

02:27:26.950 --> 02:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
caregivers
 
02:27:29.830 --> 02:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
and this will be allocated to our
 
02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
respite grants including our adrd
 
02:27:38.230 --> 02:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:41.030 --> 02:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
does that conclude your testimony
 
02:27:42.950 --> 02:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
that concludes my testimony and i'd like
 
02:27:45.429 --> 02:27:45.439 align:start position:0%
to be able to answer any questions
 
02:27:48.790 --> 02:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:50.389 --> 02:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up to representative
 
02:27:52.710 --> 02:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
delemus's question earlier could you
 
02:27:55.670 --> 02:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
just explain what happens when somebody
 
02:27:57.510 --> 02:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
when a caregiver applies how the
 
02:27:59.349 --> 02:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
department makes a determination of
 
02:28:01.910 --> 02:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
whether a grant is given
 
02:28:01.920 --> 02:28:03.349 align:start position:0%
whether a grant is given
sure

02:28:03.349 --> 02:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:28:06.469 --> 02:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
currently our family caregiver and adrd
 
02:28:08.910 --> 02:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
respite grants are administered and
 
02:28:11.429 --> 02:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
operationalized through our service link
 
02:28:13.990 --> 02:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
aging and disability resource center
 
02:28:16.389 --> 02:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
programs around the state
 
02:28:19.429 --> 02:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
we have family caregiver specialists who
 
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
perform options counseling as well as
 
02:28:24.950 --> 02:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
information and education
 
02:28:27.190 --> 02:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
they provide that directly to the
 
02:28:28.790 --> 02:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
caregivers who are supporting
 
02:28:30.950 --> 02:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
individuals who present with
 
02:28:33.270 --> 02:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
characteristics or have been diagnosed
 
02:28:35.590 --> 02:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
and are looking to receive respite
 
02:28:35.600 --> 02:28:36.630 align:start position:0%
and are looking to receive respite
grants

02:28:36.630 --> 02:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
grants
 
02:28:38.469 --> 02:28:38.479 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes
 
02:28:40.309 --> 02:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
we will
 
02:28:42.389 --> 02:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
work with those family caregivers and
 
02:28:44.309 --> 02:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
that individual and we will go to see
 
02:28:45.750 --> 02:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
them in person
 
02:28:49.190 --> 02:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
and provide an assessment um looking at
 
02:28:52.790 --> 02:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
what characteristics are they um showing
 
02:28:55.429 --> 02:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
what kinds of needs do they have most
 
02:28:55.439 --> 02:28:56.469 align:start position:0%
what kinds of needs do they have most
often

02:28:56.469 --> 02:28:56.479 align:start position:0%
often
 
02:28:58.630 --> 02:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
it's presenting with the need for
 
02:29:00.630 --> 02:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
assistance with activities of daily
 
02:29:02.630 --> 02:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
living and safety
 
02:29:07.110 --> 02:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:08.790 --> 02:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:29:11.270 --> 02:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:12.070 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
so

02:29:12.070 --> 02:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:13.030 align:start position:0%
so
i

02:29:13.030 --> 02:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:29:15.910 --> 02:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
in just an anecdotal thing
 
02:29:17.910 --> 02:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
i did not know that there was this kind
 
02:29:21.030 --> 02:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
of a program at all for my mother who
 
02:29:23.110 --> 02:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
was suffering so
 
02:29:25.510 --> 02:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
if you don't go to see a doctor to get a
 
02:29:28.150 --> 02:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
diagnosis but you have a loved one that
 
02:29:30.550 --> 02:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
you're caring for how do you know
 
02:29:36.710 --> 02:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:38.630 --> 02:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh oftentimes
 
02:29:41.270 --> 02:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
when we are monitoring and looking at
 
02:29:43.190 --> 02:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
where referrals are coming from they're
 
02:29:44.710 --> 02:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
02:29:46.950 --> 02:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
doctors offices
 
02:29:49.270 --> 02:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
places where individuals may have been
 
02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
seeking or accessing other supports and
 
02:29:53.830 --> 02:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
services such as senior centers
 
02:29:56.309 --> 02:29:56.319 align:start position:0%
adult day programs
 
02:29:59.110 --> 02:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
the alzheimer's association
 
02:30:02.070 --> 02:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
and other groups that
 
02:30:04.150 --> 02:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
may be helping either the family get
 
02:30:06.389 --> 02:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
caregiver or the individual who may be
 
02:30:08.150 --> 02:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
presenting with some of those
 
02:30:08.160 --> 02:30:11.750 align:start position:0%
presenting with some of those
characteristics

02:30:11.750 --> 02:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:14.230 --> 02:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
representative mcmahon
 
02:30:15.990 --> 02:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and good morning
 
02:30:17.590 --> 02:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
madam although
 
02:30:17.600 --> 02:30:19.030 align:start position:0%
madam although
um

02:30:19.030 --> 02:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:21.110 --> 02:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
specific to rates of pay as this is
 
02:30:23.030 --> 02:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
something we've worked on in the past
 
02:30:24.630 --> 02:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
together matter of fact
 
02:30:30.070 --> 02:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh is within this build is there a
 
02:30:33.270 --> 02:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an increased rate of pay
 
02:30:36.630 --> 02:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
for ds direct service providers to
 
02:30:40.150 --> 02:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
be present and take these jobs as as
 
02:30:43.110 --> 02:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
to take care of folks in their homes
 
02:30:43.120 --> 02:30:43.990 align:start position:0%
to take care of folks in their homes
so

02:30:43.990 --> 02:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:30:46.469 --> 02:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
the way the program is operationalized
 
02:30:48.790 --> 02:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
is through an actual respite grant we
 
02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
contract with a
 
02:30:53.990 --> 02:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal management entity who would help
 
02:30:57.830 --> 02:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
with paying for that support or service
 
02:30:59.349 --> 02:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
for example
 
02:31:01.349 --> 02:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
an individual may need respite for a
 
02:31:03.910 --> 02:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
week to be able to go away we would pay
 
02:31:05.830 --> 02:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
for respite at a
 
02:31:07.750 --> 02:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
facility or assisted living or pay
 
02:31:10.230 --> 02:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
somebody to come to the home
 
02:31:12.710 --> 02:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
to provide that care
 
02:31:15.110 --> 02:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's respite so the caregiver
 
02:31:17.429 --> 02:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
can go grocery shopping or run errands
 
02:31:19.590 --> 02:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
and do those kinds of things and it can
 
02:31:20.870 --> 02:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
be the neighbor
 
02:31:20.880 --> 02:31:21.830 align:start position:0%
be the neighbor
or

02:31:21.830 --> 02:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:31:24.469 --> 02:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
um a family member or they can solicit
 
02:31:26.950 --> 02:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
and hire somebody and they would choose
 
02:31:29.429 --> 02:31:29.439 align:start position:0%
and direct how that care would be paid
 
02:31:31.349 --> 02:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
for with the amount of money that we're
 
02:31:33.910 --> 02:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
able to give in the grant
 
02:31:36.230 --> 02:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
one follow-up thank you mr chairman then
 
02:31:38.630 --> 02:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
to be clear there's not there's not as
 
02:31:42.469 --> 02:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
has been in the past an arbitrary cap
 
02:31:44.469 --> 02:31:44.479 align:start position:0%
to what an hourly rate would be to
 
02:31:46.950 --> 02:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
provide this service under that
 
02:31:46.960 --> 02:31:48.309 align:start position:0%
provide this service under that
construct

02:31:48.309 --> 02:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
construct
 
02:31:50.550 --> 02:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
correct there's no uh there's no guard
 
02:31:53.670 --> 02:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
rails in terms of
 
02:31:56.550 --> 02:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
caps on rates of pay or what we will pay
 
02:31:58.790 --> 02:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
for in terms of respite
 
02:31:58.800 --> 02:32:00.230 align:start position:0%
for in terms of respite
it

02:32:00.230 --> 02:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:32:02.469 --> 02:32:02.479 align:start position:0%
is something that's discussed with the
 
02:32:05.349 --> 02:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
family caregiver service link and the
 
02:32:07.190 --> 02:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
exploration of which care providers they
 
02:32:09.110 --> 02:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
want whether that's
 
02:32:11.750 --> 02:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
enrolled licensed providers to provide
 
02:32:13.590 --> 02:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
certain care or
 
02:32:16.070 --> 02:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
asking somebody to come into the home
 
02:32:17.429 --> 02:32:17.439 align:start position:0%
thank you ms allman thank you mr
 
02:32:17.439 --> 02:32:18.710 align:start position:0%
thank you ms allman thank you mr
chairman

02:32:18.710 --> 02:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:32:20.469 --> 02:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
02:32:20.479 --> 02:32:22.070 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
merchant

02:32:22.070 --> 02:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
merchant
 
02:32:24.950 --> 02:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr taking my question
 
02:32:27.190 --> 02:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
i'm looking back on the methodology on
 
02:32:27.200 --> 02:32:28.309 align:start position:0%
i'm looking back on the methodology on
page

02:32:28.309 --> 02:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
page
 
02:32:28.319 --> 02:32:29.670 align:start position:0%
page
three

02:32:29.670 --> 02:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:32:31.110 --> 02:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
and if you look down it talks about a
 
02:32:31.120 --> 02:32:32.230 align:start position:0%
and if you look down it talks about a
fiscal

02:32:32.230 --> 02:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
02:32:35.270 --> 02:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
2021 there's 327 thousand dollars
 
02:32:37.670 --> 02:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate for this program
 
02:32:41.429 --> 02:32:41.439 align:start position:0%
it was reduced to 300 and 2508 in fiscal
 
02:32:43.830 --> 02:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
2223 biennium
 
02:32:46.150 --> 02:32:46.160 align:start position:0%
again my my concern is that i think the
 
02:32:48.630 --> 02:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
policy is a good policy but i hate to
 
02:32:50.389 --> 02:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
look at the policy and saying we don't
 
02:32:52.550 --> 02:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
have the ability to either support it or
 
02:32:54.150 --> 02:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
jeopardize those who currently use the
 
02:32:54.160 --> 02:32:55.270 align:start position:0%
jeopardize those who currently use the
program

02:32:55.270 --> 02:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:32:56.630 --> 02:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
because i think we need to protect the
 
02:32:58.070 --> 02:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
ones that are currently in the program
 
02:33:00.150 --> 02:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
and not have them subject to
 
02:33:01.750 --> 02:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
a harsh reality because there's not
 
02:33:03.990 --> 02:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
enough funds to support the expansion of
 
02:33:10.389 --> 02:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:12.230 --> 02:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
02:33:13.590 --> 02:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
a question
 
02:33:14.710 --> 02:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:33:17.429 --> 02:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
um i'm sorry this is blocking my view so
 
02:33:20.950 --> 02:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:23.510 --> 02:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
so um the the budget that we have in
 
02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:25.070 align:start position:0%
so um the the budget that we have in
biennium

02:33:25.070 --> 02:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
02:33:28.870 --> 02:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
2223 was based off of utilization in
 
02:33:30.870 --> 02:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 20.
 
02:33:33.670 --> 02:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
um what we are doing is monitoring the
 
02:33:33.680 --> 02:33:35.030 align:start position:0%
um what we are doing is monitoring the
need

02:33:35.030 --> 02:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
need
 
02:33:37.830 --> 02:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
and looking to formulate any
 
02:33:42.150 --> 02:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
justification if for an increase in the
 
02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
next biennium in terms of a request for
 
02:33:47.030 --> 02:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
funds to support individuals through
 
02:33:49.110 --> 02:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
this respite grant which we would do
 
02:33:51.270 --> 02:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
through the normal budgeting process so
 
02:33:53.750 --> 02:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
we're monitoring for the need and
 
02:33:56.150 --> 02:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
we'll ensure providing justification for
 
02:33:58.230 --> 02:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
that if there's more funding needed
 
02:34:02.790 --> 02:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:05.990 --> 02:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
so let me just ask about the arpa funds
 
02:34:07.670 --> 02:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
you were talking about this was funds
 
02:34:10.710 --> 02:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
that was already budgeted the the 300
 
02:34:10.720 --> 02:34:15.349 align:start position:0%
that was already budgeted the the 300
and

02:34:15.349 --> 02:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:17.670 --> 02:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
am i right in thinking that first of all
 
02:34:22.230 --> 02:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
with 327 000 that's already budgeted
 
02:34:25.110 --> 02:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
and are there arpa funds in addition to
 
02:34:25.120 --> 02:34:26.550 align:start position:0%
and are there arpa funds in addition to
that

02:34:26.550 --> 02:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:34:29.190 --> 02:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
that are available for payment
 
02:34:30.710 --> 02:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
02:34:34.230 --> 02:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
i mean for a short time anyway
 
02:34:37.590 --> 02:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am yes um representatives they
 
02:34:37.600 --> 02:34:38.630 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am yes um representatives they
the

02:34:38.630 --> 02:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:34:41.590 --> 02:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
budgeted amount which is the 327 is
 
02:34:43.670 --> 02:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
something that's general funds it's in
 
02:34:46.469 --> 02:34:46.479 align:start position:0%
our budget the arpa funds would are in
 
02:34:49.830 --> 02:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
addition to that and the time frame for
 
02:34:52.630 --> 02:34:52.640 align:start position:0%
those older americans arpa funds go
 
02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:53.750 align:start position:0%
those older americans arpa funds go
through

02:34:53.750 --> 02:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:34:56.110 --> 02:34:56.120 align:start position:0%
september 30th
 
02:35:00.230 --> 02:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
2023 so it brings us um it it crosses
 
02:35:02.950 --> 02:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
over overlaps into the next biennium
 
02:35:04.950 --> 02:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
so a follow-up mister
 
02:35:07.670 --> 02:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
so what i'm understanding you to say is
 
02:35:10.389 --> 02:35:10.399 align:start position:0%
that expanding the program is not going
 
02:35:12.150 --> 02:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
to be a problem right now it's not going
 
02:35:14.469 --> 02:35:14.479 align:start position:0%
to result in any loss of services to
 
02:35:17.110 --> 02:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
those already on the program but
 
02:35:19.670 --> 02:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
subsequent to 2023 we would need a new
 
02:35:21.670 --> 02:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
budget allocation based on our
 
02:35:25.110 --> 02:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
experience going forward is that correct
 
02:35:27.910 --> 02:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
yes we would be prepared to
 
02:35:27.920 --> 02:35:29.030 align:start position:0%
yes we would be prepared to
request

02:35:29.030 --> 02:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
request
 
02:35:30.710 --> 02:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
additional funds
 
02:35:34.630 --> 02:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
for this budget for the adrd funds if if
 
02:35:37.510 --> 02:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
the need is demonstrated and
 
02:35:43.429 --> 02:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:45.270 --> 02:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you so
 
02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:46.550 align:start position:0%

bill 414 i have a few announcements here
 
02:37:46.469 --> 02:37:46.479 align:start position:0%
at lunchtime number one we you probably
 
02:37:48.790 --> 02:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
have seen next week's schedule uh has
 
02:37:50.469 --> 02:37:50.479 align:start position:0%
been changed
 
02:37:52.710 --> 02:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
because we got
 
02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:54.870 align:start position:0%
because we got
late

02:37:54.870 --> 02:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
late
 
02:37:56.309 --> 02:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
from the senate
 
02:37:58.309 --> 02:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
some early bills
 
02:38:00.550 --> 02:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
that have to be done next week and they
 
02:38:03.429 --> 02:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
don't look easy some of them
 
02:38:05.590 --> 02:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
secondly therefore we will meet on the
 
02:38:09.830 --> 02:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
12th we will meet on the 19th
 
02:38:12.870 --> 02:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
the next two tuesdays after this and
 
02:38:15.910 --> 02:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:17.349 --> 02:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
she snuck out
 
02:38:19.270 --> 02:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
i almost got her um
 
02:38:21.830 --> 02:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
were there side by side handouts
 
02:38:25.510 --> 02:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
available on the table over there
 
02:38:27.349 --> 02:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
okay well i'll talk with her over the
 
02:38:29.830 --> 02:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
lunch hour and we'll see if we got some
 
02:38:32.950 --> 02:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
any further announcements representative
 
02:38:34.870 --> 02:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
just a question of the chair regarding
 
02:38:34.880 --> 02:38:36.870 align:start position:0%
just a question of the chair regarding
scheduling

02:38:36.870 --> 02:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
scheduling
 
02:38:39.270 --> 02:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
for the early bills they have to be out
 
02:38:42.070 --> 02:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
by the 14th so that means we will hear
 
02:38:44.710 --> 02:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
complicated bills and have to exec them
 
02:38:46.309 --> 02:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
the same day has there been any
 
02:38:49.990 --> 02:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
consideration to putting in a second day
 
02:38:52.550 --> 02:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
on the 13th or 14th so that
 
02:38:54.790 --> 02:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
if there were work that needed to be
 
02:38:57.590 --> 02:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
done on those bills it could get done
 
02:38:59.830 --> 02:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
and we could vote on it
 
02:39:03.670 --> 02:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
there has been consideration but
 
02:39:07.429 --> 02:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
i haven't decided to do it yet
 
02:39:09.990 --> 02:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
if we get permission to do this because
 
02:39:12.309 --> 02:39:12.319 align:start position:0%
it's a short turnaround
 
02:39:14.469 --> 02:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
would anybody
 
02:39:16.710 --> 02:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
object to coming in for a while on the
 
02:39:20.070 --> 02:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
11th which is monday
 
02:39:23.429 --> 02:39:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:25.110 --> 02:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
all right let me check on that thank you
 
02:39:27.830 --> 02:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:29.670 --> 02:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
all right so so that would mean that the
 
02:39:32.790 --> 02:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
early bills would be heard on the monday
 
02:39:35.190 --> 02:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
and then exact on the tuesday which
 
02:39:36.710 --> 02:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
would require changing the schedule
 
02:39:38.309 --> 02:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
again which is a pain in the neck but i
 
02:39:40.070 --> 02:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
think it would be really wise what i
 
02:39:41.590 --> 02:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
will probably do then is move the
 
02:39:43.030 --> 02:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
schedule has been announced from the
 
02:39:45.990 --> 02:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
12th over to the 11th that puts all the
 
02:39:48.150 --> 02:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh early bills up front
 
02:39:50.309 --> 02:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
and then we get some other stuff done
 
02:39:53.510 --> 02:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
and then take the leftovers from today
 
02:39:55.750 --> 02:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
and any leftovers from the 11th and dump
 
02:39:57.510 --> 02:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
them into the 12th and we might not need
 
02:40:00.150 --> 02:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
the 19th and mr speaker
 
02:40:02.150 --> 02:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
02:40:05.349 --> 02:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
i i i suggest that you talk to the clerk
 
02:40:07.110 --> 02:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
immediately about that because they're
 
02:40:08.710 --> 02:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
going to have to do an addendum to the
 
02:40:10.309 --> 02:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
calendar because the calendar on
 
02:40:12.070 --> 02:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
thursday will be too late for a monday
 
02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:13.429 align:start position:0%
thursday will be too late for a monday

him weasel out of that no weasling we
 
02:40:22.309 --> 02:40:22.319 align:start position:0%

this is a really awesome bill
[Music]

03:39:35.590 --> 03:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:39:38.150 --> 03:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
and because it's so simple and
 
03:39:38.160 --> 03:39:39.189 align:start position:0%
and because it's so simple and
um

03:39:39.189 --> 03:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:40.630 --> 03:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's anything political
 
03:39:44.309 --> 03:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
about it it is just ex i'll just
 
03:39:45.750 --> 03:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
read the blurb it's really
 
03:39:48.229 --> 03:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
straightforward it changes the statutory
 
03:39:50.150 --> 03:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
reference from glucagon injections to
 
03:39:52.150 --> 03:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
glucagon administration
 
03:39:54.950 --> 03:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
under the school health services statute
 
03:39:56.790 --> 03:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
it allows for this
 
03:39:59.110 --> 03:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
for the section heading to match the
 
03:40:01.189 --> 03:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
language used in the rest of the statute
 
03:40:03.670 --> 03:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
and also reflects that glucagon can now
 
03:40:06.229 --> 03:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
be administered intra-nasally rather
 
03:40:08.790 --> 03:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
than just by injection would you say
 
03:40:11.269 --> 03:40:11.279 align:start position:0%
this is like a housekeeping bill
 
03:40:11.279 --> 03:40:13.830 align:start position:0%
this is like a housekeeping bill
oh

03:40:13.830 --> 03:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:19.830 --> 03:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:23.510 --> 03:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:26.389 --> 03:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
yeah um i wouldn't want to needle you
 
03:40:29.429 --> 03:40:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:29.439 --> 03:40:31.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:40:31.830 --> 03:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:40:33.510 --> 03:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
that was pretty sharp huh
 
03:40:33.520 --> 03:40:35.349 align:start position:0%
that was pretty sharp huh
um

03:40:35.349 --> 03:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:37.910 --> 03:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
you're injecting comments quite well
 
03:40:41.990 --> 03:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
here we go i will get back on course um
 
03:40:43.750 --> 03:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
so this will this reflects current
 
03:40:46.950 --> 03:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
medication delivery system available and
 
03:40:49.030 --> 03:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know about you but i run away
 
03:40:51.830 --> 03:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
from syringes and needles so uh it
 
03:40:53.830 --> 03:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
creates more ease and options for school
 
03:40:55.990 --> 03:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
nurses and students alike and i also
 
03:40:57.910 --> 03:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
suspect that it will
 
03:41:01.269 --> 03:41:01.279 align:start position:0%
decrease the um
 
03:41:03.750 --> 03:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
the hesitancy of using glucagon when
 
03:41:05.990 --> 03:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's needed you know we use it all
 
03:41:08.070 --> 03:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
in the hospital or in the er all the
 
03:41:10.150 --> 03:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
time but the fact that it had to be
 
03:41:11.830 --> 03:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
given by
 
03:41:11.840 --> 03:41:13.189 align:start position:0%
given by
injection

03:41:13.189 --> 03:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
injection
 
03:41:14.870 --> 03:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
to children
 
03:41:17.349 --> 03:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
is sort of this kind of speed bump so
 
03:41:18.710 --> 03:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
the idea of being able to do it
 
03:41:21.189 --> 03:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
intranasally is awesome and i think the
 
03:41:22.630 --> 03:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
kids agree
 
03:41:25.269 --> 03:41:25.279 align:start position:0%
so i hope you'll um
 
03:41:26.950 --> 03:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
support it thank you very much happy to
 
03:41:29.429 --> 03:41:29.439 align:start position:0%
take any questions the one question um
 
03:41:31.830 --> 03:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
for the sake of the committee is you are
 
03:41:33.990 --> 03:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
aware that representative merchant
 
03:41:36.790 --> 03:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
submitted an amendment that arguably was
 
03:41:38.550 --> 03:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
non-germane the
 
03:41:40.950 --> 03:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
powers-that-be said well mr chair you
 
03:41:42.550 --> 03:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
make the decision
 
03:41:46.229 --> 03:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
the way you want so i said heck yes and
 
03:41:49.429 --> 03:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
so there's an amendment 1223 and are you
 
03:41:49.439 --> 03:41:50.389 align:start position:0%
so there's an amendment 1223 and are you
um

03:41:50.389 --> 03:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:52.309 --> 03:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that
 
03:41:53.830 --> 03:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know there's troublemakers
 
03:41:55.750 --> 03:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
everywhere um
 
03:41:57.590 --> 03:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm fine with it i thought so yeah
 
03:41:59.349 --> 03:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
it was for them yeah
 
03:42:01.670 --> 03:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
i'll flog him later
 
03:42:03.189 --> 03:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any questions for the
 
03:42:03.199 --> 03:42:05.830 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any questions for the
senator

03:42:05.830 --> 03:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:07.990 --> 03:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
i understand you're quite busy lately
 
03:42:10.309 --> 03:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
yeah i have to go down to transportation
 
03:42:10.319 --> 03:42:11.030 align:start position:0%
yeah i have to go down to transportation
it's

03:42:11.030 --> 03:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:42:12.870 --> 03:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
it's interesting it's a
 
03:42:14.710 --> 03:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
my only experience in that was driving
 
03:42:17.030 --> 03:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
my car so i'm in an ambulance when i was
 
03:42:18.710 --> 03:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
16. but wow
 
03:42:18.720 --> 03:42:19.830 align:start position:0%
16. but wow
um

03:42:19.830 --> 03:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:22.070 --> 03:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
it'll be a new experience anybody with a
 
03:42:24.550 --> 03:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
question for the senator seeing none
 
03:42:26.710 --> 03:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you senator thank you
 
03:42:31.429 --> 03:42:31.439 align:start position:0%

do we have another card for this 289
uh

03:42:35.030 --> 03:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:38.870 --> 03:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
i can lose things standing still
 
03:42:42.950 --> 03:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:42.960 --> 03:42:43.990 align:start position:0%

03:43:44.469 --> 03:43:44.479 align:start position:0%
little blurb to show you
 
03:43:46.229 --> 03:43:46.239 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
03:43:47.990 --> 03:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
my name is brittany o'donnell and i am
 
03:43:49.830 --> 03:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire chapter leader for t1
 
03:43:52.070 --> 03:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
air national a global nonprofit
 
03:43:53.910 --> 03:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
organization working towards affordable
 
03:43:56.150 --> 03:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
and accessible insulin for all today
 
03:43:56.160 --> 03:43:56.870 align:start position:0%
and accessible insulin for all today
though

03:43:56.870 --> 03:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
though
 
03:43:59.030 --> 03:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
i'm here as brittany a type 1 diabetic
 
03:44:01.750 --> 03:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
of 32 years asking your first asking for
 
03:44:04.790 --> 03:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
your support on sb 289
 
03:44:06.950 --> 03:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
i was diagnosed with diabetes at 13
 
03:44:08.790 --> 03:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
months old and at the time one of the
 
03:44:11.269 --> 03:44:11.279 align:start position:0%
youngest to be diagnosed in the seacoast
 
03:44:13.349 --> 03:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
there was no carb counting no precise
 
03:44:15.830 --> 03:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
insulin dosing the diet i was on was not
 
03:44:17.670 --> 03:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
created for children with diabetes it
 
03:44:19.429 --> 03:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
was a weight watchers exchange system
 
03:44:21.670 --> 03:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
that required my mom to puree my food so
 
03:44:23.590 --> 03:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
i could get exactly what i needed
 
03:44:25.830 --> 03:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
nothing more nothing less
 
03:44:27.590 --> 03:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
my insulin actually came from pigs and
 
03:44:28.950 --> 03:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
cows at the time
 
03:44:30.950 --> 03:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
there was no scanning your blood sugar
 
03:44:32.790 --> 03:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
or reading it from your phone or taking
 
03:44:32.800 --> 03:44:33.510 align:start position:0%
or reading it from your phone or taking
it

03:44:33.510 --> 03:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:44:35.189 --> 03:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
and taking it manually could take well
 
03:44:36.870 --> 03:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
over a minute and a half just to get the
 
03:44:36.880 --> 03:44:38.389 align:start position:0%
over a minute and a half just to get the
results

03:44:38.389 --> 03:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
results
 
03:44:39.510 --> 03:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
when i was four years old the
 
03:44:41.189 --> 03:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
kindergarten program i had been in asked
 
03:44:42.790 --> 03:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
my mom to enroll me somewhere else for
 
03:44:45.429 --> 03:44:45.439 align:start position:0%
the summer they didn't have a staff
 
03:44:47.990 --> 03:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
comfortable with dealing with a diabetic
 
03:44:50.150 --> 03:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
when i was 10 and my parents applied to
 
03:44:51.990 --> 03:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
put me into a private school
 
03:44:53.110 --> 03:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
they were told they didn't have a
 
03:44:54.550 --> 03:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
full-time nurse and didn't feel
 
03:44:57.189 --> 03:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
comfortable having that responsibility
 
03:44:58.790 --> 03:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
i was able to attend both of these
 
03:45:00.630 --> 03:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
because of my self-proclaimed helicopter
 
03:45:03.990 --> 03:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
mom who took the time to educate them
 
03:45:06.229 --> 03:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
and to get them to see past the disease
 
03:45:08.630 --> 03:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
and look at the child in front of them
 
03:45:10.309 --> 03:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
from the time i started daycare until
 
03:45:12.309 --> 03:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
the year i finished my high school my
 
03:45:13.910 --> 03:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
mom used to go into each school year
 
03:45:15.670 --> 03:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
requesting a meeting with any teachers i
 
03:45:17.110 --> 03:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
would encounter
 
03:45:19.110 --> 03:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
she would go over my tells of my high
 
03:45:21.349 --> 03:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
end low blood sugars my ability to take
 
03:45:24.150 --> 03:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
care of myself and most importantly how
 
03:45:25.510 --> 03:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
they could take care of me in case i
 
03:45:27.349 --> 03:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
couldn't do it myself
 
03:45:29.189 --> 03:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
for most people the fear of diabetes
 
03:45:31.830 --> 03:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't really come from what to do when
 
03:45:33.750 --> 03:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
i have a high or low blood sugar
 
03:45:35.510 --> 03:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
as long as i'm alert and sitting in
 
03:45:37.429 --> 03:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
front of you you can assume that i'm not
 
03:45:40.550 --> 03:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
in grave danger and that i can walk you
 
03:45:41.830 --> 03:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
through it
 
03:45:43.510 --> 03:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
and even solve it myself most of the
 
03:45:43.520 --> 03:45:44.710 align:start position:0%
and even solve it myself most of the
time

03:45:44.710 --> 03:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:45:46.550 --> 03:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
the fear is the possibility that at some
 
03:45:48.630 --> 03:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
point you may actually be responsible
 
03:45:50.790 --> 03:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
for the decision making most of the time
 
03:45:52.389 --> 03:45:52.399 align:start position:0%
there are instructions on what to do and
 
03:45:53.590 --> 03:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
how to provide care in different
 
03:45:53.600 --> 03:45:54.710 align:start position:0%
how to provide care in different
scenarios

03:45:54.710 --> 03:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
scenarios
 
03:45:56.710 --> 03:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
and heck most of the time now my
 
03:45:59.429 --> 03:45:59.439 align:start position:0%
machines do it for me and you
 
03:46:00.870 --> 03:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
but there's still that chance that we
 
03:46:03.349 --> 03:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
miscalculate or my machinery
 
03:46:05.750 --> 03:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
malfunctions or our bodies just react
 
03:46:07.189 --> 03:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
differently and we end up in that
 
03:46:09.189 --> 03:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
what-if situation where a low blood
 
03:46:10.950 --> 03:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
sugar renders us unconscious and we
 
03:46:12.790 --> 03:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
require glucagon
 
03:46:14.550 --> 03:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
my own simple interpretation of using
 
03:46:17.030 --> 03:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
glucagon is this the medication itself
 
03:46:18.950 --> 03:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
is a hormone taking the medication
 
03:46:20.550 --> 03:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
triggers your liver to break down an
 
03:46:22.950 --> 03:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
emergency storage of glycogen
 
03:46:25.429 --> 03:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
into glucose the shot is given in the
 
03:46:28.710 --> 03:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
muscle usually an arm leg or your butt
 
03:46:30.309 --> 03:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
to trigger your liver's response in the
 
03:46:32.309 --> 03:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
quickest way possible the shot comes
 
03:46:34.309 --> 03:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
drawn up with fluid as well as a vial
 
03:46:36.550 --> 03:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
with a solid glucagon powder
 
03:46:38.309 --> 03:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
to use it you have to inject the fluid
 
03:46:39.990 --> 03:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
into the vial and without removing that
 
03:46:42.309 --> 03:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
syringe gently roll or shake the vial to
 
03:46:43.830 --> 03:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
mix it
 
03:46:45.910 --> 03:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
once mixed you draw back the glucagon
 
03:46:47.750 --> 03:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
into the syringe making sure to get all
 
03:46:50.229 --> 03:46:50.239 align:start position:0%
of it before you inject it at a 90
 
03:46:52.150 --> 03:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
degree angle
 
03:46:54.550 --> 03:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
the final step is to turn the person on
 
03:46:56.070 --> 03:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
their side because there's a good chance
 
03:46:58.469 --> 03:46:58.479 align:start position:0%
that they're going to throw up
 
03:47:00.550 --> 03:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
the reaction is almost instantaneous but
 
03:47:02.630 --> 03:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
it can take up to 15 minutes
 
03:47:05.110 --> 03:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
so giving you all that information
 
03:47:06.389 --> 03:47:06.399 align:start position:0%
how many of you would be comfortable
 
03:47:08.710 --> 03:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
giving me that
 
03:47:10.229 --> 03:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
how many of you are trained in doing
 
03:47:10.239 --> 03:47:12.550 align:start position:0%
how many of you are trained in doing
that

03:47:12.550 --> 03:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:12.560 --> 03:47:13.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:47:13.510 --> 03:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:15.110 --> 03:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
aside from the size of the needle the
 
03:47:17.510 --> 03:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
side effects are difficult after getting
 
03:47:19.349 --> 03:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
insulin after getting glucagon you tend
 
03:47:21.349 --> 03:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
to feel groggy nauseous and generally
 
03:47:23.189 --> 03:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
ill for a few hours
 
03:47:25.510 --> 03:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's not caused by the quick change it's
 
03:47:26.870 --> 03:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
not only caused by the quick change in
 
03:47:28.790 --> 03:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
blood sugar but the lingering effects
 
03:47:31.030 --> 03:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
that the shot has on your body generally
 
03:47:32.950 --> 03:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
it feels like your body is crashing from
 
03:47:34.870 --> 03:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
a literal sugar high
 
03:47:37.590 --> 03:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
in 2019 the fda approved an inhaler
 
03:47:39.670 --> 03:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
glucagon it's used like a nasal spray
 
03:47:41.990 --> 03:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
and only requires three steps removing
 
03:47:43.590 --> 03:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
it from the bottle
 
03:47:46.150 --> 03:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
taking a putting it in the nostril and
 
03:47:48.389 --> 03:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
pushing the plunger for one dose
 
03:47:49.990 --> 03:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
no mixing no shaky hands as you
 
03:47:51.670 --> 03:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
administer a shot to an unresponsive
 
03:47:53.750 --> 03:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
child no worrying if you can remember
 
03:47:55.429 --> 03:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
the training on the spot most
 
03:47:57.030 --> 03:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
importantly it kicks in seven to eight
 
03:48:00.309 --> 03:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
minutes after use in 2015 the european
 
03:48:02.469 --> 03:48:02.479 align:start position:0%
association for the study of diabetes
 
03:48:04.150 --> 03:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
presented the data from a study that
 
03:48:06.150 --> 03:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
tested out both forms of glucagon in
 
03:48:08.229 --> 03:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
high stress situations the study
 
03:48:09.510 --> 03:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
measured how caretakers and
 
03:48:10.950 --> 03:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
acquaintances handled each in a
 
03:48:14.150 --> 03:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
simulated low blood glucose scenario the
 
03:48:15.750 --> 03:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
results found that there was a minute
 
03:48:16.950 --> 03:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
and a half difference between
 
03:48:18.790 --> 03:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
administering the inhaler versus the
 
03:48:21.510 --> 03:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
injection and 94 percent of caregivers
 
03:48:22.950 --> 03:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
gave the full correct dose of the
 
03:48:25.429 --> 03:48:25.439 align:start position:0%
inhaler versus only 13
 
03:48:27.670 --> 03:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
when giving an injection
 
03:48:28.950 --> 03:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
none of this is to say that the
 
03:48:30.710 --> 03:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
injection is ineffective in fact the
 
03:48:32.070 --> 03:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
injection has been around since the
 
03:48:33.990 --> 03:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
1960s and i have witnessed it being
 
03:48:35.670 --> 03:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
given to fellow diabetics and taught
 
03:48:37.349 --> 03:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
many of my friends how to use it on me
 
03:48:39.510 --> 03:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
in the event of an emergency
 
03:48:41.429 --> 03:48:41.439 align:start position:0%
in our house we actually keep both types
 
03:48:43.830 --> 03:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
handy my husband is an emt so he's
 
03:48:46.070 --> 03:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
trained to use both and effectively in
 
03:48:48.630 --> 03:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
an emergency though i have joked that if
 
03:48:50.790 --> 03:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
he ever uses the injection he better be
 
03:48:54.229 --> 03:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
able to run quicker than i can wake up
 
03:48:56.309 --> 03:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
what i am saying is that as a type 1
 
03:48:57.750 --> 03:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
diabetic i would much prefer the
 
03:48:59.429 --> 03:48:59.439 align:start position:0%
alternative one that doesn't count on
 
03:49:01.110 --> 03:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
someone who may be afraid of needles or
 
03:49:02.710 --> 03:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
panic in the undoubtedly stressful
 
03:49:04.950 --> 03:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
situation but rather takes the pressure
 
03:49:06.790 --> 03:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
off by giving them a much simpler way to
 
03:49:08.950 --> 03:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
save my life with the exception of my
 
03:49:10.710 --> 03:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
husband and a college roommate most
 
03:49:12.229 --> 03:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
others i've given the instruction to
 
03:49:13.910 --> 03:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
have said that they would likely opt out
 
03:49:15.429 --> 03:49:15.439 align:start position:0%
of trying to give me the injection at
 
03:49:17.830 --> 03:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
all and just call 9-1-1
 
03:49:19.590 --> 03:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
with an inhaler they just need to know
 
03:49:21.590 --> 03:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
where to find my purse
 
03:49:23.990 --> 03:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
when the law was written in 2015
 
03:49:26.070 --> 03:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
inhalable glucagon did not exist and in
 
03:49:28.229 --> 03:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
fairness only one type had for over 50
 
03:49:28.239 --> 03:49:29.110 align:start position:0%
fairness only one type had for over 50
years

03:49:29.110 --> 03:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:49:30.790 --> 03:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
advancements in the medication have
 
03:49:32.950 --> 03:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
finally changed and in time our language
 
03:49:32.960 --> 03:49:33.670 align:start position:0%
finally changed and in time our language
did

03:49:33.670 --> 03:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
did
 
03:49:35.030 --> 03:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
though i know this not would not have
 
03:49:36.870 --> 03:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
stopped my mom from calling her meetings
 
03:49:38.550 --> 03:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
each year i do know that it would have
 
03:49:40.070 --> 03:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
provided her some relief to know that
 
03:49:41.429 --> 03:49:41.439 align:start position:0%
almost anyone would be capable of
 
03:49:43.830 --> 03:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
providing assistance if it were needed
 
03:49:45.990 --> 03:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
and what an honor it would be to take it
 
03:49:47.590 --> 03:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
that way off of another parent's
 
03:49:49.830 --> 03:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
shoulders i appreciate your time today
 
03:49:51.910 --> 03:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
and your support
 
03:49:53.510 --> 03:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
for reference
 
03:49:57.750 --> 03:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
i did bring the sweet looking needle
 
03:49:59.429 --> 03:49:59.439 align:start position:0%
so you would have to inject it into this
 
03:50:02.389 --> 03:50:02.399 align:start position:0%
vial did you say sweet yes i did
 
03:50:04.389 --> 03:50:04.399 align:start position:0%
unintended thank you thank you very much
 
03:50:05.750 --> 03:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
i've learned you appreciate the good
 
03:50:05.760 --> 03:50:07.189 align:start position:0%
i've learned you appreciate the good
jokes

03:50:07.189 --> 03:50:07.199 align:start position:0%
jokes
 
03:50:09.269 --> 03:50:09.279 align:start position:0%
would you say that again i'm learning
 
03:50:09.279 --> 03:50:10.950 align:start position:0%
would you say that again i'm learning
yeah

03:50:10.950 --> 03:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:50:13.750 --> 03:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
you wanted the room to hear that
 
03:50:16.550 --> 03:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
so this is what the glucagon looks like
 
03:50:18.469 --> 03:50:18.479 align:start position:0%
i'm very fortunate i've never had to use
 
03:50:20.790 --> 03:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
it frequently you'll find it taped to
 
03:50:23.830 --> 03:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
the back of a door in a nurse's office
 
03:50:26.229 --> 03:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
just in case it's needed
 
03:50:28.229 --> 03:50:28.239 align:start position:0%
schools are allowed to train people
 
03:50:29.910 --> 03:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
other than school nurses if they don't
 
03:50:32.630 --> 03:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
have a full-time school nurse
 
03:50:34.469 --> 03:50:34.479 align:start position:0%
to administer this
 
03:50:37.510 --> 03:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
and make it easier the inhaler now
 
03:50:37.520 --> 03:50:38.389 align:start position:0%
and make it easier the inhaler now
um

03:50:38.389 --> 03:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:41.110 --> 03:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
looks like this kind of like a flonase
 
03:50:42.710 --> 03:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
it's pretty foolproof
 
03:50:45.590 --> 03:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
our language in the bill itself is
 
03:50:47.429 --> 03:50:47.439 align:start position:0%
really advanced when you look at states
 
03:50:49.510 --> 03:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
like massachusetts and
 
03:50:51.349 --> 03:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
massachusetts i think doesn't even allow
 
03:50:52.309 --> 03:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
this for
 
03:50:54.790 --> 03:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
people other than school nurses so
 
03:50:56.790 --> 03:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
we are already one step ahead of people
 
03:50:58.630 --> 03:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
we just really need to change the title
 
03:51:00.550 --> 03:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
to be able to include the rest of these
 
03:51:02.790 --> 03:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
items and anything that they might come
 
03:51:04.710 --> 03:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
forward with in the future will you take
 
03:51:07.750 --> 03:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
any questions i'll take any questions
 
03:51:10.229 --> 03:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
all right let's try to limit it uh to
 
03:51:12.550 --> 03:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
medicine and health okay yes
 
03:51:12.560 --> 03:51:15.269 align:start position:0%
medicine and health okay yes
representative

03:51:15.269 --> 03:51:15.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:51:17.429 --> 03:51:17.439 align:start position:0%
so you think this is a really good idea
 
03:51:19.910 --> 03:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
i do when
 
03:51:21.910 --> 03:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
down the line and it's probably a few
 
03:51:23.189 --> 03:51:23.199 align:start position:0%
years out
 
03:51:26.229 --> 03:51:26.239 align:start position:0%
one of the things that the creators of
 
03:51:28.389 --> 03:51:28.399 align:start position:0%
these glucagons these medications are
 
03:51:31.830 --> 03:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
looking to do is use micro dosing
 
03:51:33.910 --> 03:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
in instead of treating low blood sugar
 
03:51:36.229 --> 03:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
with fruit snacks or juice
 
03:51:36.239 --> 03:51:37.429 align:start position:0%
with fruit snacks or juice
and

03:51:37.429 --> 03:51:37.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:51:39.110 --> 03:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
constantly feeding carbohydrates and
 
03:51:40.790 --> 03:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
sugar to diabetics they're looking to
 
03:51:43.110 --> 03:51:43.120 align:start position:0%
find a way to give small doses of
 
03:51:45.590 --> 03:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
glucagon in some way shape or form
 
03:51:47.750 --> 03:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
because without that sugar it's a lot
 
03:51:49.830 --> 03:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
easier on the body and it's a lot easier
 
03:51:51.590 --> 03:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
to predict
 
03:51:53.670 --> 03:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
there's still a ways out but by changing
 
03:51:55.189 --> 03:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
the language of this bill what you're
 
03:51:57.429 --> 03:51:57.439 align:start position:0%
doing is you're allowing that freedom
 
03:51:59.429 --> 03:51:59.439 align:start position:0%
for the things that come down the line
 
03:52:01.030 --> 03:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
so we're not having this conversation
 
03:52:04.870 --> 03:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
over and over okay thank you yes
 
03:52:06.710 --> 03:52:06.720 align:start position:0%

03:52:08.870 --> 03:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i actually used
 
03:52:11.269 --> 03:52:11.279 align:start position:0%
to work in the diabetes device space oh
 
03:52:12.790 --> 03:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
and so that's why i noticed that you're
 
03:52:16.309 --> 03:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
a pumper um my question is um i guess do
 
03:52:18.070 --> 03:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
you know if they're actually moving
 
03:52:20.790 --> 03:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
towards glucagon in the pumps yet um and
 
03:52:22.550 --> 03:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
i believe that we probably need those
 
03:52:24.229 --> 03:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
steps first with that micro dosing
 
03:52:27.189 --> 03:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
that's being used separate from a closed
 
03:52:28.870 --> 03:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
system before we can even get to that
 
03:52:30.150 --> 03:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
point where the device can save the
 
03:52:30.160 --> 03:52:31.349 align:start position:0%
point where the device can save the
person

03:52:31.349 --> 03:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
person
 
03:52:33.349 --> 03:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure
 
03:52:35.030 --> 03:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
there is one company independent of
 
03:52:36.710 --> 03:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
these two that's working on glucagon
 
03:52:38.469 --> 03:52:38.479 align:start position:0%
right now that has a different that's
 
03:52:40.710 --> 03:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
working on microdosing i have friends
 
03:52:43.429 --> 03:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
who micro dose glucagon right now off
 
03:52:45.750 --> 03:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
label very off label
 
03:52:48.550 --> 03:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
with that type of glucagon because it
 
03:52:51.030 --> 03:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
lasts so once you once you utilize a
 
03:52:52.790 --> 03:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
glucagon shot even if you don't
 
03:52:55.030 --> 03:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
administer the whole thing this shot is
 
03:52:57.189 --> 03:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
junk after 24 hours
 
03:52:59.670 --> 03:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
so either you're giving most of the time
 
03:53:00.870 --> 03:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
you're trying to give this person the
 
03:53:03.189 --> 03:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
whole dose but even if you learn how to
 
03:53:04.950 --> 03:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
micro dose with it if you're sick some
 
03:53:06.469 --> 03:53:06.479 align:start position:0%
of the doctors will teach you how to do
 
03:53:06.479 --> 03:53:07.830 align:start position:0%
of the doctors will teach you how to do
it

03:53:07.830 --> 03:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:53:09.910 --> 03:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
you have to toss this after 24 hours
 
03:53:12.150 --> 03:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
they're working on one that will be good
 
03:53:14.790 --> 03:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
for up to three years i believe
 
03:53:16.150 --> 03:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
which would mean that this could sit in
 
03:53:17.750 --> 03:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
the nurse's office for three years you
 
03:53:21.269 --> 03:53:21.279 align:start position:0%
go in you get your shot it stays there
 
03:53:23.590 --> 03:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
the pump they are working
 
03:53:24.790 --> 03:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
they have
 
03:53:26.309 --> 03:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
i can never remember the name of it
 
03:53:28.469 --> 03:53:28.479 align:start position:0%
there is one pump um we call it the
 
03:53:30.710 --> 03:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
bionic pancreas in the community and
 
03:53:33.750 --> 03:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
they are supposedly about a year out
 
03:53:35.750 --> 03:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
um so i think they're working on the
 
03:53:37.429 --> 03:53:37.439 align:start position:0%
micro dosing and that's i think they're
 
03:53:39.750 --> 03:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
working with that other company um it's
 
03:53:39.760 --> 03:53:41.429 align:start position:0%
working with that other company um it's
beta

03:53:41.429 --> 03:53:41.439 align:start position:0%
beta
 
03:53:43.590 --> 03:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
beta i believe um
 
03:53:45.030 --> 03:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
and they are
 
03:53:46.229 --> 03:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
they're trying to work on the micro
 
03:53:47.910 --> 03:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
dosing in the pump so i think that's why
 
03:53:49.910 --> 03:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
you haven't seen it come out that way on
 
03:53:53.189 --> 03:53:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:53.199 --> 03:53:55.750 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:53:55.750 --> 03:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:58.070 --> 03:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
03:54:00.150 --> 03:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you all i will is there someone
 
03:54:01.750 --> 03:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
you'd like me to give it to i only made
 
03:54:03.910 --> 03:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
10 copies i didn't expect such a turnout
 
03:54:05.189 --> 03:54:05.199 align:start position:0%
for my
 
03:54:07.510 --> 03:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
for my speech but well we heard
 
03:54:09.429 --> 03:54:09.439 align:start position:0%
well we heard you were coming i know
 
03:54:11.269 --> 03:54:11.279 align:start position:0%
look at that i'll i will leave these
 
03:54:13.189 --> 03:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
here but these are just copies of what i
 
03:54:14.710 --> 03:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
read okay
 
03:54:17.349 --> 03:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and i'm willing to
 
03:54:19.349 --> 03:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
bet that our wonderful
 
03:54:21.189 --> 03:54:21.199 align:start position:0%
friend from the fourth floor is going to
 
03:54:24.710 --> 03:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
turn 10 into 21.
 
03:54:30.550 --> 03:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:35.830 --> 03:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:43.670 --> 03:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:47.349 --> 03:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
is your mic on
 
03:54:50.070 --> 03:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
i didn't expect to speak mr chairman but
 
03:54:52.630 --> 03:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
i couldn't go let the time go by without
 
03:54:54.950 --> 03:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
thanking the committee mr chairman and
 
03:54:56.550 --> 03:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
members for taking
 
03:54:57.750 --> 03:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
03:55:00.550 --> 03:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh and considering it uh at this level
 
03:55:03.030 --> 03:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
instead of having to go be uh before the
 
03:55:03.040 --> 03:55:03.910 align:start position:0%
instead of having to go be uh before the
house

03:55:03.910 --> 03:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
house
 
03:55:05.910 --> 03:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
without the amendment so i just want to
 
03:55:07.830 --> 03:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank the chairman the members of the
 
03:55:10.389 --> 03:55:10.399 align:start position:0%
board and uh representative merchant for
 
03:55:13.269 --> 03:55:13.279 align:start position:0%
uh submitting the uh amendment and i
 
03:55:15.349 --> 03:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
support the amendment of course as did
 
03:55:16.950 --> 03:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
the senator
 
03:55:16.960 --> 03:55:17.910 align:start position:0%
the senator
and

03:55:17.910 --> 03:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:55:19.670 --> 03:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to try to say anything
 
03:55:21.429 --> 03:55:21.439 align:start position:0%
after the previous speaker i'm
 
03:55:21.439 --> 03:55:23.110 align:start position:0%
after the previous speaker i'm
overwhelmed

03:55:23.110 --> 03:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed
 
03:55:25.269 --> 03:55:25.279 align:start position:0%
but it's pretty clear that
 
03:55:27.590 --> 03:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's a very simple amendment and thank
 
03:55:30.790 --> 03:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
you for taking it at uh at this level
 
03:55:33.510 --> 03:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so much representative canark
 
03:55:35.590 --> 03:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh this
 
03:55:37.269 --> 03:55:37.279 align:start position:0%
i only just caught this i would have
 
03:55:39.670 --> 03:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
asked uh senator sherman would you
 
03:55:42.309 --> 03:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
believe unfortunately that there is an
 
03:55:44.950 --> 03:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
error in the numbering in the bill if
 
03:55:46.309 --> 03:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
you look at line
 
03:55:49.030 --> 03:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
two it gives the new heading 200 colon
 
03:55:49.040 --> 03:55:50.950 align:start position:0%
two it gives the new heading 200 colon
40-b

03:55:50.950 --> 03:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
40-b
 
03:55:54.870 --> 03:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
but line 1 says amend the section rsa 22
 
03:55:58.469 --> 03:55:58.479 align:start position:0%
colon 40b that also should be 200.
 
03:56:00.070 --> 03:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
would you believe that that i remember
 
03:56:01.189 --> 03:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
you were a master of the would you
 
03:56:02.870 --> 03:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
believe questions that's in your honor
 
03:56:05.189 --> 03:56:05.199 align:start position:0%
that i ask it as a point of information
 
03:56:07.429 --> 03:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
instead i believe you would have you
 
03:56:08.830 --> 03:56:08.840 align:start position:0%
would have a question
 
03:56:11.189 --> 03:56:11.199 align:start position:0%
yes i'm having i i served on this
 
03:56:13.110 --> 03:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
committee for a number of years
 
03:56:15.030 --> 03:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
but uh that kept you awake all the time
 
03:56:16.550 --> 03:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's in the main bill that's not in
 
03:56:18.630 --> 03:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
this oh i'm sorry yeah well
 
03:56:20.229 --> 03:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
we haven't introduced the amendment yes
 
03:56:21.670 --> 03:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
i didn't think we were doing the segue
 
03:56:23.750 --> 03:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
so this was the main bill but i do
 
03:56:25.590 --> 03:56:25.600 align:start position:0%
believe that's a that's probably just a
 
03:56:26.630 --> 03:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
scrivener's error that could be
 
03:56:29.110 --> 03:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
corrected in enrollment i presume but it
 
03:56:30.950 --> 03:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
is not correct uh
 
03:56:33.030 --> 03:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
question of the chair for representative
 
03:56:34.229 --> 03:56:34.239 align:start position:0%
weber are you
 
03:56:37.349 --> 03:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
aware if they are simply making these
 
03:56:39.349 --> 03:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
changes along the way in process like
 
03:56:41.429 --> 03:56:41.439 align:start position:0%
they used to
 
03:56:43.590 --> 03:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
i have no knowledge okay
 
03:56:45.510 --> 03:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
because um
 
03:56:48.309 --> 03:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
but if if we know that it's a problem we
 
03:56:50.870 --> 03:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
ought to fix it right it's a lot easier
 
03:56:52.950 --> 03:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
than finding out that they can't do it
 
03:56:55.510 --> 03:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
with an enrolled bill amendment
 
03:56:57.510 --> 03:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
which means we really can't execute this
 
03:56:59.670 --> 03:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
bill today it sounds like apparently so
 
03:56:59.680 --> 03:57:03.910 align:start position:0%
bill today it sounds like apparently so
well

03:57:03.910 --> 03:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:03.920 --> 03:57:05.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:57:05.269 --> 03:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:57:07.510 --> 03:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative merchant can we someone

request to ols to make the change and
 
03:57:13.670 --> 03:57:13.680 align:start position:0%

03:57:52.229 --> 03:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:57:54.309 --> 03:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
the chair was given the option of how to
 
03:57:57.349 --> 03:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
rule and the chair ruled it as
 
03:57:59.349 --> 03:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
germaine but we are being a bit
 
03:58:01.670 --> 03:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
fastidious in the process just to make
 
03:58:01.680 --> 03:58:03.990 align:start position:0%

record my name is
 
04:00:37.269 --> 04:00:37.279 align:start position:0%
gary merchant representing sullivan
 
04:00:38.950 --> 04:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
county district 4 which is ward 2 in
 
04:00:40.870 --> 04:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
claremont new hampshire
 
04:00:42.870 --> 04:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
this is a tale of two ships that
 
04:00:44.070 --> 04:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
passed each other in the middle of the
 
04:00:44.080 --> 04:00:45.590 align:start position:0%
passed each other in the middle of the
night

04:00:45.590 --> 04:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
night
 
04:00:48.389 --> 04:00:48.399 align:start position:0%
what happened was we passed house bill
 
04:00:52.070 --> 04:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
143 came out of our committee 1902
 
04:00:53.269 --> 04:00:53.279 align:start position:0%
went through the house went through the
 
04:00:53.279 --> 04:00:54.389 align:start position:0%
went through the house went through the
senate

04:00:54.389 --> 04:00:54.399 align:start position:0%
senate
 
04:00:55.990 --> 04:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
everything was fine
 
04:00:57.750 --> 04:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2
 
04:00:59.910 --> 04:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
what they did was they took the
 
04:01:01.670 --> 04:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
prescription drug monitoring program
 
04:01:04.630 --> 04:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
which was anchored in 318 b
 
04:01:07.030 --> 04:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
and picked it up literally lock stock
 
04:01:09.269 --> 04:01:09.279 align:start position:0%
and barrel and moved it to
 
04:01:11.670 --> 04:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
rsa 129a which is under the department
 
04:01:13.590 --> 04:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
04:01:16.150 --> 04:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
so when this ship got to the dock which
 
04:01:19.990 --> 04:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
was 3 18 b there was no longer any 318b
 
04:01:23.110 --> 04:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
under oplc because it had been moved
 
04:01:26.150 --> 04:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
so when i talked to ols they said
 
04:01:29.349 --> 04:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
in the old days we could fix this
 
04:01:32.070 --> 04:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
but now it requires a legislative fix
 
04:01:34.550 --> 04:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
and i was talking at the meeting with
 
04:01:36.630 --> 04:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
president guthrie at the board meeting
 
04:01:38.070 --> 04:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
it was brought to our attention that
 
04:01:39.429 --> 04:01:39.439 align:start position:0%
this was an issue
 
04:01:41.189 --> 04:01:41.199 align:start position:0%
so i'm bringing before our committee to
 
04:01:41.199 --> 04:01:42.550 align:start position:0%
so i'm bringing before our committee to
make

04:01:42.550 --> 04:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
make
 
04:01:43.830 --> 04:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
a simple
 
04:01:43.840 --> 04:01:45.429 align:start position:0%
a simple
housekeeping

04:01:45.429 --> 04:01:45.439 align:start position:0%
housekeeping
 
04:01:45.439 --> 04:01:46.469 align:start position:0%
housekeeping
change

04:01:46.469 --> 04:01:46.479 align:start position:0%
change
 
04:01:49.189 --> 04:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
um use that word dangerously but that's
 
04:01:51.110 --> 04:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
what this bill fundamentally does is
 
04:01:53.990 --> 04:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
allow it to be attached to 129a in its
 
04:01:55.510 --> 04:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate place which is where it
 
04:01:59.189 --> 04:01:59.199 align:start position:0%
should have been if it's still in 318.
 
04:02:03.189 --> 04:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:05.030 --> 04:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
and i believe representative leon you
 
04:02:07.510 --> 04:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
have sent over a quest for an amendment
 
04:02:07.520 --> 04:02:09.110 align:start position:0%
have sent over a quest for an amendment
well

04:02:09.110 --> 04:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:02:10.710 --> 04:02:10.720 align:start position:0%

chairman
 
04:02:11.680 --> 04:02:12.469 align:start position:0%
chairman
the

04:02:12.469 --> 04:02:12.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:02:14.550 --> 04:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
clerk has said it's that
 
04:02:17.349 --> 04:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
the change for the bill itself can be
 
04:02:18.950 --> 04:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
done with an enrolled bill amendment if
 
04:02:20.389 --> 04:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
we don't have any other changes to the
 
04:02:25.110 --> 04:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:27.189 --> 04:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
i i have the language the question is
 
04:02:29.750 --> 04:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
should we use your amendment and just
 
04:02:32.389 --> 04:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
change that language in section one
 
04:02:33.910 --> 04:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
so that there's one amendment to the
 
04:02:33.920 --> 04:02:34.950 align:start position:0%
so that there's one amendment to the
bill

04:02:34.950 --> 04:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:02:36.630 --> 04:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
that would be fine i'd be more than glad
 
04:02:38.630 --> 04:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
to send it back to ols
 
04:02:40.070 --> 04:02:40.080 align:start position:0%

04:02:42.229 --> 04:02:42.239 align:start position:0%

04:04:11.990 --> 04:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:18.710 --> 04:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:21.590 --> 04:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm counting on
 
04:04:23.110 --> 04:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
i did and representative merchant is
 
04:04:24.630 --> 04:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
walking over there
 
04:04:28.950 --> 04:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:30.950 --> 04:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
let's see that's why i waited to hit
 
04:04:33.349 --> 04:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
send to see if that would be a minimal
 
04:04:36.070 --> 04:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
stretch the
 
04:04:39.030 --> 04:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
music from jeopardy to 11 minutes and 30
 
04:04:39.040 --> 04:04:42.150 align:start position:0%
music from jeopardy to 11 minutes and 30
seconds

04:04:42.150 --> 04:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:43.750 --> 04:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we can't move ahead
 
04:04:45.429 --> 04:04:45.439 align:start position:0%
because the next one's been calendared
 
04:04:47.269 --> 04:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
for 145.
 
04:04:49.590 --> 04:04:49.600 align:start position:0%

04:04:54.790 --> 04:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
have a great idea
 
04:04:57.510 --> 04:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
we could go back
 
04:05:09.510 --> 04:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:12.389 --> 04:05:12.399 align:start position:0%

04:05:14.630 --> 04:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
meet next monday i walked over to the
 
04:05:17.269 --> 04:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
clerk's office that had already been a
 
04:05:20.309 --> 04:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
supplement to the house calendar he's
 
04:05:22.550 --> 04:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
not prepared to do another one so the
 
04:05:24.550 --> 04:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
answer very quickly is no we will not
 
04:05:27.349 --> 04:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
meet next monday we will meet on tuesday
 
04:05:31.510 --> 04:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
tuesday morning will be taken up with
 
04:05:33.510 --> 04:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
early bills from the senate some of
 
04:05:36.389 --> 04:05:36.399 align:start position:0%
which are rather involved and
 
04:05:38.389 --> 04:05:38.399 align:start position:0%
maybe controversial
 
04:05:40.870 --> 04:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
so whatever we have time left for we'll
 
04:05:43.110 --> 04:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
go through the rest of the calendar
 
04:05:45.030 --> 04:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
and we'll take it from there if we have
 
04:05:47.110 --> 04:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
to do it on to another monday we'll have
 
04:05:49.670 --> 04:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
time yes is there any possibility that
 
04:05:52.870 --> 04:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
we could ask for time on the wednesday
 
04:05:55.670 --> 04:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
or the thursday which would not run us
 
04:05:59.990 --> 04:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:01.670 --> 04:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
i think different people have asked me
 
04:06:03.990 --> 04:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
about schedule and i think there may be
 
04:06:07.269 --> 04:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
a bit of a problem okay but um there it
 
04:06:07.279 --> 04:06:07.990 align:start position:0%
a bit of a problem okay but um there it
is

04:06:07.990 --> 04:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:06:09.590 --> 04:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
so if you uh
 
04:06:09.600 --> 04:06:10.309 align:start position:0%
so if you uh
the

04:06:10.309 --> 04:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:06:12.870 --> 04:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
christina daya has given me wonderful
 
04:06:14.550 --> 04:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
things that i wasn't going to give to
 
04:06:16.790 --> 04:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
you until the end because otherwise you
 
04:06:18.550 --> 04:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be paying attention to me you'd
 
04:06:19.910 --> 04:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
just be reading all these wonderful
 
04:06:21.590 --> 04:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
things but let me tell you what these
 
04:06:23.750 --> 04:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
wonderful things are and we can actually
 
04:06:25.429 --> 04:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
talk about them
 
04:06:27.110 --> 04:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
so i think i found
 
04:06:29.750 --> 04:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
the uh 11 minutes gap in the tape has
 
04:06:32.229 --> 04:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
been solved
 
04:06:34.950 --> 04:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh each person should get one if there's
 
04:06:38.070 --> 04:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
a seat empty like a representative gay
 
04:06:38.080 --> 04:06:39.030 align:start position:0%
a seat empty like a representative gay
um

04:06:39.030 --> 04:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:42.070 --> 04:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
plop one there
 
04:06:44.469 --> 04:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
this is all the same photo
 
04:06:46.710 --> 04:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
wait a minute
 
04:06:49.030 --> 04:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
thirteen you need to have
 
04:06:53.269 --> 04:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
oh i see what i did you need to have 503
 
04:06:58.950 --> 04:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:19.670 --> 04:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:21.670 --> 04:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
then there's another one coming around
 
04:07:23.670 --> 04:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
well i'm going to hold on to that one
 
04:07:23.680 --> 04:07:24.630 align:start position:0%
well i'm going to hold on to that one
okay

04:07:24.630 --> 04:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:07:28.070 --> 04:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
these are bills that have come over
 
04:07:31.990 --> 04:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
from the senate when the senate amended
 
04:07:34.389 --> 04:07:34.399 align:start position:0%
a house bill
 
04:07:58.469 --> 04:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:00.990 --> 04:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
you should have two single
 
04:08:08.550 --> 04:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:11.110 --> 04:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
does anybody over there have the extra
 
04:08:11.120 --> 04:08:26.630 align:start position:0%
does anybody over there have the extra
381s

04:08:26.630 --> 04:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:34.710 --> 04:08:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:37.189 --> 04:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
when a bill comes back like this where
 
04:08:40.550 --> 04:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
the senate amended a house bill
 
04:08:40.560 --> 04:08:41.670 align:start position:0%
the senate amended a house bill
um

04:08:41.670 --> 04:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:43.590 --> 04:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
we have three choices
 
04:08:47.429 --> 04:08:47.439 align:start position:0%
one is we can exceed to what the senate
 
04:08:51.349 --> 04:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
amended and say that's fine with us
 
04:08:54.309 --> 04:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
or we can say no way
 
04:08:55.990 --> 04:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
we're not going to
 
04:08:58.229 --> 04:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
and that kills the bill
 
04:09:02.149 --> 04:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
or we can say well we disagree but could
 
04:09:04.469 --> 04:09:04.479 align:start position:0%
we have a committee of conference
 
04:09:06.309 --> 04:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
and then some people are appointed to
 
04:09:08.550 --> 04:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
the committee of conference and it gets
 
04:09:10.229 --> 04:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
hashed out
 
04:09:12.830 --> 04:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
so i'd like you please to look at
 
04:09:15.510 --> 04:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
381 just
 
04:09:18.229 --> 04:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
this is a side by side on the left you
 
04:09:20.790 --> 04:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
see the house version
 
04:09:28.469 --> 04:09:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:30.710 --> 04:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
you will see that they're the same
 
04:09:32.630 --> 04:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
but if you turn over
 
04:09:35.189 --> 04:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
you will see in the middle
 
04:09:36.790 --> 04:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
down quite a ways
 
04:09:40.950 --> 04:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
the senate added one section
 
04:09:43.750 --> 04:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
a person under the care and custody of a
 
04:09:45.349 --> 04:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire county jail or department
 
04:09:47.189 --> 04:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
of corrections facilities shall be
 
04:09:49.830 --> 04:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
excluded from the provisions of this
 
04:09:49.840 --> 04:09:51.429 align:start position:0%
excluded from the provisions of this
section

04:09:51.429 --> 04:09:51.439 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:09:53.670 --> 04:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
that's the only addition they made and
 
04:09:55.750 --> 04:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
the chair would like to know what your
 
04:09:58.070 --> 04:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
sense is do you like the senate change
 
04:10:00.070 --> 04:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
do you dislike senator representative
 
04:10:01.910 --> 04:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
kenner actually there is one other one
 
04:10:03.510 --> 04:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
that isn't highlighted the very last one
 
04:10:04.710 --> 04:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
the effective date has changed but
 
04:10:08.229 --> 04:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
that's trivial yes that is true
 
04:10:11.110 --> 04:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
representative netarafam
 
04:10:11.120 --> 04:10:13.030 align:start position:0%
representative netarafam
yeah

04:10:13.030 --> 04:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:10:15.349 --> 04:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
cost us a lot of money so
 
04:10:19.429 --> 04:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
why would they prevent someone
 
04:10:21.030 --> 04:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
in prison from
 
04:10:24.229 --> 04:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
accessing some kinds of tests
 
04:10:26.309 --> 04:10:26.319 align:start position:0%
i don't know i i would
 
04:10:26.319 --> 04:10:27.429 align:start position:0%
i don't know i i would
representative

04:10:27.429 --> 04:10:27.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:10:30.070 --> 04:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
i think what this has to do is
 
04:10:31.269 --> 04:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
people in the
 
04:10:32.309 --> 04:10:32.319 align:start position:0%
department of corrections they're
 
04:10:34.630 --> 04:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
responsible for their medical care they
 
04:10:36.950 --> 04:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
can't just go out to a you know the
 
04:10:39.670 --> 04:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
corner somewhere and get medical care
 
04:10:41.349 --> 04:10:41.359 align:start position:0%
and so i think the point is they need to
 
04:10:43.269 --> 04:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
keep control you know how would they be
 
04:10:44.950 --> 04:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
doing various testing and ordering
 
04:10:47.990 --> 04:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
things up and getting uh blood drawn to
 
04:10:49.830 --> 04:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
get sent there they don't usually like
 
04:10:51.750 --> 04:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
extra needles over there i don't think
 
04:10:53.750 --> 04:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
so i think that's probably what it is
 
04:10:56.389 --> 04:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
04:10:59.590 --> 04:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
waving oh i say representative weber
 
04:11:01.670 --> 04:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
and remember this is not preventing
 
04:11:03.510 --> 04:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
people from getting lab testing it's
 
04:11:03.520 --> 04:11:04.309 align:start position:0%
people from getting lab testing it's
just

04:11:04.309 --> 04:11:04.319 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:11:06.229 --> 04:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
this is the one that's without a medical
 
04:11:08.550 --> 04:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
practitioner's order and it's
 
04:11:11.030 --> 04:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
people who are going to be private pay
 
04:11:11.040 --> 04:11:12.870 align:start position:0%
people who are going to be private pay
uh

04:11:12.870 --> 04:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:11:15.830 --> 04:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
i i'll say for myself mr chairman not
 
04:11:18.790 --> 04:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
anybody else that i i was against the
 
04:11:20.389 --> 04:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
bill when it started and i'm still
 
04:11:22.229 --> 04:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
against it but i don't think the change
 
04:11:23.910 --> 04:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
is anything
 
04:11:23.920 --> 04:11:26.309 align:start position:0%
is anything
that

04:11:26.309 --> 04:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:29.269 --> 04:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
makes a huge amount of difference
 
04:11:31.429 --> 04:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
so i need a sense of the committee i
 
04:11:33.670 --> 04:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a vote is it
 
04:11:35.990 --> 04:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's a recommendation to the chair
 
04:11:37.830 --> 04:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
that would be a matter for whatever
 
04:11:40.550 --> 04:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
policy the current speaker has set when
 
04:11:41.590 --> 04:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
it was
 
04:11:44.149 --> 04:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
speaker norelli or speaker shirtless the
 
04:11:46.469 --> 04:11:46.479 align:start position:0%
committee had to actually take a vote
 
04:11:49.269 --> 04:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
under the president speaker um he said
 
04:11:50.950 --> 04:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
mark do what you want with them so what
 
04:11:53.429 --> 04:11:53.439 align:start position:0%
i want to do is get advice from my
 
04:11:55.750 --> 04:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
distinguished colleagues representative
 
04:11:55.760 --> 04:11:56.950 align:start position:0%
distinguished colleagues representative
kanark

04:11:56.950 --> 04:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
kanark
 
04:11:59.110 --> 04:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
i would repeat precisely what
 
04:12:00.950 --> 04:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative weber said i was against
 
04:12:02.389 --> 04:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
this bill when it first came out i'm
 
04:12:04.630 --> 04:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
still against this bill but this is not
 
04:12:06.389 --> 04:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
the deal breaker this doesn't change my
 
04:12:08.070 --> 04:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
thought on the bill at all so i'm
 
04:12:10.070 --> 04:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
comfortable with this change
 
04:12:10.080 --> 04:12:10.950 align:start position:0%
comfortable with this change
uh

04:12:10.950 --> 04:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:12:16.469 --> 04:12:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:18.710 --> 04:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative nuterapam i know i'm
 
04:12:22.630 --> 04:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
chatty today i have made use of tests
 
04:12:24.389 --> 04:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
that were not prescribed by my
 
04:12:27.429 --> 04:12:27.439 align:start position:0%
prescriber um to get more clarification
 
04:12:28.790 --> 04:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm
 
04:12:31.910 --> 04:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know a responsible adult mostly and
 
04:12:31.920 --> 04:12:33.349 align:start position:0%
you know a responsible adult mostly and
um

04:12:33.349 --> 04:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:35.349 --> 04:12:35.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm in i'm in favor of this bill and
 
04:12:36.950 --> 04:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
although i feel a little bad that if
 
04:12:39.110 --> 04:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
somebody in prison was worried that they
 
04:12:40.389 --> 04:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
had something and they were being
 
04:12:42.229 --> 04:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
ignored by their
 
04:12:44.469 --> 04:12:44.479 align:start position:0%
providers that they would be excluded
 
04:12:45.349 --> 04:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
from this
 
04:12:49.429 --> 04:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
but i will vote in favor of the change
 
04:12:51.590 --> 04:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
this is really a sense of the meeting to
 
04:12:53.750 --> 04:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
give me a guidance it's not a vote
 
04:12:55.590 --> 04:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
04:12:58.309 --> 04:12:58.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i do think that
 
04:13:00.870 --> 04:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
i have also done sort of the labs
 
04:13:02.630 --> 04:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
without prescription but they actually
 
04:13:04.790 --> 04:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
ended up contracting with somebody to do
 
04:13:06.950 --> 04:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
it it required me to go to that facility
 
04:13:08.630 --> 04:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure how somebody who's
 
04:13:10.389 --> 04:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
incarcerated would be able to go to a
 
04:13:12.710 --> 04:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
private facility to do that so i think
 
04:13:14.149 --> 04:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
that they're probably i know with some
 
04:13:15.590 --> 04:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
of the other bills they had talked to us
 
04:13:17.189 --> 04:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
about excluding people in the prison
 
04:13:19.590 --> 04:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
system that are incarcerated because
 
04:13:21.750 --> 04:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise they might take it as a reason
 
04:13:23.429 --> 04:13:23.439 align:start position:0%
that they can push in order to get out
 
04:13:25.110 --> 04:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
when they otherwise aren't allowed out
 
04:13:26.710 --> 04:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
so while i do want to provide that that
 
04:13:28.630 --> 04:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
flexibility to them i understand why
 
04:13:30.149 --> 04:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
it's added and i don't see a problem
 
04:13:32.070 --> 04:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
with it personally the clerk of the
 
04:13:33.349 --> 04:13:33.359 align:start position:0%
house has just
 
04:13:35.990 --> 04:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
texted me saying no vote is needed
 
04:13:38.870 --> 04:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
it is recommendation so
 
04:13:41.590 --> 04:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
just ask how many of you just show of
 
04:13:41.600 --> 04:13:42.630 align:start position:0%
just ask how many of you just show of
hands

04:13:42.630 --> 04:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
hands
 
04:13:44.950 --> 04:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
would be in favor of exceeding to the
 
04:13:44.960 --> 04:13:46.070 align:start position:0%
would be in favor of exceeding to the
senate

04:13:46.070 --> 04:13:46.080 align:start position:0%

04:13:46.080 --> 04:13:47.349 align:start position:0%

version
 
04:13:49.910 --> 04:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
and how many of you not
 
04:13:56.550 --> 04:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:58.469 --> 04:13:58.479 align:start position:0%
alrighty we'll do the other one later if
 
04:14:06.790 --> 04:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:09.750 --> 04:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
open the hearing on senate bill

fn

04:14:12.630 --> 04:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
fn
 
04:14:15.189 --> 04:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
establishing a supplemental nutrition
 
04:14:17.349 --> 04:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
assistance program this ought to be a
 
04:14:17.359 --> 04:14:25.189 align:start position:0%
assistance program this ought to be a
snap

04:14:25.189 --> 04:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:27.750 --> 04:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
i appreciate andy and all puns
 
04:14:30.710 --> 04:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chair and uh good
 
04:14:32.309 --> 04:14:32.319 align:start position:0%
afternoon members of the committee for
 
04:14:34.070 --> 04:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
the record my name is becky whitley and
 
04:14:35.670 --> 04:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
i am honored to serve new hampshire
 
04:14:37.830 --> 04:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
senate district 15 including the
 
04:14:39.269 --> 04:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
wonderful communities of concord
 
04:14:41.670 --> 04:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
henniker hopkinton and warner
 
04:14:43.910 --> 04:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm honored today to bring for senate
 
04:14:46.790 --> 04:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
bill 404 establishing an outreach
 
04:14:48.630 --> 04:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
program in the snap
 
04:14:50.550 --> 04:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
existing stack program snap program in
 
04:14:51.990 --> 04:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:14:54.070 --> 04:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm sure folks on this committee are
 
04:14:56.070 --> 04:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
well aware that food insecurity is still
 
04:14:58.070 --> 04:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
an issue that we struggle with in new
 
04:15:01.110 --> 04:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire and unfortunately it has only
 
04:15:04.389 --> 04:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
worsened since the pandemic
 
04:15:07.030 --> 04:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
we know that our low wage earners have
 
04:15:08.950 --> 04:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
been particularly impacted by food
 
04:15:10.790 --> 04:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
insecurity because of things like
 
04:15:13.110 --> 04:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
stagnant income growth and of course our
 
04:15:15.189 --> 04:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
high costs of living in the granite
 
04:15:15.199 --> 04:15:16.229 align:start position:0%
high costs of living in the granite
state

04:15:16.229 --> 04:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:15:17.910 --> 04:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
but thankfully the federal government
 
04:15:19.750 --> 04:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
provides support to address
 
04:15:21.670 --> 04:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
food insecurity through the snap program
 
04:15:23.670 --> 04:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
the supplemental nutrition assistance
 
04:15:23.680 --> 04:15:24.710 align:start position:0%
the supplemental nutrition assistance
program

04:15:24.710 --> 04:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:15:24.720 --> 04:15:25.590 align:start position:0%
program
and

04:15:25.590 --> 04:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:15:27.189 --> 04:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
folks are probably well aware of what
 
04:15:28.870 --> 04:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
that program does
 
04:15:31.030 --> 04:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
but it provides essential nutritional
 
04:15:32.550 --> 04:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
aid to individuals and families
 
04:15:34.149 --> 04:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
throughout new hampshire
 
04:15:35.910 --> 04:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
these benefits it's important to know
 
04:15:38.229 --> 04:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
are federally funded and dispersed to
 
04:15:40.229 --> 04:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
eligible new hampshire residents who may
 
04:15:43.110 --> 04:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
be experiencing food insecurity
 
04:15:45.590 --> 04:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
so despite what we know is an ongoing
 
04:15:47.030 --> 04:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
need for
 
04:15:48.790 --> 04:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
nutritional assistance
 
04:15:50.389 --> 04:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
there was a report issued by the new
 
04:15:52.950 --> 04:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire fiscal policy institute on
 
04:15:52.960 --> 04:15:53.990 align:start position:0%
hampshire fiscal policy institute on
july

04:15:53.990 --> 04:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
july
 
04:15:56.070 --> 04:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
15 2021
 
04:15:58.149 --> 04:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
and that report showed
 
04:16:01.189 --> 04:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
that there are more individuals
 
04:16:03.429 --> 04:16:03.439 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
04:16:05.349 --> 04:16:05.359 align:start position:0%
there are more eligible individuals in
 
04:16:07.590 --> 04:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire than are enrolled
 
04:16:09.910 --> 04:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
in snap meaning we have people a lot of
 
04:16:11.349 --> 04:16:11.359 align:start position:0%
people in new hampshire that are
 
04:16:15.590 --> 04:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
eligible and are not enrolled in snap
 
04:16:17.510 --> 04:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
and i say that because i that there are
 
04:16:20.229 --> 04:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
some trickle effects uh from that
 
04:16:24.550 --> 04:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
so there are estimates that up to 17 000
 
04:16:27.349 --> 04:16:27.359 align:start position:0%
children in particular are eligible for
 
04:16:29.830 --> 04:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
snap and not getting it that means we
 
04:16:32.790 --> 04:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
have children who are food insecure
 
04:16:35.830 --> 04:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
who are not getting this aid
 
04:16:38.149 --> 04:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
now to me that's a problem that's really
 
04:16:41.349 --> 04:16:41.359 align:start position:0%
screaming for a solution
 
04:16:43.750 --> 04:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
so not only are 17 000 children not
 
04:16:45.189 --> 04:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
getting the aid that they're eligible
 
04:16:45.199 --> 04:16:46.070 align:start position:0%
getting the aid that they're eligible
for

04:16:46.070 --> 04:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:16:48.710 --> 04:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of adults aren't
 
04:16:48.720 --> 04:16:49.830 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of adults aren't
either

04:16:49.830 --> 04:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
either
 
04:16:52.550 --> 04:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
so this same analysis from the fiscal
 
04:16:54.630 --> 04:16:54.640 align:start position:0%
policy institute which i'm happy to send
 
04:16:57.510 --> 04:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
to the committee detailed that if these
 
04:17:00.309 --> 04:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
17 000 children
 
04:17:03.429 --> 04:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
had been enrolled in snap in 2019
 
04:17:04.870 --> 04:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
and each child was in a separate
 
04:17:06.389 --> 04:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
household that received the average
 
04:17:08.309 --> 04:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
benefit amount during that year
 
04:17:09.870 --> 04:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
then additional
 
04:17:13.110 --> 04:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
37.9 million dollars and federally
 
04:17:14.870 --> 04:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
funded aid would have flowed to new
 
04:17:17.830 --> 04:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire to support those families and
 
04:17:20.309 --> 04:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
to support our economy
 
04:17:22.469 --> 04:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
so this estimated underenrollment may
 
04:17:24.950 --> 04:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
not only may have resulted in folks not
 
04:17:27.429 --> 04:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
getting this important nutritional aid
 
04:17:30.070 --> 04:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
but of course that this was less money
 
04:17:31.990 --> 04:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
an economic stimulus that was flowing
 
04:17:34.149 --> 04:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
into our state during the pandemic and
 
04:17:35.990 --> 04:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
to our local economies to our local
 
04:17:37.990 --> 04:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
grocery stores
 
04:17:39.670 --> 04:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
in this analysis the fiscal policy
 
04:17:41.670 --> 04:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
institute detailed that levels of
 
04:17:41.680 --> 04:17:43.189 align:start position:0%
institute detailed that levels of
underenrollment

04:17:43.189 --> 04:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
underenrollment
 
04:17:45.110 --> 04:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
in nutritional aid
 
04:17:47.110 --> 04:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
of course continued through the pandemic
 
04:17:48.790 --> 04:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
of you know we do we know that those
 
04:17:50.710 --> 04:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
numbers didn't get better during the
 
04:17:52.710 --> 04:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
pandemic right
 
04:17:54.550 --> 04:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
data collected by the u.s census bureau
 
04:17:56.309 --> 04:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
showed that significant portions of new
 
04:17:58.309 --> 04:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire population face declining or
 
04:18:00.229 --> 04:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
lost incomes and challenges affording
 
04:18:01.830 --> 04:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
expenses in food
 
04:18:03.110 --> 04:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
even while enrollment during the
 
04:18:05.349 --> 04:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
pandemic declined
 
04:18:08.070 --> 04:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
again this is a problem crying out for a
 
04:18:10.149 --> 04:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
policy solution
 
04:18:11.590 --> 04:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
so thankfully the federal government
 
04:18:13.670 --> 04:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
does give the state flexibility to
 
04:18:16.309 --> 04:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
expand eligibility for snap and to
 
04:18:18.870 --> 04:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
conduct program outreach
 
04:18:20.469 --> 04:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
which helps ensure that information
 
04:18:22.229 --> 04:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
about benefits information about
 
04:18:24.950 --> 04:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
eligibility is available to residents
 
04:18:27.750 --> 04:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
who may qualify for assistance the
 
04:18:29.830 --> 04:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
federal government reimburses states for
 
04:18:31.590 --> 04:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
half of the costs associated with these
 
04:18:33.910 --> 04:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
outreach programs so long as those costs
 
04:18:35.590 --> 04:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
are part of an outreach plan that's
 
04:18:37.990 --> 04:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
approved by the government so they allow
 
04:18:39.510 --> 04:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
states to do that but it has to be a
 
04:18:41.990 --> 04:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
plan part of a plan that's approved by
 
04:18:43.110 --> 04:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
the government
 
04:18:45.349 --> 04:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
and not only do they allow this allow
 
04:18:47.030 --> 04:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
this the federal government actually
 
04:18:50.229 --> 04:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
encourages these these uh plans because
 
04:18:51.910 --> 04:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
of course they help improve program
 
04:18:54.710 --> 04:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
participation and get more stable food
 
04:18:56.630 --> 04:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
access to people
 
04:18:58.469 --> 04:18:58.479 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately new hampshire has not
 
04:19:01.429 --> 04:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
had an outreach plan for five years the
 
04:19:03.590 --> 04:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
last approved outreach plan ended in
 
04:19:03.600 --> 04:19:04.990 align:start position:0%
last approved outreach plan ended in
september

04:19:04.990 --> 04:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
september
 
04:19:05.000 --> 04:19:06.790 align:start position:0%
september
2017

04:19:06.790 --> 04:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
2017
 
04:19:08.870 --> 04:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
and so outreach eligible granite staters
 
04:19:10.149 --> 04:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
04:19:12.790 --> 04:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
can also help disproportionately
 
04:19:14.550 --> 04:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
impacted folks
 
04:19:16.950 --> 04:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
move for move ahead during this crisis
 
04:19:19.429 --> 04:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
um you know we we know a lot of people
 
04:19:21.349 --> 04:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
were disproportionately impacted by
 
04:19:22.469 --> 04:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
everything that happened during the
 
04:19:24.149 --> 04:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic and i think we have an
 
04:19:25.990 --> 04:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
obligation to sort of find those policy
 
04:19:28.710 --> 04:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
solutions to get them back on track
 
04:19:31.429 --> 04:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
um so the bill before you is a very well
 
04:19:32.950 --> 04:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
thought out proposal there are a lot of
 
04:19:34.950 --> 04:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
very smart people advocates that worked
 
04:19:38.149 --> 04:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
on this bill it also has bipartisan and
 
04:19:41.030 --> 04:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
bicameral support um so i think that
 
04:19:44.469 --> 04:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
speaks to how important this policy is
 
04:19:44.479 --> 04:19:45.510 align:start position:0%
speaks to how important this policy is
and

04:19:45.510 --> 04:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:19:47.429 --> 04:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
that it's really ready for prime time so
 
04:19:48.710 --> 04:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your consideration and i'm
 
04:19:52.229 --> 04:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:54.469 --> 04:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
04:19:56.229 --> 04:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
04:19:59.110 --> 04:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
question um
 
04:20:01.349 --> 04:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
where could we find out what kind of
 
04:20:02.870 --> 04:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
plans are
 
04:20:04.790 --> 04:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
approved by the federal government like
 
04:20:06.630 --> 04:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
do they have guidelines for establishing
 
04:20:10.550 --> 04:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
the plans so that they'd fit there
 
04:20:12.550 --> 04:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for that question i
 
04:20:14.070 --> 04:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
am not the best one to answer that there
 
04:20:16.469 --> 04:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
are some nutrition experts dhhs might
 
04:20:17.830 --> 04:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
also be able to answer that question
 
04:20:18.950 --> 04:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
because they did have an outreach plan
 
04:20:21.349 --> 04:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
in the past okay thank you thank you
 
04:20:23.030 --> 04:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
04:20:24.950 --> 04:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chairman
 
04:20:26.309 --> 04:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking the question
 
04:20:28.469 --> 04:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
senator um this may be similar to the
 
04:20:30.070 --> 04:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
other question do you know if they're
 
04:20:32.070 --> 04:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
going through individuals financial
 
04:20:34.229 --> 04:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
records in order to identify them for
 
04:20:36.309 --> 04:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
that outreach or if this is more of a
 
04:20:38.469 --> 04:20:38.479 align:start position:0%
messaging and advertising approach to
 
04:20:41.030 --> 04:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
these outreach plans uh that would be a
 
04:20:42.469 --> 04:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
good question for the food bank if they
 
04:20:44.229 --> 04:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
were here okay
 
04:20:46.070 --> 04:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
then i will defer to them okay thank you
 
04:20:47.429 --> 04:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question i will say
 
04:20:47.439 --> 04:20:48.229 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question i will say
that

04:20:48.229 --> 04:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:20:49.429 --> 04:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire food bank has
 
04:20:51.590 --> 04:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
participated in outreach significant
 
04:20:54.229 --> 04:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
outreach in the past present um and so
 
04:20:55.830 --> 04:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
they are the really the best folks to
 
04:20:57.510 --> 04:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
talk about the details of the plan and
 
04:20:58.870 --> 04:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
how that might work
 
04:21:00.550 --> 04:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
04:21:01.990 --> 04:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:21:03.590 --> 04:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
taking that chris i'm
 
04:21:04.950 --> 04:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
here sorry
 
04:21:06.870 --> 04:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
hello representative they hide me for
 
04:21:09.429 --> 04:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
good reason
 
04:21:11.269 --> 04:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
you mentioned a hiatus
 
04:21:14.229 --> 04:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
about these programs was there a problem
 
04:21:16.469 --> 04:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
that needed to be addressed
 
04:21:18.870 --> 04:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
in the absence of these programs
 
04:21:21.110 --> 04:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
why why were they discontinued
 
04:21:22.469 --> 04:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
i don't really know the answer to that i
 
04:21:25.429 --> 04:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
know folks from dhhs are here um you
 
04:21:28.070 --> 04:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
know of course their dhhs has a whole
 
04:21:30.229 --> 04:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
host of responsibilities and i you know
 
04:21:31.750 --> 04:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
i don't really know why the outreach
 
04:21:33.429 --> 04:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
plan was discontinued
 
04:21:35.510 --> 04:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
like einstein said you're doing the same
 
04:21:36.870 --> 04:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
thing over and over and expecting a
 
04:21:38.309 --> 04:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
different result
 
04:21:41.269 --> 04:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
is there something we needed to change
 
04:21:42.550 --> 04:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:21:42.560 --> 04:21:44.389 align:start position:0%
i think
thanks

04:21:44.389 --> 04:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
04:21:46.790 --> 04:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
i have a question here in the second
 
04:21:49.510 --> 04:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
page under methodology
 
04:21:50.950 --> 04:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps a little
 
04:21:54.229 --> 04:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
unpacking on your part if you would um
 
04:21:56.389 --> 04:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
the paragraph that begins at the very
 
04:21:58.389 --> 04:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
bottom the department notes that in its
 
04:22:00.070 --> 04:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
normal course of business that already
 
04:22:04.229 --> 04:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
plans to apply for a snap outreach plan
 
04:22:04.239 --> 04:22:04.690 align:start position:0%
plans to apply for a snap outreach plan
um

04:22:04.690 --> 04:22:04.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:04.700 --> 04:22:06.950 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

04:22:06.950 --> 04:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:22:08.469 --> 04:22:08.479 align:start position:0%
that makes me want to believe that some
 
04:22:10.229 --> 04:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
of the stuff that's listed in the bill
 
04:22:13.670 --> 04:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
is unnecessary but i'm not sure of that
 
04:22:15.269 --> 04:22:15.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question and you know
 
04:22:17.590 --> 04:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
i think i i'm glad to see that but
 
04:22:19.189 --> 04:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we haven't had a plan for
 
04:22:21.670 --> 04:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
five years you know we um
 
04:22:24.149 --> 04:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
the stat program is established by state
 
04:22:25.910 --> 04:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
statute and so i think if the
 
04:22:27.510 --> 04:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
legislature thinks it's important to
 
04:22:29.510 --> 04:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
have this component of it to reach who's
 
04:22:31.670 --> 04:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
eligible then i think we the legislature
 
04:22:33.110 --> 04:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
needs to speak on the
 
04:22:34.870 --> 04:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
need and the importance of an outreach
 
04:22:36.469 --> 04:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
plan even though the department's
 
04:22:39.110 --> 04:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
planning on doing it i mean plans change
 
04:22:40.710 --> 04:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
you know look
 
04:22:42.469 --> 04:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
different responsibilities you know we
 
04:22:44.950 --> 04:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
heard you know they it could be that you
 
04:22:47.110 --> 04:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
know this takes not a priority i mean i
 
04:22:48.309 --> 04:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
think i think that's fine if they're
 
04:22:49.590 --> 04:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
doing it that wouldn't i don't think
 
04:22:51.910 --> 04:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
that you know impedes what we're trying
 
04:22:53.670 --> 04:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
to do here i just think it puts a
 
04:22:55.349 --> 04:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
legislative imprimatur you know we have
 
04:22:57.349 --> 04:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
three branches of government you know i
 
04:22:58.710 --> 04:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
think it's important for the legislature
 
04:23:00.550 --> 04:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
to speak on this and then the end of
 
04:23:02.550 --> 04:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
that paragraph this bill indicates that
 
04:23:04.149 --> 04:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
the resulting plan would not be
 
04:23:07.349 --> 04:23:07.359 align:start position:0%
implemented unless its costs were fully
 
04:23:09.990 --> 04:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
funded by private or federal sources in
 
04:23:11.269 --> 04:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
other words no
 
04:23:13.269 --> 04:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
charge against the state budget at least
 
04:23:15.189 --> 04:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
right now thank you for that question
 
04:23:17.189 --> 04:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
yes this has been um a really
 
04:23:18.630 --> 04:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
collaborative bill
 
04:23:19.990 --> 04:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
if there is a state there is a state
 
04:23:23.030 --> 04:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
match for for this and there are already
 
04:23:25.429 --> 04:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
uh private funds identified for that and
 
04:23:26.950 --> 04:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
i think other folks can speak to that as
 
04:23:29.110 --> 04:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
well how can it be fully funded by
 
04:23:31.030 --> 04:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
private or federal sources if there's a
 
04:23:33.990 --> 04:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
match by anybody the the private entity
 
04:23:35.830 --> 04:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
would provide the state match
 
04:23:39.429 --> 04:23:39.439 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cushman
 
04:23:41.750 --> 04:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i believe you
 
04:23:43.510 --> 04:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
answered my question
 
04:23:43.520 --> 04:23:44.950 align:start position:0%
answered my question
um

04:23:44.950 --> 04:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:47.030 --> 04:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
with your last statement but just to
 
04:23:49.590 --> 04:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
really tie it up um for my own
 
04:23:51.910 --> 04:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
understanding and maybe someone else's
 
04:23:54.309 --> 04:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
um so really the difference between the
 
04:23:55.510 --> 04:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
the plan
 
04:23:55.520 --> 04:23:56.389 align:start position:0%
the plan
the

04:23:56.389 --> 04:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:23:58.149 --> 04:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
outreach plan
 
04:24:00.550 --> 04:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
application that will be submitted
 
04:24:03.590 --> 04:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
by the department and this one is that
 
04:24:05.590 --> 04:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
the one that the department would be
 
04:24:08.790 --> 04:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
submitting would use
 
04:24:10.950 --> 04:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
their existing budget and this bill
 
04:24:13.590 --> 04:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
requires that the funds come
 
04:24:18.229 --> 04:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:20.229 --> 04:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
was that a question
 
04:24:20.239 --> 04:24:21.670 align:start position:0%
was that a question
yeah

04:24:21.670 --> 04:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:24:23.750 --> 04:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's my that's my understanding
 
04:24:26.149 --> 04:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
04:24:27.990 --> 04:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and pulling on the same thread
 
04:24:31.349 --> 04:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
i see on page one line eight and nine it
 
04:24:33.110 --> 04:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
says nothing in this paragraph shall be
 
04:24:34.630 --> 04:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
construed to prevent the department's
 
04:24:36.229 --> 04:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
use of available general fund
 
04:24:38.070 --> 04:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
appropriations for the purposes of the
 
04:24:39.990 --> 04:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph if there's insufficient
 
04:24:42.389 --> 04:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
federal public public uh private funds
 
04:24:44.710 --> 04:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
available so it seems that this is this
 
04:24:46.790 --> 04:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
would this be enabling in order to reach
 
04:24:49.670 --> 04:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
for those those private funds yes okay
 
04:24:52.070 --> 04:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:24:55.990 --> 04:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:57.830 --> 04:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you senator thank you
 
04:24:59.030 --> 04:24:59.040 align:start position:0%

04:25:00.710 --> 04:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate the time
 
04:25:03.349 --> 04:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
keep those puns coming
 
04:25:05.750 --> 04:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes elise bolster from the
 
04:25:14.710 --> 04:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:16.870 --> 04:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
hi chairman and committee members
 
04:25:18.229 --> 04:25:18.239 align:start position:0%

save them for the end
 
04:25:32.550 --> 04:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
i have something written here i think
 
04:25:33.910 --> 04:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
it'd probably be more helpful if i read
 
04:25:33.920 --> 04:25:35.269 align:start position:0%
it'd probably be more helpful if i read
it

04:25:35.269 --> 04:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:25:37.349 --> 04:25:37.359 align:start position:0%
well we don't like long red stuff it's
 
04:25:40.550 --> 04:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:42.550 --> 04:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm here today with my co-workers
 
04:25:44.790 --> 04:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
um jennifer lennox she is our snap
 
04:25:46.469 --> 04:25:46.479 align:start position:0%
outreach coordinator
 
04:25:48.630 --> 04:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
she does some of the outreach that we're
 
04:25:49.750 --> 04:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
currently doing at the new hampshire
 
04:25:51.429 --> 04:25:51.439 align:start position:0%
food bank to ensure those who we serve
 
04:25:53.269 --> 04:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
through our agency network do know about
 
04:25:55.990 --> 04:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
snap and can access
 
04:25:57.510 --> 04:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
snap applications through new hampshire
 
04:25:59.030 --> 04:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
easy which is through the department of
 
04:26:00.870 --> 04:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
health and human services or they could
 
04:26:02.630 --> 04:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
call her especially if they don't have
 
04:26:04.229 --> 04:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
access to
 
04:26:06.630 --> 04:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
computers or electronic devices to apply
 
04:26:08.550 --> 04:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
on their own they do need that resource
 
04:26:10.309 --> 04:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
to go through that process and to have
 
04:26:12.309 --> 04:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
someone on the other end of the line
 
04:26:13.990 --> 04:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
that can actually help them through that
 
04:26:14.000 --> 04:26:15.110 align:start position:0%
that can actually help them through that
process

04:26:15.110 --> 04:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:26:16.389 --> 04:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
i think we can all relate to a
 
04:26:18.149 --> 04:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
frustrating conversation with someone on
 
04:26:19.670 --> 04:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
the other end that's not understanding
 
04:26:21.590 --> 04:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
us or not helping us through our
 
04:26:21.600 --> 04:26:25.349 align:start position:0%
us or not helping us through our
processes

04:26:25.349 --> 04:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:26.790 --> 04:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
i wanted to
 
04:26:29.269 --> 04:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
define food insecurity for you food
 
04:26:31.269 --> 04:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
security which is
 
04:26:34.309 --> 04:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
having enough consistent access to food
 
04:26:36.469 --> 04:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
for an active active healthy life i can
 
04:26:37.990 --> 04:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
imagine many of us have experienced
 
04:26:39.830 --> 04:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
hunger at some point
 
04:26:41.510 --> 04:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
i was hungry before i ate breakfast this
 
04:26:41.520 --> 04:26:42.630 align:start position:0%
i was hungry before i ate breakfast this
morning

04:26:42.630 --> 04:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
morning
 
04:26:44.870 --> 04:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
food insecurity i'm fortunate not not to
 
04:26:46.790 --> 04:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
have experience firsthand but food
 
04:26:50.309 --> 04:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
security is as as i said consistent
 
04:26:51.910 --> 04:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
access to enough food for an active
 
04:26:54.149 --> 04:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
healthy life um and i think some of
 
04:26:55.830 --> 04:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
those words within that definition can
 
04:26:58.950 --> 04:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
resonate uh consistent enough
 
04:26:58.960 --> 04:27:00.389 align:start position:0%
resonate uh consistent enough
healthy

04:27:00.389 --> 04:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
healthy
 
04:27:01.590 --> 04:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
the mission at the new hampshire food
 
04:27:03.189 --> 04:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
bank is to ensure that all new hampshire
 
04:27:05.349 --> 04:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
residents are food secure anyone who is
 
04:27:07.670 --> 04:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
eligible and enrolled in the federal
 
04:27:09.110 --> 04:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
supplemental nutrition assistance
 
04:27:11.189 --> 04:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
program also known as snap are able to
 
04:27:12.710 --> 04:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
choose for themselves which foods to
 
04:27:14.550 --> 04:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
purchase how often
 
04:27:16.870 --> 04:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
and how much of those foods
 
04:27:19.269 --> 04:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
this monetary supplementation again
 
04:27:21.510 --> 04:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
supplementation it's not to purchase all
 
04:27:23.349 --> 04:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
of their groceries with
 
04:27:25.830 --> 04:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
it's usually not enough provides dignity
 
04:27:27.269 --> 04:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
choice and options to new hampshire
 
04:27:29.030 --> 04:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
residents on how they nourish themselves
 
04:27:30.790 --> 04:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
and their families and helps us work
 
04:27:32.389 --> 04:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
towards our mission of ensuring those
 
04:27:34.469 --> 04:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
who are around in our communities our
 
04:27:36.710 --> 04:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
food secure
 
04:27:38.469 --> 04:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
without clear and trusted awareness and
 
04:27:40.229 --> 04:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
knowledge of snap's existence how to
 
04:27:42.630 --> 04:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
apply learning how one might be eligible
 
04:27:43.830 --> 04:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
or where
 
04:27:45.750 --> 04:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
to call or go to receive help our new
 
04:27:47.349 --> 04:27:47.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents cannot access this
 
04:27:47.359 --> 04:27:48.550 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents cannot access this
resource

04:27:48.550 --> 04:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
resource
 
04:27:51.110 --> 04:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
and in turn might left be that left
 
04:27:52.469 --> 04:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
might be left without the sufficient
 
04:27:55.110 --> 04:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
food resources for optimal health
 
04:27:56.469 --> 04:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
as much as the food bank would like to
 
04:27:58.550 --> 04:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
provide all the resources at all times
 
04:28:00.630 --> 04:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
to all of the individuals in the state
 
04:28:02.630 --> 04:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
we cannot carry this weight
 
04:28:04.710 --> 04:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
for those who are food insecure
 
04:28:07.429 --> 04:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
and cannot care the entire way for those
 
04:28:09.189 --> 04:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
that are food insecure
 
04:28:11.990 --> 04:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
and this plan is the federal safety net
 
04:28:13.750 --> 04:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
to ensure
 
04:28:16.070 --> 04:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
that you know this program is help
 
04:28:18.309 --> 04:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
helping to carry that weight
 
04:28:19.830 --> 04:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
snap outreach provides the foundation
 
04:28:21.269 --> 04:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
for this program
 
04:28:24.149 --> 04:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
to be successfully util utilized
 
04:28:26.469 --> 04:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
um and just we hope you consider the
 
04:28:28.389 --> 04:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
fundamental need for this type statewide
 
04:28:30.630 --> 04:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
plan uh so that we can
 
04:28:31.830 --> 04:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
so that all can know about what
 
04:28:33.990 --> 04:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
resources are available to obtain this
 
04:28:36.389 --> 04:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
basic human need and
 
04:28:37.830 --> 04:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
i can share a little bit about my
 
04:28:39.269 --> 04:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
background at the food bank which is
 
04:28:40.710 --> 04:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
that i wasn't here when the last
 
04:28:43.510 --> 04:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
outreach plan was in place it was
 
04:28:44.710 --> 04:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
contracted through the new hampshire
 
04:28:45.910 --> 04:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
food bank
 
04:28:49.030 --> 04:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
i started in 2017
 
04:28:51.349 --> 04:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
as a coordinator and became manager at
 
04:28:54.630 --> 04:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
the end of 2019 so a lot of this wasn't
 
04:28:57.189 --> 04:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
in play when i was a manager and
 
04:29:00.710 --> 04:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
something happened between 2017 and 2019
 
04:29:02.149 --> 04:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
not to say that we have to be the
 
04:29:04.149 --> 04:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
contracted agency in the state i think
 
04:29:06.149 --> 04:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
as as far as the state goes they can
 
04:29:08.469 --> 04:29:08.479 align:start position:0%
send out an rfp and anyone can apply to
 
04:29:10.229 --> 04:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
be that contractor
 
04:29:11.670 --> 04:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire food bank is more than
 
04:29:13.429 --> 04:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
willing it's like i said part of our
 
04:29:15.910 --> 04:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
mission and we would love to be able to
 
04:29:17.830 --> 04:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
access those resources to ensure that
 
04:29:19.670 --> 04:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
all of our agencies and the network that
 
04:29:21.670 --> 04:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
we serve that are food insecure know
 
04:29:24.389 --> 04:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
about this this resource that can allow
 
04:29:26.469 --> 04:29:26.479 align:start position:0%
for them and themselves to purchase the
 
04:29:28.309 --> 04:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
food where where they want when they
 
04:29:32.469 --> 04:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
want and how they want to purchase them
 
04:29:32.479 --> 04:29:38.550 align:start position:0%
want and how they want to purchase them
questions

04:29:38.550 --> 04:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:40.710 --> 04:29:40.720 align:start position:0%

ongoing statewide snap outreach is
 
04:30:35.590 --> 04:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
critical eligibility for the program is
 
04:30:38.309 --> 04:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
set by states so new hampshire should
 
04:30:40.149 --> 04:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
ensure that our residents who are
 
04:30:42.630 --> 04:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
eligible for snap know it know how to
 
04:30:45.269 --> 04:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
apply and can benefit from it
 
04:30:47.510 --> 04:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
ongoing outreach improves the state's
 
04:30:49.590 --> 04:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
ability to educate residents about
 
04:30:51.990 --> 04:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility rules ensuring the program's
 
04:30:52.000 --> 04:30:53.670 align:start position:0%
eligibility rules ensuring the program's
integrity

04:30:53.670 --> 04:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
integrity
 
04:30:56.309 --> 04:30:56.319 align:start position:0%
we know that new hampshire is now 39th
 
04:30:58.790 --> 04:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
in the nation in snap participation
 
04:31:01.269 --> 04:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
the majority or 60
 
04:31:03.429 --> 04:31:03.439 align:start position:0%
of eligible older adults are not
 
04:31:05.189 --> 04:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
currently enrolled
 
04:31:08.229 --> 04:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
as many as a third of eligible eligible
 
04:31:10.710 --> 04:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
children are not enrolled
 
04:31:14.710 --> 04:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
in the week ending march 14 2022
 
04:31:17.830 --> 04:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
over 55 000 new hampshire residents said
 
04:31:20.229 --> 04:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
that they did not have enough to eat
 
04:31:21.590 --> 04:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's more than the population of
 
04:31:21.600 --> 04:31:22.950 align:start position:0%
that's more than the population of
concord

04:31:22.950 --> 04:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
concord
 
04:31:25.910 --> 04:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
in the uh in that same week 25 percent
 
04:31:28.070 --> 04:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire adults reported that it
 
04:31:30.229 --> 04:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
was somewhat or very difficult to pay
 
04:31:32.910 --> 04:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
for usual household expenses that's over
 
04:31:35.590 --> 04:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
241 000 people
 
04:31:36.790 --> 04:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
and these numbers are from the new
 
04:31:39.750 --> 04:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire excuse me the u.s census pulse
 
04:31:39.760 --> 04:31:41.429 align:start position:0%
hampshire excuse me the u.s census pulse
survey

04:31:41.429 --> 04:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
survey
 
04:31:42.790 --> 04:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
the rising inflation that we've all
 
04:31:44.630 --> 04:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
experienced is also affecting food
 
04:31:46.389 --> 04:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
prices which have increased over six
 
04:31:48.550 --> 04:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
percent in the last 12 months
 
04:31:50.630 --> 04:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
we are simply not reaching all those who
 
04:31:52.469 --> 04:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
could benefit from snap and it's clear
 
04:31:55.030 --> 04:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
that the need is great
 
04:31:56.790 --> 04:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
statewide outreach is critical to
 
04:31:59.750 --> 04:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
ensuring public resources flow equitably
 
04:32:02.070 --> 04:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
and we know that outreach works studies
 
04:32:04.309 --> 04:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
show that data-driven outreach and
 
04:32:06.469 --> 04:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
application assistance increases
 
04:32:09.110 --> 04:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
participation more than seven times in
 
04:32:11.830 --> 04:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
adults over 65. an outreach plan
 
04:32:13.429 --> 04:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
codified in legislation will have the
 
04:32:14.790 --> 04:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
effect of saying that we in new
 
04:32:16.790 --> 04:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire believe that addressing hunger
 
04:32:18.630 --> 04:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
is a bedrock value
 
04:32:20.790 --> 04:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
we applaud new hampshire dhhs for its
 
04:32:22.870 --> 04:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
recent stated commitment to submitting a
 
04:32:24.550 --> 04:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
snap outreach plan to the federal
 
04:32:26.070 --> 04:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
government this year
 
04:32:28.710 --> 04:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
we also support this legislation as it
 
04:32:30.149 --> 04:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
will ensure that all future
 
04:32:31.990 --> 04:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
administrations do the same new
 
04:32:33.670 --> 04:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire has failed to submit a plan
 
04:32:36.149 --> 04:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
since 2017 with clear negative effects
 
04:32:38.149 --> 04:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
on hunger in the state and this
 
04:32:39.750 --> 04:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
legislation will ensure that doesn't
 
04:32:41.750 --> 04:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
happen again
 
04:32:43.910 --> 04:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
so this legislation requires the state
 
04:32:45.990 --> 04:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
to file an outreach plan but not to
 
04:32:48.630 --> 04:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
implement or administer it unless they
 
04:32:50.149 --> 04:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
receive private or federal money
 
04:32:52.149 --> 04:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
sufficient to cover the costs
 
04:32:53.670 --> 04:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
fifty percent of the funding is already
 
04:32:55.189 --> 04:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
assured as the federal government
 
04:32:57.349 --> 04:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
provides the fifty percent match now
 
04:32:59.750 --> 04:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
while the state must submit the plan in
 
04:33:02.550 --> 04:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
order to access that 50 percent match
 
04:33:04.869 --> 04:33:04.879 align:start position:0%
because non-profits can't do that the
 
04:33:06.709 --> 04:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
bill puts the burden of raising the rest
 
04:33:09.670 --> 04:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
of the dollars on nonprofit partners
 
04:33:12.070 --> 04:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
the bill is modeled after a nebraska law
 
04:33:14.230 --> 04:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
where the new nebraska food bank for the
 
04:33:16.310 --> 04:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
heartland raises the money for outreach
 
04:33:18.869 --> 04:33:18.879 align:start position:0%
and administers the outreach program the
 
04:33:20.709 --> 04:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
state's only obligation is to submit the
 
04:33:23.429 --> 04:33:23.439 align:start position:0%
plan it's entirely revenue neutral
 
04:33:25.269 --> 04:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
snap not only keeps our neighbors from
 
04:33:27.189 --> 04:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
hunger but communities gain from the
 
04:33:29.750 --> 04:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
multiplier effect of snap dollars being
 
04:33:32.150 --> 04:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
spent in the local economy
 
04:33:34.470 --> 04:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
for every snap dollar that comes into
 
04:33:36.869 --> 04:33:36.879 align:start position:0%
the state it's estimated to stimulate a
 
04:33:39.670 --> 04:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
dollar fifty or more in local economic
 
04:33:39.680 --> 04:33:41.510 align:start position:0%
dollar fifty or more in local economic
activity

04:33:41.510 --> 04:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
activity
 
04:33:44.310 --> 04:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
so for example as senator whitley said
 
04:33:46.070 --> 04:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
earlier the new hampshire fiscal policy
 
04:33:49.269 --> 04:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
institute estimated that 17 000 children
 
04:33:51.349 --> 04:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
may have been eligible for snap benefits
 
04:33:54.150 --> 04:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
in 2019 but were not enrolled now if
 
04:33:56.470 --> 04:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
they had been that would have brought
 
04:33:59.510 --> 04:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
nearly 38 million dollars in economic
 
04:34:01.510 --> 04:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
stimulus to new hampshire in a single
 
04:34:01.520 --> 04:34:02.949 align:start position:0%
stimulus to new hampshire in a single
year

04:34:02.949 --> 04:34:02.959 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:34:04.230 --> 04:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
our system of food and nutrition
 
04:34:06.470 --> 04:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
supports is like a power grid that moves
 
04:34:08.150 --> 04:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
nutritious food to communities
 
04:34:10.230 --> 04:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
throughout the state but that grid is
 
04:34:12.310 --> 04:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
now patchy in some communities and
 
04:34:14.310 --> 04:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
non-existent in others
 
04:34:16.070 --> 04:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
this bell will help us plug more
 
04:34:18.310 --> 04:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
communities into the grid ensuring more
 
04:34:21.109 --> 04:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
children older adults and other eligible
 
04:34:23.349 --> 04:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
granite staters benefit from the
 
04:34:23.359 --> 04:34:24.470 align:start position:0%
granite staters benefit from the
nutrition

04:34:24.470 --> 04:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
nutrition
 
04:34:26.390 --> 04:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
support that they deserve
 
04:34:29.109 --> 04:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
thank you so much take any questions
 
04:34:30.789 --> 04:34:30.799 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:34:32.709 --> 04:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
04:34:34.390 --> 04:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:34:36.789 --> 04:34:36.799 align:start position:0%
taking my question um i hope you can
 
04:34:39.429 --> 04:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
answer what i have to ask here do you
 
04:34:40.789 --> 04:34:40.799 align:start position:0%
know if the outreach would be
 
04:34:42.789 --> 04:34:42.799 align:start position:0%
specifically targeting households that
 
04:34:44.551 --> 04:34:44.561 align:start position:0%
have been identified as having the
 
04:34:47.029 --> 04:34:47.039 align:start position:0%
earnings level where they would qualify
 
04:34:49.349 --> 04:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
or if this is a broader outreach that's
 
04:34:52.230 --> 04:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
not targeted to specific households
 
04:34:55.349 --> 04:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question um
 
04:34:57.029 --> 04:34:57.039 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
04:35:00.310 --> 04:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
i think that we would um want to broadly
 
04:35:04.150 --> 04:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
target the outreach i um i
 
04:35:06.230 --> 04:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
don't know that we even have the ability
 
04:35:08.949 --> 04:35:08.959 align:start position:0%
to target as you as you indicate i think
 
04:35:12.230 --> 04:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
we could use census tract data to show
 
04:35:14.869 --> 04:35:14.879 align:start position:0%
what areas people might live in who are
 
04:35:16.390 --> 04:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
snap eligible
 
04:35:19.429 --> 04:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
but the idea is not to in any way
 
04:35:22.390 --> 04:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
stigmatize anyone the idea is to make
 
04:35:24.310 --> 04:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
sure that the people who need snap can
 
04:35:26.310 --> 04:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
access it
 
04:35:28.629 --> 04:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you mr chairman so you
 
04:35:31.109 --> 04:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
don't know of any plans taking medicaid
 
04:35:32.869 --> 04:35:32.879 align:start position:0%
benefits or anything else like that to
 
04:35:34.830 --> 04:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
personally target any of these
 
04:35:36.949 --> 04:35:36.959 align:start position:0%
families i see what you're saying so
 
04:35:38.789 --> 04:35:38.799 align:start position:0%
you're talking about medicaid direct
 
04:35:44.470 --> 04:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:46.390 --> 04:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
medicaid direct certification for free
 
04:35:49.429 --> 04:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
and reduced meals not for snap okay well
 
04:35:51.429 --> 04:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
the privacy issues of that um were a
 
04:35:53.189 --> 04:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
concern to me especially families that
 
04:35:55.510 --> 04:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to be identified that way so
 
04:35:57.029 --> 04:35:57.039 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to learn more that's why i'm
 
04:35:59.029 --> 04:35:59.039 align:start position:0%
asking these questions i see i mean that
 
04:36:00.709 --> 04:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
is that's an interesting way of looking
 
04:36:02.230 --> 04:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
at it i sort of see it a little bit
 
04:36:04.709 --> 04:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
differently that that's families who
 
04:36:06.709 --> 04:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
have already submitted information for
 
04:36:06.719 --> 04:36:07.910 align:start position:0%
have already submitted information for
medicaid

04:36:07.910 --> 04:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
04:36:09.830 --> 04:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
would be told that they were are also
 
04:36:12.629 --> 04:36:12.639 align:start position:0%
eligible for other programs which uh you
 
04:36:14.789 --> 04:36:14.799 align:start position:0%
know gives them the option to enroll or
 
04:36:14.799 --> 04:36:16.869 align:start position:0%
know gives them the option to enroll or
not

04:36:16.869 --> 04:36:16.879 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:36:18.629 --> 04:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
so you would you would be in favor of
 
04:36:20.709 --> 04:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
using that information to do to reach
 
04:36:23.269 --> 04:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
out specifically to those families uh so
 
04:36:26.150 --> 04:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
this this the snap outreach bill doesn't
 
04:36:27.990 --> 04:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with medicaid direct
 
04:36:30.470 --> 04:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
certification thank you
 
04:36:33.990 --> 04:36:34.000 align:start position:0%

i am the director for the division of
 
04:37:05.109 --> 04:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
economic and housing stability for the
 
04:37:07.590 --> 04:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
04:37:09.269 --> 04:37:09.279 align:start position:0%
it's a long
 
04:37:12.551 --> 04:37:12.561 align:start position:0%
title i have to take a breath in between
 
04:37:15.269 --> 04:37:15.279 align:start position:0%
so i do want to uh
 
04:37:17.109 --> 04:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
note that i
 
04:37:19.189 --> 04:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
the department respects the policy
 
04:37:19.199 --> 04:37:20.310 align:start position:0%
the department respects the policy
support

04:37:20.310 --> 04:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:37:22.230 --> 04:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
of senator whitley
 
04:37:23.990 --> 04:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
as well as the support that we have been
 
04:37:24.000 --> 04:37:24.869 align:start position:0%
as well as the support that we have been
getting

04:37:24.869 --> 04:37:24.879 align:start position:0%
getting
 
04:37:27.510 --> 04:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
from a number of food advocates
 
04:37:29.109 --> 04:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
04:37:31.349 --> 04:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
so i do recognize that and the
 
04:37:33.269 --> 04:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
department does agree that an outreach
 
04:37:33.279 --> 04:37:35.029 align:start position:0%
department does agree that an outreach
plan

04:37:35.029 --> 04:37:35.039 align:start position:0%
plan
 
04:37:37.109 --> 04:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
is extremely important to families in
 
04:37:39.429 --> 04:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:37:41.269 --> 04:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
especially with our increasing and
 
04:37:44.629 --> 04:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
recent rising food costs
 
04:37:46.470 --> 04:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
we were approached by a number of the
 
04:37:48.150 --> 04:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
food advocates as well as new hampshire
 
04:37:50.551 --> 04:37:50.561 align:start position:0%
legal assistants really supporting and
 
04:37:53.590 --> 04:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
encouraging the department to conduct
 
04:37:56.629 --> 04:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
further outreach for the snap program
 
04:37:58.789 --> 04:37:58.799 align:start position:0%
and while the
 
04:38:00.551 --> 04:38:00.561 align:start position:0%
caseloads in
 
04:38:03.349 --> 04:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
the department for snap were encouraged
 
04:38:05.429 --> 04:38:05.439 align:start position:0%
by a slight increase that we have seen
 
04:38:07.189 --> 04:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
in the last month
 
04:38:08.629 --> 04:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
what we didn't really see was an
 
04:38:11.590 --> 04:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
increase in the need during covid so
 
04:38:13.590 --> 04:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
during the last two years it was it were
 
04:38:13.600 --> 04:38:14.310 align:start position:0%
during the last two years it was it were
the

04:38:14.310 --> 04:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:38:18.070 --> 04:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
caseloads remained relatively steady
 
04:38:20.150 --> 04:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
so that's certainly something we made a
 
04:38:21.349 --> 04:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
note of
 
04:38:23.510 --> 04:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
so we've been currently analyzing some
 
04:38:25.109 --> 04:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
of our own data
 
04:38:27.590 --> 04:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
including survey very recent survey data
 
04:38:30.310 --> 04:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
as well as other data that includes work
 
04:38:31.910 --> 04:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
done by the children new hampshire
 
04:38:34.230 --> 04:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
children's health foundation and find it
 
04:38:37.510 --> 04:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
very informative so we've started the we
 
04:38:39.990 --> 04:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
started a while ago to initiate
 
04:38:42.709 --> 04:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
a request for procurement a request for
 
04:38:43.990 --> 04:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
proposals rather through the
 
04:38:46.310 --> 04:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
department's procurement process
 
04:38:49.109 --> 04:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
for a snap outreach plan
 
04:38:50.629 --> 04:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
while we're in the middle of that
 
04:38:52.310 --> 04:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
procurement so i'm a little restricted
 
04:38:53.670 --> 04:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
on what we can
 
04:38:56.709 --> 04:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
disclose about that at this time
 
04:38:58.869 --> 04:38:58.879 align:start position:0%
we do basically agree
 
04:38:58.879 --> 04:39:00.551 align:start position:0%
we do basically agree
that

04:39:00.551 --> 04:39:00.561 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:39:02.551 --> 04:39:02.561 align:start position:0%
an outreach plan is helpful and
 
04:39:06.230 --> 04:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
essential for our families
 
04:39:07.990 --> 04:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
a couple of technicalities i just want
 
04:39:10.949 --> 04:39:10.959 align:start position:0%
to point out that are in the bill
 
04:39:13.349 --> 04:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
one of them being
 
04:39:16.070 --> 04:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
on line 13 of page one
 
04:39:17.830 --> 04:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
it refers to
 
04:39:18.949 --> 04:39:18.959 align:start position:0%
as uh
 
04:39:20.949 --> 04:39:20.959 align:start position:0%
that upon approval by the federal
 
04:39:20.959 --> 04:39:22.629 align:start position:0%
that upon approval by the federal
government

04:39:22.629 --> 04:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:39:24.869 --> 04:39:24.879 align:start position:0%
of an outreach plan
 
04:39:26.709 --> 04:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
that the plan shall be implemented
 
04:39:28.390 --> 04:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
within three months
 
04:39:30.230 --> 04:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
and i just want to point out
 
04:39:31.990 --> 04:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
the procurement process that includes
 
04:39:34.709 --> 04:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
developing those contracts it's entirely
 
04:39:36.789 --> 04:39:36.799 align:start position:0%
possible it could take more than three
 
04:39:39.910 --> 04:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
months and i don't want to
 
04:39:43.270 --> 04:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
get us in trouble if you will
 
04:39:45.750 --> 04:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering if it would be
 
04:39:48.310 --> 04:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
acceptable to make an amendment to that
 
04:39:50.708 --> 04:39:50.718 align:start position:0%
time frame so that we're not restricting
 
04:39:52.628 --> 04:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
ourselves based on a process that we
 
04:39:55.190 --> 04:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
don't always have control over that is
 
04:39:57.430 --> 04:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
also subject to governor and council
 
04:40:03.590 --> 04:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:05.750 --> 04:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
a second technicality that i want to
 
04:40:07.270 --> 04:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
point out is
 
04:40:11.590 --> 04:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:14.788 --> 04:40:14.798 align:start position:0%
which that particular fiscal year 2023
 
04:40:17.110 --> 04:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
actually refers to the state
 
04:40:19.430 --> 04:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and i wanted to ensure there
 
04:40:21.190 --> 04:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't confusion over
 
04:40:25.190 --> 04:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:25.200 --> 04:40:26.470 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:40:26.470 --> 04:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:40:29.590 --> 04:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
deadline for the usda's
 
04:40:31.990 --> 04:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
for our submittal to the usda for an
 
04:40:34.628 --> 04:40:34.638 align:start position:0%
outreach plan is august 15th of every
 
04:40:37.190 --> 04:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
year so the deadline for august 15th of
 
04:40:37.200 --> 04:40:38.708 align:start position:0%
year so the deadline for august 15th of
2022

04:40:38.708 --> 04:40:38.718 align:start position:0%
2022
 
04:40:45.510 --> 04:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:47.990 --> 04:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
the last thing i want to just note is
 
04:40:49.830 --> 04:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
that while
 
04:40:52.390 --> 04:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
we have been initiating the current
 
04:40:53.750 --> 04:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
outreach plan
 
04:40:55.590 --> 04:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
using existing resources in the
 
04:40:55.600 --> 04:40:56.868 align:start position:0%
using existing resources in the
department

04:40:56.868 --> 04:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:40:58.550 --> 04:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
if the
 
04:41:00.708 --> 04:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass i do note that it
 
04:41:03.270 --> 04:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
refers to online 24 to
 
04:41:05.990 --> 04:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
this as being annually or as required by
 
04:41:09.110 --> 04:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
the usda thereafter uh it is entirely
 
04:41:11.670 --> 04:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
possible we would seek resources through
 
04:41:13.350 --> 04:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
the budget process
 
04:41:16.550 --> 04:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
for a continuation of an annual
 
04:41:18.390 --> 04:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
support for an annual
 
04:41:18.400 --> 04:41:19.430 align:start position:0%
support for an annual
plan

04:41:19.430 --> 04:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
plan
 
04:41:21.990 --> 04:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
and we would seek that in the next
 
04:41:23.670 --> 04:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
biennium budget
 
04:41:25.350 --> 04:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
we also don't
 
04:41:26.868 --> 04:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
know at this time
 
04:41:29.190 --> 04:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
we will be putting together relative
 
04:41:32.310 --> 04:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
projections for the 24-25
 
04:41:35.190 --> 04:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
budget based on how successful the
 
04:41:37.430 --> 04:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
outreach plan could be so we can make
 
04:41:40.708 --> 04:41:40.718 align:start position:0%
projections on perhaps the increase in
 
04:41:43.350 --> 04:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
applications the increase in eligibility
 
04:41:45.670 --> 04:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
determinations that our eligibility
 
04:41:47.910 --> 04:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
staff would have to process
 
04:41:49.830 --> 04:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
and if we are very very successful we
 
04:41:51.990 --> 04:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
will need further resources for that
 
04:41:53.350 --> 04:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
we're hoping
 
04:41:57.590 --> 04:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:00.550 --> 04:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
04:42:02.390 --> 04:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you and if i may mr chairman i
 
04:42:05.510 --> 04:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
have a couple of different questions uh
 
04:42:07.750 --> 04:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
the first comes from your testimony
 
04:42:11.430 --> 04:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
about uh line 13 you said that three
 
04:42:13.510 --> 04:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
months might be too limiting do you have
 
04:42:15.110 --> 04:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
a time period that you're comfortable
 
04:42:15.120 --> 04:42:16.868 align:start position:0%
a time period that you're comfortable
with

04:42:16.868 --> 04:42:16.878 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:42:18.628 --> 04:42:18.638 align:start position:0%
i would recommend six
 
04:42:20.948 --> 04:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
just in case i don't know that we would
 
04:42:23.510 --> 04:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
need that but i'd rather be safe than
 
04:42:23.520 --> 04:42:24.788 align:start position:0%
need that but i'd rather be safe than
sorry

04:42:24.788 --> 04:42:24.798 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:42:25.670 --> 04:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:42:27.430 --> 04:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
and second question on
 
04:42:30.628 --> 04:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
online 24 you want the insertion of the
 
04:42:33.110 --> 04:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
word state fiscal year or do you think
 
04:42:34.868 --> 04:42:34.878 align:start position:0%
that now that you've explained it to us
 
04:42:37.270 --> 04:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
we're we're okay
 
04:42:39.750 --> 04:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
i think it would be helpful for that
 
04:42:42.070 --> 04:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
clarification to and i uh senator
 
04:42:44.550 --> 04:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
whitley did support that as well okay to
 
04:42:46.550 --> 04:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
include the word state
 
04:42:48.868 --> 04:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
okay and then
 
04:42:51.830 --> 04:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
just you you made some sweeping
 
04:42:54.708 --> 04:42:54.718 align:start position:0%
statements at the end about
 
04:42:54.718 --> 04:42:55.670 align:start position:0%
statements at the end about
uh

04:42:55.670 --> 04:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:42:57.510 --> 04:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
needing more
 
04:43:00.070 --> 04:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
money but
 
04:43:02.390 --> 04:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
just so that i am clear we're talking
 
04:43:04.230 --> 04:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
about two different things one is the
 
04:43:07.190 --> 04:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
program itself which might need more
 
04:43:07.200 --> 04:43:08.868 align:start position:0%
program itself which might need more
money

04:43:08.868 --> 04:43:08.878 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:43:10.628 --> 04:43:10.638 align:start position:0%
but what we're talking about in this
 
04:43:12.550 --> 04:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
bill is simply the funds for the
 
04:43:15.030 --> 04:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
outreach is that correct
 
04:43:16.868 --> 04:43:16.878 align:start position:0%
so the funds for the outreach plan
 
04:43:19.270 --> 04:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
itself so what i'm talking about are yes
 
04:43:21.750 --> 04:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
couple of different things so resources
 
04:43:24.150 --> 04:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
that the department needs in order to
 
04:43:26.788 --> 04:43:26.798 align:start position:0%
pull a plan together and do a
 
04:43:29.670 --> 04:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
procurement process for that plan
 
04:43:31.990 --> 04:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
so that does take resources to be able
 
04:43:32.000 --> 04:43:33.510 align:start position:0%
so that does take resources to be able
to

04:43:33.510 --> 04:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:43:35.350 --> 04:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
to to make that happen
 
04:43:38.310 --> 04:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
so if this were to be an annual
 
04:43:40.868 --> 04:43:40.878 align:start position:0%
initiative for the department we would
 
04:43:42.708 --> 04:43:42.718 align:start position:0%
certainly look at seeking an additional
 
04:43:42.718 --> 04:43:43.910 align:start position:0%
certainly look at seeking an additional
resource

04:43:43.910 --> 04:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
resource
 
04:43:43.920 --> 04:43:45.030 align:start position:0%
resource
for

04:43:45.030 --> 04:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:43:47.430 --> 04:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
implementing that on an annual basis
 
04:43:49.910 --> 04:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
right now we are using an existing
 
04:43:52.070 --> 04:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
resource that we have
 
04:43:54.470 --> 04:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
until the end of april
 
04:43:56.310 --> 04:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
but after that we will no longer have
 
04:43:58.070 --> 04:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
that resource so we will look at
 
04:43:59.910 --> 04:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
incorporating something into the next
 
04:44:02.628 --> 04:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
budget for that resource
 
04:44:04.550 --> 04:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
the funding for the plan
 
04:44:04.560 --> 04:44:05.750 align:start position:0%
the funding for the plan
essentially

04:44:05.750 --> 04:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
04:44:07.590 --> 04:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
comes from
 
04:44:10.708 --> 04:44:10.718 align:start position:0%
the federal government that pays for 50
 
04:44:13.110 --> 04:44:13.120 align:start position:0%
of of eligible activities or allowable
 
04:44:15.750 --> 04:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
activities and what we anticipate is
 
04:44:19.350 --> 04:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
that the other match would be raised by
 
04:44:21.510 --> 04:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
the programs that bid on
 
04:44:23.030 --> 04:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:44:24.788 --> 04:44:24.798 align:start position:0%
on a contract for that
 
04:44:27.350 --> 04:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:32.868 --> 04:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:34.708 --> 04:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
representative knurk
 
04:44:37.750 --> 04:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
well then a follow-up on what
 
04:44:40.390 --> 04:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
representative berber was just asking
 
04:44:42.550 --> 04:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
would you be
 
04:44:44.150 --> 04:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
happier if we did not have that
 
04:44:45.990 --> 04:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
reference into annually so that you're
 
04:44:48.150 --> 04:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
not obligated to do it annually since it
 
04:44:49.670 --> 04:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
may not be something you would wish to
 
04:44:52.230 --> 04:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
do on that basis
 
04:44:53.110 --> 04:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
in other words if we're going to get an
 
04:44:54.550 --> 04:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
amendment we might as well fix all the
 
04:44:58.150 --> 04:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:00.390 --> 04:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
i think the department will be neutral
 
04:45:02.628 --> 04:45:02.638 align:start position:0%
on that
 
04:45:05.350 --> 04:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
because i think that
 
04:45:07.190 --> 04:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
while the concept of having an outreach
 
04:45:07.200 --> 04:45:08.230 align:start position:0%
while the concept of having an outreach
plan

04:45:08.230 --> 04:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
plan
 
04:45:10.948 --> 04:45:10.958 align:start position:0%
i understand the necessity to it and
 
04:45:13.190 --> 04:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
support the need for further outreach
 
04:45:14.708 --> 04:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
for families
 
04:45:17.270 --> 04:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
but at the same time i want to ensure
 
04:45:20.230 --> 04:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
that we have the resources in place
 
04:45:22.230 --> 04:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
to make that happen and make it
 
04:45:22.240 --> 04:45:25.510 align:start position:0%
to make that happen and make it
successful

04:45:25.510 --> 04:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:27.830 --> 04:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
so the outreach plan the program from
 
04:45:31.030 --> 04:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
the federal government is voluntary it
 
04:45:32.948 --> 04:45:32.958 align:start position:0%
is not a requirement
 
04:45:35.270 --> 04:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
by the usda
 
04:45:38.708 --> 04:45:38.718 align:start position:0%
to have to conduct outreach but the
 
04:45:40.230 --> 04:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
state certainly sees the importance to
 
04:45:42.390 --> 04:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
it which is why we initiated it a little
 
04:45:45.110 --> 04:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:47.510 --> 04:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up i i think i understand that
 
04:45:49.110 --> 04:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
but you you
 
04:45:50.230 --> 04:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
as you point out you wouldn't want to do
 
04:45:52.550 --> 04:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
it unless it's successful but i'm
 
04:45:54.550 --> 04:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
concerned about the language here says
 
04:45:57.350 --> 04:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
as well as annually or as required but
 
04:45:59.190 --> 04:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
if you felt that it were not successful
 
04:46:01.830 --> 04:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
so you did not wish to do it annually
 
04:46:03.510 --> 04:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
is there an escape clause here because
 
04:46:05.510 --> 04:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
it would only be if it were required
 
04:46:07.910 --> 04:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
i think the or as required okay probably
 
04:46:09.670 --> 04:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
suits that just okay thank you
 
04:46:12.948 --> 04:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:15.270 --> 04:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
so do we actually need this legislation
 
04:46:16.708 --> 04:46:16.718 align:start position:0%
at all is this not something the
 
04:46:18.470 --> 04:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
department can just go ahead and do
 
04:46:22.550 --> 04:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
without enabling legislation
 
04:46:22.560 --> 04:46:23.270 align:start position:0%
without enabling legislation
so

04:46:23.270 --> 04:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:46:25.190 --> 04:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
the while it is voluntary it's a
 
04:46:26.868 --> 04:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
voluntary program from the federal
 
04:46:26.878 --> 04:46:30.150 align:start position:0%
voluntary program from the federal
perspective

04:46:30.150 --> 04:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:32.230 --> 04:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
the department has been neutral on
 
04:46:33.670 --> 04:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
04:46:35.270 --> 04:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
this we haven't
 
04:46:37.190 --> 04:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
the department is neutral on whether or
 
04:46:40.230 --> 04:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
not we move forward with legislation on
 
04:46:41.830 --> 04:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
this particular bill could i have a
 
04:46:43.350 --> 04:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up you may
 
04:46:45.910 --> 04:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
i understand that you're neutral on the
 
04:46:45.920 --> 04:46:47.110 align:start position:0%
i understand that you're neutral on the
bill

04:46:47.110 --> 04:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:46:49.350 --> 04:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
04:46:51.430 --> 04:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
it appears from
 
04:46:53.350 --> 04:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
statements made in the methodology and
 
04:46:54.868 --> 04:46:54.878 align:start position:0%
statements that you just made that the
 
04:46:57.910 --> 04:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
department can go ahead and do this
 
04:47:00.310 --> 04:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
program whether we have a bill or not is
 
04:47:02.708 --> 04:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
that correct that's correct and the
 
04:47:04.150 --> 04:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
issue is
 
04:47:07.350 --> 04:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
whether the program will be initiated
 
04:47:09.670 --> 04:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh within the parameters of what the
 
04:47:12.150 --> 04:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
legislature has outlined here or whether
 
04:47:14.390 --> 04:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
the department will just continue with
 
04:47:17.350 --> 04:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
it or not continue with it
 
04:47:19.510 --> 04:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
at the department's own
 
04:47:19.520 --> 04:47:20.948 align:start position:0%
at the department's own
initiative

04:47:20.948 --> 04:47:20.958 align:start position:0%
initiative
 
04:47:20.958 --> 04:47:22.150 align:start position:0%
initiative
yes

04:47:22.150 --> 04:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:47:24.070 --> 04:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
oh could i have one more
 
04:47:26.310 --> 04:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
let me follow up to you or your
 
04:47:28.230 --> 04:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up and then you can follow up
 
04:47:30.948 --> 04:47:30.958 align:start position:0%
okay so this really means if the bill
 
04:47:33.110 --> 04:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't go anywhere
 
04:47:34.948 --> 04:47:34.958 align:start position:0%
it leaves the department with a lot more
 
04:47:37.750 --> 04:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
flexibility on how to do
 
04:47:39.830 --> 04:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
pretty much this stuff whereas if the
 
04:47:42.390 --> 04:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
bill passes it starts restricting it
 
04:47:44.550 --> 04:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
am i right i don't know that the bill
 
04:47:46.948 --> 04:47:46.958 align:start position:0%
restricts what it is that we're doing
 
04:47:49.590 --> 04:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
any i think that it just is presented as
 
04:47:50.948 --> 04:47:50.958 align:start position:0%
a supportive
 
04:47:50.958 --> 04:47:51.830 align:start position:0%
a supportive
um

04:47:51.830 --> 04:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:51.840 --> 04:47:53.110 align:start position:0%
um
policy

04:47:53.110 --> 04:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
policy
 
04:47:54.550 --> 04:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
from the state
 
04:47:56.948 --> 04:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
to encourage the department to continue
 
04:48:01.030 --> 04:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
having an outreach plan for snap
 
04:48:03.270 --> 04:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative weber
 
04:48:05.510 --> 04:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
i was reminded that there was a question
 
04:48:08.830 --> 04:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
a while back saying why was the program
 
04:48:13.670 --> 04:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
discontinued five years ago and
 
04:48:15.750 --> 04:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
it's clear to me that if we have it in
 
04:48:18.150 --> 04:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
statute then the program is not going to
 
04:48:21.190 --> 04:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
be discontinued unless the statute is
 
04:48:21.200 --> 04:48:22.868 align:start position:0%
be discontinued unless the statute is
repealed

04:48:22.868 --> 04:48:22.878 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
04:48:25.830 --> 04:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
was there a statute if you know was
 
04:48:28.628 --> 04:48:28.638 align:start position:0%
there a statute five years ago and and
 
04:48:30.708 --> 04:48:30.718 align:start position:0%
was that repealed or did the department
 
04:48:32.868 --> 04:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
simply discontinue the program and if so
 
04:48:35.190 --> 04:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
for what reason i believe the latter i'm
 
04:48:37.190 --> 04:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
not aware of any statute previous to
 
04:48:40.470 --> 04:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
this uh that was repealed
 
04:48:41.990 --> 04:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
and whether the department would
 
04:48:44.310 --> 04:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
discontinue the program without
 
04:48:46.788 --> 04:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
legislation in place i
 
04:48:48.230 --> 04:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's a little tough to predict the
 
04:48:50.788 --> 04:48:50.798 align:start position:0%
department certainly has a number of
 
04:48:53.750 --> 04:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
competing priorities and only so many
 
04:48:57.190 --> 04:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
resources so we look at really what
 
04:49:06.150 --> 04:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:07.750 --> 04:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
who has a question representative
 
04:49:07.760 --> 04:49:09.190 align:start position:0%
who has a question representative

04:49:09.190 --> 04:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
cushman
 
04:49:11.750 --> 04:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so just um to
 
04:49:14.550 --> 04:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
clarify that last statement so that was
 
04:49:16.868 --> 04:49:16.878 align:start position:0%
the reason that it was discontinued
 
04:49:19.830 --> 04:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
before because it was not strategically
 
04:49:19.840 --> 04:49:22.310 align:start position:0%
before because it was not strategically
prudent

04:49:22.310 --> 04:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
prudent
 
04:49:24.708 --> 04:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
i would be happy to find out that
 
04:49:27.510 --> 04:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
specific information because i was not
 
04:49:30.470 --> 04:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
in this role at that time um so i'd be
 
04:49:32.390 --> 04:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
happy to get back to you if that's okay
 
04:49:34.628 --> 04:49:34.638 align:start position:0%

04:49:36.948 --> 04:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you
 
04:49:39.350 --> 04:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
is there sentiment in the committee for
 
04:49:41.990 --> 04:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
someone to write an amendment changing
 
04:49:43.910 --> 04:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
the two or three little things that we
 
04:49:43.920 --> 04:49:46.550 align:start position:0%
the two or three little things that we
noted

04:49:46.550 --> 04:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:49.030 --> 04:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative kanark
 
04:49:50.948 --> 04:49:50.958 align:start position:0%
yes i'll do that for you
 
04:49:52.788 --> 04:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
i just want to we could take a moment to
 
04:49:54.390 --> 04:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
make sure that i have them both it was
 
04:49:57.270 --> 04:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
the line 13 and the line 24 adding the
 
04:49:59.830 --> 04:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
word state and changing it six months in
 
04:50:01.430 --> 04:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
13. did anybody have anything else
 
04:50:02.868 --> 04:50:02.878 align:start position:0%
please let me know
 
04:50:08.070 --> 04:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:09.430 --> 04:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
particularly representative weber who
 
04:50:12.230 --> 04:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
usually figures everything out oh
 
04:50:15.190 --> 04:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative cushman if i may you also
 
04:50:17.830 --> 04:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
made a remark about the word annual and
 
04:50:19.590 --> 04:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
striking the word annual so that they
 
04:50:22.070 --> 04:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
weren't bound to do it annually if they
 
04:50:25.110 --> 04:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
find that yes it's not may i respond you
 
04:50:28.070 --> 04:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
may respond uh well except as
 
04:50:29.990 --> 04:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
ms hebert pointed out that says annually
 
04:50:31.990 --> 04:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
or as required so there is an escape
 
04:50:33.910 --> 04:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
clause that gives an option
 
04:50:37.510 --> 04:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
um line 24 as well as annually or as
 
04:50:39.990 --> 04:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
required so since it's not a requirement
 
04:50:41.590 --> 04:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
but it's an option it seems like they
 
04:50:43.110 --> 04:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
have the flexibility that they would
 
04:50:43.120 --> 04:50:46.310 align:start position:0%
have the flexibility that they would
need

04:50:46.310 --> 04:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:47.670 --> 04:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
so she said
 
04:50:49.190 --> 04:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
that she had no objection to leaving the
 
04:50:50.788 --> 04:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
word annually in there
 
04:50:56.070 --> 04:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:58.550 --> 04:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
it's always good when's people are happy
 
04:51:00.070 --> 04:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
and it looks like the house committee
 
04:51:00.080 --> 04:51:01.270 align:start position:0%
and it looks like the house committee
services

04:51:01.270 --> 04:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:51:02.470 --> 04:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
are happy
 
04:51:06.070 --> 04:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
to provide a legislative history on this
 
04:51:08.948 --> 04:51:08.958 align:start position:0%
kind of a thing we are asking uh
 
04:51:11.510 --> 04:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
were there such and we want them to be
 
04:51:11.520 --> 04:51:12.550 align:start position:0%
were there such and we want them to be
happy

04:51:12.550 --> 04:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
happy
 
04:51:15.590 --> 04:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
so we will it looks like we will um wait
 
04:51:17.670 --> 04:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
for a couple weeks before we exact this
 
04:51:18.628 --> 04:51:18.638 align:start position:0%
so let's
 
04:51:21.750 --> 04:51:21.760 align:start position:0%

it is good to be back in my old stomping

04:52:06.150 --> 04:52:06.160 align:start position:0%

so
 
04:52:13.430 --> 04:52:13.440 align:start position:0%

04:52:15.430 --> 04:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
district 227 communities up in the
 
04:52:17.670 --> 04:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
central western part of the state

and i am prime sponsor on senate bill
 
04:52:21.990 --> 04:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
439 fn
 
04:52:24.470 --> 04:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh this bill is a result of a long
 
04:52:26.070 --> 04:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
progression of things it began with my
 
04:52:28.150 --> 04:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
wife's tragedy
 
04:52:29.750 --> 04:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
that brought me into contact with the
 
04:52:32.550 --> 04:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
brain and spinal cord injury
 
04:52:34.230 --> 04:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
advisory council
 
04:52:36.788 --> 04:52:36.798 align:start position:0%
uh a very well intended
 
04:52:41.830 --> 04:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:43.910 --> 04:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
we had a number of discussions at their
 
04:52:46.150 --> 04:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
regular meetings and the need arose very
 
04:52:48.628 --> 04:52:48.638 align:start position:0%
clearly to streamline
 
04:52:51.030 --> 04:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
the council because it had too many
 
04:52:53.270 --> 04:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
members they couldn't get a quorum
 
04:52:54.788 --> 04:52:54.798 align:start position:0%
and those types of things that i think
 
04:52:56.628 --> 04:52:56.638 align:start position:0%
you see as well sometimes from time to
 
04:52:56.638 --> 04:52:57.670 align:start position:0%
you see as well sometimes from time to
time

04:52:57.670 --> 04:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:52:59.750 --> 04:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
and so this bill is a result of the
 
04:53:01.430 --> 04:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
consensus of that
 
04:53:01.440 --> 04:53:02.628 align:start position:0%
consensus of that
council

04:53:02.628 --> 04:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
council
 
04:53:02.638 --> 04:53:04.310 align:start position:0%
council
okay

04:53:04.310 --> 04:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:53:06.470 --> 04:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
as to what they would like the or the
 
04:53:08.788 --> 04:53:08.798 align:start position:0%
council to look like going forward
 
04:53:12.470 --> 04:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh it um addresses some things that were
 
04:53:14.550 --> 04:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
if you will again well intended but
 
04:53:14.560 --> 04:53:16.150 align:start position:0%
if you will again well intended but
dysfunctional

04:53:16.150 --> 04:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
dysfunctional
 
04:53:18.310 --> 04:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
takes those out and i'd be happy to
 
04:53:20.390 --> 04:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
answer any of the questions any of those
 
04:53:21.750 --> 04:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
to any of the things in the bill that
 
04:53:22.868 --> 04:53:22.878 align:start position:0%
any of the members of your committee
 
04:53:24.788 --> 04:53:24.798 align:start position:0%
have to
 
04:53:27.110 --> 04:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
to ask again it doesn't establish a
 
04:53:28.788 --> 04:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
committee it just takes and cleans up
 
04:53:30.788 --> 04:53:30.798 align:start position:0%
the bylaws and and
 
04:53:32.708 --> 04:53:32.718 align:start position:0%
of the existing committee
 
04:53:34.230 --> 04:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
i'm pleased to know there's only one
 
04:53:36.470 --> 04:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
house member appointed to this
 
04:53:37.670 --> 04:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
it will be you
 
04:53:38.400 --> 04:53:38.410 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
04:53:38.410 --> 04:53:39.910 align:start position:0%
i know that
[Laughter]

04:53:39.910 --> 04:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:53:42.150 --> 04:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
but i didn't mean that as much as i have
 
04:53:43.990 --> 04:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
to go looking for
 
04:53:46.868 --> 04:53:46.878 align:start position:0%
other members uh representative excuse
 
04:53:48.470 --> 04:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
me senator guida
 
04:53:50.390 --> 04:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
there's a few things now i'm very keen
 
04:53:52.708 --> 04:53:52.718 align:start position:0%
on when i see committees and commissions
 
04:53:55.350 --> 04:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
and councils having spent several months
 
04:53:57.190 --> 04:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
with the education commissioner trying
 
04:53:59.990 --> 04:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
to rescue a law because it was extremely
 
04:54:02.150 --> 04:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
unclear as to how we should go forward
 
04:54:05.910 --> 04:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
so i get appointed to that as a citizen
 
04:54:08.390 --> 04:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
and so now i'm very careful to look i
 
04:54:11.190 --> 04:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
don't see in here
 
04:54:13.670 --> 04:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
and help me i may have missed it
 
04:54:16.230 --> 04:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
who is the convener who calls the first
 
04:54:18.470 --> 04:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
meeting together well mr chairman if i
 
04:54:21.910 --> 04:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
may this council already exists okay
 
04:54:24.390 --> 04:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
so it does the current chair
 
04:54:25.990 --> 04:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh jim pete's
 
04:54:27.830 --> 04:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh an incredible man
 
04:54:30.310 --> 04:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
with an incredible disability that he
 
04:54:31.590 --> 04:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
has managed to overcome i mean
 
04:54:33.430 --> 04:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
incredible is an understatement
 
04:54:36.390 --> 04:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh is the current chair he calls them as
 
04:54:38.230 --> 04:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
it was too obvious why it wasn't there i
 
04:54:39.190 --> 04:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
missed that
 
04:54:41.830 --> 04:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
and also therefore who uh will elect the
 
04:54:43.750 --> 04:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
chair that's already going on the one
 
04:54:45.110 --> 04:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
thing that seems to be missing is
 
04:54:48.310 --> 04:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
mileage for legislators
 
04:54:50.470 --> 04:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
that may already or as far as well again
 
04:54:51.830 --> 04:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
this doesn't establish a committee the
 
04:54:53.590 --> 04:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
led the mileage for legislation that may
 
04:54:55.670 --> 04:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
already be already in there okay
 
04:54:58.550 --> 04:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
yeah just in case yeah any other
 
04:55:03.910 --> 04:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:08.070 --> 04:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
oh yeah representative weber
 
04:55:10.948 --> 04:55:10.958 align:start position:0%
i actually had one but then i think i've
 
04:55:12.948 --> 04:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
read a little more carefully i was going
 
04:55:15.350 --> 04:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
to ask if if the commissioner of health
 
04:55:17.670 --> 04:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
and human services and and the people
 
04:55:19.830 --> 04:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
following him could designate an
 
04:55:22.470 --> 04:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
alternate and i noticed that that is
 
04:55:24.310 --> 04:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
headed by the following persons or their
 
04:55:27.350 --> 04:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
designees so they can which is always
 
04:55:29.350 --> 04:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
one of the issues when we have large
 
04:55:31.590 --> 04:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions there's only
 
04:55:33.590 --> 04:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
so much time that the commissioner can
 
04:55:35.270 --> 04:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
spend in committees and commissions and
 
04:55:37.670 --> 04:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
get the rest of their jobs done so but
 
04:55:39.030 --> 04:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
the designees
 
04:55:40.948 --> 04:55:40.958 align:start position:0%
are already there so that's okay thank
 
04:55:40.958 --> 04:55:45.030 align:start position:0%
are already there so that's okay thank
you

04:55:45.030 --> 04:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:47.590 --> 04:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
representative snow
 
04:55:49.510 --> 04:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
that was the same question okay i was
 
04:55:50.550 --> 04:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
going to ask
 
04:55:53.110 --> 04:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
representative connerk yes i'm
 
04:55:55.190 --> 04:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
hiding over here i had a couple of
 
04:55:56.708 --> 04:55:56.718 align:start position:0%
questions um
 
04:55:59.590 --> 04:55:59.600 align:start position:0%
one was the i did notice the rem and my
 
04:56:01.030 --> 04:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
sorry i had to step out for a moment i
 
04:56:02.868 --> 04:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
might have missed this if you said it
 
04:56:06.230 --> 04:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
on page two line four the chief of
 
04:56:08.310 --> 04:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
speculation special education bureau is
 
04:56:08.320 --> 04:56:09.670 align:start position:0%
speculation special education bureau is
removed

04:56:09.670 --> 04:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
removed
 
04:56:12.708 --> 04:56:12.718 align:start position:0%
um i was curious why that person would
 
04:56:14.390 --> 04:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
be removed since it seems like special
 
04:56:15.990 --> 04:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
education would be an area of quite a
 
04:56:17.510 --> 04:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
big interest in this
 
04:56:18.708 --> 04:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
or is it just because they were never
 
04:56:18.718 --> 04:56:20.230 align:start position:0%
or is it just because they were never
attending

04:56:20.230 --> 04:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
attending
 
04:56:22.310 --> 04:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
that was one the other reason is again
 
04:56:23.910 --> 04:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
this is a council that comes forth with
 
04:56:26.070 --> 04:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations those recommendations
 
04:56:27.830 --> 04:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
will be delivered to department of
 
04:56:29.510 --> 04:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
education health and human services and
 
04:56:31.990 --> 04:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
so forth as as as would be you know as
 
04:56:34.868 --> 04:56:34.878 align:start position:0%
the report would indicate okay follow-up
 
04:56:36.948 --> 04:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
follow-up up another one was i did
 
04:56:38.470 --> 04:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
notice there was also language in here
 
04:56:41.590 --> 04:56:41.600 align:start position:0%
about removing issues about grants and
 
04:56:43.270 --> 04:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
gifts and i was wondering why grants and
 
04:56:45.430 --> 04:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
gifts were being removed i
 
04:56:50.868 --> 04:56:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:55.830 --> 04:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:57.190 --> 04:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
so they were authorized to solicit
 
04:56:58.550 --> 04:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
receive any grants or gifts and that's
 
04:57:00.788 --> 04:57:00.798 align:start position:0%
removed and i was curious why remove
 
04:57:02.628 --> 04:57:02.638 align:start position:0%
that those grants and gifts should go to
 
04:57:05.110 --> 04:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
hhs because the advisory council doesn't
 
04:57:07.350 --> 04:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
have fiduciary authority statutorily
 
04:57:10.470 --> 04:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
okay and one last one one more okay the
 
04:57:12.310 --> 04:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
last one i had was one that actually
 
04:57:13.750 --> 04:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
kind of troubled me the most there was
 
04:57:16.150 --> 04:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
also removal in the duties
 
04:57:19.030 --> 04:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
about issues about prevention
 
04:57:19.040 --> 04:57:20.310 align:start position:0%
about issues about prevention
um

04:57:20.310 --> 04:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:22.230 --> 04:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
that it seemed like we were taking away
 
04:57:23.590 --> 04:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
any work
 
04:57:26.150 --> 04:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
for prevention work
 
04:57:28.788 --> 04:57:28.798 align:start position:0%
and i was curious why that well again
 
04:57:31.270 --> 04:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
the focus of this council is for the
 
04:57:31.280 --> 04:57:32.550 align:start position:0%
the focus of this council is for the
survivors

04:57:32.550 --> 04:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
survivors
 
04:57:34.708 --> 04:57:34.718 align:start position:0%
of brain injury and spinal cord injury
 
04:57:36.788 --> 04:57:36.798 align:start position:0%
it does not look at prevention it looks
 
04:57:39.030 --> 04:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
at programs for example in the last
 
04:57:41.030 --> 04:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
budget we appropriated 200 000 to
 
04:57:43.910 --> 04:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
develop a training center for mildly a
 
04:57:45.990 --> 04:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
brain injured folks down in the central
 
04:57:47.110 --> 04:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
part of the state where one currently
 
04:57:48.868 --> 04:57:48.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist but this is all after the
 
04:57:50.788 --> 04:57:50.798 align:start position:0%
fact of the brain injury uh that's the
 
04:57:52.550 --> 04:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
purpose of the association certainly to
 
04:57:52.560 --> 04:57:53.670 align:start position:0%
purpose of the association certainly to
discuss

04:57:53.670 --> 04:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
04:57:55.110 --> 04:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh you know preventative measures but
 
04:57:57.990 --> 04:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
the focus is is almost completely on how
 
04:57:59.670 --> 04:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
do we now help these folks that have
 
04:58:01.270 --> 04:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
been afflicted
 
04:58:03.590 --> 04:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
if it followed sure
 
04:58:05.910 --> 04:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
was the initial legislative intent
 
04:58:07.910 --> 04:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
though i mean usually the duties are put
 
04:58:09.750 --> 04:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
out put in in the legislative intent to
 
04:58:11.430 --> 04:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
the initial bill
 
04:58:13.510 --> 04:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
was the initial legislative intent for
 
04:58:15.430 --> 04:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
it to be dealing with prevention and it
 
04:58:17.030 --> 04:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
just evolved to the point that it wasn't
 
04:58:18.948 --> 04:58:18.958 align:start position:0%
doing that so might as well get rid of
 
04:58:21.430 --> 04:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
it or was that not the intent
 
04:58:23.750 --> 04:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that was the intent okay
 
04:58:25.510 --> 04:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you again this was formed because
 
04:58:27.030 --> 04:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
people were with brain injuries had
 
04:58:28.788 --> 04:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
nowhere to go right no resources
 
04:58:30.628 --> 04:58:30.638 align:start position:0%
available and so it's managed to work i
 
04:58:32.310 --> 04:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
got to give full credit to steve wade
 
04:58:34.070 --> 04:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
and jim pete steve is the head of the
 
04:58:35.270 --> 04:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
brain injury association of new
 
04:58:35.280 --> 04:58:36.230 align:start position:0%
brain injury association of new
hampshire

04:58:36.230 --> 04:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:58:37.910 --> 04:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
and he has done yeoman's work in
 
04:58:39.910 --> 04:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
coordinating with dhhs and any other of
 
04:58:41.590 --> 04:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
the agencies in getting this bill put
 
04:58:42.868 --> 04:58:42.878 align:start position:0%
together so
 
04:58:44.628 --> 04:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
kudos to him and that organization which
 
04:58:46.470 --> 04:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
is which does incredible work for people
 
04:58:48.628 --> 04:58:48.638 align:start position:0%
that are suffering some pretty terrible
 
04:58:48.638 --> 04:58:51.670 align:start position:0%
that are suffering some pretty terrible
afflictions

04:58:51.670 --> 04:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:54.150 --> 04:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the senator
 
04:58:56.470 --> 04:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
representative cushman thank you mr
 
04:58:58.390 --> 04:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you senator for taking my
 
04:59:00.470 --> 04:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
question um i noticed that this repeals
 
04:59:03.910 --> 04:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
the brain injury registry um can you
 
04:59:06.390 --> 04:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
tell me a little bit about that um
 
04:59:08.390 --> 04:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
how long it existed in statute and was
 
04:59:10.708 --> 04:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
it ever um implemented did it ever get
 
04:59:13.030 --> 04:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
up and running do you know
 
04:59:14.788 --> 04:59:14.798 align:start position:0%
i think part of i don't know the answer
 
04:59:16.390 --> 04:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
to those questions but from my
 
04:59:18.788 --> 04:59:18.798 align:start position:0%
discussions with the council it was
 
04:59:20.868 --> 04:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
basically dysfunctional anyone that has
 
04:59:22.948 --> 04:59:22.958 align:start position:0%
a brain injury
 
04:59:25.190 --> 04:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
is either known already so this is a
 
04:59:26.550 --> 04:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
redone that would have been a redundant
 
04:59:28.070 --> 04:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
thing the brain injury association keeps
 
04:59:30.070 --> 04:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
very close track of people
 
04:59:30.080 --> 04:59:31.190 align:start position:0%
very close track of people
um

04:59:31.190 --> 04:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:33.030 --> 04:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure of the state's resources in
 
04:59:34.948 --> 04:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
that capacity so i'm not enabled i'm not
 
04:59:36.628 --> 04:59:36.638 align:start position:0%
able to answer that
 
04:59:41.910 --> 04:59:41.920 align:start position:0%

05:00:42.868 --> 05:00:42.878 align:start position:0%
and some of the changes to the council
 
05:00:45.190 --> 05:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
so i think one of the major roles of the
 
05:00:46.708 --> 05:00:46.718 align:start position:0%
council over the years has really been
 
05:00:48.628 --> 05:00:48.638 align:start position:0%
to try and identify some of the gaps in
 
05:00:51.030 --> 05:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
services and unmet needs of people
 
05:00:52.868 --> 05:00:52.878 align:start position:0%
living with brain injury which has been
 
05:00:54.708 --> 05:00:54.718 align:start position:0%
very much an underserved population
 
05:00:56.948 --> 05:00:56.958 align:start position:0%
particularly children with brain injury
 
05:00:57.990 --> 05:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
and especially children with
 
05:00:58.000 --> 05:00:59.190 align:start position:0%
and especially children with
co-occurring

05:00:59.190 --> 05:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
co-occurring
 
05:01:01.270 --> 05:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
brain injury and neurobehavioral health
 
05:01:02.470 --> 05:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
issues so
 
05:01:04.150 --> 05:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
um so the council does a lot of work in
 
05:01:05.990 --> 05:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
terms of holding hearings and listening
 
05:01:07.750 --> 05:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
sessions and working with the support
 
05:01:07.760 --> 05:01:08.628 align:start position:0%
sessions and working with the support
groups

05:01:08.628 --> 05:01:08.638 align:start position:0%
groups
 
05:01:11.110 --> 05:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
all as volunteers again trying to gather
 
05:01:13.270 --> 05:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
information for an annual report that
 
05:01:15.750 --> 05:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
goes to the legislature and to the
 
05:01:17.670 --> 05:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
health and human services so
 
05:01:17.680 --> 05:01:18.868 align:start position:0%
health and human services so
um

05:01:18.868 --> 05:01:18.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:20.708 --> 05:01:20.718 align:start position:0%
there were oh actually i also have a
 
05:01:22.948 --> 05:01:22.958 align:start position:0%
letter from jim piatt jim um
 
05:01:25.030 --> 05:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
senator guy to mention that jim is
 
05:01:27.350 --> 05:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
currently the chairman of the uh of the
 
05:01:29.430 --> 05:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
council and um
 
05:01:31.510 --> 05:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh if it's if i if it's okay with you
 
05:01:33.590 --> 05:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
i'd like to read that letter of support
 
05:01:35.910 --> 05:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
it's brief yeah it's very brief actually
 
05:01:37.750 --> 05:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
my name is jim piatt i am the chair of
 
05:01:38.948 --> 05:01:38.958 align:start position:0%
the brain and spinal cord injury
 
05:01:41.190 --> 05:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
advisory council the council has been in
 
05:01:43.670 --> 05:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
existence since 1997 when it was
 
05:01:47.270 --> 05:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
established by statute rsa 137k
 
05:01:48.948 --> 05:01:48.958 align:start position:0%
i'm writing on behalf of the council to
 
05:01:52.230 --> 05:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
ask for your support of sb 439 fn an act
 
05:01:53.670 --> 05:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
relative to the brain and spinal cord
 
05:01:55.190 --> 05:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
injury advisory council and community
 
05:01:57.590 --> 05:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
based brain injury programs our
 
05:01:58.708 --> 05:01:58.718 align:start position:0%
council's been working with senator
 
05:02:00.310 --> 05:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
geider on this proposed legislation that
 
05:02:02.150 --> 05:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
would streamline the council membership
 
05:02:03.430 --> 05:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
and continue our work in a more
 
05:02:04.868 --> 05:02:04.878 align:start position:0%
effective manner if you have any
 
05:02:06.628 --> 05:02:06.638 align:start position:0%
questions please contact me and list his
 
05:02:09.030 --> 05:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
phone number so actually i have copies
 
05:02:09.990 --> 05:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:02:11.190 --> 05:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
letters of support i probably should
 
05:02:13.350 --> 05:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
have given these to someone if i could
 
05:02:16.550 --> 05:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:17.990 --> 05:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
but in terms of answering some of the
 
05:02:19.990 --> 05:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
questions would it be okay if i took a
 
05:02:21.430 --> 05:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
stab at that i know there was a question
 
05:02:24.070 --> 05:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
about the registry um i know when the
 
05:02:26.628 --> 05:02:26.638 align:start position:0%
law was originally a past
 
05:02:28.550 --> 05:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
establishing the council there was talk
 
05:02:30.390 --> 05:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
about actually putting together a brain
 
05:02:32.070 --> 05:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
injury registry modeled after some of
 
05:02:34.070 --> 05:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
the other registries and i know at that
 
05:02:36.150 --> 05:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
time the legislature was concerned about
 
05:02:38.390 --> 05:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
issues of confidentiality and i think
 
05:02:39.990 --> 05:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
the feeling was could we do this without
 
05:02:42.230 --> 05:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
actually having a formal registry and
 
05:02:44.550 --> 05:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
i'm pleased to say that we it has been
 
05:02:46.390 --> 05:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
very successful um
 
05:02:48.390 --> 05:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
health and human services developed a
 
05:02:50.470 --> 05:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
program called the acronym is wisdom i'm
 
05:02:52.390 --> 05:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
not exactly sure what it stands for but
 
05:02:53.990 --> 05:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
one of the major purposes of registries
 
05:02:55.670 --> 05:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
of course is to put together your your
 
05:02:57.830 --> 05:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
your um incidents and prevalence data
 
05:02:59.990 --> 05:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
for the state so the the health and
 
05:03:02.628 --> 05:03:02.638 align:start position:0%
human services does have that data uh
 
05:03:04.788 --> 05:03:04.798 align:start position:0%
and and produces it not on an annual
 
05:03:06.948 --> 05:03:06.958 align:start position:0%
basis but on a somewhat regular basis
 
05:03:08.628 --> 05:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
from hospital discharge data that the
 
05:03:10.310 --> 05:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
state has the other purpose of the
 
05:03:11.910 --> 05:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
registry was to link
 
05:03:13.510 --> 05:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
newly injured folks up with state
 
05:03:15.670 --> 05:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
services and community-based services
 
05:03:18.230 --> 05:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
and health and human services did fund
 
05:03:19.510 --> 05:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
through the bureau of developmental
 
05:03:19.520 --> 05:03:21.190 align:start position:0%
through the bureau of developmental
services

05:03:21.190 --> 05:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:03:22.708 --> 05:03:22.718 align:start position:0%
essentially essentially navigator
 
05:03:24.550 --> 05:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
positions neuro navigator positions to
 
05:03:26.948 --> 05:03:26.958 align:start position:0%
work with folks again post looking at
 
05:03:29.270 --> 05:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
the post acute long term chronic phase
 
05:03:31.030 --> 05:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
of brain injury the hospital your
 
05:03:32.470 --> 05:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
hospitalization is just the start of
 
05:03:35.350 --> 05:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
really oftentimes a long journey so um
 
05:03:37.830 --> 05:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
and that those um those resource
 
05:03:39.990 --> 05:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
navigators work very closely with the
 
05:03:41.590 --> 05:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
all the acute rehab facilities in new
 
05:03:43.430 --> 05:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire and many of the hospitals to
 
05:03:45.270 --> 05:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
work with newly injured families to help
 
05:03:47.270 --> 05:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
them identify services at the community
 
05:03:48.788 --> 05:03:48.798 align:start position:0%
level so essentially although we don't
 
05:03:50.550 --> 05:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
have a formal registry in new hampshire
 
05:03:52.070 --> 05:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
all the functions of a registry are
 
05:03:53.990 --> 05:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
being accomplished
 
05:03:54.000 --> 05:03:55.590 align:start position:0%
being accomplished
so

05:03:55.590 --> 05:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:03:57.270 --> 05:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
and that's probably fairly typical of
 
05:03:59.670 --> 05:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
other states as well
 
05:04:01.670 --> 05:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
particularly our neighboring states
 
05:04:03.750 --> 05:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
so there was one other question besides
 
05:04:05.190 --> 05:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
the registry that someone oh the
 
05:04:08.390 --> 05:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
prevention question i think um so
 
05:04:09.430 --> 05:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of brain injury
 
05:04:11.510 --> 05:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
prevention work being done and it's
 
05:04:12.948 --> 05:04:12.958 align:start position:0%
primarily being done by the injury
 
05:04:15.270 --> 05:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
prevention center up at dartmouth
 
05:04:16.868 --> 05:04:16.878 align:start position:0%
as well as i know health and human
 
05:04:18.788 --> 05:04:18.798 align:start position:0%
services has some injury prevention work
 
05:04:20.390 --> 05:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
as well and then the brain injury
 
05:04:21.910 --> 05:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
association does a lot in terms of
 
05:04:23.910 --> 05:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
injury prevention but the core focus of
 
05:04:25.590 --> 05:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
the council really has been to try to
 
05:04:27.670 --> 05:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
identify unmet needs of folks living
 
05:04:29.270 --> 05:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
with brain injury those who've already
 
05:04:31.510 --> 05:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
sustained an injury so
 
05:04:33.270 --> 05:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
i hope that hope that helps answer a
 
05:04:35.270 --> 05:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
question so i'm happy to answer any
 
05:04:40.708 --> 05:04:40.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:42.948 --> 05:04:42.958 align:start position:0%
representative knurk
 
05:04:44.830 --> 05:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and actually it was not until
 
05:04:47.270 --> 05:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
after doctor
 
05:04:49.510 --> 05:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
sorry doctor got it senator guida uh
 
05:04:51.030 --> 05:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
left the chair that i realized there's
 
05:04:52.470 --> 05:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
still kind of a bit of a follow-up on
 
05:04:54.070 --> 05:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
that chief of the special education he
 
05:04:56.470 --> 05:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
commented that because this particular
 
05:04:58.550 --> 05:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
council comes up with recommendations
 
05:05:00.230 --> 05:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
and especially it would be more of it
 
05:05:02.390 --> 05:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
something that implements it but yet
 
05:05:03.830 --> 05:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
when we come up with a recommendation we
 
05:05:04.470 --> 05:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to come up with a
 
05:05:06.628 --> 05:05:06.638 align:start position:0%
recommendation that can't be implemented
 
05:05:08.230 --> 05:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
is it not helpful to have those who have
 
05:05:10.070 --> 05:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
to implement be at the table to make
 
05:05:11.910 --> 05:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
sure that what we draw up is still
 
05:05:14.070 --> 05:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
effective again i don't know the
 
05:05:16.390 --> 05:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
internal workings of it so if if you who
 
05:05:18.390 --> 05:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
have been there still feel it's better
 
05:05:19.670 --> 05:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
not to have that person i would
 
05:05:22.628 --> 05:05:22.638 align:start position:0%
understand but i just have wondered why
 
05:05:23.990 --> 05:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
it just struck me as funny because it
 
05:05:26.708 --> 05:05:26.718 align:start position:0%
seems like a large role no certainly
 
05:05:28.550 --> 05:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
again brain injury affects children
 
05:05:30.708 --> 05:05:30.718 align:start position:0%
perhaps more so than adults and new
 
05:05:33.350 --> 05:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire actually has a code within
 
05:05:36.470 --> 05:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
the idea for acquired brain disorders it
 
05:05:37.750 --> 05:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
was originally just traumatic brain
 
05:05:38.868 --> 05:05:38.878 align:start position:0%
injury but i think new hampshire was
 
05:05:40.708 --> 05:05:40.718 align:start position:0%
very took a very positive progressive
 
05:05:43.030 --> 05:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
approach and really broadens that coding
 
05:05:44.628 --> 05:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
so children with brain injury are being
 
05:05:47.830 --> 05:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
identified um i think the reason that
 
05:05:49.910 --> 05:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
that particular category was taken out
 
05:05:51.110 --> 05:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
is because there is already
 
05:05:53.430 --> 05:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
representation from the department of ed
 
05:05:56.310 --> 05:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
on the on the council and oftentimes uh
 
05:05:58.070 --> 05:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
folks from uh department of ed will be
 
05:05:59.590 --> 05:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
called in a specialist if there are
 
05:06:01.510 --> 05:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
specific questions but there is always
 
05:06:03.590 --> 05:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
in fact jim piatt himself the chair
 
05:06:05.350 --> 05:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
works for the department of education
 
05:06:08.150 --> 05:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
you know through voc rehab so understood
 
05:06:08.160 --> 05:06:11.910 align:start position:0%
you know through voc rehab so understood
so

05:06:11.910 --> 05:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:14.550 --> 05:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
any further questions

that we should have too much trouble
 
05:06:33.030 --> 05:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
doing that so uh
 
05:06:34.628 --> 05:06:34.638 align:start position:0%

05:07:13.350 --> 05:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
05:07:15.830 --> 05:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i'll i'll try
 
05:07:18.550 --> 05:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
to make a brief i was speaking with a
 
05:07:20.470 --> 05:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
member of the community who
 
05:07:22.390 --> 05:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
is a brain injured person
 
05:07:24.708 --> 05:07:24.718 align:start position:0%
who's dealt with
 
05:07:27.670 --> 05:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
the baa of new hampshire and
 
05:07:30.150 --> 05:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
has been privy to what's going on with
 
05:07:32.788 --> 05:07:32.798 align:start position:0%
this registry for a while and
 
05:07:34.788 --> 05:07:34.798 align:start position:0%
apparently the law was passed in 2000
 
05:07:37.190 --> 05:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
and it never
 
05:07:39.830 --> 05:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
came to be and there were i guess
 
05:07:41.750 --> 05:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
they're basing
 
05:07:43.830 --> 05:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
their surveillance now off of data from
 
05:07:46.830 --> 05:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
wisdom but dhhs
 
05:07:49.590 --> 05:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
has reported that it's not capturing all
 
05:07:50.628 --> 05:07:50.638 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:07:53.190 --> 05:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
um brain injuries and spinal in spinal
 
05:07:55.590 --> 05:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
cord injuries
 
05:07:58.150 --> 05:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
so i i i do support passing this bill
 
05:07:58.160 --> 05:07:59.910 align:start position:0%
so i i i do support passing this bill
today

05:07:59.910 --> 05:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:08:02.310 --> 05:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
and just wanted to state for the record
 
05:08:02.320 --> 05:08:03.190 align:start position:0%
and just wanted to state for the record
that

05:08:03.190 --> 05:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:08:03.200 --> 05:08:04.310 align:start position:0%
that
um

05:08:04.310 --> 05:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:06.948 --> 05:08:06.958 align:start position:0%
that something that was in statute to be
 
05:08:08.788 --> 05:08:08.798 align:start position:0%
done was never done
 
05:08:11.510 --> 05:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
and um there may have been a disservice
 
05:08:12.868 --> 05:08:12.878 align:start position:0%
to some people
 
05:08:14.708 --> 05:08:14.718 align:start position:0%
who did encounter brain injury and were
 
05:08:16.948 --> 05:08:16.958 align:start position:0%
never counted into that system and i
 
05:08:19.110 --> 05:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
hope that perhaps next year someone will
 
05:08:20.788 --> 05:08:20.798 align:start position:0%
bring forward a bill
 
05:08:23.510 --> 05:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
to address that issue
 
05:08:24.788 --> 05:08:24.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:08:27.110 --> 05:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh in my first term
 
05:08:28.868 --> 05:08:28.878 align:start position:0%
i got a phone call and then a couple
 
05:08:30.708 --> 05:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
months later a follow-up phone call from
 
05:08:32.788 --> 05:08:32.798 align:start position:0%
an individual who was serving on this
 
05:08:32.798 --> 05:08:33.910 align:start position:0%
an individual who was serving on this
group

05:08:33.910 --> 05:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
group
 
05:08:36.310 --> 05:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
and had all kinds of
 
05:08:36.320 --> 05:08:37.430 align:start position:0%
and had all kinds of
problems

05:08:37.430 --> 05:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
problems
 
05:08:38.788 --> 05:08:38.798 align:start position:0%
with it
 
05:08:38.798 --> 05:08:39.670 align:start position:0%
with it
and

05:08:39.670 --> 05:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:08:42.550 --> 05:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
he called me a couple of days ago and
 
05:08:45.110 --> 05:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
said that what senator geider has
 
05:08:46.948 --> 05:08:46.958 align:start position:0%
brought forth here
 
05:08:48.708 --> 05:08:48.718 align:start position:0%
uh wonderfully addresses all the
 
05:08:51.830 --> 05:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
concerns that he had as to why the group
 
05:08:53.670 --> 05:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't functioning as well as it could
 
05:08:55.270 --> 05:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
and so on and so forth so that's just a
 
05:09:00.470 --> 05:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
little shout out to the bill anyone else

05:13:29.120 --> 05:13:31.030 align:start position:0%

05:13:36.550 --> 05:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
is this basically something that we sent
 
05:13:38.948 --> 05:13:38.958 align:start position:0%
over to the senate they modified it and
 
05:13:40.230 --> 05:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
sent it back to us we're looking to
 
05:13:40.240 --> 05:13:41.350 align:start position:0%
sent it back to us we're looking to
concur

05:13:41.350 --> 05:13:41.360 align:start position:0%

05:13:49.510 --> 05:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
for committee of conference and although

i don't have to i want to i want to get
 
05:13:53.510 --> 05:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
your advice and guidance and thoughts
 
05:14:12.470 --> 05:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:14.390 --> 05:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
if you look in the right hand column you
 
05:14:17.030 --> 05:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
will see the asterisk picks up and says
 
05:14:22.150 --> 05:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:24.310 --> 05:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
mr chair given given that there isn't a
 
05:14:26.550 --> 05:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
house session between now and next week
 
05:14:29.110 --> 05:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
and given that there's
 
05:14:31.110 --> 05:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
a significant amount of change and
 
05:14:33.350 --> 05:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
i for one am really tired
 
05:14:34.948 --> 05:14:34.958 align:start position:0%
would you like to take this home and
 
05:14:37.430 --> 05:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
think about it could we take it home and
 
05:14:39.670 --> 05:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
look at it and bring it back and
 
05:14:41.750 --> 05:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
think about it and also the big thick
 
05:14:44.390 --> 05:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
one called 503. if you want to do that
 
05:14:46.788 --> 05:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
that is wonderful there's no
 
05:14:50.070 --> 05:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:51.270 --> 05:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:14:51.280 --> 05:14:52.070 align:start position:0%
all right
uh

05:14:52.070 --> 05:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:14:53.510 --> 05:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
before we
 
05:14:56.070 --> 05:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
before we leave this
 
05:14:59.270 --> 05:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
i am even more baffled than usual
 
05:15:02.628 --> 05:15:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:04.230 --> 05:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
if we look in the first grade it says
 
05:15:07.750 --> 05:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
amend rsa 310a
 
05:15:07.760 --> 05:15:09.430 align:start position:0%
amend rsa 310a
310

05:15:09.430 --> 05:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
310
 
05:15:12.470 --> 05:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
as a title is about architects
 
05:15:14.868 --> 05:15:14.878 align:start position:0%
i have some a little bit baffled on why
 
05:15:16.708 --> 05:15:16.718 align:start position:0%
why the architects are doing this
 
05:15:16.718 --> 05:15:17.590 align:start position:0%
why the architects are doing this
um

05:15:17.590 --> 05:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:18.948 --> 05:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if
 
05:15:20.390 --> 05:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
they have a drafting error this
 
05:15:21.670 --> 05:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
remembers the one where i picked up two
 
05:15:23.590 --> 05:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
different statutory reference errors or
 
05:15:25.590 --> 05:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
one was where it should live and by the
 
05:15:26.948 --> 05:15:26.958 align:start position:0%
way i was privy to some of the stuff
 
05:15:28.550 --> 05:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
that was going on there they
 
05:15:31.030 --> 05:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
insurance people had concerns about
 
05:15:32.868 --> 05:15:32.878 align:start position:0%
where we placed it you may recall that
 
05:15:35.190 --> 05:15:35.200 align:start position:0%
there was a concern where she'd reside
 
05:15:37.350 --> 05:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
in statute whether it was dhhs or
 
05:15:40.070 --> 05:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
insurance it got stuck into the 4-1-5
 
05:15:41.190 --> 05:15:41.200 align:start position:0%
they didn't like that so they're going
 
05:15:44.788 --> 05:15:44.798 align:start position:0%
to find a new home but now it says 310
 
05:15:46.550 --> 05:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
which is architects which doesn't not
 
05:15:48.390 --> 05:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
make a lot of sense that's one of the
 
05:15:50.948 --> 05:15:50.958 align:start position:0%
reasons i'm highly baffled
 
05:15:54.070 --> 05:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative leon is looking that
 
05:15:56.390 --> 05:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
up maybe a few well i've looked up 310
 
05:15:57.430 --> 05:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
but i'm trying to i'm going to go back
 
05:15:58.868 --> 05:15:58.878 align:start position:0%
to the bill and see if there's something
 
05:16:00.750 --> 05:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
wrong and what's written here it's in
 
05:16:05.750 --> 05:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
310-a so 310 is architects and 310-a is
 
05:16:07.590 --> 05:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
the office of professional licensure and
 
05:16:09.910 --> 05:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
certification thank you because we like
 
05:16:13.830 --> 05:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
to make things very clear wait a minute

take them home look at them
 
05:16:19.350 --> 05:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
let me know what you think
 
05:16:22.550 --> 05:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh will we have a discussion on it or
 
05:16:24.470 --> 05:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
will it be yes and thank you for picking
 
05:16:26.390 --> 05:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
it up or are we going to actually come
 
05:16:27.670 --> 05:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
back to this and do it together do you
 
05:16:29.030 --> 05:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
want us to individually just let you
 
05:16:31.350 --> 05:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
know what we think sure
 
05:16:36.470 --> 05:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:37.590 --> 05:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
you can
 
05:16:39.190 --> 05:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
if it looks like i'm getting a good
 
05:16:41.350 --> 05:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
consensus coming in from some from
 
05:16:43.430 --> 05:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
everybody then i won't
 
05:16:46.070 --> 05:16:46.080 align:start position:0%

governor's commission on alcohol
 
05:17:41.750 --> 05:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
and other drugs and this bill is one
 
05:17:43.270 --> 05:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
that was worked on
 
05:17:44.628 --> 05:17:44.638 align:start position:0%
with the new hampshire's provider
 
05:17:46.708 --> 05:17:46.718 align:start position:0%

hampshire

05:17:51.990 --> 05:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:17:54.070 --> 05:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
has been much beleaguered by
 
05:17:56.390 --> 05:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
overdose deaths but we've made a lot of
 
05:17:58.150 --> 05:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
progress as well i mean you on this
 
05:17:59.830 --> 05:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
committee know and have done are
 
05:18:01.510 --> 05:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for a lot of progress that
 
05:18:03.590 --> 05:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
we have made
 
05:18:05.350 --> 05:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
i've seen it on the governor's
 
05:18:05.360 --> 05:18:06.550 align:start position:0%
i've seen it on the governor's
commission

05:18:06.550 --> 05:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
commission
 
05:18:08.390 --> 05:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
the recovery community the recovery
 
05:18:10.550 --> 05:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
centers around the state have done
 
05:18:12.390 --> 05:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
really an extraordinary job we've seen
 
05:18:14.550 --> 05:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
governor sununu's leadership with the
 
05:18:16.470 --> 05:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
doorway program
 
05:18:18.470 --> 05:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
so we put a lot of good pieces
 
05:18:20.550 --> 05:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh together there are still a lot of
 
05:18:22.948 --> 05:18:22.958 align:start position:0%
overdose deaths in the state as we know
 
05:18:25.590 --> 05:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
and it does seem by people in this uh
 
05:18:25.600 --> 05:18:26.708 align:start position:0%
and it does seem by people in this uh
area

05:18:26.708 --> 05:18:26.718 align:start position:0%
area
 
05:18:29.110 --> 05:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
that one thing perhaps we could do more
 
05:18:30.390 --> 05:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
on was
 
05:18:32.550 --> 05:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
harm reduction overdose prevention
 
05:18:34.230 --> 05:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
programs that's that's is still
 
05:18:37.030 --> 05:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
something of a missing piece of the
 
05:18:39.190 --> 05:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
puzzle uh you know whether it's drug
 
05:18:41.990 --> 05:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
courts to the doorways or other programs
 
05:18:44.310 --> 05:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
we have found ways to help
 
05:18:46.708 --> 05:18:46.718 align:start position:0%
uh folks who are you know looking for
 
05:18:49.910 --> 05:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
treatment or in re or in recovery uh but
 
05:18:52.150 --> 05:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
if we want to prevent deaths
 
05:18:54.150 --> 05:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
maybe this is something that we should
 
05:18:56.390 --> 05:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
look into
 
05:18:59.350 --> 05:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
so um what it proposes as you'll see a
 
05:19:01.030 --> 05:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
lot of findings and it certainly
 
05:19:03.110 --> 05:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
recognizes the situation that we're in
 
05:19:05.830 --> 05:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
with overdose deaths in the
 
05:19:07.830 --> 05:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
state and
 
05:19:10.628 --> 05:19:10.638 align:start position:0%
what harm reduction overdose prevention
 
05:19:12.070 --> 05:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
programs are
 
05:19:13.510 --> 05:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
discussed here
 
05:19:14.868 --> 05:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
as well
 
05:19:16.868 --> 05:19:16.878 align:start position:0%
that there are 165
 
05:19:19.030 --> 05:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
of these overdose prevention programs
 
05:19:21.430 --> 05:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
operating in 10
 
05:19:24.310 --> 05:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
countries and looking for potential
 
05:19:26.470 --> 05:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
alternatives as well to the legal
 
05:19:29.190 --> 05:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
justice system being the kind of first
 
05:19:29.200 --> 05:19:30.150 align:start position:0%
justice system being the kind of first
stop

05:19:30.150 --> 05:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
stop
 
05:19:30.160 --> 05:19:31.030 align:start position:0%
stop
for

05:19:31.030 --> 05:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:19:33.510 --> 05:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
this issue as well so what the bill
 
05:19:35.270 --> 05:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
intends to do is to have us take a look
 
05:19:37.350 --> 05:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
to have a study for a few months and be
 
05:19:39.590 --> 05:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
able to make some recommendations for
 
05:19:42.150 --> 05:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
legislation now in the senate i will say
 
05:19:43.910 --> 05:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
that we look we've looked at this for
 
05:19:45.910 --> 05:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
the last couple of years and we were in
 
05:19:48.070 --> 05:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
the middle of uh passing a bill a couple
 
05:19:50.628 --> 05:19:50.638 align:start position:0%
years ago covert came along some kind of
 
05:19:52.788 --> 05:19:52.798 align:start position:0%
further you know after
 
05:19:55.590 --> 05:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
a strong support unanimous vote in our
 
05:19:56.868 --> 05:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
our health and her
 
05:19:58.788 --> 05:19:58.798 align:start position:0%
human service committee then decision to
 
05:20:01.270 --> 05:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
take another look at it and so on and in
 
05:20:03.670 --> 05:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
a way that that couple of delays um has
 
05:20:05.830 --> 05:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
been useful because programs have opened
 
05:20:05.840 --> 05:20:06.868 align:start position:0%
been useful because programs have opened
up

05:20:06.868 --> 05:20:06.878 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:20:09.750 --> 05:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
and uh i can just mention that if you
 
05:20:11.830 --> 05:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
look uh do a search for the new york
 
05:20:13.910 --> 05:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
city program that's been open up and
 
05:20:15.430 --> 05:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
operating long enough to have some
 
05:20:17.430 --> 05:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
reporting on it and some statistics on
 
05:20:19.510 --> 05:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
it you can search that you'll find some
 
05:20:21.430 --> 05:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
extensive articles about it in the new
 
05:20:23.430 --> 05:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
york times
 
05:20:25.590 --> 05:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
also since we began talking about it
 
05:20:28.628 --> 05:20:28.638 align:start position:0%
rhode island has passed a pilot program
 
05:20:30.708 --> 05:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
and if you go to medpage today you can
 
05:20:33.030 --> 05:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
find reports on what rhode island is
 
05:20:34.628 --> 05:20:34.638 align:start position:0%
doing and again we'll be getting data
 
05:20:37.430 --> 05:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
from that and massachusetts and
 
05:20:38.948 --> 05:20:38.958 align:start position:0%
philadelphia and some other places
 
05:20:41.030 --> 05:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
around the country are looking as well
 
05:20:43.030 --> 05:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
plus all the um
 
05:20:44.868 --> 05:20:44.878 align:start position:0%
uh foreign countries that have
 
05:20:48.470 --> 05:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
undertaken this um and there is well you
 
05:20:49.990 --> 05:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
know one of the kind of larger
 
05:20:52.070 --> 05:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed studies that looks at 22
 
05:20:53.510 --> 05:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
programs that are
 
05:20:56.070 --> 05:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
reviewed you'll find in the uh
 
05:20:57.910 --> 05:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
journal of preventive medicine so you
 
05:20:59.430 --> 05:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
know the internet's a wonderful thing
 
05:21:01.110 --> 05:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
right so you can go out there and look
 
05:21:02.708 --> 05:21:02.718 align:start position:0%
around and just see what the way the
 
05:21:04.548 --> 05:21:04.558 align:start position:0%
land is and that's the kind of work that
 
05:21:06.948 --> 05:21:06.958 align:start position:0%
i hope this committee can do over the
 
05:21:06.958 --> 05:21:07.990 align:start position:0%
i hope this committee can do over the
next

05:21:07.990 --> 05:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
next
 
05:21:09.830 --> 05:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
few months take a look what's out there
 
05:21:11.510 --> 05:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
now we have some data about how they're
 
05:21:14.150 --> 05:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
done and then see what might work for
 
05:21:16.470 --> 05:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire uh and so that's what the
 
05:21:18.230 --> 05:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
you know the study committees put
 
05:21:19.750 --> 05:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
together and can make some
 
05:21:22.150 --> 05:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations to us and i i do hope
 
05:21:24.548 --> 05:21:24.558 align:start position:0%
that next year we will be ready uh to
 
05:21:26.310 --> 05:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
legislate in this area and see if new
 
05:21:28.310 --> 05:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire is ready to have some uh
 
05:21:29.990 --> 05:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
overdose prevention harm reduction
 
05:21:34.548 --> 05:21:34.558 align:start position:0%
programs um enabled uh as an option for
 
05:21:34.558 --> 05:21:36.230 align:start position:0%
programs um enabled uh as an option for
municipalities

05:21:36.230 --> 05:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
05:21:37.910 --> 05:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
to to take on
 
05:21:39.350 --> 05:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'd be glad to
 
05:21:40.788 --> 05:21:40.798 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
05:21:42.788 --> 05:21:42.798 align:start position:0%
it would seem that from the time it's
 
05:21:45.110 --> 05:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
likely to be signed into law until the
 
05:21:47.350 --> 05:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
report is due on november 1st you might
 
05:21:50.150 --> 05:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
meet two or three times at most
 
05:21:53.430 --> 05:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
so it's not a forever committee it's
 
05:21:55.350 --> 05:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
go in do your job
 
05:21:57.270 --> 05:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
report and that's it thank you mr
 
05:21:58.470 --> 05:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
chairman and i think that's just about
 
05:21:59.990 --> 05:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
right as i said we're now getting a lot
 
05:22:01.990 --> 05:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
of data and i think that this will let
 
05:22:04.548 --> 05:22:04.558 align:start position:0%
people focus and concentrate on what we
 
05:22:04.558 --> 05:22:05.350 align:start position:0%
people focus and concentrate on what we
can

05:22:05.350 --> 05:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
can
 
05:22:07.350 --> 05:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
think might work for new hampshire
 
05:22:08.708 --> 05:22:08.718 align:start position:0%
any questions for the senator
 
05:22:11.110 --> 05:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
05:22:11.120 --> 05:22:19.030 align:start position:0%
representative um
shapiro

05:22:19.030 --> 05:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:20.548 --> 05:22:20.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:22:21.990 --> 05:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:22:22.000 --> 05:22:23.990 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

05:22:23.990 --> 05:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:28.070 --> 05:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that this kind of issue
 
05:22:28.080 --> 05:22:29.750 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that this kind of issue
um

05:22:29.750 --> 05:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:31.670 --> 05:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
the people are very opinionated about
 
05:22:34.070 --> 05:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
this kind of issue that um people tend
 
05:22:36.868 --> 05:22:36.878 align:start position:0%
to have a fixed idea about whether
 
05:22:39.830 --> 05:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
um providing a place for people to come
 
05:22:41.910 --> 05:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
and inject themselves with drugs is a
 
05:22:45.030 --> 05:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
good idea because it prevents overdoses
 
05:22:48.310 --> 05:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
or it's encouraging drug use so
 
05:22:50.470 --> 05:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
given the fact that i am going to get to
 
05:22:52.230 --> 05:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
a question
 
05:22:57.110 --> 05:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:59.990 --> 05:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
an issue that is
 
05:23:01.990 --> 05:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
likely to be contentious
 
05:23:02.000 --> 05:23:03.110 align:start position:0%
likely to be contentious
um

05:23:03.110 --> 05:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:05.990 --> 05:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
and um in my mind
 
05:23:08.470 --> 05:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
might be a very good idea
 
05:23:11.910 --> 05:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
what is the distinction between having a
 
05:23:13.430 --> 05:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
05:23:16.070 --> 05:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
where a few legislators
 
05:23:18.708 --> 05:23:18.718 align:start position:0%
have experts come and testify before
 
05:23:20.788 --> 05:23:20.798 align:start position:0%
them and then write up a report what is
 
05:23:23.430 --> 05:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
the difference between that activity
 
05:23:25.990 --> 05:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
and just proposing a bill where once
 
05:23:26.000 --> 05:23:27.190 align:start position:0%
and just proposing a bill where once
again

05:23:27.190 --> 05:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:23:28.788 --> 05:23:28.798 align:start position:0%
experts will
 
05:23:31.110 --> 05:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
come out of the woodwork to testify in
 
05:23:33.430 --> 05:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
front of a committee about a specific
 
05:23:33.440 --> 05:23:35.270 align:start position:0%
front of a committee about a specific
bill

05:23:35.270 --> 05:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:23:37.510 --> 05:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
given the given the problem with
 
05:23:39.750 --> 05:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
recruiting people to do
 
05:23:41.590 --> 05:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
study committees
 
05:23:44.150 --> 05:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to figure out what are the
 
05:23:45.750 --> 05:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
what's what the real distinction is
 
05:23:47.670 --> 05:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
between those two things
 
05:23:49.350 --> 05:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative for your
 
05:23:51.270 --> 05:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
question and um you really do get kind
 
05:23:53.110 --> 05:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
of the heart of the matter i think we
 
05:23:55.590 --> 05:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
face as legislators all the time there
 
05:23:57.750 --> 05:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
are likely to be strong opinions once a
 
05:23:59.110 --> 05:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
bill emerges
 
05:24:00.230 --> 05:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:24:02.230 --> 05:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
you know we're really really pretty
 
05:24:04.070 --> 05:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
cherry of establishing commissions
 
05:24:06.390 --> 05:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
especially in the second year
 
05:24:08.470 --> 05:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
and i will say just to kind of back up a
 
05:24:10.150 --> 05:24:10.160 align:start position:0%
little bit that i did try to put
 
05:24:11.430 --> 05:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
together a bill
 
05:24:13.670 --> 05:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
originally on this uh three years ago or
 
05:24:15.350 --> 05:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
two two years ago excuse me
 
05:24:18.470 --> 05:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
and um it was based on our uh needle
 
05:24:19.990 --> 05:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
exchange bill had all the same
 
05:24:21.590 --> 05:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
provisions of how you'd set it up what
 
05:24:24.150 --> 05:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
the wrap arounds would be in terms of
 
05:24:26.150 --> 05:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
medical personnel and approvals and it
 
05:24:27.990 --> 05:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
was enabling and so you'd have the law
 
05:24:30.070 --> 05:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement neighbors the municipality
 
05:24:32.150 --> 05:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
agree and and so on that was kind of the
 
05:24:34.390 --> 05:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
model that was there but the issue came
 
05:24:35.830 --> 05:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
up right away about well is this going
 
05:24:37.190 --> 05:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
to cause more crime or is this going to
 
05:24:38.788 --> 05:24:38.798 align:start position:0%
enable more people
 
05:24:40.548 --> 05:24:40.558 align:start position:0%
to do drugs than otherwise would have
 
05:24:42.310 --> 05:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
and would would it help people actually
 
05:24:44.628 --> 05:24:44.638 align:start position:0%
get treatment or get healthy or you know
 
05:24:46.390 --> 05:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
get into recovery so
 
05:24:48.788 --> 05:24:48.798 align:start position:0%
good questions i think what is useful
 
05:24:50.948 --> 05:24:50.958 align:start position:0%
about this is we've got some data now
 
05:24:52.708 --> 05:24:52.718 align:start position:0%
and i think that this study committee
 
05:24:55.670 --> 05:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
will be focusing very carefully on okay
 
05:24:57.110 --> 05:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
given that these issues are likely to
 
05:24:59.350 --> 05:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
come up how do we write a bill and i
 
05:25:01.430 --> 05:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
think a smaller group actually can do
 
05:25:04.868 --> 05:25:04.878 align:start position:0%
that do that more effectively uh and uh
 
05:25:06.948 --> 05:25:06.958 align:start position:0%
you know once something's introduced of
 
05:25:08.470 --> 05:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
course then
 
05:25:10.948 --> 05:25:10.958 align:start position:0%
the fair is open right and what happens
 
05:25:13.190 --> 05:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
happens but i i would hope that we'd be
 
05:25:15.030 --> 05:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
able to provide some very good answers
 
05:25:16.788 --> 05:25:16.798 align:start position:0%
and information through the through the
 
05:25:18.788 --> 05:25:18.798 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
05:25:18.798 --> 05:25:19.670 align:start position:0%
study committee
senator

05:25:19.670 --> 05:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
senator
 
05:25:23.430 --> 05:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
along the way have you identified
 
05:25:25.190 --> 05:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
for me
 
05:25:27.110 --> 05:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
three representatives who are keenly
 
05:25:29.110 --> 05:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
interested in this since i'm the one the
 
05:25:31.510 --> 05:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
speaker's office often asks to go
 
05:25:31.520 --> 05:25:33.670 align:start position:0%
speaker's office often asks to go
recruiting

05:25:33.670 --> 05:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
recruiting
 
05:25:36.230 --> 05:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
along the way as you've studied this and
 
05:25:38.868 --> 05:25:38.878 align:start position:0%
talked it up and so on do you have some
 
05:25:41.670 --> 05:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
people that i could call you and say who
 
05:25:43.270 --> 05:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
would be good on this and you'll give me
 
05:25:44.708 --> 05:25:44.718 align:start position:0%
the answer
 
05:25:47.430 --> 05:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
yes wonderful
 
05:25:48.548 --> 05:25:48.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:25:52.230 --> 05:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:53.910 --> 05:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you so
 
05:25:55.510 --> 05:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
much for being here and for taking my
 
05:25:55.520 --> 05:25:59.270 align:start position:0%
much for being here and for taking my
question

05:25:59.270 --> 05:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:02.150 --> 05:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at line 27 and i was kind of
 
05:26:04.150 --> 05:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
hearing mixed messages
 
05:26:07.350 --> 05:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh it it says it is the intent of the
 
05:26:09.190 --> 05:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
legislature that opps should be
 
05:26:10.548 --> 05:26:10.558 align:start position:0%
evaluated in new hampshire
 
05:26:14.310 --> 05:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities that authorize them are
 
05:26:18.150 --> 05:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
are opps currently authorized at all in
 
05:26:19.910 --> 05:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and are there any
 
05:26:22.070 --> 05:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
operating here at all
 
05:26:23.910 --> 05:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question and i i
 
05:26:26.070 --> 05:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
i agree looking at the line it does
 
05:26:27.350 --> 05:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
create that confusion but the reason
 
05:26:30.150 --> 05:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
it's in there is that let's say
 
05:26:32.310 --> 05:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
that a bill is introduced and it passes
 
05:26:34.150 --> 05:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
this is a signal to this group that
 
05:26:36.708 --> 05:26:36.718 align:start position:0%
would work on this the study committee
 
05:26:39.030 --> 05:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
that you'd better have
 
05:26:40.868 --> 05:26:40.878 align:start position:0%
continuing studies
 
05:26:43.030 --> 05:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
in the legislation for those communities
 
05:26:44.310 --> 05:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
that may
 
05:26:46.628 --> 05:26:46.638 align:start position:0%
adopt adopt this so i think it's partly
 
05:26:48.628 --> 05:26:48.638 align:start position:0%
the verb tenses there
 
05:26:50.150 --> 05:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
but no there are not at this point in
 
05:26:52.070 --> 05:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
time in the state of new hampshire
 
05:26:56.150 --> 05:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:57.910 --> 05:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you taking
 
05:26:59.510 --> 05:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
my question senator
 
05:26:59.520 --> 05:27:00.948 align:start position:0%
my question senator
um

05:27:00.948 --> 05:27:00.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:02.708 --> 05:27:02.718 align:start position:0%
i served on the
 
05:27:04.868 --> 05:27:04.878 align:start position:0%
pharmacy board for 10 years
 
05:27:08.150 --> 05:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
and part of that time was overseeing the
 
05:27:10.548 --> 05:27:10.558 align:start position:0%
prescription drug monitoring program
 
05:27:12.150 --> 05:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
which also deals with the same basic
 
05:27:12.160 --> 05:27:13.190 align:start position:0%
which also deals with the same basic
issue

05:27:13.190 --> 05:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
issue
 
05:27:15.510 --> 05:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
on that advisory council is currently a
 
05:27:16.868 --> 05:27:16.878 align:start position:0%
requirement for two house
 
05:27:19.030 --> 05:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
representatives and one senator
 
05:27:20.868 --> 05:27:20.878 align:start position:0%
um is there any thought about utilizing
 
05:27:20.878 --> 05:27:21.910 align:start position:0%
um is there any thought about utilizing
that

05:27:21.910 --> 05:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:27:21.920 --> 05:27:22.948 align:start position:0%
that
council

05:27:22.948 --> 05:27:22.958 align:start position:0%
council
 
05:27:25.110 --> 05:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
instead of creating another commission
 
05:27:27.190 --> 05:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
is going to the council and having them
 
05:27:28.708 --> 05:27:28.718 align:start position:0%
help you guide through this process
 
05:27:31.430 --> 05:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
because part of their
 
05:27:31.440 --> 05:27:32.708 align:start position:0%
because part of their
requirements

05:27:32.708 --> 05:27:32.718 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
05:27:34.230 --> 05:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
is to
 
05:27:36.310 --> 05:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
look at rulemaking as well as future
 
05:27:38.230 --> 05:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
legislation so my question is have any
 
05:27:39.270 --> 05:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
thought about
 
05:27:40.868 --> 05:27:40.878 align:start position:0%
instead of creating another commission
 
05:27:42.628 --> 05:27:42.638 align:start position:0%
another committee is using what is
 
05:27:44.230 --> 05:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
already in existence dealing with
 
05:27:45.910 --> 05:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
something comparable to the same subject
 
05:27:45.920 --> 05:27:47.270 align:start position:0%
something comparable to the same subject
matter

05:27:47.270 --> 05:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
matter
 
05:27:48.708 --> 05:27:48.718 align:start position:0%
well thanks for the question i have two
 
05:27:51.030 --> 05:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
answers to that i actually think that um
 
05:27:52.868 --> 05:27:52.878 align:start position:0%
you know given the
 
05:27:54.548 --> 05:27:54.558 align:start position:0%
function and purpose of that existing
 
05:27:56.548 --> 05:27:56.558 align:start position:0%
group and thinking that this is going to
 
05:27:59.910 --> 05:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
be done by november 1st 2022 that we
 
05:28:01.350 --> 05:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
might actually be able to get more
 
05:28:03.990 --> 05:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
attention through this vehicle and then
 
05:28:05.910 --> 05:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
secondly i think what's different here
 
05:28:08.390 --> 05:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
is that this
 
05:28:10.948 --> 05:28:10.958 align:start position:0%
is going to involve connections to a lot
 
05:28:13.030 --> 05:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
of groups that you may not deal with so
 
05:28:13.040 --> 05:28:13.830 align:start position:0%
of groups that you may not deal with so
much

05:28:13.830 --> 05:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
much
 
05:28:15.590 --> 05:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
the recovery community
 
05:28:17.510 --> 05:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
recovery centers
 
05:28:19.270 --> 05:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
police departments
 
05:28:20.470 --> 05:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
other law and
 
05:28:23.110 --> 05:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
other law enforcement municipal
 
05:28:25.590 --> 05:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities so i i think it's very
 
05:28:27.590 --> 05:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
very focused but also
 
05:28:27.600 --> 05:28:28.470 align:start position:0%
very focused but also
um

05:28:28.470 --> 05:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:30.070 --> 05:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
you know might be a little more of a
 
05:28:31.830 --> 05:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
stretch for the group that you're
 
05:28:35.110 --> 05:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
05:28:35.120 --> 05:28:36.788 align:start position:0%
referring to
follow-up

05:28:36.788 --> 05:28:36.798 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:28:38.868 --> 05:28:38.878 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for that senator
 
05:28:40.390 --> 05:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
when i looked at the composition of the
 
05:28:41.830 --> 05:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
advisory council many of the people
 
05:28:43.510 --> 05:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
you're talking about are currently on
 
05:28:44.868 --> 05:28:44.878 align:start position:0%
that council
 
05:28:47.030 --> 05:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to do is look at the
 
05:28:48.470 --> 05:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
legislative calendar and saying can we
 
05:28:50.708 --> 05:28:50.718 align:start position:0%
use a vehicle that is up and running
 
05:28:53.110 --> 05:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
today and try to get this done sooner
 
05:28:55.430 --> 05:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
than later i'm not i think the intent of
 
05:28:56.788 --> 05:28:56.798 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to accomplish senator
 
05:28:56.798 --> 05:28:58.150 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to accomplish senator
is

05:28:58.150 --> 05:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:28:59.350 --> 05:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
great i think it's something we have to
 
05:29:01.350 --> 05:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
do because fundamentally what i've seen
 
05:29:03.270 --> 05:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
so far is that when we talked about
 
05:29:05.990 --> 05:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
reducing illicit use of prescription
 
05:29:07.830 --> 05:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
drugs we never talked about the
 
05:29:10.070 --> 05:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
underlying problem which is addiction
 
05:29:11.430 --> 05:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
and what we've done is moved the
 
05:29:13.830 --> 05:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
addiction from a pharmacy to someplace
 
05:29:15.430 --> 05:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
else we never dealt with the issue of
 
05:29:17.270 --> 05:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
addiction with it and i think that would
 
05:29:19.670 --> 05:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
be a good tie-in between what's
 
05:29:21.510 --> 05:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
happening now is working with an
 
05:29:23.270 --> 05:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
existing group made up of physicians
 
05:29:25.590 --> 05:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
police departments the ag's office and
 
05:29:26.708 --> 05:29:26.718 align:start position:0%
so forth
 
05:29:28.708 --> 05:29:28.718 align:start position:0%
to probably try to spearhead your
 
05:29:30.788 --> 05:29:30.798 align:start position:0%
initiative sooner than later
 
05:29:33.110 --> 05:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
well i appreciate that interest there's
 
05:29:34.708 --> 05:29:34.718 align:start position:0%
nothing and i will say representatives
 
05:29:36.150 --> 05:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
nothing to prevent you from doing that
 
05:29:36.160 --> 05:29:37.110 align:start position:0%
nothing to prevent you from doing that
anyways

05:29:37.110 --> 05:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
05:29:38.868 --> 05:29:38.878 align:start position:0%
i think that what is different here from
 
05:29:40.548 --> 05:29:40.558 align:start position:0%
the larger picture of addiction and
 
05:29:42.868 --> 05:29:42.878 align:start position:0%
recovery is that this is focusing on
 
05:29:45.110 --> 05:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
harm reduction uh and overdose
 
05:29:46.948 --> 05:29:46.958 align:start position:0%
prevention programming which is a rather
 
05:29:49.030 --> 05:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
specific initiative that's being
 
05:29:50.628 --> 05:29:50.638 align:start position:0%
undertaken and that's that's what i
 
05:29:53.590 --> 05:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:55.990 --> 05:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
05:29:57.990 --> 05:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and just to
 
05:30:01.110 --> 05:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
piggyback upon the previous question
 
05:30:01.120 --> 05:30:03.270 align:start position:0%
piggyback upon the previous question
um

05:30:03.270 --> 05:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:06.150 --> 05:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
this issue came up i think a year ago
 
05:30:07.510 --> 05:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:30:10.830 --> 05:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
i'm serving on the commission on the new
 
05:30:10.840 --> 05:30:12.628 align:start position:0%
i'm serving on the commission on the new
hampshire

05:30:12.628 --> 05:30:12.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:30:16.150 --> 05:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
drug overdose fatality review commission
 
05:30:18.070 --> 05:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
um and i thought that this was a perfect
 
05:30:20.070 --> 05:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
thing for them to study so i brought it
 
05:30:21.830 --> 05:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
to that commission to say is this
 
05:30:23.830 --> 05:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
something that we could study and would
 
05:30:26.070 --> 05:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
you believe that they just felt like
 
05:30:28.310 --> 05:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
even though it was so close to their
 
05:30:28.320 --> 05:30:29.350 align:start position:0%
even though it was so close to their
mission

05:30:29.350 --> 05:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
mission
 
05:30:31.590 --> 05:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
that they were just overwhelmed with
 
05:30:34.310 --> 05:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
setting up a fatality review commission
 
05:30:35.670 --> 05:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:30:38.628 --> 05:30:38.638 align:start position:0%
were not able to take on another um task
 
05:30:40.788 --> 05:30:40.798 align:start position:0%
like this i don't know if that would
 
05:30:43.510 --> 05:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
apply to the other commission
 
05:30:47.590 --> 05:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:50.548 --> 05:30:50.558 align:start position:0%
representative acton
 
05:30:52.310 --> 05:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh thank you
 
05:30:52.320 --> 05:30:53.430 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh thank you
senator

05:30:53.430 --> 05:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
senator
 
05:30:53.440 --> 05:30:54.628 align:start position:0%
senator
um

05:30:54.628 --> 05:30:54.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:56.070 --> 05:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
just a quick point of information i'm
 
05:30:57.350 --> 05:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
i'm the uh
 
05:30:58.310 --> 05:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
the sole
 
05:31:00.548 --> 05:31:00.558 align:start position:0%
state representative on the um
 
05:31:02.788 --> 05:31:02.798 align:start position:0%
opiate abatement advisory commission we
 
05:31:05.350 --> 05:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
got the bill this morning i've largely
 
05:31:07.030 --> 05:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
stayed out of the money fight but i am
 
05:31:09.430 --> 05:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
very much interested in this type of
 
05:31:11.270 --> 05:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
information so would you believe senator
 
05:31:11.280 --> 05:31:11.990 align:start position:0%
information so would you believe senator
that

05:31:11.990 --> 05:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:31:13.990 --> 05:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
if you do move forward in seating a
 
05:31:15.590 --> 05:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
committee a study committee i would like
 
05:31:17.910 --> 05:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
to volunteer for that or if there
 
05:31:20.470 --> 05:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
happens to be an ad hoc
 
05:31:22.230 --> 05:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
group over the summer to do studies that
 
05:31:24.470 --> 05:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
can be available for that as well okay
 
05:31:26.548 --> 05:31:26.558 align:start position:0%
there's one well uh thank goodness would
 
05:31:28.230 --> 05:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
you believe i'm i'm delighted to hear
 
05:31:28.240 --> 05:31:29.990 align:start position:0%
you believe i'm i'm delighted to hear
that

05:31:29.990 --> 05:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:31:33.350 --> 05:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:35.270 --> 05:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
05:31:37.110 --> 05:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
05:31:39.270 --> 05:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
senator for being here with this bill
 
05:31:41.510 --> 05:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if you also read a
 
05:31:43.830 --> 05:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
relatively troubling investigatory story
 
05:31:46.230 --> 05:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
from nhpr about some issues around some
 
05:31:47.910 --> 05:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
of the recovery houses
 
05:31:49.670 --> 05:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
i'm just hopeful that anything that's
 
05:31:51.670 --> 05:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
going forward with these opps where
 
05:31:53.350 --> 05:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
people will be in in vulnerable
 
05:31:56.628 --> 05:31:56.638 align:start position:0%
situations that any potential for a
 
05:31:59.350 --> 05:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
misuse of trust will also be addressed
 
05:32:01.030 --> 05:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
so would that be true
 
05:32:03.510 --> 05:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and um
 
05:32:05.590 --> 05:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
you know i i
 
05:32:08.548 --> 05:32:08.558 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that story is a tough story
 
05:32:10.150 --> 05:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
i've worked very closely with a lot of
 
05:32:11.510 --> 05:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
the recovery
 
05:32:13.830 --> 05:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
centers in the in the state and i know
 
05:32:15.670 --> 05:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
it's of great concern
 
05:32:17.750 --> 05:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
and um i think any legislation that
 
05:32:19.430 --> 05:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
comes forward is certainly going to have
 
05:32:23.910 --> 05:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:28.150 --> 05:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:30.548 --> 05:32:30.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and because
 
05:32:32.230 --> 05:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
the chairman had this question with
 
05:32:35.510 --> 05:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
respect to another bill
 
05:32:35.520 --> 05:32:36.470 align:start position:0%
respect to another bill
the

05:32:36.470 --> 05:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:32:38.230 --> 05:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the drafting and although
 
05:32:39.990 --> 05:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
it's a senate committee i noticed that
 
05:32:42.470 --> 05:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
the house members are put on first and a
 
05:32:45.270 --> 05:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
member of the senate is put on after
 
05:32:45.280 --> 05:32:46.788 align:start position:0%
member of the senate is put on after
traditionally

05:32:46.788 --> 05:32:46.798 align:start position:0%
traditionally
 
05:32:49.430 --> 05:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
senate committees have been convened by
 
05:32:51.830 --> 05:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
senators and they're usually named first
 
05:32:51.840 --> 05:32:52.788 align:start position:0%
senators and they're usually named first
and

05:32:52.788 --> 05:32:52.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:32:55.110 --> 05:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
senate committees are generally staffed
 
05:32:57.910 --> 05:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
by senate staffers
 
05:32:57.920 --> 05:32:59.590 align:start position:0%
by senate staffers
so

05:32:59.590 --> 05:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:33:02.230 --> 05:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
i just want some assurances because we
 
05:33:04.868 --> 05:33:04.878 align:start position:0%
have had problems in the past with
 
05:33:07.350 --> 05:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh house members being told that they're
 
05:33:09.430 --> 05:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
going to staff senate
 
05:33:11.990 --> 05:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
created committees and i just want to be
 
05:33:13.590 --> 05:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
sure that this
 
05:33:15.750 --> 05:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
is a senate committee with the senate
 
05:33:18.788 --> 05:33:18.798 align:start position:0%
convener and senate staffing because our
 
05:33:18.798 --> 05:33:19.750 align:start position:0%
convener and senate staffing because our
staff

05:33:19.750 --> 05:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
staff
 
05:33:22.390 --> 05:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
is very small relative to the number of
 
05:33:25.510 --> 05:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:28.070 --> 05:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
well indeed it is a senate committee and
 
05:33:29.990 --> 05:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
that would be my um
 
05:33:31.590 --> 05:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative that would be
 
05:33:31.600 --> 05:33:32.390 align:start position:0%
thank you representative that would be
my

05:33:32.390 --> 05:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:33:33.750 --> 05:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
assumption but if you'd like to make
 
05:33:35.670 --> 05:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
that assumption uh
 
05:33:38.628 --> 05:33:38.638 align:start position:0%
even clearer you could say that um you
 
05:33:40.708 --> 05:33:40.718 align:start position:0%
could add that the first meeting was was
 
05:33:43.030 --> 05:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
called by a member of the senate
 
05:33:45.670 --> 05:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
yeah and that would that would make sure
 
05:33:48.548 --> 05:33:48.558 align:start position:0%
yeah the back story to this is i had to
 
05:33:50.150 --> 05:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
spend several months working with a
 
05:33:52.470 --> 05:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner because it was a wonderful
 
05:33:54.830 --> 05:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
bill signed into law
 
05:33:58.548 --> 05:33:58.558 align:start position:0%
but who is bold enough to call the first
 
05:34:00.948 --> 05:34:00.958 align:start position:0%
meeting it wasn't in the bill so i got
 
05:34:03.190 --> 05:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
appointed not as a representative but as
 
05:34:05.350 --> 05:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
a citizen and we all looked in different
 
05:34:07.270 --> 05:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
directions in whistle dixie and we got
 
05:34:10.628 --> 05:34:10.638 align:start position:0%
it going but so i'm keen on some things
 
05:34:12.310 --> 05:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
and thank you and
 
05:34:14.150 --> 05:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
you know i i think that they
 
05:34:16.948 --> 05:34:16.958 align:start position:0%
owe us a boy or boilerplate for
 
05:34:18.310 --> 05:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
for study committees but i think it
 
05:34:20.230 --> 05:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
would be good to specify that the
 
05:34:21.750 --> 05:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
senator calls the first or you could
 
05:34:23.910 --> 05:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
just do it in representative and two
 
05:34:26.310 --> 05:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
others will just show up
 
05:34:28.390 --> 05:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
study club
 
05:34:30.470 --> 05:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
point of order sir line 17 already says
 
05:34:32.150 --> 05:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
the senate the senate member calls the
 
05:34:34.230 --> 05:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
first meeting oh i missed it it's all
 
05:34:35.510 --> 05:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
right it's already in the bill i know
 
05:34:36.708 --> 05:34:36.718 align:start position:0%
i'm not supposed to speak because i've
 
05:34:38.788 --> 05:34:38.798 align:start position:0%
got it
 
05:34:41.350 --> 05:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
yeah line 17 already states this
 
05:34:42.548 --> 05:34:42.558 align:start position:0%
i did too
 
05:34:43.910 --> 05:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm usually keen it's that time of
 
05:34:46.310 --> 05:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
day the eyes are glazing
 
05:34:48.548 --> 05:34:48.558 align:start position:0%
i didn't see it last night either
 
05:34:50.310 --> 05:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else with a question for
 
05:34:52.548 --> 05:34:52.558 align:start position:0%
senator juarez
 
05:34:57.190 --> 05:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:57.200 --> 05:34:59.430 align:start position:0%
 
mike

05:34:59.430 --> 05:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
mike
 
05:35:01.590 --> 05:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
this is a good time for here it is
 
05:35:04.708 --> 05:35:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:07.830 --> 05:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
mr microphone follows it up again
 
05:35:09.750 --> 05:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
a few years ago i was placed on a study
 
05:35:11.750 --> 05:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
committee like this
 
05:35:13.910 --> 05:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
senator and three of us when narcan
 
05:35:15.750 --> 05:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
first came out oh yeah and of course the
 
05:35:17.430 --> 05:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
speculation then was this is just going
 
05:35:19.910 --> 05:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
to increase drug abuse because all these
 
05:35:21.590 --> 05:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
people that are abusing drugs are going
 
05:35:23.190 --> 05:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
to walk around narcan in their pocket
 
05:35:25.030 --> 05:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
and feel like they can do it and
 
05:35:26.868 --> 05:35:26.878 align:start position:0%
interesting the thing that we discovered
 
05:35:28.470 --> 05:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
as we explored where we brought in
 
05:35:31.190 --> 05:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
several people who are regular users
 
05:35:33.590 --> 05:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
and their answer almost unanimously was
 
05:35:35.430 --> 05:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
i thought i had that under control i'd
 
05:35:37.910 --> 05:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
never think of bringing that narcan and
 
05:35:39.590 --> 05:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
that was never anything that ever
 
05:35:41.110 --> 05:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
crossed my mind
 
05:35:41.120 --> 05:35:42.470 align:start position:0%
crossed my mind
and

05:35:42.470 --> 05:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:35:44.470 --> 05:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
i think this and even the ambulance
 
05:35:46.548 --> 05:35:46.558 align:start position:0%
drivers who responded and often the ones
 
05:35:49.190 --> 05:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
that administered it wandering our way
 
05:35:52.070 --> 05:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
to a question mark
 
05:35:55.350 --> 05:35:55.360 align:start position:0%
would you would you i didn't hear you i
 
05:35:55.360 --> 05:35:56.868 align:start position:0%
would you would you i didn't hear you i
apologize

05:35:56.868 --> 05:35:56.878 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
05:35:58.788 --> 05:35:58.798 align:start position:0%
that's but i think and he's shaking his
 
05:36:00.470 --> 05:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
head in such a way that i think he does
 
05:36:03.270 --> 05:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
and i rest my case
 
05:36:09.510 --> 05:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:11.030 --> 05:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
sing no further questions thank you
 
05:36:11.040 --> 05:36:12.470 align:start position:0%
sing no further questions thank you
senator

05:36:12.470 --> 05:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
senator
 
05:36:14.708 --> 05:36:14.718 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes ryan fowler
 
05:36:16.470 --> 05:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire
 
05:36:18.708 --> 05:36:18.718 align:start position:0%
providers association and you can tell
 
05:36:21.590 --> 05:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:23.910 --> 05:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
what is the new hampshire providers
 
05:36:25.830 --> 05:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
association so the new hampshire
 
05:36:27.590 --> 05:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
products association is a membership
 
05:36:29.910 --> 05:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
organization of substance use disorder
 
05:36:29.920 --> 05:36:31.030 align:start position:0%
organization of substance use disorder
uh

05:36:31.030 --> 05:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:36:32.390 --> 05:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
providers in treatment prevention and
 
05:36:33.910 --> 05:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
recovery okay
 
05:36:35.990 --> 05:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
so across the continuum we represent
 
05:36:37.350 --> 05:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
substance use professionals look at that
 
05:36:38.948 --> 05:36:38.958 align:start position:0%
it's right there in the masthead of your

senate bill 234 a few years ago
 
05:37:09.830 --> 05:37:09.840 align:start position:0%

work for jsi as a consultant and advisor
 
05:37:24.708 --> 05:37:24.718 align:start position:0%
and i'm here today in support of senate
 
05:37:27.430 --> 05:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
bill 279 as kind of a pragmatic approach
 
05:37:28.868 --> 05:37:28.878 align:start position:0%
forward with harm reduction in new
 
05:37:28.878 --> 05:37:30.070 align:start position:0%
forward with harm reduction in new
hampshire

05:37:30.070 --> 05:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:37:31.670 --> 05:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
i'm somebody who's alive because of harm
 
05:37:33.350 --> 05:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
reduction i'm a former injection drug
 
05:37:35.030 --> 05:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
user and i've been saved three times by
 
05:37:37.830 --> 05:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
narcan i was provided syringes illegally
 
05:37:39.910 --> 05:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
through my chaotic drug use i ended in
 
05:37:42.948 --> 05:37:42.958 align:start position:0%
2014 and uh i come from a social circle
 
05:37:44.150 --> 05:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
of people who are here because of harm
 
05:37:47.190 --> 05:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
reduction you know harm reduction is a
 
05:37:49.830 --> 05:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
as a strategy is really uh a way to keep
 
05:37:51.510 --> 05:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
people alive because dead people don't
 
05:37:53.830 --> 05:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
enter recovery and really recovery is a
 
05:37:55.750 --> 05:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
natural thing when human needs are met
 
05:37:57.910 --> 05:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
and for me the goal of a harm reduction
 
05:37:59.750 --> 05:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
program is to meet human needs and
 
05:38:01.590 --> 05:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
understand that people are using drugs
 
05:38:03.270 --> 05:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
for no reason like any human behavior
 
05:38:04.948 --> 05:38:04.958 align:start position:0%
serves a purpose including chaotic drug
 
05:38:07.110 --> 05:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
use and what i see working primarily in
 
05:38:08.470 --> 05:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
the claremont and lebanon region of new
 
05:38:09.830 --> 05:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire and on the other side of the
 
05:38:11.350 --> 05:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
river in vermont is that people are
 
05:38:13.110 --> 05:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
meeting their human needs by using drugs
 
05:38:15.350 --> 05:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
in a chaotic way and once we meet them
 
05:38:17.270 --> 05:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
where they're at and empower them and
 
05:38:19.590 --> 05:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
support them recovery is natural and i
 
05:38:21.750 --> 05:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
see a far more recovery oriented
 
05:38:23.910 --> 05:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
pathways than i do chaos i see a lot
 
05:38:25.990 --> 05:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
more success stories and i hear death
 
05:38:28.230 --> 05:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
stories because harm reduction works and
 
05:38:30.150 --> 05:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
what we know is you know syringe
 
05:38:31.910 --> 05:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
programs like the ones that i'm able to
 
05:38:34.948 --> 05:38:34.958 align:start position:0%
operate in my region of new hampshire
 
05:38:36.708 --> 05:38:36.718 align:start position:0%
they're possibly the most studied public
 
05:38:38.708 --> 05:38:38.718 align:start position:0%
health intervention there's 30 plus
 
05:38:39.670 --> 05:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
years of research that show that they're
 
05:38:41.510 --> 05:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
a good idea but there's a lot of gaps in
 
05:38:42.788 --> 05:38:42.798 align:start position:0%
new hampshire there's currently no
 
05:38:44.628 --> 05:38:44.638 align:start position:0%
syringe access in laconia or the north
 
05:38:46.310 --> 05:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
country and there's a
 
05:38:48.470 --> 05:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
there's there is a significant cost
 
05:38:50.150 --> 05:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
savings and return on investment when we
 
05:38:51.670 --> 05:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
look at harm reduction as a way to
 
05:38:54.390 --> 05:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
prevent health care costs death disease
 
05:38:56.708 --> 05:38:56.718 align:start position:0%
transmission and it's just really really
 
05:38:58.230 --> 05:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunate when people's needs aren't
 
05:38:59.830 --> 05:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
met what happens to that chaotic drug
 
05:39:01.350 --> 05:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
use that we see on the headlines time
 
05:39:03.350 --> 05:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
and time again and you know as we look
 
05:39:05.430 --> 05:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
at this as a public health issue we
 
05:39:06.948 --> 05:39:06.958 align:start position:0%
realize that you know prohibition and
 
05:39:08.788 --> 05:39:08.798 align:start position:0%
the war on drugs doesn't work really law
 
05:39:10.868 --> 05:39:10.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement have no no business dealing
 
05:39:12.470 --> 05:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
with a non-violent health issue so what
 
05:39:14.470 --> 05:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
are we going to do when we address this
 
05:39:16.470 --> 05:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
as a public health issue harm reduction
 
05:39:18.070 --> 05:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
is a way to keep people alive and keep
 
05:39:20.628 --> 05:39:20.638 align:start position:0%
people safe and save money and i think
 
05:39:22.150 --> 05:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
that overdose prevention programs like
 
05:39:23.510 --> 05:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
the one in the title of this bill are a
 
05:39:25.190 --> 05:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
great idea but there's an order of
 
05:39:26.708 --> 05:39:26.718 align:start position:0%
operations because harm reduction
 
05:39:28.548 --> 05:39:28.558 align:start position:0%
strategies are on a continuum we heard
 
05:39:30.230 --> 05:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
about narcan or naloxone we've heard
 
05:39:32.470 --> 05:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
about syringe programs there are gaps in
 
05:39:33.510 --> 05:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that i think that we're
 
05:39:35.830 --> 05:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
going to find and if we invest money in
 
05:39:37.590 --> 05:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
a way that supports people and doesn't
 
05:39:39.430 --> 05:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
criminalize them or punish them then the
 
05:39:41.030 --> 05:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
cost savings are really tremendous and
 
05:39:42.310 --> 05:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
it really improves the quality of life
 
05:39:44.070 --> 05:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
for everybody in the community what we
 
05:39:45.350 --> 05:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
see when we empower people and meet
 
05:39:46.708 --> 05:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
their human needs is that people get
 
05:39:49.350 --> 05:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
better and they stop doing crime uh
 
05:39:51.670 --> 05:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
think of this as pre-recovery engagement
 
05:39:53.350 --> 05:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
and really it seems counterintuitive i
 
05:39:54.150 --> 05:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
know it really does seem
 
05:39:55.750 --> 05:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive because we only know
 
05:39:57.270 --> 05:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
punitive responses in the war on drugs
 
05:39:58.708 --> 05:39:58.718 align:start position:0%
we have to punish them but it doesn't
 
05:40:00.310 --> 05:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
work it actually makes the problem a lot
 
05:40:02.948 --> 05:40:02.958 align:start position:0%
worse you know we really need to see
 
05:40:02.958 --> 05:40:03.910 align:start position:0%
worse you know we really need to see
um

05:40:03.910 --> 05:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:05.590 --> 05:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
something better we all need to do
 
05:40:06.788 --> 05:40:06.798 align:start position:0%
something better about the drug problem
 
05:40:08.470 --> 05:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
because putting people in a cage for a
 
05:40:10.390 --> 05:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
health issue isn't an effective strategy
 
05:40:12.788 --> 05:40:12.798 align:start position:0%
for producing trauma-related drug use
 
05:40:15.350 --> 05:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
it's really built on trauma and it's
 
05:40:16.948 --> 05:40:16.958 align:start position:0%
really um
 
05:40:18.390 --> 05:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
that's my spiel you know i really
 
05:40:19.670 --> 05:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
believe in this stuff i've dedicated a
 
05:40:21.910 --> 05:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
lot of my life to it because
 
05:40:24.548 --> 05:40:24.558 align:start position:0%
it works and it's just it's awesome to
 
05:40:26.310 --> 05:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
see but is it working in new hampshire
 
05:40:27.590 --> 05:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
you know there's currently several
 
05:40:29.030 --> 05:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
programs mostly on the southern side of
 
05:40:30.868 --> 05:40:30.878 align:start position:0%
the state you know where is it that we
 
05:40:32.868 --> 05:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
can do better and i think that if we're
 
05:40:33.910 --> 05:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
going to do anything to address this
 
05:40:35.830 --> 05:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
problem harm reduction is the way to go
 
05:40:37.030 --> 05:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
and my hope is that a study committee
 
05:40:39.270 --> 05:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
will demonstrate that and allocate funds
 
05:40:40.948 --> 05:40:40.958 align:start position:0%
accordingly thank you very much
 
05:40:43.990 --> 05:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative webber with a question
 
05:40:47.110 --> 05:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
i just note that your um letter here uh
 
05:40:48.948 --> 05:40:48.958 align:start position:0%
says you're attaching a three-page fax
 
05:40:51.430 --> 05:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
sheet and i didn't see that
 
05:40:53.590 --> 05:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
so i wondered if you would be willing if
 
05:40:55.350 --> 05:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
there is a such a fact sheet to just
 
05:40:57.030 --> 05:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
email it to members of the committee so
 
05:40:58.470 --> 05:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
that we could take a look at it
 
05:41:00.310 --> 05:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you i know that it was
 
05:41:01.670 --> 05:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
emailed to senator waters i can
 
05:41:02.708 --> 05:41:02.718 align:start position:0%
certainly make sure it's forwarded to
 
05:41:03.750 --> 05:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
05:41:05.670 --> 05:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you
 
05:41:08.150 --> 05:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
senator representative nadarapam
 
05:41:10.628 --> 05:41:10.638 align:start position:0%
um i wondered if you could supply your
 
05:41:12.948 --> 05:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
contact information because i have like
 
05:41:14.708 --> 05:41:14.718 align:start position:0%
a ton of questions that i won't take up
 
05:41:16.868 --> 05:41:16.878 align:start position:0%
the committees with time today
 
05:41:18.948 --> 05:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay thank you
 
05:41:22.070 --> 05:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
and any other questions
 
05:41:25.510 --> 05:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you so much and uh
 
05:41:30.470 --> 05:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:33.030 --> 05:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
i tell you
 
05:41:34.868 --> 05:41:34.878 align:start position:0%
they always come back to us
 
05:41:36.708 --> 05:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i almost expected
 
05:41:38.390 --> 05:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
your music after you said that
 
05:41:40.310 --> 05:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
you didn't hear the music
 
05:41:42.150 --> 05:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
never mind
 
05:41:45.030 --> 05:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
um my name is joe hannon um and i'm in
 
05:41:47.750 --> 05:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
support of um the support of this bill
 
05:41:49.910 --> 05:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh a little background i am a person in
 
05:41:51.910 --> 05:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
long term recovery over 30 years myself
 
05:41:53.350 --> 05:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
i was as a representative i was a
 
05:41:55.670 --> 05:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of the naloxone the narcan
 
05:41:57.510 --> 05:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
bill i had a lot of experience getting
 
05:41:59.030 --> 05:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
that through the legislature which i can
 
05:42:00.948 --> 05:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
tell you as you know was not easy
 
05:42:02.708 --> 05:42:02.718 align:start position:0%
because of some of the rumors and
 
05:42:05.030 --> 05:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
misconceptions out there i was also i
 
05:42:06.628 --> 05:42:06.638 align:start position:0%
put in the first syringe exchange
 
05:42:08.230 --> 05:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
legislation when i was in office and
 
05:42:09.990 --> 05:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
then when i was out of office i had uh
 
05:42:11.270 --> 05:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
our good senator here and another
 
05:42:13.110 --> 05:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
senator be the prime sponsors for a new
 
05:42:14.548 --> 05:42:14.558 align:start position:0%
bill which became law and now we have
 
05:42:16.310 --> 05:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
certain service programs throughout most
 
05:42:18.548 --> 05:42:18.558 align:start position:0%
of the state as uh ryan fowler said not
 
05:42:21.590 --> 05:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
enough of it but um we've increased in a
 
05:42:23.430 --> 05:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
very significant rate
 
05:42:23.440 --> 05:42:25.030 align:start position:0%
very significant rate
um

05:42:25.030 --> 05:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:26.628 --> 05:42:26.638 align:start position:0%
one thing that we know and you've heard
 
05:42:28.788 --> 05:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
this before there is over 30 years of
 
05:42:30.150 --> 05:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
data that supports syringe service
 
05:42:31.750 --> 05:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
programs and the effect they've had
 
05:42:33.750 --> 05:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
narcan has been naloxone is a
 
05:42:35.430 --> 05:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
life-saving drug that is absolutely
 
05:42:35.440 --> 05:42:36.310 align:start position:0%
life-saving drug that is absolutely
vital

05:42:36.310 --> 05:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
vital
 
05:42:37.750 --> 05:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
and is the only thing that can actually
 
05:42:39.430 --> 05:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
stop someone from overdosing when they
 
05:42:41.670 --> 05:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
are overdosing from an opioid
 
05:42:41.680 --> 05:42:42.470 align:start position:0%
are overdosing from an opioid
um

05:42:42.470 --> 05:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:43.990 --> 05:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
you know we've heard one person already
 
05:42:45.510 --> 05:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
here today say that they've been revived
 
05:42:47.830 --> 05:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
three times um one of the negative
 
05:42:49.430 --> 05:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
things you usually hear is people say oh
 
05:42:52.070 --> 05:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
you know we this person was narcan 15
 
05:42:52.080 --> 05:42:53.190 align:start position:0%
you know we this person was narcan 15
times

05:42:53.190 --> 05:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
times
 
05:42:56.070 --> 05:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
and you know why are we doing it again
 
05:42:57.110 --> 05:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
people like
 
05:42:58.628 --> 05:42:58.638 align:start position:0%
the person behind me and other people i
 
05:43:00.070 --> 05:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
know friends of mine are here today
 
05:43:03.110 --> 05:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
because we didn't give up on someone
 
05:43:03.120 --> 05:43:04.310 align:start position:0%
because we didn't give up on someone
um

05:43:04.310 --> 05:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:05.910 --> 05:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
when pushing for the syringe exchange
 
05:43:07.830 --> 05:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
legislation i would talk to i talked to
 
05:43:09.510 --> 05:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
everybody if anyone was here when i did
 
05:43:11.350 --> 05:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
that you probably were sick of seeing me
 
05:43:11.360 --> 05:43:12.070 align:start position:0%
that you probably were sick of seeing me
but

05:43:12.070 --> 05:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:43:14.948 --> 05:43:14.958 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that i he's not thank you
 
05:43:18.390 --> 05:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
um i i didn't start the conversation
 
05:43:19.510 --> 05:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
with people who aren't familiar with
 
05:43:21.190 --> 05:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
what syringe exchanges and other harm
 
05:43:23.590 --> 05:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
reduction programs did by saying oh look
 
05:43:25.350 --> 05:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
we're gonna help people who use drugs to
 
05:43:26.708 --> 05:43:26.718 align:start position:0%
do it safely they're looking at me like
 
05:43:28.390 --> 05:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
i'm crazy
 
05:43:29.910 --> 05:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
but if i said look we've got this great
 
05:43:32.548 --> 05:43:32.558 align:start position:0%
program that can is proven to save lives
 
05:43:35.830 --> 05:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
and prevent infections hiv hepatitis c
 
05:43:37.110 --> 05:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
prevent uh
 
05:43:39.030 --> 05:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
you know the negative consequences of
 
05:43:41.510 --> 05:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
all those actions and also as a way to
 
05:43:43.670 --> 05:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
get people to have greater access to
 
05:43:45.670 --> 05:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
recovery services and to help that they
 
05:43:47.270 --> 05:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
need other medical services that they
 
05:43:48.868 --> 05:43:48.878 align:start position:0%
they need and don't usually have that
 
05:43:50.868 --> 05:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
gateway to because they're afraid to go
 
05:43:52.310 --> 05:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
to hospitals because the way they're
 
05:43:55.190 --> 05:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
treated they are usually uh and you know
 
05:43:56.708 --> 05:43:56.718 align:start position:0%
though we do have some programs in the
 
05:43:58.788 --> 05:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
in the penal system in the state
 
05:44:00.390 --> 05:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
they are not enough
 
05:44:02.868 --> 05:44:02.878 align:start position:0%
and they don't generally uh
 
05:44:04.310 --> 05:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
get all the people that we need to have
 
05:44:06.150 --> 05:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
treated many people are in jail because
 
05:44:07.990 --> 05:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
of substance use and other mental health
 
05:44:10.628 --> 05:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
issues and it's not the priority of the
 
05:44:12.948 --> 05:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
penal system to get people
 
05:44:14.310 --> 05:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
physically better into recovery even
 
05:44:15.830 --> 05:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
though we have to provide treatment by
 
05:44:18.390 --> 05:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
law that's not generally what happens
 
05:44:21.110 --> 05:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
um you know we we've i don't want to get
 
05:44:22.470 --> 05:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
too uh
 
05:44:24.708 --> 05:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
grandiose here but like we've i heard
 
05:44:26.628 --> 05:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
one person say you know do we have any
 
05:44:28.070 --> 05:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
opioid prevention programs in new
 
05:44:30.230 --> 05:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire and the answer is obviously no
 
05:44:31.670 --> 05:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
there are very few in the united states
 
05:44:34.548 --> 05:44:34.558 align:start position:0%
one recently opened up in new york city
 
05:44:37.350 --> 05:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
we've got 100 over 160 some programs
 
05:44:39.670 --> 05:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
around the world and one they all have
 
05:44:41.910 --> 05:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
one thing in common no one has ever died
 
05:44:43.590 --> 05:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
of an overdose in any of those
 
05:44:45.350 --> 05:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
facilities we've had over a hundred
 
05:44:46.628 --> 05:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
thousand people overdose in united
 
05:44:48.868 --> 05:44:48.878 align:start position:0%
states in the last year and about almost
 
05:44:50.548 --> 05:44:50.558 align:start position:0%
around two thirds of those died from an
 
05:44:52.230 --> 05:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
opioid overdose
 
05:44:54.548 --> 05:44:54.558 align:start position:0%
that number is not going down any law we
 
05:44:56.390 --> 05:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
put in to increase penalties and arrest
 
05:44:57.910 --> 05:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
people and try to take the drugs off the
 
05:44:59.750 --> 05:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
street is not working drugs are stronger
 
05:45:01.910 --> 05:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
cheaper and more potent and more people
 
05:45:04.390 --> 05:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
are dying if we went to the state uh
 
05:45:06.390 --> 05:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
stores and tried to buy a six-pack of
 
05:45:08.548 --> 05:45:08.558 align:start position:0%
beer and one of out of those six beers
 
05:45:09.990 --> 05:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
was a different concentration the beer
 
05:45:11.990 --> 05:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
could probably kill you we'd all be kind
 
05:45:13.430 --> 05:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
of nervous
 
05:45:14.310 --> 05:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:45:14.320 --> 05:45:15.350 align:start position:0%
you know
um

05:45:15.350 --> 05:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:16.548 --> 05:45:16.558 align:start position:0%
but back to the question do we have
 
05:45:18.548 --> 05:45:18.558 align:start position:0%
opioid overdose prevention
 
05:45:20.548 --> 05:45:20.558 align:start position:0%
centers in new hampshire sort of we have
 
05:45:20.558 --> 05:45:21.590 align:start position:0%
centers in new hampshire sort of we have
bars

05:45:21.590 --> 05:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
bars
 
05:45:23.830 --> 05:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
you know you go to a bar the bartender
 
05:45:24.868 --> 05:45:24.878 align:start position:0%
cuts you off if you look like you're
 
05:45:25.910 --> 05:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
getting too
 
05:45:27.910 --> 05:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
inebriated someone might call you a ride
 
05:45:30.150 --> 05:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
there's someone watching you most people
 
05:45:31.830 --> 05:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
that overdose
 
05:45:34.470 --> 05:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
overdose in the presence of someone else
 
05:45:35.830 --> 05:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
most people that are found dead from an
 
05:45:38.470 --> 05:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
overdose are found alone
 
05:45:39.590 --> 05:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
and that's why we pass the good
 
05:45:41.110 --> 05:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
samaritan law which allows people to
 
05:45:42.628 --> 05:45:42.638 align:start position:0%
call during an overdose and that does
 
05:45:44.628 --> 05:45:44.638 align:start position:0%
prevent that we don't have hard data on
 
05:45:46.070 --> 05:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
it because we are a small state but we
 
05:45:47.670 --> 05:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
do know that that is one thing that gets
 
05:45:49.030 --> 05:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
people to get
 
05:45:50.390 --> 05:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
the help that they need
 
05:45:52.390 --> 05:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
uh we've heard i heard many stories from
 
05:45:54.548 --> 05:45:54.558 align:start position:0%
paramedics and i that i know personally
 
05:45:56.868 --> 05:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
and my wife has worked with his doctor
 
05:45:58.868 --> 05:45:58.878 align:start position:0%
that people would be found in the shower
 
05:46:00.230 --> 05:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
when they get called for an overdose
 
05:46:01.110 --> 05:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
because they thought maybe the cold
 
05:46:02.390 --> 05:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
water wake them up and they find out how
 
05:46:04.230 --> 05:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
long they've been there 20 minutes they
 
05:46:05.590 --> 05:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
might already be dead by then or have
 
05:46:07.110 --> 05:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
brain damage
 
05:46:09.350 --> 05:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
places where someone can go and get the
 
05:46:12.070 --> 05:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
help get the supervision they need can
 
05:46:13.590 --> 05:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
save their lives
 
05:46:15.030 --> 05:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
you know and i
 
05:46:17.110 --> 05:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
the the last thing i'll say is you know
 
05:46:18.948 --> 05:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
on the way over thinking about this i
 
05:46:20.150 --> 05:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
was thinking about the the parable the
 
05:46:21.430 --> 05:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
good samaritan don't worry this isn't a
 
05:46:23.270 --> 05:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
religious lecture just
 
05:46:23.280 --> 05:46:24.230 align:start position:0%
religious lecture just
the

05:46:24.230 --> 05:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:46:26.150 --> 05:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
the first person was that came upon him
 
05:46:28.628 --> 05:46:28.638 align:start position:0%
just walked past the second person same
 
05:46:30.070 --> 05:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
thing the third person actually helped
 
05:46:31.750 --> 05:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
bandage the wounds and take care of that
 
05:46:33.830 --> 05:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
person i think we're all called to be
 
05:46:35.990 --> 05:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
that that good samaritan and this is a
 
05:46:37.750 --> 05:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
great first step to starting that
 
05:46:40.470 --> 05:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
process and to do it right by not just
 
05:46:41.590 --> 05:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
leaving it to all the people that are
 
05:46:43.030 --> 05:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
studying it i'm on the opioid task force
 
05:46:44.470 --> 05:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
and lots of other meeting groups and
 
05:46:44.480 --> 05:46:45.830 align:start position:0%
and lots of other meeting groups and
commissions

05:46:45.830 --> 05:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
05:46:47.430 --> 05:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
people are looking at this but we need
 
05:46:49.270 --> 05:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
legislators to look at it to start the
 
05:46:51.190 --> 05:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
process of getting you and everyone in
 
05:46:53.350 --> 05:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
this building across the street to start
 
05:46:55.030 --> 05:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
seriously contemplating how it's going
 
05:46:56.868 --> 05:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
to work we know it works
 
05:46:58.150 --> 05:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
we have to start thinking about how
 
05:46:59.590 --> 05:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it and i think this is
 
05:47:02.230 --> 05:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
the best first step to start and i'd be
 
05:47:03.510 --> 05:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions and thank
 
05:47:04.868 --> 05:47:04.878 align:start position:0%
you for your time thank you
 
05:47:07.510 --> 05:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative any questions
 
05:47:10.150 --> 05:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
representative soloway
 
05:47:12.830 --> 05:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:47:15.910 --> 05:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative i haven't
 
05:47:17.190 --> 05:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
seen you in a while it's been at least
 
05:47:19.190 --> 05:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
48 hours i know
 
05:47:21.510 --> 05:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
um can you describe any programs that
 
05:47:24.868 --> 05:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
may exist or have existed in the dover
 
05:47:26.470 --> 05:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
and rochester area that have been
 
05:47:26.480 --> 05:47:28.150 align:start position:0%
and rochester area that have been
effective

05:47:28.150 --> 05:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
effective
 
05:47:30.070 --> 05:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
but you should mention that yeah um not
 
05:47:30.080 --> 05:47:31.670 align:start position:0%
but you should mention that yeah um not
just

05:47:31.670 --> 05:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:47:32.948 --> 05:47:32.958 align:start position:0%
we didn't talk about this at breakfast
 
05:47:34.868 --> 05:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
the other day um
 
05:47:37.030 --> 05:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
the um we have syringe service programs
 
05:47:39.270 --> 05:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
in rochester dover somersworth uh
 
05:47:40.948 --> 05:47:40.958 align:start position:0%
there's there are programs now in
 
05:47:42.310 --> 05:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
concord that has been started in the
 
05:47:44.230 --> 05:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
last year we have a service program in
 
05:47:46.868 --> 05:47:46.878 align:start position:0%
manchester they're also in uh the south
 
05:47:48.150 --> 05:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state and west's
 
05:47:49.750 --> 05:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
part of the state claremont
 
05:47:51.030 --> 05:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
we don't have a lot in laconia in the
 
05:47:52.470 --> 05:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
north country like you heard but there
 
05:47:55.350 --> 05:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
are programs in manchester when we
 
05:47:56.868 --> 05:47:56.878 align:start position:0%
started doing the sermon service program
 
05:47:56.878 --> 05:47:57.910 align:start position:0%
started doing the sermon service program
there

05:47:57.910 --> 05:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:47:59.350 --> 05:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
the first
 
05:48:01.030 --> 05:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
i think the first big month that we we
 
05:48:02.470 --> 05:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
started in april or march i think i
 
05:48:04.070 --> 05:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
forget the exact month but
 
05:48:07.030 --> 05:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh a year later in may we gave out 500
 
05:48:09.270 --> 05:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
kids of naloxone to people on the street
 
05:48:11.270 --> 05:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
and many of them had report we keep an
 
05:48:13.030 --> 05:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
eye we ask people you know we find out
 
05:48:15.110 --> 05:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
how many syringes they give give us
 
05:48:16.390 --> 05:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
guess we get how many we get back we
 
05:48:18.310 --> 05:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
write it all down how many referrals we
 
05:48:20.070 --> 05:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
make and another thing we ask people is
 
05:48:20.080 --> 05:48:21.110 align:start position:0%
make and another thing we ask people is
um

05:48:21.110 --> 05:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:22.390 --> 05:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
if you know have you reversed any
 
05:48:23.670 --> 05:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
overdoses since the last time you were
 
05:48:23.680 --> 05:48:24.628 align:start position:0%
overdoses since the last time you were
here

05:48:24.628 --> 05:48:24.638 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:48:26.230 --> 05:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
in the first year and a half that that
 
05:48:27.750 --> 05:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
program was in manchester our
 
05:48:29.750 --> 05:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
participants reported over 3 000
 
05:48:31.750 --> 05:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
overdoses were reversed that was more
 
05:48:33.270 --> 05:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
than all the hospitals and paramedics in
 
05:48:35.190 --> 05:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
the city combined not putting them down
 
05:48:36.868 --> 05:48:36.878 align:start position:0%
at all they do a great job
 
05:48:38.310 --> 05:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
but one thing we've seen in the data
 
05:48:40.868 --> 05:48:40.878 align:start position:0%
from the state is
 
05:48:42.230 --> 05:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
people even when paramedics are
 
05:48:44.070 --> 05:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
responding to an overdose it is becoming
 
05:48:45.510 --> 05:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
increasingly more common for them to
 
05:48:46.948 --> 05:48:46.958 align:start position:0%
show up and someone has already received
 
05:48:48.788 --> 05:48:48.798 align:start position:0%
narcan and is maybe already breathing
 
05:48:51.190 --> 05:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
that is key so it's not just a matter of
 
05:48:52.628 --> 05:48:52.638 align:start position:0%
making a phone call and sending someone
 
05:48:54.628 --> 05:48:54.638 align:start position:0%
out to save a life we can have a program
 
05:48:56.708 --> 05:48:56.718 align:start position:0%
where someone can be there and it's
 
05:48:58.390 --> 05:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
almost instantaneous
 
05:49:00.948 --> 05:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
um this is basically making it making
 
05:49:02.390 --> 05:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
our job easier
 
05:49:03.990 --> 05:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
most people that are using drugs
 
05:49:06.070 --> 05:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
chaotically illicit substances on the
 
05:49:07.910 --> 05:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
street are doing so
 
05:49:09.350 --> 05:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
secretively they're trying to hide they
 
05:49:10.868 --> 05:49:10.878 align:start position:0%
don't want to get caught they're doing
 
05:49:13.030 --> 05:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
it as quickly as they can in a place
 
05:49:14.628 --> 05:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
that may not be you know it may be in
 
05:49:16.070 --> 05:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
public it may be
 
05:49:17.430 --> 05:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
you know and it can create a public
 
05:49:17.440 --> 05:49:18.390 align:start position:0%
you know and it can create a public
health

05:49:18.390 --> 05:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
health
 
05:49:20.230 --> 05:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
risk when people are doing that not that
 
05:49:21.750 --> 05:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
they're leaving syringes around more
 
05:49:23.190 --> 05:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
more often they're actually less likely
 
05:49:24.628 --> 05:49:24.638 align:start position:0%
to leave them around because of syringe
 
05:49:24.638 --> 05:49:25.750 align:start position:0%
to leave them around because of syringe
programs

05:49:25.750 --> 05:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
programs
 
05:49:27.990 --> 05:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
but when someone is rushing and if
 
05:49:29.990 --> 05:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
someone is not doing it in a clean
 
05:49:31.830 --> 05:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
sanitary manner they're more likely to
 
05:49:32.868 --> 05:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
get infections they're more likely to
 
05:49:33.990 --> 05:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
overdose and die because they're doing
 
05:49:35.830 --> 05:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
it very quickly when we teach people
 
05:49:37.350 --> 05:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
that i when i we give out syringes to
 
05:49:39.830 --> 05:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
people that are using iv substances we
 
05:49:42.548 --> 05:49:42.558 align:start position:0%
teach them how to inject properly and
 
05:49:43.830 --> 05:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
again some people might think oh you're
 
05:49:45.910 --> 05:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
encouraging drug use you're you know
 
05:49:47.110 --> 05:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
enabling it
 
05:49:49.430 --> 05:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
we're only enabling people to not die
 
05:49:51.990 --> 05:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
and not get sick or injured that's it
 
05:49:53.270 --> 05:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
they're doing it anyway they were doing
 
05:49:54.868 --> 05:49:54.878 align:start position:0%
it before we came along and they're
 
05:49:56.310 --> 05:49:56.320 align:start position:0%
probably going to do it if this program
 
05:49:58.230 --> 05:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
if all these programs go away but
 
05:50:00.390 --> 05:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
the sicknesses will still be there in
 
05:50:03.510 --> 05:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
higher numbers um the overdose numbers
 
05:50:05.190 --> 05:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
that we've seen in this cut this state i
 
05:50:06.548 --> 05:50:06.558 align:start position:0%
can't remember the exact number but it
 
05:50:08.230 --> 05:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
was the year two years ago a year and a
 
05:50:10.390 --> 05:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
half ago the very beginning of covid
 
05:50:12.390 --> 05:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh overdose rates around the country had
 
05:50:13.830 --> 05:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
increased drastically in just about
 
05:50:15.110 --> 05:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
every state there were only i think two
 
05:50:16.230 --> 05:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
states that they decreased in new
 
05:50:17.830 --> 05:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire was one of them and that was
 
05:50:19.510 --> 05:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
the year that we had a vast amount of
 
05:50:21.030 --> 05:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
syringe service programs flooding the
 
05:50:23.110 --> 05:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
areas with naloxone to not just
 
05:50:25.190 --> 05:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
everybody but the end user the person
 
05:50:26.948 --> 05:50:26.958 align:start position:0%
who was more likely to be around someone
 
05:50:28.830 --> 05:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
that was going to see someone
 
05:50:31.030 --> 05:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
overdosing and representative thank you
 
05:50:32.070 --> 05:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
so much
 
05:50:34.548 --> 05:50:34.558 align:start position:0%
for some other yeah because we the title
 
05:50:36.150 --> 05:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
of the bill is do we establish a study
 
05:50:37.350 --> 05:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
committee i thought we were doing it
 
05:50:38.548 --> 05:50:38.558 align:start position:0%
studying it now
 
05:50:40.150 --> 05:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
no yeah
 
05:50:42.070 --> 05:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
we have an executive bill yeah all right
 
05:50:44.628 --> 05:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
i'll wait all right
 
05:50:46.230 --> 05:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
i really have missed you you know that
 
05:50:48.470 --> 05:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
come back again don't be strange
 
05:50:52.470 --> 05:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:54.788 --> 05:50:54.798 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea okay
 
05:50:59.750 --> 05:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:01.430 --> 05:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
this concludes the
 
05:51:04.470 --> 05:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh hearing on senate bill 279.
 
05:51:07.510 --> 05:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
wonder if we're ready to go to an exec
 
05:51:10.628 --> 05:51:10.638 align:start position:0%
session or do you want to ponder it for
 
05:51:13.430 --> 05:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:51:15.670 --> 05:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh ponder it for a while what is what's
 
05:51:17.190 --> 05:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
your pleasure
 
05:51:18.310 --> 05:51:18.320 align:start position:0%

bill uh 279 the chair will
 
05:51:38.948 --> 05:51:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:40.948 --> 05:51:40.958 align:start position:0%
representative nada upham
 
05:51:40.958 --> 05:51:42.070 align:start position:0%
representative nada upham
again

05:51:42.070 --> 05:51:42.080 align:start position:0%

05:51:44.868 --> 05:51:44.878 align:start position:0%
um i move we ought to pass
 
05:51:44.878 --> 05:51:50.548 align:start position:0%
um i move we ought to pass
otp

05:51:50.548 --> 05:51:50.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:53.670 --> 05:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
and who is that dr soloway dr soloway i
 
05:51:58.948 --> 05:51:58.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:03.670 --> 05:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:08.310 --> 05:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:10.548 --> 05:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be a question now this
 
05:52:13.830 --> 05:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
is executing representative merchant
 
05:52:16.788 --> 05:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
05:52:18.628 --> 05:52:18.638 align:start position:0%
like yourself i think we have a lot of
 
05:52:20.470 --> 05:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
study committees and commissions and so
 
05:52:22.788 --> 05:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
forth we have a hard time to fill them
 
05:52:24.310 --> 05:52:24.320 align:start position:0%
however given the gravity of the
 
05:52:24.320 --> 05:52:25.590 align:start position:0%
however given the gravity of the
situation

05:52:25.590 --> 05:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
situation
 
05:52:27.030 --> 05:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
i think we need to find a solution
 
05:52:29.270 --> 05:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
because i mentioned before
 
05:52:30.868 --> 05:52:30.878 align:start position:0%
on the prescription drug monitoring
 
05:52:32.948 --> 05:52:32.958 align:start position:0%
program we've done a phenomenal job in
 
05:52:34.708 --> 05:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
reducing the number of
 
05:52:36.470 --> 05:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
illicit prescriptions or prescription
 
05:52:38.788 --> 05:52:38.798 align:start position:0%
drugs being used illicitly
 
05:52:40.548 --> 05:52:40.558 align:start position:0%
unfortunately did not tackle the
 
05:52:42.548 --> 05:52:42.558 align:start position:0%
underlying problem which is addiction
 
05:52:44.310 --> 05:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
and i think we need to find some way to
 
05:52:46.628 --> 05:52:46.638 align:start position:0%
start looking at that seriously and find
 
05:52:48.788 --> 05:52:48.798 align:start position:0%
some solutions to it
 
05:52:51.110 --> 05:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
to me the idea well there's two things
 
05:52:53.110 --> 05:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
the idea that uh
 
05:52:55.110 --> 05:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
once this is signed into law it's got to
 
05:52:57.190 --> 05:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
do a lot of work and be done by november
 
05:52:59.990 --> 05:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
1st sounds to me like it's just a prep
 
05:53:00.000 --> 05:53:00.868 align:start position:0%
1st sounds to me like it's just a prep
group

05:53:00.868 --> 05:53:00.878 align:start position:0%
group
 
05:53:02.470 --> 05:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
for bill writing
 
05:53:04.310 --> 05:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
and number two since the senators
 
05:53:06.708 --> 05:53:06.718 align:start position:0%
promised me he will get the people to
 
05:53:08.070 --> 05:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
fill the slots
 
05:53:10.310 --> 05:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
i'm very happy so just a couple of
 
05:53:12.310 --> 05:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
reasons one of the things i'll talk to
 
05:53:14.868 --> 05:53:14.878 align:start position:0%
the senator afterwards is there is
 
05:53:17.270 --> 05:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
sorry there on the advisory council
 
05:53:18.868 --> 05:53:18.878 align:start position:0%
there's currently two reps and one
 
05:53:20.868 --> 05:53:20.878 align:start position:0%
senator so i mean he could probably call
 
05:53:22.510 --> 05:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
upon them as well and have some
 
05:53:24.548 --> 05:53:24.558 align:start position:0%
cross-pollination between the two sounds
 
05:53:27.190 --> 05:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
like a plan anyone else
 
05:53:27.200 --> 05:53:28.070 align:start position:0%
like a plan anyone else

pinged ols once more
 
05:56:49.430 --> 05:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
but the one that was more complicated
 
05:56:54.628 --> 05:56:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:11.990 --> 05:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:13.350 --> 05:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
that was the one
 
05:57:15.270 --> 05:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
that was the one in which we had a
 
05:57:17.590 --> 05:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
change because of drafting error in the
 
05:57:19.030 --> 05:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
first paragraph
 
05:57:21.190 --> 05:57:21.200 align:start position:0%

05:57:38.948 --> 05:57:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:46.070 --> 05:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:49.110 --> 05:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
senate bill 229 the
 
05:57:49.120 --> 05:57:50.230 align:start position:0%
senate bill 229 the

i want to say thank you to represent
 
05:57:58.708 --> 05:57:58.718 align:start position:0%
cushman to uh
 
05:58:00.150 --> 05:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
working over this working with me on
 
05:58:02.310 --> 05:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
this over lunch um and put our heads
 
05:58:03.350 --> 05:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
together i think we came up with
 
05:58:04.868 --> 05:58:04.878 align:start position:0%
something we all can agree we at least
 
05:58:06.150 --> 05:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
agree with hopefully folks will agree
 
05:58:07.350 --> 05:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
with us as well
 
05:58:09.110 --> 05:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
so i gave out two pieces of paper one's
 
05:58:11.670 --> 05:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment the other one's in 318 16
 
05:58:12.868 --> 05:58:12.878 align:start position:0%
f because that's the part that's getting
 
05:58:12.878 --> 05:58:14.070 align:start position:0%
f because that's the part that's getting
repealed

05:58:14.070 --> 05:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
05:58:15.830 --> 05:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
and some of the concerns that were
 
05:58:18.868 --> 05:58:18.878 align:start position:0%
shared were dealing with what was in 16
 
05:58:21.910 --> 05:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
f because being repealed we lose it
 
05:58:21.920 --> 05:58:23.030 align:start position:0%
f because being repealed we lose it
and

05:58:23.030 --> 05:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:58:25.110 --> 05:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
in talking with representative
 
05:58:27.430 --> 05:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
cushman i recognize that some of the
 
05:58:28.470 --> 05:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
things that
 
05:58:30.310 --> 05:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
she's referring to and the statue were
 
05:58:31.910 --> 05:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
actually addressed in the rules but she
 
05:58:33.430 --> 05:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
felt more comfortable and okay with it
 
05:58:35.190 --> 05:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
putting in the statute
 
05:58:39.030 --> 05:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:01.830 --> 05:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:01.840 --> 05:59:03.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:59:03.190 --> 05:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:05.910 --> 05:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
did they get caught somewhere
 
05:59:07.270 --> 05:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
i have
 
05:59:09.910 --> 05:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:31.270 --> 05:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:31.280 --> 05:59:32.708 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:59:32.708 --> 05:59:32.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:59:35.110 --> 05:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
you should be looking up in front of you
 
05:59:37.750 --> 05:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
to amendment two zero two two
 
05:59:41.030 --> 05:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
one three three four h
 
05:59:43.590 --> 05:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
and also you have another piece of paper
 
05:59:45.510 --> 05:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
which is circulating which was section
 
05:59:47.350 --> 05:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
three eighteen sixteen f which is the
 
05:59:48.788 --> 05:59:48.798 align:start position:0%
statute itself
 
05:59:51.030 --> 05:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with what's being repealed
 
05:59:52.948 --> 05:59:52.958 align:start position:0%
and the reason i'm sharing this with you
 
05:59:54.548 --> 05:59:54.558 align:start position:0%
is understanding what do you have them
 
05:59:54.558 --> 05:59:56.390 align:start position:0%
is understanding what do you have them
both

05:59:56.390 --> 05:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
both
 
06:00:12.628 --> 06:00:12.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:29.110 --> 06:00:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:31.590 --> 06:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
so does everyone have
 
06:00:34.788 --> 06:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
rsa 318 16f
 
06:00:41.110 --> 06:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:41.120 --> 06:00:42.948 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:00:42.948 --> 06:00:42.958 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:00:42.958 --> 06:00:43.750 align:start position:0%
okay
so

06:00:43.750 --> 06:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:00:45.750 --> 06:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
in talking with representative cushman
 
06:00:46.948 --> 06:00:46.958 align:start position:0%
over lunch
 
06:00:50.470 --> 06:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:52.150 --> 06:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
the fact that many things that are in
 
06:00:54.150 --> 06:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
the rsa were actually in rules by the
 
06:00:55.670 --> 06:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
board of pharmacy at the time we created
 
06:00:55.680 --> 06:00:56.548 align:start position:0%
board of pharmacy at the time we created
the

06:00:56.548 --> 06:00:56.558 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:00:58.548 --> 06:00:58.558 align:start position:0%
rules we recognized that one of the
 
06:01:00.628 --> 06:01:00.638 align:start position:0%
things critical here is having whoever's
 
06:01:02.788 --> 06:01:02.798 align:start position:0%
going to the vaccines
 
06:01:05.270 --> 06:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
is being trained in cpr cardio pulmonary
 
06:01:07.750 --> 06:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
resuscitation which is critical it's in
 
06:01:09.750 --> 06:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
rules but it wasn't a statute so
 
06:01:11.910 --> 06:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
basically we did if you look at
 
06:01:11.920 --> 06:01:15.270 align:start position:0%
basically we did if you look at
rsa31816f

06:01:15.270 --> 06:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:18.150 --> 06:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
and look at number six
 
06:01:19.750 --> 06:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
certified pharmacy technician has a
 
06:01:19.760 --> 06:01:20.708 align:start position:0%
certified pharmacy technician has a
current

06:01:20.708 --> 06:01:20.718 align:start position:0%
current
 
06:01:22.708 --> 06:01:22.718 align:start position:0%
certification of basic cardiopulmonary
 
06:01:26.390 --> 06:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
recession station we've moved it from
 
06:01:27.670 --> 06:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
this section
 
06:01:29.670 --> 06:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
back into the amendment so it stays
 
06:01:29.680 --> 06:01:31.270 align:start position:0%
back into the amendment so it stays
consistent

06:01:31.270 --> 06:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
06:01:32.868 --> 06:01:32.878 align:start position:0%
the nice thing about it is because it's
 
06:01:35.590 --> 06:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
in the statute now all the pharmacists
 
06:01:37.590 --> 06:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
as well as the licensed technician and
 
06:01:39.830 --> 06:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
the certified tech all have to be cpr
 
06:01:42.948 --> 06:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
trained and we want that anyway no we we
 
06:01:46.310 --> 06:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
do oh you want it okay i i wanted it but
 
06:01:51.670 --> 06:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:55.110 --> 06:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
then we talked about in line 17
 
06:01:57.670 --> 06:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
is no reference back to the statute
 
06:01:59.270 --> 06:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
dealing with a certified registered
 
06:02:02.150 --> 06:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
technician so to be consistent
 
06:02:05.030 --> 06:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
we wanted to anchor it down in that rsa
 
06:02:08.070 --> 06:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
which is rsa 318 15 a which is my
 
06:02:12.708 --> 06:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:14.708 --> 06:02:14.718 align:start position:0%
it's sort of implied but
 
06:02:16.628 --> 06:02:16.638 align:start position:0%
we want to be sure it's explicit if you
 
06:02:18.310 --> 06:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
look at line 20
 
06:02:20.230 --> 06:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
2 through 24
 
06:02:22.150 --> 06:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
is that the training has to include
 
06:02:22.160 --> 06:02:23.350 align:start position:0%
is that the training has to include
hands-on

06:02:23.350 --> 06:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
hands-on
 
06:02:25.910 --> 06:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
it can be something to take online
 
06:02:27.190 --> 06:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
it's pretty hard to understand how to
 
06:02:29.750 --> 06:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
give an injection online
 
06:02:32.070 --> 06:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
so you want to be sure be clear that it
 
06:02:33.350 --> 06:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
has to have
 
06:02:36.948 --> 06:02:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:38.788 --> 06:02:38.798 align:start position:0%
we also want to be sure that if you look
 
06:02:41.670 --> 06:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
at number four which is line 25 buck
 
06:02:43.430 --> 06:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
certification cardio pulmonary
 
06:02:43.440 --> 06:02:44.948 align:start position:0%
certification cardio pulmonary
resuscitation

06:02:44.948 --> 06:02:44.958 align:start position:0%
resuscitation
 
06:02:47.190 --> 06:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
because we added number four we had to
 
06:02:49.430 --> 06:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
modify line 26
 
06:02:57.830 --> 06:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:59.510 --> 06:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
and the other requirement was the fact
 
06:03:02.110 --> 06:03:02.120 align:start position:0%
which again is pretty
 
06:03:04.150 --> 06:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory is that before you go
 
06:03:05.750 --> 06:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine you should at least review the
 
06:03:09.190 --> 06:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:10.548 --> 06:03:10.558 align:start position:0%
it's pretty much
 
06:03:12.310 --> 06:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
implied but we wanted to make it
 
06:03:17.190 --> 06:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:18.150 --> 06:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
i want to say thank you to
 
06:03:19.270 --> 06:03:19.280 align:start position:0%

06:03:21.270 --> 06:03:21.280 align:start position:0%

representative merchant would you make a

oh thank you snow
 
06:11:09.510 --> 06:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
so basically um represent canark
 
06:11:10.390 --> 06:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
caught a
 
06:11:13.430 --> 06:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
drafting error which was in line eight
 
06:11:15.350 --> 06:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
we fixed that so line eight now agrees
 
06:11:17.030 --> 06:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
with line 9
 
06:11:19.190 --> 06:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
and we also then took the
 
06:11:21.830 --> 06:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
amendment which i drafted earlier
 
06:11:24.310 --> 06:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
to then include that language into this
 
06:11:25.830 --> 06:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
amendment as well
 
06:11:27.190 --> 06:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
which is
 
06:11:29.510 --> 06:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
basically taking the format of the
 
06:11:32.070 --> 06:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
prescription which is line 13
 
06:11:33.590 --> 06:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
and moving it from what was attached
 
06:11:36.070 --> 06:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
before in 318b over to our belongs now
 
06:11:41.510 --> 06:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:43.510 --> 06:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
it's a simple bill
 
06:11:47.830 --> 06:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:50.628 --> 06:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
