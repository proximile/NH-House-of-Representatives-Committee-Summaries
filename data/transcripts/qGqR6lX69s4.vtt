the work for public works and highways
 
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
committee for today
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
i would remind members of
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
the committee that
 
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
you have to press the button make sure
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
the microphone is showing red because
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
this is live streamed and the only way
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
that people can hear what you are saying
 
00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:32.559 align:start position:0%
or asking is if you do that
 
00:33:32.559 --> 00:33:33.830 align:start position:0%
or asking is if you do that
um

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
i will now call
 
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
house order and
 
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.389 align:start position:0%
house order and
um

00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
open the
 
00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
continued hearing on house bill
 
00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.269 align:start position:0%
continued hearing on house bill
1656

00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
1656
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
an act establishing a road usage
 
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
registration fee
 
00:33:54.389 --> 00:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
and making an appropriation there for
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
the reason that it was continued is that
 
00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:00.559 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor was dealing with the
 
00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
sick relative the day of the hearing and
 
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
i did he did ask that if he could come
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
back and explain his rationale
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
and i was willing to do that
 
00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.069 align:start position:0%
and i was willing to do that
so

00:34:12.069 --> 00:34:12.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
with that i would recognize the prime
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative some serious on
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and
 
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
i have handed out an oral
 
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
presentation to you but i'm going to go
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
through this
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill
 
00:34:44.079 --> 00:34:45.510 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill
is

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
isn't my way of thinking about it is
 
00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:49.030 align:start position:0%
isn't my way of thinking about it is
this

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
all of you know better than i
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
what the needs are for additional
 
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
revenue to maintain new hampshire's
 
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
roadways and bridges
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
you also know that the world of
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
transportation is changing
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
and that we have already seen that
 
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
impact when it comes to the declining
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
gasoline diesel tax revenues
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
however our state
 
00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
only has three primary sources to fix
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
and maintain our roads and bridges
 
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
fueled tax revenues revenues from our
 
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
toll booths and registration
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle registration fees
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
studies including the 2020 cambridge
 
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
systems report have documented a
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
continuing decline in our fuel tax
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
revenues due to more gas efficient
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
vehicle standards for both cars and
 
00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:37.589 align:start position:0%

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
and more hybrid vehicles on our roadways

the new generation of hybrids evs and
 
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%

california
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
will also impact our state at some time
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
at some point
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
there are no good political options to
 
00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
raise revenues without some groups
 
00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.829 align:start position:0%
raise revenues without some groups
objecting

00:35:59.829 --> 00:35:59.839 align:start position:0%
objecting
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
however it is the responsibility of this
 
00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
policy committee to plan for the future
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
of our state's infrastructure needs
 
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
i acknowledge the tough tasks you are
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
facing and i support hb 1040 sponsored
 
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
by representative norm majors calling
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
for a commission to look at new
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%

00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
my bill hb
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
1656 however provides a shorter term
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
solution to our declining revenues
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
the bill modifies the current state
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
vehicle registration fee based on weight
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
to a fee based on weight and the annual
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
miles miles driven
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
it is designed to address three primary

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:45.910 align:start position:0%
issues
first

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
since the weight-based fee has not
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
changed for almost 15 years
 
00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
that fee is adjusted for the past 15
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
years of inflation loss
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
it creates five vehicle
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
weight classes instead of the current
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
three classes
 
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
and adjusts the classes so that lighter
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
vehicles pay less proportionately than
 
00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
the average
 
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
while heavier vehicles pay
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
proportionally more
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
in addition it creates a new road usage
 
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
and registration fee
 
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
replacing the current weight-based oney

00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
vmt to the calculation of the road usage
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
registration fee
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
regardless of the fuel source of a
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
vehicle whether it's an ev a hydrogen or
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
a hybrid
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
if it weighs something it pays something
 
00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
second it addresses a current situation
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
of annually declining fuel tax revenues
 
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
since the core weight-based fee in this
 
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
bill automatically is adjusted to
 
00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
increase by 2.4 percent per year
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
this is the
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
recent 10-year average of increasing
 
00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.790 align:start position:0%

vehicle fuel efficiency
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
it will compensate us annually for the
 
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
lost fuel tax revenues
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
and third
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
it should be of concern to all of us
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
that when our state makes promises to
 
00:38:12.069 --> 00:38:12.079 align:start position:0%
residents and communities
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
that these promises are kept
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
however there are currently 49 locations
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
that are qualified to receive and have
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
been promised sound barriers against
 
00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
local traffic noise
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
but for which no funding exists to keep
 
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
those promises
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
this bill would set aside five percent
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
of regis total registration fees
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
enough for one to two sites per year
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
for that very purpose
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
those locations are in the following
 
00:38:41.839 --> 00:38:43.030 align:start position:0%
those locations are in the following

please keep in mind that this bill only
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
changes the state portion of the vehicle
 
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
registration and not the municipal

portion

for example in my personal case
 
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
when my vehicle was brand new five years
 
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
ago i paid five hundred dollar

musical fee
 
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
and only forty three dollars eight
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
percent of the total to the state
 
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
five years later i am now paying a 154
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
dollars to my municipality and again
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
still 43 dollars to the state which is
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
now a higher percentage of the total
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
two years ago i proposed a similar bill
 
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
what was told by members of this
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
committee that too many changes were
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
being made in one step
 
00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
so this bill today has a two-step
 
00:39:48.079 --> 00:39:49.190 align:start position:0%
so this bill today has a two-step
process

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
in the first year the weight-based fees
 
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
are changed and for the calculation it
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
is assumed that everyone will have
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
a vehicle model traveled amount of
 
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
twelve thousand miles
 
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
however in the second year of
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
implementation the vehicle miles
 
00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
traveled value will be collected as part
 
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
of the annual safety inspection process
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
and the difference between the first and
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
the second year odometer readings will
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
be assumed to be the vehicle miles
 
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
traveled of that vehicle
 
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
this can be illustrated by the following
 
00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.829 align:start position:0%
this can be illustrated by the following
equations

00:40:22.829 --> 00:40:22.839 align:start position:0%
equations
 
00:40:22.839 --> 00:40:24.390 align:start position:0%
equations
and

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:25.839 align:start position:0%
despite what you've heard these
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
calculations are not very complicated
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
so in the first year we have a new total
 
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
fee of the the registration use usage
 
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
and registration fee
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
you have a new weight-based fee
 
00:40:41.109 --> 00:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
and that is multiplied
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
by one plus a portion for the vehicle
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
miles traveled
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
normalized to 12 000 miles and divide it
 
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
by one fourth
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
by four
 
00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
so for example
 
00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh in the first year with everyone
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
getting twelve thousand miles of vehicle
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
miles traveled
 
00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
that would be one plus
 
00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
a fourth
 
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
or 1.25 multiplied by the weight fee
 
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
so a 25
 
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
increase over the weight fee alone
 
00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
in the second year
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
the same calculation applies but this
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
time we do not assume a
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
miles traveled number everyone will be
 
00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
putting in a number that is typical or
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
it has been recorded for their vehicle
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
so for example for someone that travels
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
24 000 miles
 
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
that factor of 1.5 multiplied by the
 
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
weight fee
 
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
while someone that only travels
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
6 000 miles will multiply that new
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
weight fee by
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:56.309 --> 00:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
now the estimated revenues for
 
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
that will be generated by this new uh
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
road usage registration fee
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
in the first year are estimated to be
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
108 million dollars which would be an
 
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
increase of 36 million dollars
 
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
and in the second year
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh the the road usage registration fee
 
00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
would generate between and ten thousand
 
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
million and 128 million
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
or an increase of between thirty eight
 
00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:24.079 align:start position:0%
million and fifty six million and this
 
00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:25.640 align:start position:0%
is based on the
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
2019 vehicle registration numbers i
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten any more recent ones
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
maybe someone from the department of
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
safety is going to be here to tell us
 
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
but i'm assuming that number might be
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
higher by a couple percentage points
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
as of 2019 a vehicle total registration
 
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
fees were 72 million
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
as a comparison
 
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
so that's my presentation but i've also
 
00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
provided you a spreadsheet
 
00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
actually two spreadsheets one for the
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
first year and one for the second year
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.790 align:start position:0%
of this bill
and

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to go through it in detail
 
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
you can take a look at it yourself but
 
00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.550 align:start position:0%
you can take a look at it yourself but
the

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
the first year
 
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
at the very bottom section it says
 
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle plus miles traveled in first
 
00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:13.910 align:start position:0%
vehicle plus miles traveled in first
year

00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
the first section at the very top just
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
shows the current situation as it is
 
00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
the middle part shows you what happens
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
when you just increase the
 
00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
you make the weight change as i
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
suggested and the bottom part shows you
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
what happens when you combine the weight
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
changes plus the miles traveled
 
00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
and you can see the the total numbers
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
and the additional revenue that's
 
00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.309 align:start position:0%
and the additional revenue that's
generated

00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
generated
 
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
in in the second year um
 
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
it is because it's a little more
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
complicated because we don't know how
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
many miles people will be traveling
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
while he is while i'm assuming in the
 
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
first year 12 000 for everyone in the
 
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
second year i've given the scenario for
 
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
three different choices
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
traveling 12 000 miles traveling 24 000
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
miles and 7 500
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
and you can see what the different
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
revenues that are generated based on
 
00:44:07.589 --> 00:44:07.599 align:start position:0%
that scenario are
 
00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
but as i mentioned the additional
 
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
additional new revenue
 
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
would be something somewhere between 38
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
million to 46 million dollars additional
 
00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.069 align:start position:0%
million to 46 million dollars additional
revenue

00:44:20.069 --> 00:44:20.079 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
and as i said before about this bill
 
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
that every year
 
00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
the weight-based number will go up by
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
2.4 percent uh to compensate for losses
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
we might be suffering uh due to
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
declining fuel taxes
 
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much mr chairman and
 
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
members and i'm glad to answer any
 
00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.750 align:start position:0%
members and i'm glad to answer any
questions

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.510 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
question representative sampson nice to
 
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
see you in a different committee for
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
both of us
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
one of the jobs i had in the electric
 
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
and gas industry was selling contracts
 
00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
to businesses
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts and connecticut and
 
00:45:01.109 --> 00:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
throughout new england which
 
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
took me out of state i said mileage but
 
00:45:05.589 --> 00:45:05.599 align:start position:0%
only a fraction was in new hampshire i
 
00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
don't see anything in your bill
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
about any affidavit process so i could
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
claim how much was actually in new
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire so it gets stuck for paying
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
fees and all that out of state driving
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
as well is there any way to fix that
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
was there a question there
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative platt and nice
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
to see you here in the different
 
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and it's a
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
very good question however um
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
as you might imagine since i was here
 
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
two years ago and people thought doing
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
everything all at once was too
 
00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:42.790 align:start position:0%
everything all at once was too
complicated

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
that doing something like that would be
 
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
even more complicated to actually have
 
00:45:49.109 --> 00:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
verification process i tried to make it
 
00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
simple we already collect the odometer
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
readings from the safety inspection so
 
00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
that's nothing new the only thing that
 
00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
happens is that those numbers not being
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
used for any purpose right now and this
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
could be used make use of that those
 
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
numbers that are already being gathered
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
yes you could do more than
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
than i'm doing and have a certification
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
process or something it would be very
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
complicated i think and we've heard prop
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
proposals to put put tracking devices in
 
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
your car
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
so you could track how many miles you
 
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
are where with a gps you could do all
 
00:46:24.309 --> 00:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
those things i'm trying to keep it less
 
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative philadelphia
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
the problem i have with this bill and
 
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
is the real damage to our roads are from
 
00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
heavy trucks
 
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know of a single 3 000 pound car
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
that's ever put a crack in the hot top
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh is there going to be a question here
 
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
how are we going to deal with
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
if we raise the
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
the taxes on the commercial vehicles
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
they'll just go to maine and register in
 
00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
maine how how do we
 
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
how we got they're doing they're doing
 
00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:30.079 align:start position:0%
that now
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
if we're going to raise it again we're
 
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
going to lose more revenue
 
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
going to maine
 
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
any way to deal with that any ideas i
 
00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.950 align:start position:0%
any way to deal with that any ideas i
don't

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative for your
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
question and it's a good question and i
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
can't say i have an answer to that in
 
00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
fact i think last week you had testimony
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
both from the
 
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
from jason stock from the timberland
 
00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
association as well as the general
 
00:47:58.559 --> 00:47:59.910 align:start position:0%
association as well as the general
contractors

00:47:59.910 --> 00:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
contractors
 
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
who told you that our roadways are
 
00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:03.510 align:start position:0%
who told you that our roadways are
designed

00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
designed
 
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
to be used by trucks that's what they're
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
designed to do
 
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
and the rest of us who don't really put
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
much of a wear and tear on the roadways
 
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
we're just subsidizing that
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
and they were very resistant to any
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
increases in their expenses
 
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
but i would just point out that business
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
for-profit businesses can deduct all
 
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:24.559 align:start position:0%
these costs from their taxes you and i
 
00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
as residents cannot
 
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
so i think they should step up to the
 
00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:30.079 align:start position:0%
plate and say you know we we need to
 
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
contribute as well to maintaining the
 
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
roadways because we need them and we we
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
need these businesses too i recognize
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
that as well i don't know how we can do
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
that uh right now uh
 
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
like you've heard yet last week even the
 
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
fact that they might be increasing some
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
of their fees here uh
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
bumps up against a lot of resistance but
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
i agree with you that trucks are the
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
ones that do do the most damage and the
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
roadways are designed for them
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative ortiz
 
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um so my major
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
concern with this is
 
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
we are just going to do this to new
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents i'm up in the lakes
 
00:49:10.549 --> 00:49:10.559 align:start position:0%
region tourism is huge up there tons of
 
00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:12.559 align:start position:0%
out of state traffic so why are we just
 
00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:14.079 align:start position:0%
going to charge
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
fees to our residents when we have a
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
high tourist occupation up there
 
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
and i just don't think it's fair to
 
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
our residents so how can we fix that
 
00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.910 align:start position:0%
our residents so how can we fix that
issue

00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
well thank you thank you representative
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
for the question uh
 
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
i noticed that this bill brings out all
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
the issues that we haven't dealt with in
 
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
the past including that one uh you know
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
and i i i it's it's a little bit of the
 
00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
resistance that we don't like taxes we
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
don't like fees in this state
 
00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
and it's hard to apply them to just one
 
00:49:48.549 --> 00:49:48.559 align:start position:0%
group and not the other
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
i would say that the the most obvious
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
thing is raising the tolls because most
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
of those visitors come through the toll
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
booth you know that would be my
 
00:49:59.190 --> 00:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
first thought
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
unless we
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
have some kind of tourist fee or
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
something you know if new hampshire
 
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
residents have to pay taxes for a view
 
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't outsiders pay some extra
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
fees for getting an ice for you when
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you for
 
00:50:19.589 --> 00:50:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
that was the only pink card i had on
 
00:50:24.589 --> 00:50:24.599 align:start position:0%

00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
uh wishes to testify
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
anybody who has spoken once wish to
 
00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:37.839 align:start position:0%
speak uh speak a second time seeing none
 
00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:40.040 align:start position:0%

is there a second
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
representative aboard his second seat

there any discussion on the motion of
 
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:43.839 align:start position:0%
representative clutier
 
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman can everybody hear
 
00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.150 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman can everybody hear
me

00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
i got the red button on i am going to
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill i'm going to vote no on
 
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
the motion of ought to pass i think this
 
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
bill is frankly premature we are still
 
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
doing the corridor study
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
i am concerned that if we signed a
 
00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
contract this could pose some legal
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
problems and could be taken to court and
 
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
ruled unconstitutional either by the
 
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
state or the federal constitutions
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
another thing
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
i think it is premature
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
is because we're gonna we should do the
 
00:52:15.839 --> 00:52:16.710 align:start position:0%
is because we're gonna we should do the
study

00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
find out what the costs are
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if state government
 
00:52:23.359 --> 00:52:24.069 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if state government
is

00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
i know their concerns about state
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
government actually subsidizing this
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
line realistically
 
00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
i don't i think the the best course is
 
00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
probably going to be
 
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
a public private partnership with with
 
00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
the state government and or the
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities along the
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
rail line and maybe some federal aid
 
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
doing this rail i don't think state
 
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
government directly
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that we can't use
 
00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
highway funds that's unconstitutional
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
and plus general funds the general fund
 
00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
is very tight as i've been talking with
 
00:52:56.790 --> 00:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
people from finance and ways and means
 
00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:57.670 align:start position:0%
people from finance and ways and means
but

00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
i am concerned that if we pass this bill
 
00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
we are going to prohibit our state dot
 
00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
from helping the municipalities who want
 
00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
this line in the southern part of the
 
00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:09.829 align:start position:0%
this line in the southern part of the
state

00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
and i've been told and by the way i was
 
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
there was a bill
 
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
i believe this committee passed and was
 
00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
legislate in 2016 a public private
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
partnership law
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
that i was a co-sponsor a bipartisan
 
00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:22.790 align:start position:0%
that i was a co-sponsor a bipartisan
bill

00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
and i spoke to the prime sponsor former
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
senator betty lafsky last night and she
 
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
said if this bill passes the way it's
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
written she is concerned that the state
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
d.o.t could not even help
 
00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
the communities involved in any
 
00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
public-private partnership see we were
 
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
handcuffing our own state d.o.t with all
 
00:53:43.829 --> 00:53:43.839 align:start position:0%
due respect to the sponsors of this bill
 
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
and if the communities in the southern
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
part of the state want this
 
00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
i think you know if they're willing to
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
pony up the money manchester nashua and
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
the business community which wants it
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
that we've heard testimony then why
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
should we use past this bill to handcuff
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
the public-private partnership thank you
 
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
very much mr chairman members of the
 
00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:06.790 align:start position:0%
very much mr chairman members of the
committee

00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:08.829 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:08.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
query uh thank you chairman um
 
00:54:12.079 --> 00:54:13.109 align:start position:0%
query uh thank you chairman um
it's

00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
off i will i will also say that i am
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
going to oppose this motion um
 
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
it's always been something that we talk
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
about here in this committee is that we
 
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
never tie the hands of the future
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
members of this committee
 
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
and i believe that this bill does just
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
that and you know i i think that we
 
00:54:31.829 --> 00:54:31.839 align:start position:0%
shouldn't tie the hands of future
 
00:54:31.839 --> 00:54:34.790 align:start position:0%
shouldn't tie the hands of future
members

00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative eaton
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'll oppose it just
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
because of silliness
 
00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
one legislative body cannot obligate a
 
00:54:47.349 --> 00:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
future legislative body and if you
 
00:54:49.829 --> 00:54:49.839 align:start position:0%
haven't been here for any amount of time
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
you can pass this right now and before
 
00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
the session is out an amendment can get
 
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
tagged onto any bill
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
that says the exact opposite whatever
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
passes last wins
 
00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:03.750 align:start position:0%
passes last wins
and

00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:05.349 --> 00:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
if you don't like the language of the
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
spill you can either repeal it the next
 
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
session or write another piece of
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
legislation that says notwithstanding
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
rsa such and such all you're doing is
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
cluttering a law book for no legitimate
 
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
purpose because any legislative body is
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
going to make their own decision at the
 
00:55:23.589 --> 00:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
appropriate time this is feel good waste
 
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
of time silliness
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative faulkner
 
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:31.839 align:start position:0%
i guess i was going to use the same
 
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
adjective but my concern is that we look
 
00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:35.430 align:start position:0%
adjective but my concern is that we look
dumb

00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
dumb
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
if we go ahead and decide how this
 
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
should turn out
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
without having the information that's
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
being prepared for us at the present
 
00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:44.470 align:start position:0%
being prepared for us at the present
time

00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
you know if we were
 
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
to you know to get this information to
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
decide this is too expensive we
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do it that's that's one thing
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
but we're
 
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
we're making a decision without the
 
00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:55.589 align:start position:0%
we're making a decision without the
information

00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
and in fact it appears that we don't
 
00:55:59.589 --> 00:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
want to hear the information or perhaps
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
we're even
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
afraid that the information is not going
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
to support the position that we might
 
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
want to take and i think that that just
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh is
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
it encourages disrespect of this process
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
of this committee and of the legislature
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
and i think for that reason i'm going to
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative um faulkner
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
took stole most of my thunder i just
 
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
additionally comment that some of you
 
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
who are on this committee
 
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
over a few turn a couple of terms ago
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
will remember one of our colleagues
 
00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
she wasn't necessarily supportive of it
 
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
but she wanted to get the questions
 
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
answered and she strongly felt we owe it
 
00:56:47.829 --> 00:56:47.839 align:start position:0%
to we owe it to each other we owe it to
 
00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
the state to get the questions answered
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
as to how much this will cost and then
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
thank you any further discussion
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
i will say one thing i did talk to the
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
department the way this is written it
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
does not impact on the ongoing study we
 
00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
will still get that
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
that said
 
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
are you ready for the question
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:19.270 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
everybody hear me all right okay again
 
00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
i've also heard from my own local area
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
the city of claremont and we
 
00:57:28.789 --> 00:57:28.799 align:start position:0%
host a stop in claremont that's the
 
00:57:30.789 --> 00:57:30.799 align:start position:0%
vermonter the state of vermont basically
 
00:57:32.789 --> 00:57:32.799 align:start position:0%
pays for the rail line but there is one
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
stop in new hampshire and that is in
 
00:57:34.319 --> 00:57:35.589 align:start position:0%
stop in new hampshire and that is in
claremont

00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
claremont
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
and people in claremont are concerned
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
they they like rail too and they are so
 
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:41.839 align:start position:0%
concerned about the impact this bill if
 
00:57:43.109 --> 00:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
they surpass
 
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
if if th that line ever needed state
 
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
help in the future
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
it could bar that it could also borrow
 
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
the downeaster so there's it's not just
 
00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
a capital corridor project
 
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
we are going to be hindering
 
00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
rail lines that we have now in this
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
state serving our constituents who get
 
00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
on them and ride them
 
00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
and i i just feel this
 
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
bill i i understand the sponsor's

01:03:23.109 --> 01:03:23.119 align:start position:0%

01:03:23.119 --> 01:03:26.470 align:start position:0%
so move we adopt amendment
2022-0205-h

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:36.069 --> 01:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
the amendment does two things uh i i was
 
01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:38.559 align:start position:0%
concerned that
 
01:03:38.559 --> 01:03:39.349 align:start position:0%
concerned that
the

01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
focus on the title and the purpose on
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles was going to raise
 
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
proposing to eliminate that particular
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
phrase from the first from the title in
 
01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
the first section
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
and and where it's repeated down below
 
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that the
 
01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:03.589 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that the
[Music]

01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
new section is titled commission to
 
01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
study revenue alternatives to the road
 
01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:09.349 align:start position:0%
study revenue alternatives to the road
toll

01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
toll
 
01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:10.839 align:start position:0%
all of
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
the things that were in the original
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
bill and the sponsors
 
01:04:18.549 --> 01:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
version as as introduced are still in
 
01:04:18.559 --> 01:04:19.430 align:start position:0%
version as as introduced are still in
here

01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
but in addition we added one additional
 
01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
item that they
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
may consider which is to evaluate the
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
future funding needs
 
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
the operation and maintenance of the
 
01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:29.839 align:start position:0%
highway system that's under
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph four f
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
so with those two changes i did review
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
this with the
 
01:04:37.029 --> 01:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
representative major the sponsor he's
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
fine with it
 
01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:39.589 align:start position:0%
fine with it
i

01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
don't think it changes the meaning
 
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
you know focusing on the general problem
 
01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
of revenue and of the equity of
 
01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
who pays what
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
instead of instead of focusing on
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles
 
01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
i think this improves the chances this
 
01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
would pass and
 
01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
i would urge everybody to support this
 
01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.549 align:start position:0%
i would urge everybody to support this
amendment

01:05:02.549 --> 01:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:04.549 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you just so that that i understand
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
the amendment you would
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
in this case you would also expect them
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
to look at things like hydrogen-powered
 
01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
vehicles and how they would pay in in
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
that kind of
 
01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:22.549 align:start position:0%
that kind of
situation

01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
yes so the
 
01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:26.799 align:start position:0%
the equity of who pays what is still
 
01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
listed that was one of the original
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
purposes and that's still in there that
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
any comments or questions
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%

01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
sorry can everybody hear me now
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
all right thank you i have a question
 
01:09:30.349 --> 01:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
about the the legality or
 
01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of some parts of this
 
01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
bill i know representation just wants to
 
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
do something about the sound barriers
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
but i believe some of them are on
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
turnpikes like i think
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
one of the ones in portsmouth some are
 
01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
on on highways and i question whether
 
01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:09:47.829 --> 01:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
the way it's written now would only
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
benefit the highway fund but then we'd
 
01:09:51.269 --> 01:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
be using
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
money raised to maybe deal some with you
 
01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
know work on sound barriers that are on
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
our our
 
01:09:59.590 --> 01:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
that are turnpikes
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
and in other words we take money raised
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
for the highway fund and spend it on
 
01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
sound barriers along turnpikes and i'm
 
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
wondering if that's legal and i don't
 
01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
know if anyone and i i don't know if it
 
01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
was addressed already someone from d.o.t
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
or somebody here to maybe
 
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
question the legality even the
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of that section of the
 
01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:21.990 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of that section of the
bill

01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative clutter i think that
 
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
that is a great question for us to
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
pursue at some time maybe during the
 
01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
work session on 10 40 and how things are
 
01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:31.750 align:start position:0%
work session on 10 40 and how things are
funded

01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
funded
 
01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
but with the motion being inexpedient to
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
legislate it really does not
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
impact on
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
whether it is or not if it was not to
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
pass it would probably be a very
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
pertinent question but i think we do
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative faulkner
 
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr john i'm
 
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be sporting itl but for a
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
little bit different reason i
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
think to be consistent
 
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
we just approved this uh
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
commission to study the road fee
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
i think there are a lot of good ideas
 
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
here obviously some things need to be
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
worked out but i think we need to work
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
them out through this commission and
 
01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.149 align:start position:0%
them out through this commission and
therefore

01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
we should not proceed with this
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
particular solution at this time thank
 
01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
you representative flett yes thank you
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:11:46.709 --> 01:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
representative sampson's on the same
 
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
committee as me so i'm a little careful
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
um i would just say i like the intent of
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
the bill but it's premature there's some
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
questions asked that couldn't be
 
01:11:57.510 --> 01:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
answered such as driving out of state
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
and being hit with the tax or people
 
01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
driving in-state from out-of-state not
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
getting hit with attacks
 
01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:04.229 align:start position:0%
getting hit with attacks
and

01:12:04.229 --> 01:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
trucks re-registering in another state
 
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
to avoid it all sorts of questions like
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
that we just passed 10 40 let's do some
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
of the homework before we bring up
 
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
something like this again thanks
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you any further discussion
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%

that is being proposed for sale
 
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's currently listed as about 17 acres
 
01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
a couple buildings they may be looking
 
01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:07.510 align:start position:0%
a couple buildings they may be looking
at

01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
building another place
 
01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
if we were to adopt something we're
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
going to need an amendment to either
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
and i'll probably that would this is
 
01:20:26.629 --> 01:20:26.639 align:start position:0%
graham talking at the moment not a
 
01:20:26.639 --> 01:20:27.990 align:start position:0%
graham talking at the moment not a
directive

01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
directive
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
and we definitely would need that if it
 
01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:32.719 align:start position:0%
was sold
 
01:20:34.709 --> 01:20:34.719 align:start position:0%
as currently
 
01:20:36.629 --> 01:20:36.639 align:start position:0%
envisioned by
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 as part and parcel of the
 
01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:40.149 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 as part and parcel of the
sale

01:20:40.149 --> 01:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
sale
 
01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
at least
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
a statement that some of the proceeds
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
from that
 
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
would go to building the new building
 
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
rather than going out and borrowing the
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
money to build a new building
 
01:20:56.709 --> 01:20:56.719 align:start position:0%
for emergency services
 
01:20:58.790 --> 01:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
i just want to know where what the will
 
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
of the committee is going forward and
 
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
looking at those issues because it will
 
01:21:06.149 --> 01:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
any of that i have just been talking
 
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
about will take an amendment which we're
 
01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
not going to try to get done today we've
 
01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:11.270 align:start position:0%
not going to try to get done today we've
got

01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
got
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
a month or more to work on this
 
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
all right so laconia is my district um
 
01:21:22.229 --> 01:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
i've had lots of conversations
 
01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:24.639 align:start position:0%
with the municipal um
 
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
fire service as well as
 
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
all the parties involved
 
01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.629 align:start position:0%
all the parties involved
um

01:21:30.629 --> 01:21:30.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
i'm strongly for itl on this to be
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
honest with you after the discussions
 
01:21:36.629 --> 01:21:36.639 align:start position:0%
i've had it seems apparent to me they're
 
01:21:40.149 --> 01:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
already working on relocating
 
01:21:40.159 --> 01:21:40.950 align:start position:0%
already working on relocating
the

01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
existing building so i don't even feel
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh the question i would have would be
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
how emergency state portion of the
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
emergency service is going to pay for
 
01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:59.350 align:start position:0%
emergency service is going to pay for
moving

01:21:59.350 --> 01:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
i and that would
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
just a question you don't have to answer
 
01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
because we're not going to execute at
 
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
this moment but i'm trying to get a
 
01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
sense of the committee on where we're
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
going representative query
 
01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:14.639 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
01:22:16.229 --> 01:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
since we heard this bill i did a little
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
research and i would be
 
01:22:20.229 --> 01:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
wary of
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh shrinking that parcel down from the
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
17 acres it does seem like the sale of
 
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
the property would be better
 
01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
at 17 acres than if we continually
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
chopped it down into smaller pieces plus
 
01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:34.719 align:start position:0%
i will let
 
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
representative jack speak but he made
 
01:22:39.669 --> 01:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
some points of uh some
 
01:22:39.679 --> 01:22:40.550 align:start position:0%
some points of uh some
like

01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
equipment that he knows is on that
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
property that is pretty spread out
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
therefore making it kind of awkward to
 
01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
carve it out but i would support an idea
 
01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
of making sure that the sale proceeds of
 
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
that sale
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
representative jack you got thrown under
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
the bus
 
01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh there is there
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
is uh statewide communications equipment
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
on that property that was not
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
widely discussed at the hearing
 
01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh and we need to make sure that that
 
01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:16.709 align:start position:0%
uh and we need to make sure that that
that

01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
if if it were moved it were done in such
 
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:32.229 --> 01:23:32.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
i think this should be a little more
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
discussion on uh the fire service that's
 
01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
there and if in fact they were forced to
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
move if there's any consideration for
 
01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:44.639 align:start position:0%
for helping them with that move
 
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
represent me
 
01:23:54.870 --> 01:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman uh my concern
 
01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:56.390 align:start position:0%
mr chairman uh my concern
is

01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
what was just mentioned and that
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
i'm a director of southwest new
 
01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire fire mutual aid which is the
 
01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
oldest and largest in the country
 
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
lakes region does a wonderful job i got
 
01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
a concern that use we should not be
 
01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
using state monies
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
for a private corporation that has
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
bonding ability and they could go out
 
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
to their towns they can change their fee
 
01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:23.270 align:start position:0%
to their towns they can change their fee
structure

01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
structure
 
01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
i know in
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
southwest we floated a bond just a few
 
01:24:28.629 --> 01:24:28.639 align:start position:0%
years ago to
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
buy the former keene fire department and
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
did a massive expansion in modernization
 
01:24:34.709 --> 01:24:34.719 align:start position:0%
the facility
 
01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
and it cost a little bit more for our
 
01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:40.639 align:start position:0%
member communities but the cost is
 
01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
more than worth it for everyone and i i
 
01:24:45.669 --> 01:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
don't want to see a precedent start that
 
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
anytime a mutual aid system or a fire
 
01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
fire service
 
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
is inconvenienced that they come to the
 
01:24:58.149 --> 01:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:00.149 --> 01:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
okay it looks like we have a
 
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
fairly wide range of of opinions on this
 
01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:03.830 align:start position:0%
fairly wide range of of opinions on this
bill

01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:04.870 align:start position:0%
bill
um

01:25:04.870 --> 01:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
we're not going to execute for probably
 
01:25:10.629 --> 01:25:10.639 align:start position:0%
a couple of weeks
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
and i will let everybody know when we're
 
01:25:14.229 --> 01:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
going to do that
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
um if you think that something should be
 
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
amended in the bill
 
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
i expect you to bring forward an
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
amendment at that point
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
um the motion
 
01:25:27.669 --> 01:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
as always can be ought to pass out to
 
01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
pass as amended or itl
 
01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
and we can have that full and frank
 
01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:34.719 align:start position:0%
discussion during an exact session i was
 
01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
just trying to get
 
01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
some sense of where the committee wanted
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
to go on it but i don't think we've
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
reached any kind of consensus at the
 
01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:44.790 align:start position:0%
reached any kind of consensus at the
moment

01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
moment
 
01:25:47.189 --> 01:25:47.199 align:start position:0%
but that will give us a chance to both
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
the testimony that's been submitted both
 
01:25:54.229 --> 01:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
in person and online on this issue
 
01:25:56.950 --> 01:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
before we start making any decisions on
 
01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:57.990 align:start position:0%
before we start making any decisions on
it

01:25:57.990 --> 01:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
we have about
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
10 minutes before we open our
 
01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
full committee work session on house
 
01:26:12.629 --> 01:26:12.639 align:start position:0%
bill 2022 relative to the 10-year
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
transportation plan
 
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
the committee is in recess until
 
01:26:20.830 --> 01:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
10 35. thank
 
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
you i just had a question about the
 
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
other laconia 10 32 we didn't exec
 
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
we will exactly two of them at the same
 
01:26:28.960 --> 01:38:24.470 align:start position:0%
we will exactly two of them at the same
time

01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
i'd like to call the committee back to
 
01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
order for our full committee work
 
01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:29.590 align:start position:0%
order for our full committee work
session

01:38:29.590 --> 01:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
on the 10-year transportation plan
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
and i call
 
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
call the committee to order
 
01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:38.470 align:start position:0%
call the committee to order
if

01:38:38.470 --> 01:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
the clerk could was there anybody still
 
01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
out there to have them come
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
in and what i'd like to do for the work
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
session is
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
invite the commissioner and or anybody
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
that she wants to send to the hot seat
 
01:38:55.109 --> 01:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
uh to uh
 
01:38:58.709 --> 01:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
to the table to to
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
work with us as we work through any
 
01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
where where i would like to start
 
01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
if you recall from
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
presentation that the the department
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
gave us
 
01:39:18.950 --> 01:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
last time around
 
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing slide 20 had
 
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
items for discussion
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
um i just want to make sure that we have
 
01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
worked through all of those make sure
 
01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
that we are where we are on them
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
and the first one up
 
01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
is the
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
port authority functional replacement
 
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner we have the funds
 
01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
to do that if i remember correctly with
 
01:39:47.189 --> 01:39:47.199 align:start position:0%
what you said
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
all right you don't have to answer
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:54.629 --> 01:39:54.639 align:start position:0%
anybody answer i i'll direct i'll
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:00.149 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:40:00.149 --> 01:40:00.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:02.470 --> 01:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
so when we had advanced the draft
 
01:40:05.189 --> 01:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
10-year plan in the gasset phase we
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
were still in the process of
 
01:40:10.870 --> 01:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
applying for a grant
 
01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:11.750 align:start position:0%
applying for a grant
from

01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
usdot unfortunately we did not secure
 
01:40:16.629 --> 01:40:16.639 align:start position:0%
that grant and so
 
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
our current intention is to fully fund
 
01:40:21.109 --> 01:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
this project with traditional formula
 
01:40:24.629 --> 01:40:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:27.910 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
um

01:40:27.910 --> 01:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
any anybody else okay so that will be in
 
01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:34.709 align:start position:0%
any anybody else okay so that will be in
there

01:40:34.709 --> 01:40:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:36.310 --> 01:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
and something near and dear to
 
01:40:39.669 --> 01:40:39.679 align:start position:0%
everybody's heart uh heart to include i
 
01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
know the governor's um exit sign
 
01:40:45.510 --> 01:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
renumbering project for tier one roads
 
01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:46.870 align:start position:0%
renumbering project for tier one roads
which

01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:40:51.189 --> 01:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
which would renumber all of the
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
exits on the highways major highways
 
01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
especially the interstates to the mile
 
01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:57.350 align:start position:0%
especially the interstates to the mile
markers

01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
markers
 
01:40:59.109 --> 01:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:41:00.629 --> 01:41:00.639 align:start position:0%
the one for
 
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh lincoln would now be i think exit 100
 
01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
rather than 32 if we were to go with
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
this my understanding
 
01:41:12.149 --> 01:41:12.159 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:41:14.550 --> 01:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
there may be a penalty
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
because there's only two states that are
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
not going through this is that a real
 
01:41:20.310 --> 01:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
threat or
 
01:41:21.750 --> 01:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
can we just
 
01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
go along with the gasset recommendation
 
01:41:26.229 --> 01:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
of not to have this
 
01:41:28.470 --> 01:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
remembering project within the 10-year
 
01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:31.270 align:start position:0%
remembering project within the 10-year
plan

01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
so this has been a requirement of what's
 
01:41:35.910 --> 01:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
called the mutcd the manual of uniform
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
traffic control devices for a long time
 
01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
and while
 
01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
there is a risk of a penalty um it has
 
01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
never been
 
01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:44.830 align:start position:0%
never been
applied

01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
applied
 
01:41:48.390 --> 01:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
so given the will of both gasset and the
 
01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
governor to not include this project in
 
01:41:52.229 --> 01:41:52.239 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan
 
01:41:55.189 --> 01:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
we would suggest that
 
01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
we continue to
 
01:41:59.189 --> 01:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
maintain our existing exit numbers and
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
if something was to change if federal
 
01:42:02.629 --> 01:42:02.639 align:start position:0%
highway or usdot was to contact the
 
01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
department then of course we'd bring
 
01:42:08.709 --> 01:42:08.719 align:start position:0%
that information to this committee and
 
01:42:10.229 --> 01:42:10.239 align:start position:0%
to others in the legislature at that
 
01:42:10.239 --> 01:42:12.070 align:start position:0%
to others in the legislature at that
time

01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
to the committee representative faulkner
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
just to clarify
 
01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:21.679 align:start position:0%
is the money that would be
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise spent on the renumbering going
 
01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
to be available for other projects or
 
01:42:27.590 --> 01:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
was it something that was earmarked by
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
the feds
 
01:42:30.629 --> 01:42:30.639 align:start position:0%
the money would be available for other
 
01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
things we would have to fund this
 
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
project if we intended to comply with
 
01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
is it the will of the committee to go
 
01:42:42.629 --> 01:42:42.639 align:start position:0%
along with the gas gasset
 
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
approval and not not include this in the
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
10-year plan
 
01:42:49.189 --> 01:42:49.199 align:start position:0%
i see a lot of heads nodding okay thank
 
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
you just making sure we get hit them all
 
01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:54.830 align:start position:0%
you just making sure we get hit them all
the

01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:42:58.950 --> 01:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
i-95 portsmouth sound walls are included
 
01:43:01.109 --> 01:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
for the most part not to the complete
 
01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
satisfaction of the city but they are
 
01:43:05.109 --> 01:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
included within the
 
01:43:05.119 --> 01:43:06.070 align:start position:0%
included within the
um

01:43:06.070 --> 01:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:08.070 --> 01:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
scope of
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
of this current 10-year plan
 
01:43:12.149 --> 01:43:12.159 align:start position:0%
i do have
 
01:43:12.159 --> 01:43:13.189 align:start position:0%
i do have
one

01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
question that was brought to me
 
01:43:18.229 --> 01:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
by the city
 
01:43:18.239 --> 01:43:19.990 align:start position:0%
by the city
on

01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
how do
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
they go about proposing a change
 
01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh so that a thing like uh school
 
01:43:31.990 --> 01:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
or whatever can be
 
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
used to qualify for
 
01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
sound walls on tier one
 
01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:39.669 align:start position:0%
sound walls on tier one
roads

01:43:39.669 --> 01:43:39.679 align:start position:0%
roads
 
01:43:42.229 --> 01:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
as you know we we're skipping a portion
 
01:43:42.239 --> 01:43:43.030 align:start position:0%
as you know we we're skipping a portion
of

01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
a sound wall that they think is
 
01:43:44.719 --> 01:43:48.149 align:start position:0%
a sound wall that they think is
important

01:43:48.149 --> 01:43:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
so we have an existing noise policy
 
01:43:52.470 --> 01:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
as you know
 
01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
we could talk about sound walls a type 1
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
and a type 2
 
01:44:04.149 --> 01:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
wall so type 1 walls or those that are
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
constructed as part of
 
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
a roadway project
 
01:44:10.229 --> 01:44:10.239 align:start position:0%
we still have not funded a type 2
 
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
program which would allow us to go out
 
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
and build sound walls as standalone
 
01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:15.990 align:start position:0%
and build sound walls as standalone
projects

01:44:15.990 --> 01:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:44:17.910 --> 01:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
so the reason we are
 
01:44:19.350 --> 01:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
proposing constructing walls in
 
01:44:22.149 --> 01:44:22.159 align:start position:0%
portsmouth is because we're doing
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
a project in 95 to implement shoulder
 
01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
running and because
 
01:44:29.669 --> 01:44:29.679 align:start position:0%
we're advancing that work we did an
 
01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
assessment of the sound
 
01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:32.470 align:start position:0%
assessment of the sound
levels

01:44:32.470 --> 01:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
levels
 
01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
and applied our policy criteria and then
 
01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
identified that certain segments of wall
 
01:44:38.870 --> 01:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
were warranted
 
01:44:41.669 --> 01:44:41.679 align:start position:0%
we do continue to review and evaluate
 
01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
our policy and we look at examples from
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
across the country as well as federal
 
01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
guidelines as it pertains to noise
 
01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:49.270 align:start position:0%
guidelines as it pertains to noise
mitigation

01:44:49.270 --> 01:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
mitigation
 
01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:50.310 align:start position:0%
mitigation
and

01:44:50.310 --> 01:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:52.629 --> 01:44:52.639 align:start position:0%
we believe that we are applying sort of
 
01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
the industry standards in this area and
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
but certainly if the legislature or
 
01:44:58.950 --> 01:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
others want us to take a second look at
 
01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
our policy
 
01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:01.030 align:start position:0%
our policy
we

01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
are always willing to
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
um see what flexibilities we do have as
 
01:45:07.510 --> 01:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative query
 
01:45:12.149 --> 01:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um
 
01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
so just on the sound barrier like i
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
think i've mentioned it before and
 
01:45:20.310 --> 01:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
potentially changing how we
 
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
allow for public spaces including
 
01:45:24.070 --> 01:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
schools parks
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
and recreation areas
 
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
as far as i'm aware right now it's the
 
01:45:31.189 --> 01:45:31.199 align:start position:0%
population density is measured
 
01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
the full 24 7 not just daytime would
 
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
making an ex
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
exclusion or an exemption for
 
01:45:43.750 --> 01:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
public spaces for just daytime
 
01:45:46.709 --> 01:45:46.719 align:start position:0%
population density would that help
 
01:45:50.229 --> 01:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
in matters like this school or parks
 
01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
so that say like during the hours of 6
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:58.709 --> 01:45:58.719 align:start position:0%
um we can take a closer look at that but
 
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
i don't believe so representative um
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
the way that we
 
01:46:05.590 --> 01:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
assess who is a receptor and then
 
01:46:07.990 --> 01:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
evaluate the density of those receptors
 
01:46:11.189 --> 01:46:11.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know that even if we
 
01:46:13.189 --> 01:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
only looked at the criteria over the
 
01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
daytime hours it would change the
 
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
outcome in terms of who qualifies for a
 
01:46:18.629 --> 01:46:18.639 align:start position:0%
sound wall
 
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:24.149 --> 01:46:24.159 align:start position:0%
as you know commissioner having sat
 
01:46:24.159 --> 01:46:25.270 align:start position:0%
as you know commissioner having sat
through

01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:46:27.510 --> 01:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
all this for a couple of years sidewalls
 
01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:28.470 align:start position:0%
all this for a couple of years sidewalls
are

01:46:28.470 --> 01:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
a big deal for many members of this
 
01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:32.390 align:start position:0%
a big deal for many members of this
committee

01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
i remember having to go to
 
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
the town of merrimack and
 
01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:37.830 align:start position:0%
the town of merrimack and
and

01:46:37.830 --> 01:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:39.669 --> 01:46:39.679 align:start position:0%
talk about the
 
01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
being built in
 
01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:43.189 align:start position:0%
being built in
um

01:46:43.189 --> 01:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
yeah along the effie ever at about
 
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
i was in the minority and i still had to
 
01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
go do it i don't understand that one but
 
01:46:53.109 --> 01:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
01:46:54.790 --> 01:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
it's still um
 
01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
will continue to be a problem
 
01:47:00.629 --> 01:47:00.639 align:start position:0%
um as as we
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
widen roads um traffic goes up so i
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
think that you and your successors we'll
 
01:47:10.149 --> 01:47:10.159 align:start position:0%
continue to hear this almost along every
 
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
road that has
 
01:47:14.070 --> 01:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
heavy traffic especially
 
01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
and as
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
we develop more land along those routes
 
01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
i don't see an easy solution and i think
 
01:47:24.709 --> 01:47:24.719 align:start position:0%
at one point you said if we would put
 
01:47:26.950 --> 01:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
them up every place that people think
 
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's in the 200 million range
 
01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
so several years ago we had done a study
 
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
and we looked at across the entire
 
01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:37.030 align:start position:0%
and we looked at across the entire
network

01:47:37.030 --> 01:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
network
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
if you apply today's standards to
 
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
our highway system in what locations
 
01:47:45.270 --> 01:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
would qualify for a sound wall
 
01:47:47.590 --> 01:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
and so as we're doing projects as we're
 
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
widening highways you know in the case
 
01:47:51.510 --> 01:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
of this project
 
01:47:53.590 --> 01:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
in portsmouth on 95
 
01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
people are always looking for us to
 
01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
broaden the criteria so that as part of
 
01:48:00.070 --> 01:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
that project we construct more walls
 
01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
but we keep emphasizing that even under
 
01:48:03.669 --> 01:48:03.679 align:start position:0%
the existing criteria there are
 
01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
communities that would be deserving of a
 
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
sound wall the issue is we don't have a
 
01:48:09.990 --> 01:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
funded type 2 program a
 
01:48:13.109 --> 01:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
funding to go out and do standalone
 
01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
projects purely to install sound walls
 
01:48:17.590 --> 01:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
and so we're very concerned about this
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
from an equity perspective
 
01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:20.950 align:start position:0%
from an equity perspective
um

01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:23.510 --> 01:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
while we're sympathetic to those who
 
01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
have advocated for additional walls
 
01:48:26.950 --> 01:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
within projects
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
we are just as sympathetic to those
 
01:48:30.870 --> 01:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
communities who have noise problems
 
01:48:32.790 --> 01:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
today there is no work planned in their
 
01:48:34.629 --> 01:48:34.639 align:start position:0%
area and therefore there is no sound
 
01:48:36.870 --> 01:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
wall proposed despite the fact they do
 
01:48:40.550 --> 01:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
meet the density requirements etc etc so
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
we try to bring attention to both issues
 
01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
um the fact that individuals would like
 
01:48:46.709 --> 01:48:46.719 align:start position:0%
more walls as part of projects but that
 
01:48:48.149 --> 01:48:48.159 align:start position:0%
we also have
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
many many locations that would be
 
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
deserving of a sound wall following the
 
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
current criteria we just don't have the
 
01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:00.719 align:start position:0%
i reserve thompson
 
01:49:02.310 --> 01:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner thank you for coming again
 
01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:05.750 align:start position:0%
commissioner thank you for coming again
today

01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
is the criteria different for turnpikes
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
than it is for
 
01:49:13.750 --> 01:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
the highway system in general or
 
01:49:16.470 --> 01:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
and the reason i ask is
 
01:49:18.229 --> 01:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
i went down the spalding turnpike the
 
01:49:21.189 --> 01:49:21.199 align:start position:0%
other day from dover toll to great bay
 
01:49:24.229 --> 01:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
and they've got these what i consider to
 
01:49:26.229 --> 01:49:26.239 align:start position:0%
be horrendous walls it's like you're
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
well not downtown maybe just anywhere in
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
new jersey
 
01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
the walls go up
 
01:49:38.229 --> 01:49:38.239 align:start position:0%
14 or 18 feet high you can't see the
 
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods and i just didn't see the
 
01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:42.719 align:start position:0%
justification for it there
 
01:49:45.189 --> 01:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
and we're a tourist state we want people
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
to see the things around the highways
 
01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
and i sympathize with these people who
 
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
live in these neighborhoods but
 
01:49:56.550 --> 01:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
down in great bay in particular we
 
01:49:56.560 --> 01:49:57.990 align:start position:0%
down in great bay in particular we
should

01:49:57.990 --> 01:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:49:59.669 --> 01:49:59.679 align:start position:0%
not be putting up this many of these
 
01:50:02.149 --> 01:50:02.159 align:start position:0%
walls we apply the same standards to all
 
01:50:04.629 --> 01:50:04.639 align:start position:0%
projects um the difference is we've done
 
01:50:06.709 --> 01:50:06.719 align:start position:0%
extensive widening on the spalding
 
01:50:09.589 --> 01:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
turnpike therefore we've assessed noise
 
01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
and then built the sound walls as part
 
01:50:13.270 --> 01:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
of those projects you know likewise as
 
01:50:15.910 --> 01:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
we widened i-93 from salem to manchester
 
01:50:17.910 --> 01:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
for those areas that qualified we built
 
01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
sound walls
 
01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned there's
 
01:50:23.109 --> 01:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
locations elsewhere in the state where
 
01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
we haven't done a project and so the
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
sections of 101 and sections of 93
 
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
beyond where we did the widening project
 
01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
that would be eligible for sound walls
 
01:50:37.589 --> 01:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
so we apply consistent criteria
 
01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
why you don't see it in other locations
 
01:50:40.629 --> 01:50:40.639 align:start position:0%
as those sections were widened before
 
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
the sound criteria was in place okay
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:50.070 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:50:50.070 --> 01:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:50:52.950 --> 01:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
i'm i should be able to recall but
 
01:50:55.350 --> 01:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately as i age
 
01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
that becomes more of a problem
 
01:51:01.990 --> 01:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
but what is the life expectancy
 
01:51:05.189 --> 01:51:05.199 align:start position:0%
for the existing sound walls that we
 
01:51:05.199 --> 01:51:06.790 align:start position:0%
for the existing sound walls that we
have

01:51:06.790 --> 01:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:51:09.189 --> 01:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
so that is one of our current challenges
 
01:51:10.709 --> 01:51:10.719 align:start position:0%
that not only do we have inadequate
 
01:51:13.270 --> 01:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
funding to build additional walls and
 
01:51:15.189 --> 01:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
we're now at a point where we're trying
 
01:51:15.199 --> 01:51:16.070 align:start position:0%
we're now at a point where we're trying
to

01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:51:17.910 --> 01:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
understand what the maintenance and
 
01:51:19.910 --> 01:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
repair needs are for existing systems so
 
01:51:22.629 --> 01:51:22.639 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask pete to talk to that
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
pete stamnis director of project
 
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.669 align:start position:0%
pete stamnis director of project
development

01:51:27.669 --> 01:51:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
we understand that most of the walls
 
01:51:32.229 --> 01:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
affect all of the walls that have been
 
01:51:32.239 --> 01:51:34.390 align:start position:0%
affect all of the walls that have been
constructed

01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
constructed
 
01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
within the last 20 years
 
01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:37.430 align:start position:0%
within the last 20 years
along

01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
along
 
01:51:40.629 --> 01:51:40.639 align:start position:0%
the highways as part of type 1
 
01:51:40.639 --> 01:51:41.990 align:start position:0%
the highways as part of type 1
policy

01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:42.870 align:start position:0%
policy
are

01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
made from wood
 
01:51:47.109 --> 01:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
and certainly there's a life
 
01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
span of that material we haven't begun
 
01:51:53.189 --> 01:51:53.199 align:start position:0%
replacing them yet but it's on the
 
01:51:53.199 --> 01:51:55.030 align:start position:0%
replacing them yet but it's on the
horizon

01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
horizon
 
01:51:57.910 --> 01:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
and because of that we've made a recent
 
01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
change that we're
 
01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:01.270 align:start position:0%
change that we're
finalizing

01:52:01.270 --> 01:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
finalizing
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
the wood walls would then become
 
01:52:07.830 --> 01:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
in in new installations would become
 
01:52:11.270 --> 01:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
precast concrete to extend the overall
 
01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:12.629 align:start position:0%
precast concrete to extend the overall
life

01:52:12.629 --> 01:52:12.639 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:52:12.639 --> 01:52:13.589 align:start position:0%
life
span

01:52:13.589 --> 01:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
span
 
01:52:16.310 --> 01:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
of the walls themselves and we find that
 
01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:18.070 align:start position:0%
of the walls themselves and we find that
they're

01:52:18.070 --> 01:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:52:21.189 --> 01:52:21.199 align:start position:0%
if you look at the life cycle costs that
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
this change would uh be
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
cost savings overall to the state so
 
01:52:30.550 --> 01:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
representative claudia
 
01:52:40.229 --> 01:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i i i'm going
 
01:52:41.910 --> 01:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
to ask the question i wanted to ask this
 
01:52:43.669 --> 01:52:43.679 align:start position:0%
morning if you don't mind
 
01:52:45.750 --> 01:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about the funding the
 
01:52:47.669 --> 01:52:47.679 align:start position:0%
proper funding of sowell some of the
 
01:52:49.189 --> 01:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
proposed sound walls are going to be
 
01:52:50.950 --> 01:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
built along turnpike some are going to
 
01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
be built along highways
 
01:52:54.709 --> 01:52:54.719 align:start position:0%
is it
 
01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
are you required when building a saw
 
01:52:59.430 --> 01:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
well for example it's along a turnpike
 
01:53:02.390 --> 01:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
to only use funds from the turnpike
 
01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:03.350 align:start position:0%
to only use funds from the turnpike
system

01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:53:05.430 --> 01:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
for those type of sound walls or
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
barriers and then for those built along
 
01:53:09.750 --> 01:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
highways are you only supposed to use
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
highway funds
 
01:53:14.310 --> 01:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
to erect those barriers and is it
 
01:53:16.470 --> 01:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
legal or constitutional
 
01:53:21.270 --> 01:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:23.669 --> 01:53:23.679 align:start position:0%
so when we are advancing a federal
 
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
project then
 
01:53:26.950 --> 01:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
through the environmental permitting
 
01:53:28.950 --> 01:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
process we're required to look at noise
 
01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:29.990 align:start position:0%
process we're required to look at noise
impacts

01:53:29.990 --> 01:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
01:53:31.830 --> 01:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
and then we can use federal funds to
 
01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
where there's restrictions is for
 
01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
example we could never use turnpike
 
01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:39.350 align:start position:0%
example we could never use turnpike
money

01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:53:41.270 --> 01:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
beyond the turnpike the dollars
 
01:53:42.629 --> 01:53:42.639 align:start position:0%
collected on the turnpike system can
 
01:53:45.109 --> 01:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
only be used on the turnpike system
 
01:53:47.189 --> 01:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
however we can use federal funds on the
 
01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
turnpike we can also use state funds on
 
01:53:51.669 --> 01:53:51.679 align:start position:0%
the turnpike but many times we choose
 
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
not to
 
01:53:55.510 --> 01:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
the reason being if we use any federal
 
01:53:58.149 --> 01:53:58.159 align:start position:0%
funds on a section of turnpike then
 
01:53:59.910 --> 01:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
federal rules will be applied to that
 
01:54:02.629 --> 01:54:02.639 align:start position:0%
section of turnpike in perpetuity
 
01:54:05.910 --> 01:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
because we accepted federal funding so
 
01:54:09.189 --> 01:54:09.199 align:start position:0%
there are many advantages to continuing
 
01:54:11.350 --> 01:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
to maintain control of the sections of
 
01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:12.390 align:start position:0%
to maintain control of the sections of
roadway

01:54:12.390 --> 01:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
roadway
 
01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
that were turnpike before the
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
federal-aid highway system was
 
01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:17.109 align:start position:0%
federal-aid highway system was
established

01:54:17.109 --> 01:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
established
 
01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
and so representative as an example i-95
 
01:54:21.990 --> 01:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
we're choosing to fund the sound walls
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
on 95 with federal funds
 
01:54:27.589 --> 01:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
because i-95 was part of the state
 
01:54:28.950 --> 01:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
highway system
 
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
for a long time we used federal funds on
 
01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
95 in the past and then
 
01:54:35.589 --> 01:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
for those of you that have been on the
 
01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
committee for a longer time you'll
 
01:54:38.790 --> 01:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
remember that we actually sold the i-95
 
01:54:41.109 --> 01:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
bridge to the turnpike and made it part
 
01:54:43.109 --> 01:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
of the turnpike system so having already
 
01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
used federal funds we have no concern
 
01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
about using federal funds for the sound
 
01:54:49.270 --> 01:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
walls even though we're advancing the
 
01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
shoulder running project with turnpike
 
01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:51.910 align:start position:0%
shoulder running project with turnpike
dollars

01:54:51.910 --> 01:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:54:53.910 --> 01:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
um so the only strict prohibition is we
 
01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
cannot use turnpike funding beyond the
 
01:54:56.159 --> 01:54:57.430 align:start position:0%
cannot use turnpike funding beyond the
turnpike

01:54:57.430 --> 01:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
turnpike
 
01:54:59.189 --> 01:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
um we technically can use federal and
 
01:55:01.350 --> 01:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
state funds on the turnpike system
 
01:55:02.790 --> 01:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
but there are reasons why we would
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
choose not to
 
01:55:09.510 --> 01:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:12.149 --> 01:55:12.159 align:start position:0%
representative faulkner
 
01:55:13.270 --> 01:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:14.070 align:start position:0%
thank you
the

01:55:14.070 --> 01:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
question i have is do you have a
 
01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
standard design where you put a wall in
 
01:55:19.990 --> 01:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
is always
 
01:55:22.070 --> 01:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
to a standard design and is there any
 
01:55:23.990 --> 01:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
pressure to kind of
 
01:55:26.470 --> 01:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
upgrade the aesthetics uh which i
 
01:55:30.149 --> 01:55:30.159 align:start position:0%
imagine would also upgrade the cost or
 
01:55:31.669 --> 01:55:31.679 align:start position:0%
are people just happy to get some
 
01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
something to block the noise
 
01:55:36.629 --> 01:55:36.639 align:start position:0%
um as pete indicated one of the things
 
01:55:38.229 --> 01:55:38.239 align:start position:0%
we're pursuing is
 
01:55:38.239 --> 01:55:39.990 align:start position:0%
we're pursuing is
replacing

01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
replacing
 
01:55:42.709 --> 01:55:42.719 align:start position:0%
our wooden walls with concrete when the
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
time comes because we are looking at the
 
01:55:47.589 --> 01:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
life expectancy and the life cycle costs
 
01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
but yes as we work with communities
 
01:55:51.669 --> 01:55:51.679 align:start position:0%
there is concerns about aesthetics
 
01:55:51.679 --> 01:55:52.629 align:start position:0%
there is concerns about aesthetics
um

01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:52.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know in particular we've seen a lot
 
01:55:55.830 --> 01:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
of graffiti on some of our sound walls
 
01:55:57.669 --> 01:55:57.679 align:start position:0%
and trying to keep up with graffiti
 
01:56:00.390 --> 01:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
removal is challenging
 
01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:01.350 align:start position:0%
removal is challenging
so

01:56:01.350 --> 01:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
certainly there's discussions about
 
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's appropriate to put
 
01:56:05.589 --> 01:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
in plantings or things that would
 
01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
discourage people from accessing the
 
01:56:08.709 --> 01:56:08.719 align:start position:0%
sound walls
 
01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
and so we do take that into
 
01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:11.669 align:start position:0%
and so we do take that into
consideration

01:56:11.669 --> 01:56:11.679 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:56:11.679 --> 01:56:12.470 align:start position:0%
consideration
but

01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:56:14.790 --> 01:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
you know from our perspective it's about
 
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
um life cycle cost and what is the most
 
01:56:19.189 --> 01:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
prudent solution
 
01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
um from that perspective i don't know
 
01:56:25.270 --> 01:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:28.070 --> 01:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
there will be opportunities to enhance
 
01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:28.870 align:start position:0%
there will be opportunities to enhance
the

01:56:28.870 --> 01:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:56:31.030 --> 01:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
the look of the
 
01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
sound wall the most visible portion of
 
01:56:36.470 --> 01:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
it with a transition to
 
01:56:38.229 --> 01:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
precast concrete
 
01:56:41.830 --> 01:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
there are things that can be done
 
01:56:43.990 --> 01:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
but we haven't really we haven't
 
01:56:45.589 --> 01:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
massachusetts puts them in that way and
 
01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
they do have some panel
 
01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
liners that they can that can
 
01:56:52.390 --> 01:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
put a
 
01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
different surface you know texture to
 
01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:56.719 align:start position:0%
the panel itself and there have been
 
01:56:59.350 --> 01:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
some you probably noticed in
 
01:57:01.830 --> 01:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
in a couple of locations um they had
 
01:57:04.149 --> 01:57:04.159 align:start position:0%
supplied a a
 
01:57:06.310 --> 01:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
precast concrete panel with a you know
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
put on the panel itself there's one i
 
01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
think in in the newington dover project
 
01:57:15.430 --> 01:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
on the uh on the dover side and i think
 
01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
there might be one on i-93 also so
 
01:57:19.589 --> 01:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
there's opportunities to do things uh
 
01:57:25.270 --> 01:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:27.830 --> 01:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um i have
 
01:57:31.030 --> 01:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
two questions uh on separate things um
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
one would be
 
01:57:33.589 --> 01:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
just off of what we're talking about now
 
01:57:35.510 --> 01:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
for aesthetic reasons
 
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:38.390 align:start position:0%
um and
anti-graffiti

01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
anti-graffiti
 
01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:39.830 align:start position:0%
anti-graffiti
uh

01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
it whatever you want to call that um
 
01:57:44.310 --> 01:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
have you
 
01:57:47.030 --> 01:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
thought or have you allowed communities
 
01:57:48.709 --> 01:57:48.719 align:start position:0%
to put together
 
01:57:48.719 --> 01:57:50.310 align:start position:0%
to put together
um

01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
projects where
 
01:57:53.669 --> 01:57:53.679 align:start position:0%
murals could be painted on these because
 
01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:55.679 align:start position:0%
i do know that that's quite successful
 
01:57:57.750 --> 01:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
at stopping people from
 
01:58:00.629 --> 01:58:00.639 align:start position:0%
tagging um in case you all didn't know i
 
01:58:02.790 --> 01:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
do have a degree in art so it's it is
 
01:58:04.390 --> 01:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
something that i
 
01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh know quite well um
 
01:58:08.790 --> 01:58:08.800 align:start position:0%
and these don't have to be detailed
 
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
because obviously we don't want to make
 
01:58:11.830 --> 01:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
it too distracting that people start
 
01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:13.679 align:start position:0%
staring at the wall instead of paying
 
01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
attention to road conditions
 
01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:16.229 align:start position:0%
attention to road conditions
but

01:58:16.229 --> 01:58:16.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:58:18.870 --> 01:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
just kind of a general painting
 
01:58:20.950 --> 01:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
is that allowed um so that's something
 
01:58:23.270 --> 01:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
that we have discussed if we go to a
 
01:58:26.310 --> 01:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
concrete standard and it's precast then
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
maybe we don't do the form liners that
 
01:58:30.149 --> 01:58:30.159 align:start position:0%
pete described and give texture to the
 
01:58:32.070 --> 01:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
panel if it was a flat surface then
 
01:58:33.669 --> 01:58:33.679 align:start position:0%
maybe we could work with communities on
 
01:58:36.790 --> 01:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
murals in addition to
 
01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:38.320 align:start position:0%
what pete described where we embossed
 
01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
the state seal or something into a panel
 
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
um other parts of the country they have
 
01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
had some success
 
01:58:45.990 --> 01:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
what they found is that
 
01:58:48.149 --> 01:58:48.159 align:start position:0%
um for the true graffiti artists they
 
01:58:50.310 --> 01:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
are artists as well that they won't
 
01:58:52.629 --> 01:58:52.639 align:start position:0%
destroy somebody else's work um so
 
01:58:54.149 --> 01:58:54.159 align:start position:0%
murals have
 
01:58:56.149 --> 01:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
held up over time
 
01:58:57.750 --> 01:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
of course it depends on the location how
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
accessible it is but we definitely would
 
01:59:02.149 --> 01:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
have more opportunity to look at that if
 
01:59:04.390 --> 01:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
we're using concrete over wood
 
01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:07.189 align:start position:0%
we're using concrete over wood
great

01:59:07.189 --> 01:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:10.790 --> 01:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
um and then my second question is
 
01:59:12.709 --> 01:59:12.719 align:start position:0%
i've just been reading some articles
 
01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
about the effectiveness of basically the
 
01:59:16.790 --> 01:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
throw of the sound that
 
01:59:19.109 --> 01:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
as you get to about
 
01:59:20.629 --> 01:59:20.639 align:start position:0%
500 feet
 
01:59:22.229 --> 01:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
away from the wall
 
01:59:22.239 --> 01:59:23.430 align:start position:0%
away from the wall
um

01:59:23.430 --> 01:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
they are ineffective
 
01:59:28.229 --> 01:59:28.239 align:start position:0%
at that point which um
 
01:59:30.070 --> 01:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
you know seems like we're putting up a
 
01:59:32.709 --> 01:59:32.719 align:start position:0%
lot of money just for the houses that
 
01:59:35.030 --> 01:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
are right next to the highway
 
01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
um but whereas
 
01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
natural or soft um sound barriers like
 
01:59:45.350 --> 01:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
shrubs trees and other things like that
 
01:59:45.360 --> 01:59:46.070 align:start position:0%
shrubs trees and other things like that
is

01:59:46.070 --> 01:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:59:47.589 --> 01:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
is the reason why we don't look into
 
01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
that more is that because of a safety
 
01:59:51.589 --> 01:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
reason of having a giant tree right next
 
01:59:54.550 --> 01:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
to the highway and now you have a an
 
01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
obstacle that may fall or
 
02:00:00.629 --> 02:00:00.639 align:start position:0%
drop branches or other debris
 
02:00:03.990 --> 02:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
so i would say it's much more likely
 
02:00:05.109 --> 02:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to limit the
 
02:00:07.669 --> 02:00:07.679 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts so
 
02:00:09.189 --> 02:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
if you imagine we're doing a widening
 
02:00:10.470 --> 02:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
project we're going to have to clear
 
02:00:14.229 --> 02:00:14.239 align:start position:0%
trees to install the additional travel
 
02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
lane or the
 
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
wider shoulder
 
02:00:19.109 --> 02:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:00:21.030 --> 02:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
if we don't have the right-of-way
 
02:00:23.350 --> 02:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
between the limits of the project and
 
02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
the houses then we're putting up that
 
02:00:27.350 --> 02:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
wall because it's
 
02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
the smallest footprint and provides the
 
02:00:31.830 --> 02:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
highest degree of benefit in terms of
 
02:00:34.390 --> 02:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
reducing sound we don't typically have
 
02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
the width to then
 
02:00:38.470 --> 02:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
widen the highway in addition put in
 
02:00:41.350 --> 02:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
trees and adequate plantings to truly
 
02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
and i i think um you would need probably
 
02:00:50.149 --> 02:00:50.159 align:start position:0%
a couple hundred feet of of trees in
 
02:00:52.310 --> 02:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
order to get the same effectiveness from
 
02:00:54.709 --> 02:00:54.719 align:start position:0%
a sound
 
02:00:59.910 --> 02:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:06.229 --> 02:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:11.669 --> 02:01:11.679 align:start position:0%
have you ever considered
 
02:01:15.589 --> 02:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
i know i was a contractor i designed
 
02:01:17.589 --> 02:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
commercial industrial buildings we had
 
02:01:19.669 --> 02:01:19.679 align:start position:0%
problems with sound
 
02:01:23.270 --> 02:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
we used abba vitis now the advantage to
 
02:01:26.229 --> 02:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
abba bodies as opposed to trees
 
02:01:28.709 --> 02:01:28.719 align:start position:0%
is they grow all the way to the ground
 
02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
you plant them six feet apart
 
02:01:32.550 --> 02:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
in the second row
 
02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:34.070 align:start position:0%
in the second row
alternating

02:01:34.070 --> 02:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
alternating
 
02:01:35.910 --> 02:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
in six feet this way
 
02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
nothing that even small animals can't
 
02:01:39.189 --> 02:01:39.199 align:start position:0%
get through
 
02:01:41.669 --> 02:01:41.679 align:start position:0%
and it's an effective sound barrier
 
02:01:43.109 --> 02:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
i don't know about the cost of it but
 
02:01:47.669 --> 02:01:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:49.109 --> 02:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
i grow too about i don't know that we've
 
02:01:51.910 --> 02:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
looked um specifically at the cost and
 
02:01:53.830 --> 02:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
what it would mean but
 
02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:54.790 align:start position:0%
what it would mean but
um

02:01:54.790 --> 02:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:56.950 --> 02:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
i don't believe it has the same noise
 
02:01:58.790 --> 02:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
benefits that constructing these walls
 
02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
do and that's why it's not an accepted
 
02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:02.629 align:start position:0%
do and that's why it's not an accepted
practice

02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
practice
 
02:02:04.470 --> 02:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
as pete said that the depth that we
 
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
would need for the level of um
 
02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
noise mitigation required for the
 
02:02:10.870 --> 02:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
traffic volumes that we're talking about
 
02:02:13.830 --> 02:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
on these high-speed facilities um i
 
02:02:15.589 --> 02:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
don't know that it
 
02:02:17.350 --> 02:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
would be a viable solution in this
 
02:02:19.830 --> 02:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
setting i think in lower volume areas
 
02:02:21.510 --> 02:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
along developments and such it can be
 
02:02:23.030 --> 02:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
effective but we're talking about you
 
02:02:26.950 --> 02:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
know high speed high volume
 
02:02:30.390 --> 02:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
interstate corridors and the like
 
02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
used uh plantings of that nature um to
 
02:02:38.470 --> 02:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
improve the visual
 
02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
view from those
 
02:02:42.229 --> 02:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
community or those neighborhoods that
 
02:02:45.350 --> 02:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
don't qualify for sound walls so on on
 
02:02:47.910 --> 02:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
many occasions we've had uh double rows
 
02:02:50.149 --> 02:02:50.159 align:start position:0%
of plantings of of uh fur trees
 
02:02:50.159 --> 02:02:51.430 align:start position:0%
of plantings of of uh fur trees
arborvitaes

02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
arborvitaes
 
02:02:53.189 --> 02:02:53.199 align:start position:0%
not so much mainly because the deer like
 
02:02:56.229 --> 02:02:56.239 align:start position:0%
them a lot but um but we have done that
 
02:02:59.109 --> 02:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
um as a as a
 
02:03:01.350 --> 02:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
consolation i guess you could say
 
02:03:03.510 --> 02:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
because they didn't qualify for sound
 
02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:08.310 align:start position:0%
because they didn't qualify for sound
abatement

02:03:08.310 --> 02:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
it just seems it has a lot of benefits
 
02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
it improves the value it's good to look
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
at from the highway improves the value
 
02:03:20.709 --> 02:03:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:23.189 --> 02:03:23.199 align:start position:0%
i just think you know if the noise is
 
02:03:23.199 --> 02:03:24.070 align:start position:0%
i just think you know if the noise is
that

02:03:24.070 --> 02:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:03:26.550 --> 02:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
that level maybe a third row i don't
 
02:03:28.950 --> 02:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
know i've never done a third row
 
02:03:31.510 --> 02:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
but it seems as though this you know
 
02:03:33.990 --> 02:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
that a lot of places have used
 
02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:35.510 align:start position:0%
that a lot of places have used
aberfaities

02:03:35.510 --> 02:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
aberfaities
 
02:03:36.870 --> 02:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
because they do go all the way to the
 
02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:37.830 align:start position:0%
because they do go all the way to the
ground

02:03:37.830 --> 02:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
ground
 
02:03:41.750 --> 02:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:44.709 --> 02:03:44.719 align:start position:0%
anyway that's all i have to say
 
02:03:44.719 --> 02:03:46.950 align:start position:0%
anyway that's all i have to say
dennis

02:03:46.950 --> 02:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
dennis
 
02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:47.910 align:start position:0%
dennis
um

02:03:47.910 --> 02:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:52.629 --> 02:03:52.639 align:start position:0%
i agree with with representative fidolfi
 
02:03:54.310 --> 02:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
i've been in the construction business
 
02:03:57.270 --> 02:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
45 years worked many
 
02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
years on the highways
 
02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:01.750 align:start position:0%
years on the highways
and

02:04:01.750 --> 02:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
we did install berms
 
02:04:06.550 --> 02:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
with abervides sometimes we did
 
02:04:08.950 --> 02:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
adverbities with a
 
02:04:12.310 --> 02:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
um as he suggested offset with a fence
 
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
down the middle and no it doesn't
 
02:04:18.550 --> 02:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't give you the same uh
 
02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
sound retention that these walls that
 
02:04:22.470 --> 02:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
you've put up with
 
02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:23.510 align:start position:0%
you've put up with
would

02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
but in many cases i think
 
02:04:29.430 --> 02:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
it would just make the people feel
 
02:04:32.790 --> 02:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
better that you've made an effort
 
02:04:35.750 --> 02:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
in maybe what is a limited right of way
 
02:04:37.589 --> 02:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
in a neighborhood
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
you know and i can think of one in
 
02:04:40.950 --> 02:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
particular in bedford
 
02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:42.629 align:start position:0%
particular in bedford
um

02:04:42.629 --> 02:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:44.790 --> 02:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
my uh
 
02:04:46.310 --> 02:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
the second part of my question is have
 
02:04:48.390 --> 02:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
you done any testing on the back side of
 
02:04:49.669 --> 02:04:49.679 align:start position:0%
these walls
 
02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
to see what the actual sound reduction
 
02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:53.430 align:start position:0%
to see what the actual sound reduction
is

02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:04:55.030 --> 02:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
i mean obviously there's going to be
 
02:04:57.189 --> 02:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
some but is it
 
02:04:57.199 --> 02:04:58.629 align:start position:0%
some but is it
sufficient

02:04:58.629 --> 02:04:58.639 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
02:05:00.310 --> 02:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
to warrant the
 
02:05:02.310 --> 02:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars that we spend on
 
02:05:05.270 --> 02:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:07.510 --> 02:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
we do thorough sound analysis so yes we
 
02:05:10.069 --> 02:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
put um equipment out and we measure the
 
02:05:12.550 --> 02:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
existing sound levels and then we
 
02:05:14.470 --> 02:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
have done post construction monitoring
 
02:05:17.270 --> 02:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
that's why we now have able to identify
 
02:05:18.709 --> 02:05:18.719 align:start position:0%
locations in the state that would
 
02:05:21.189 --> 02:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
qualify for sound walls if we had a type
 
02:05:23.350 --> 02:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
2 program
 
02:05:25.830 --> 02:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
the sound reduction is noticeable if
 
02:05:27.990 --> 02:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
you've ever
 
02:05:31.189 --> 02:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
one place that i walked recently there's
 
02:05:33.589 --> 02:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
a path along the
 
02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
dover side of the new dover project
 
02:05:39.910 --> 02:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
um that was behind a sound wall and
 
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:05:43.589 --> 02:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
before and afters it's it's noticeable
 
02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
and it does um there
 
02:05:48.069 --> 02:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
there the way it works is it basically
 
02:05:49.589 --> 02:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
creates a
 
02:05:52.229 --> 02:05:52.239 align:start position:0%
i think somewhat coined it as a as a uh
 
02:05:53.910 --> 02:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
a sound shadow
 
02:05:56.229 --> 02:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
so based on the height of the wall and
 
02:05:58.390 --> 02:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
the you know sound travels in a straight
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
line so it creates a a shadow and that
 
02:06:04.229 --> 02:06:04.239 align:start position:0%
that the areas behind the wall that are
 
02:06:05.910 --> 02:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
within that shadow would get the benefit
 
02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
of the sound and as you go further away
 
02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
you get less of a benefit so that's
 
02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
just one little further question if i
 
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
may mr speaker um a number quite a
 
02:06:23.669 --> 02:06:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:23.679 --> 02:06:25.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:06:25.189 --> 02:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
quite a number of years ago there was a
 
02:06:30.390 --> 02:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
system constructed down by candia road
 
02:06:34.149 --> 02:06:34.159 align:start position:0%
on 101 i think mitchy corporation built
 
02:06:34.159 --> 02:06:35.589 align:start position:0%
on 101 i think mitchy corporation built
those

02:06:35.589 --> 02:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
i can only think to call them a hog
 
02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:39.030 align:start position:0%
i can only think to call them a hog
trough

02:06:39.030 --> 02:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
trough
 
02:06:41.270 --> 02:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
where they sat inside of each other and
 
02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
there were
 
02:06:45.589 --> 02:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
there was some biology built into the
 
02:06:47.189 --> 02:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
built into that too i wondered i've
 
02:06:49.030 --> 02:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
never seen one since i wondered what
 
02:06:50.310 --> 02:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
happened to that
 
02:06:53.270 --> 02:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
system it's called an evergreen wall and
 
02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
the only way it stays green is if you
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
water it
 
02:06:59.030 --> 02:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
and that's uh part of the problem okay
 
02:07:01.189 --> 02:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
is the long-term maintenance
 
02:07:03.990 --> 02:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:06.069 --> 02:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
representative edgar
 
02:07:07.669 --> 02:07:07.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:07:10.149 --> 02:07:10.159 align:start position:0%
and uh thanks for taking my question
 
02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
i'm back to the m back to the portsmouth
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh sound walls
 
02:07:14.159 --> 02:07:15.109 align:start position:0%
uh sound walls
and

02:07:15.109 --> 02:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
i was wondering has there been a cost
 
02:07:19.189 --> 02:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
estimate for what it would take to
 
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
actually fill a gap around the school to
 
02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:22.629 align:start position:0%
actually fill a gap around the school to
put

02:07:22.629 --> 02:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
put
 
02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
02:07:26.950 --> 02:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
sound wall system in
 
02:07:28.310 --> 02:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
i'd be interested to know one of the
 
02:07:29.830 --> 02:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
reasons is because the chairman said if
 
02:07:31.350 --> 02:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to try to make any
 
02:07:33.510 --> 02:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
additions or changes you had to
 
02:07:34.870 --> 02:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
be able to give something up or make
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:41.910 --> 02:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that we have run an
 
02:07:44.709 --> 02:07:44.719 align:start position:0%
accurate cost estimate for what it would
 
02:07:44.719 --> 02:07:45.669 align:start position:0%
accurate cost estimate for what it would
um

02:07:45.669 --> 02:07:45.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
we'd have to budget
 
02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
to cover the cost of that location
 
02:07:51.030 --> 02:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
what we have been cautioning is if we
 
02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:56.470 --> 02:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
because we have done this analysis
 
02:07:58.149 --> 02:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
across the state of all the locations
 
02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
that qualify for sound walls if we were
 
02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
to build this section in portsmouth then
 
02:08:05.189 --> 02:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
there are many many other communities
 
02:08:07.109 --> 02:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
that would be making the case that they
 
02:08:09.189 --> 02:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
too should receive a sound wall
 
02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
as i said we're trying to follow the
 
02:08:14.950 --> 02:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
policy and even following that policy
 
02:08:17.109 --> 02:08:17.119 align:start position:0%
we're not able to mitigate noise in all
 
02:08:18.390 --> 02:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
of the communities that would be
 
02:08:20.310 --> 02:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
deserving um
 
02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:21.109 align:start position:0%
deserving um
and

02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:08:22.390 --> 02:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
i think representative you asked the
 
02:08:23.510 --> 02:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
question earlier what is the order of
 
02:08:26.069 --> 02:08:26.079 align:start position:0%
magnitude at the time that we had looked
 
02:08:27.990 --> 02:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
at the 49
 
02:08:31.589 --> 02:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
50 or so locations that would meet the
 
02:08:31.599 --> 02:08:32.709 align:start position:0%
50 or so locations that would meet the
criteria

02:08:32.709 --> 02:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
02:08:34.229 --> 02:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
it was going to be approximately 120.
 
02:08:41.910 --> 02:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
25 130 million um
 
02:08:43.750 --> 02:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
but that's dated information now if we
 
02:08:46.069 --> 02:08:46.079 align:start position:0%
were to apply today's dollars
 
02:08:48.229 --> 02:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
it probably would be closer to
 
02:08:48.239 --> 02:08:49.750 align:start position:0%
it probably would be closer to
175

02:08:49.750 --> 02:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
175
 
02:08:51.510 --> 02:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars just to tackle those
 
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:59.030 --> 02:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you mr chairman
 
02:09:01.510 --> 02:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
um well one of the reasons i asked is i
 
02:09:03.830 --> 02:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
i know that uh you provided us
 
02:09:05.669 --> 02:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
information in the past it was a pretty
 
02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
thick packet
 
02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:08.310 align:start position:0%
thick packet
that

02:09:08.310 --> 02:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:09:10.550 --> 02:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned the different criteria and
 
02:09:12.069 --> 02:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
where the needs were
 
02:09:14.229 --> 02:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
throughout the state but you are working
 
02:09:16.470 --> 02:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
right now in that area and it kind of
 
02:09:18.149 --> 02:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
makes it a little bit different in a way
 
02:09:19.510 --> 02:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
to me anyway
 
02:09:22.229 --> 02:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
at least to consider it and that's why i
 
02:09:24.629 --> 02:09:24.639 align:start position:0%
asked the question so uh thank you for
 
02:09:28.470 --> 02:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:31.270 --> 02:09:31.280 align:start position:0%
thank you i think that we have
 
02:09:33.270 --> 02:09:33.280 align:start position:0%
talked a lot about sound walls and
 
02:09:35.669 --> 02:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
construction there are sound walls
 
02:09:37.910 --> 02:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
within the 10-year plan
 
02:09:41.189 --> 02:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
if we want to move them around remember
 
02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
that this is a zero-sum game
 
02:09:47.830 --> 02:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
if we move something into a given year
 
02:09:49.990 --> 02:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
we have to move something out with the
 
02:09:51.669 --> 02:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
equivalent dollars
 
02:09:54.069 --> 02:09:54.079 align:start position:0%
it makes our job a little tougher if we
 
02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
want to make any changes
 
02:09:56.159 --> 02:09:57.750 align:start position:0%
want to make any changes
um

02:09:57.750 --> 02:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:01.589 --> 02:10:01.599 align:start position:0%
but it's not impossible for us to do um
 
02:10:04.069 --> 02:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
the governor and the the executive
 
02:10:06.149 --> 02:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
council has proposed
 
02:10:08.790 --> 02:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
uh uh plan and we have that draft but we
 
02:10:10.550 --> 02:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
can work on that
 
02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:11.510 align:start position:0%
can work on that
um

02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:14.229 --> 02:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
let's go to
 
02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
hudson's circumvention highway
 
02:10:20.149 --> 02:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
i know that it was not included in the
 
02:10:20.159 --> 02:10:21.350 align:start position:0%
i know that it was not included in the
draft

02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
draft
 
02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
but i also know that there are
 
02:10:27.510 --> 02:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
representatives of of hudson who are
 
02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
working hard to try to get it put back
 
02:10:31.750 --> 02:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
into the plan
 
02:10:33.750 --> 02:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
as it goes through the legislative
 
02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:35.189 align:start position:0%
as it goes through the legislative
process

02:10:35.189 --> 02:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:10:37.270 --> 02:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
can you explain how how it could be
 
02:10:39.350 --> 02:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
funded or not be funded or what you know
 
02:10:44.149 --> 02:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:46.709 --> 02:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
so on tuesday evening i was made aware
 
02:10:49.030 --> 02:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
that a number of the reps in hudson are
 
02:10:50.950 --> 02:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
interested in having the circumferential
 
02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
added to the 10-year plan
 
02:10:54.149 --> 02:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
i'll be honest i have not had a chance
 
02:10:56.390 --> 02:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
to reach out to any of the
 
02:10:57.830 --> 02:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
representatives from hudson to talk
 
02:11:00.310 --> 02:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
about what their request would be
 
02:11:02.790 --> 02:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if they're
 
02:11:04.950 --> 02:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
asking that the project be
 
02:11:07.830 --> 02:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
added back into the 10-year plan using
 
02:11:09.669 --> 02:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
the funding assumptions
 
02:11:11.430 --> 02:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
that were associated with the project
 
02:11:14.229 --> 02:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
when it was last in the 10-year plan
 
02:11:16.470 --> 02:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
previously what was discussed was the
 
02:11:18.790 --> 02:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
town of hudson advancing
 
02:11:20.629 --> 02:11:20.639 align:start position:0%
a conceptual design
 
02:11:21.750 --> 02:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:11:23.589 --> 02:11:23.599 align:start position:0%
submitting applications for some of the
 
02:11:26.069 --> 02:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
discretionary grant programs to access
 
02:11:28.790 --> 02:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
the dollars to construct the wall
 
02:11:31.030 --> 02:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
or sorry to construct the project
 
02:11:33.510 --> 02:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
this is a challenging location
 
02:11:36.870 --> 02:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
the hudson boulevard would be located
 
02:11:38.629 --> 02:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
on a portion of the layout that was
 
02:11:40.870 --> 02:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
identified for the circumferential
 
02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:41.910 align:start position:0%
identified for the circumferential
highway

02:11:41.910 --> 02:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
highway
 
02:11:44.310 --> 02:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
which was a roadway project that was
 
02:11:45.830 --> 02:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
never constructed
 
02:11:47.430 --> 02:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
the circumferential was supposed to
 
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
connect from
 
02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
the nashua hudson area up to litchfield
 
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
and be a true circumferential roadway to
 
02:11:57.669 --> 02:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
the turnpike
 
02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
so some of the land that has been
 
02:12:01.189 --> 02:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
acquired was purchased with turnpike
 
02:12:01.199 --> 02:12:02.310 align:start position:0%
acquired was purchased with turnpike
dollars

02:12:02.310 --> 02:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:12:04.149 --> 02:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
and so hudson boulevard would only be a
 
02:12:06.870 --> 02:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
very small piece of what was envisioned
 
02:12:09.189 --> 02:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
for the entire circumferential
 
02:12:11.589 --> 02:12:11.599 align:start position:0%
and would not necessarily have benefit
 
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
to the turnpike system
 
02:12:15.030 --> 02:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
and so that's why there was hesitation
 
02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
in the past to fund that project with
 
02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
turnpike funds
 
02:12:20.310 --> 02:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
also we've just delayed a number of our
 
02:12:22.550 --> 02:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
turnpike projects because of the revenue
 
02:12:24.870 --> 02:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
impacts during the clover 19 pandemic so
 
02:12:27.430 --> 02:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
for example exit six and seven on 293
 
02:12:29.270 --> 02:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
has been delayed the bill conquered
 
02:12:31.669 --> 02:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
widening project has been delayed
 
02:12:32.950 --> 02:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:12:35.189 --> 02:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
that factors into the
 
02:12:37.750 --> 02:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
the use of turnpike dollars
 
02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
so that would leave us with either
 
02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
federal funds or state funds
 
02:12:42.790 --> 02:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
as this committee knows we have very
 
02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
limited state funds
 
02:12:45.589 --> 02:12:45.599 align:start position:0%
so that would be an impact to our
 
02:12:47.430 --> 02:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
betterment program if we were to fund
 
02:12:49.109 --> 02:12:49.119 align:start position:0%
this project
 
02:12:51.189 --> 02:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
and then the use of federal funds
 
02:12:52.550 --> 02:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
is challenging
 
02:12:54.790 --> 02:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
um if if we were to program federal
 
02:12:56.870 --> 02:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
dollars for the design and then not move
 
02:12:59.109 --> 02:12:59.119 align:start position:0%
to construction would be
 
02:13:01.030 --> 02:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps subject to payback and have to
 
02:13:02.629 --> 02:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
pay federal highway back for those
 
02:13:04.310 --> 02:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
federal dollars
 
02:13:06.550 --> 02:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
so i really need more time since we have
 
02:13:09.589 --> 02:13:09.599 align:start position:0%
a work session scheduled for next week
 
02:13:11.109 --> 02:13:11.119 align:start position:0%
i'd like to talk to the representatives
 
02:13:13.109 --> 02:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
from hudson understand exactly what
 
02:13:15.270 --> 02:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
their thoughts are and then come back to
 
02:13:16.550 --> 02:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
the committee next week when i know a
 
02:13:17.830 --> 02:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
02:13:20.550 --> 02:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
i i would appreciate that because
 
02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise we could end up with floor
 
02:13:26.149 --> 02:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
amendments when house bill 2022 comes to
 
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
the floor and if we don't have um
 
02:13:32.470 --> 02:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
accurate information to
 
02:13:34.870 --> 02:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
either support or
 
02:13:37.270 --> 02:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
fight any type of amendment that might
 
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
come forward
 
02:13:40.950 --> 02:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful just so that we have
 
02:13:42.310 --> 02:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
the background
 
02:13:44.870 --> 02:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
background with it um keeping an open
 
02:13:47.189 --> 02:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
mind that i understand that every town
 
02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
wants to if something is dropped out
 
02:13:52.310 --> 02:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
they want to get it back in
 
02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:53.990 align:start position:0%
they want to get it back in
so

02:13:53.990 --> 02:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:13:55.830 --> 02:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
that would be useful i thank you for
 
02:13:58.069 --> 02:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
that answer and we will look forward to
 
02:13:59.910 --> 02:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
the information
 
02:14:01.669 --> 02:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
representative jack
 
02:14:04.550 --> 02:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh as best you know is this
 
02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
uh the work that's being talked about
 
02:14:08.069 --> 02:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
totally within the town of hudson
 
02:14:09.910 --> 02:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
because there's also the part
 
02:14:12.629 --> 02:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
that would go to the that the uh exit
 
02:14:14.790 --> 02:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
nine is reserved for to go across the
 
02:14:16.709 --> 02:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
river that's not being talked about i
 
02:14:17.910 --> 02:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
would assume
 
02:14:19.589 --> 02:14:19.599 align:start position:0%
this would purely be in the town of
 
02:14:21.350 --> 02:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
hudson um really they're trying to
 
02:14:24.390 --> 02:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
address the level of congestion on
 
02:14:27.669 --> 02:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
lowell road which is 3a
 
02:14:29.990 --> 02:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
by providing an alternate route within
 
02:14:31.669 --> 02:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
the town of hudson
 
02:14:33.270 --> 02:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
i just want to be clear the department
 
02:14:35.430 --> 02:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
was not the lead on this project it was
 
02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
the town that had hired a consultant to
 
02:14:39.430 --> 02:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
scope out the project
 
02:14:42.470 --> 02:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
they did submit a grant application
 
02:14:45.910 --> 02:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
they applied for a bill grant from usdot
 
02:14:48.149 --> 02:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
a few years ago
 
02:14:49.990 --> 02:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
my recollection is that they were
 
02:14:51.910 --> 02:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
estimating the design to be about 4
 
02:14:53.910 --> 02:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
million and the construction at that
 
02:14:56.310 --> 02:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
time to be 45 million
 
02:14:58.229 --> 02:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
um but they had really not advanced the
 
02:14:58.239 --> 02:14:59.510 align:start position:0%
um but they had really not advanced the
design

02:14:59.510 --> 02:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
design
 
02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:00.629 align:start position:0%
design
um

02:15:00.629 --> 02:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
to a level where you'd have high
 
02:15:03.750 --> 02:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
confidence in the budget i think that
 
02:15:04.870 --> 02:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
was one of the reasons they weren't
 
02:15:07.510 --> 02:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
successful in securing the bill grant
 
02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:08.950 align:start position:0%
successful in securing the bill grant
um

02:15:08.950 --> 02:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:10.790 --> 02:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
they wanted more confidence around the
 
02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
true cost so
 
02:15:14.950 --> 02:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
having not managed this project you know
 
02:15:17.350 --> 02:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
the the prior 10-year plan project and
 
02:15:18.790 --> 02:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
the authority that it was granted to the
 
02:15:20.149 --> 02:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
department was purely to work with the
 
02:15:23.109 --> 02:15:23.119 align:start position:0%
town of hudson and support them
 
02:15:24.950 --> 02:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
we'd have to talk to the town about what
 
02:15:26.790 --> 02:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
the current estimate would be for either
 
02:15:29.990 --> 02:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
design or construction
 
02:15:32.709 --> 02:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
02:15:32.719 --> 02:15:35.990 align:start position:0%
um thank you
representative

02:15:35.990 --> 02:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:38.149 --> 02:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
you just mentioned the concord widening
 
02:15:39.990 --> 02:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
and being delayed
 
02:15:42.310 --> 02:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
is there any way whether the new federal
 
02:15:44.550 --> 02:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
funds or anything else comes along that
 
02:15:46.229 --> 02:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
we can
 
02:15:49.109 --> 02:15:49.119 align:start position:0%
figure out anything to advance and
 
02:15:53.750 --> 02:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
accelerate the concord widening it just
 
02:15:55.350 --> 02:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
as a tourist state that's got to be one
 
02:15:56.950 --> 02:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
of the greatest embarrassments there are
 
02:15:58.550 --> 02:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
on any given friday afternoon
 
02:16:00.470 --> 02:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
particularly during the summer time
 
02:16:02.069 --> 02:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
uh the back up into the city of
 
02:16:04.149 --> 02:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
manchester as far as the city of
 
02:16:06.390 --> 02:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
manchester and beyond it rivals
 
02:16:09.589 --> 02:16:09.599 align:start position:0%
traffic jams i've been in dc or la or
 
02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
multiple other cities it's it's a state
 
02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:16.069 align:start position:0%
multiple other cities it's it's a state
embarrassment

02:16:16.069 --> 02:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:16.079 --> 02:16:16.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:16:16.790 --> 02:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:16:19.030 --> 02:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
currently um
 
02:16:22.790 --> 02:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
the turnpike ends at exit 14.
 
02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
and so this project would be
 
02:16:28.550 --> 02:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
both federally and turnpike funded um so
 
02:16:31.189 --> 02:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
for example the interchange between 89
 
02:16:33.509 --> 02:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
and 93 would be federally funded because
 
02:16:36.070 --> 02:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
89 is not part of the turnpike
 
02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
and then all of the work beyond exit 14
 
02:16:41.270 --> 02:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
which would include the merrimack
 
02:16:43.509 --> 02:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
river bridge crossing that would all be
 
02:16:45.830 --> 02:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
eligible for federal funding so while
 
02:16:48.790 --> 02:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
yes we have significant
 
02:16:50.950 --> 02:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
increases in our federal funds
 
02:16:52.469 --> 02:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
we also had a lot of other needs that
 
02:16:55.509 --> 02:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
came up during the 10-year plan process
 
02:16:55.519 --> 02:16:56.709 align:start position:0%
came up during the 10-year plan process
and

02:16:56.709 --> 02:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:16:58.469 --> 02:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
given where our turnpike revenues were
 
02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
at and the lack of available dollars for
 
02:17:04.150 --> 02:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
the sections that are turnpike funded
 
02:17:05.910 --> 02:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
and that was why the decision was made
 
02:17:07.589 --> 02:17:07.599 align:start position:0%
to push out the bill concord project and
 
02:17:09.190 --> 02:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
we really didn't hear a lot of advocacy
 
02:17:11.110 --> 02:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
during the 10-year plan hearings for
 
02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
that project to be
 
02:17:14.629 --> 02:17:14.639 align:start position:0%
done sooner
 
02:17:16.549 --> 02:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
so you know we intend to work with the
 
02:17:19.270 --> 02:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
city of concord get the layout for the
 
02:17:21.030 --> 02:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
project approved
 
02:17:22.709 --> 02:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
and then we do think that this would be
 
02:17:23.990 --> 02:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
a good candidate for some of the
 
02:17:26.230 --> 02:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
discretionary grant programs and so
 
02:17:27.830 --> 02:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of safety concerns
 
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
with the interchange between 89 and 93.
 
02:17:32.709 --> 02:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
if we have the layout approved for the
 
02:17:34.950 --> 02:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
entire corridor and can advance the
 
02:17:36.709 --> 02:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
environmental permitting
 
02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
then we'd be well positioned to compete
 
02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
for discretionary grants so that's our
 
02:17:41.669 --> 02:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
current thought
 
02:17:43.990 --> 02:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
but the we still caution if we were to
 
02:17:45.750 --> 02:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
use federal funds on the turnpike
 
02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:46.629 align:start position:0%
use federal funds on the turnpike
section

02:17:46.629 --> 02:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:17:49.270 --> 02:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
then the federal strings that come with
 
02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:50.070 align:start position:0%
then the federal strings that come with
that

02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:17:50.080 --> 02:17:51.190 align:start position:0%
that
um

02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:52.389 align:start position:0%
um
might

02:17:52.389 --> 02:17:52.399 align:start position:0%
might
 
02:17:55.190 --> 02:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
pose some concern so that's the piece
 
02:17:56.790 --> 02:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
that we have to keep discussing as we
 
02:17:58.469 --> 02:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
move forward but certainly we would
 
02:18:01.750 --> 02:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
attempt to secure federal grants for the
 
02:18:04.389 --> 02:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
federal portions and do those sooner
 
02:18:05.750 --> 02:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
and we always intended to break that
 
02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
project into multiple phases and it was
 
02:18:09.030 --> 02:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
never going to be one single
 
02:18:15.190 --> 02:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:17.190 --> 02:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner and the last one
 
02:18:20.230 --> 02:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
on on that the items for discussion from
 
02:18:22.950 --> 02:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:25.349 --> 02:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
near and dear to some people especially
 
02:18:28.150 --> 02:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
one of the executive councilors
 
02:18:31.429 --> 02:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
balsams the gulf links road
 
02:18:33.669 --> 02:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
my understanding
 
02:18:36.230 --> 02:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:18:38.870 --> 02:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
one is not in the draft plan and that if
 
02:18:42.389 --> 02:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
we were to do anything with it
 
02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
we would have to
 
02:18:46.389 --> 02:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
come up with i forget i forget the exact
 
02:18:47.990 --> 02:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
number somewhere around four million
 
02:18:49.429 --> 02:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
dollars to do
 
02:18:53.270 --> 02:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:55.910 --> 02:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
so what are your thoughts on doing that
 
02:18:58.230 --> 02:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
as we go forward
 
02:19:01.750 --> 02:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
or not or just leave it the way gasset
 
02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
proposed and not have it in the 10-year
 
02:19:06.389 --> 02:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
plan it it's a policy decision i
 
02:19:07.830 --> 02:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
understand but
 
02:19:10.150 --> 02:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
it has financial implications for your
 
02:19:14.150 --> 02:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:15.589 --> 02:19:15.599 align:start position:0%
um so at the
 
02:19:17.750 --> 02:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
hearing last week when we spoke to this
 
02:19:19.190 --> 02:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
project you know i explained it's not
 
02:19:21.030 --> 02:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
eligible for federal funding this would
 
02:19:23.750 --> 02:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
have to be state funded
 
02:19:25.509 --> 02:19:25.519 align:start position:0%
as we've discussed
 
02:19:27.750 --> 02:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
our betterment dollars are limited
 
02:19:32.309 --> 02:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
and especially when sb 367 revenue goes
 
02:19:35.509 --> 02:19:35.519 align:start position:0%
to the principal payments for the i-93
 
02:19:35.519 --> 02:19:37.190 align:start position:0%
to the principal payments for the i-93
construction

02:19:37.190 --> 02:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
construction
 
02:19:38.389 --> 02:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
then we
 
02:19:40.070 --> 02:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
will be further hampered in terms of the
 
02:19:42.389 --> 02:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
level investment we can make on our tier
 
02:19:43.669 --> 02:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
three and four roads that aren't
 
02:19:45.429 --> 02:19:45.439 align:start position:0%
eligible for federal funds
 
02:19:47.429 --> 02:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
so we would
 
02:19:49.670 --> 02:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
not recommend the use of highway funds
 
02:19:51.030 --> 02:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
but as i said the other day you know
 
02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
this is a policy decision if the
 
02:19:55.030 --> 02:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
legislature wanted to use general funds
 
02:19:57.110 --> 02:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
or another category of funding that
 
02:19:58.469 --> 02:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:20:01.750 --> 02:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
your decision to make but we would not
 
02:20:03.830 --> 02:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
advocate for the use of highway funds
 
02:20:05.910 --> 02:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
given how our revenues were impacted
 
02:20:08.389 --> 02:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
both during the covet 19 pandemic
 
02:20:10.230 --> 02:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
as well as the timing of this request
 
02:20:13.110 --> 02:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:14.630 --> 02:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
the principal payments kicking in a
 
02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:23.190 --> 02:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
to your knowledge of the rules
 
02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
uh federal rules would this be eligible
 
02:20:28.469 --> 02:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
if fiscal and or the governor and
 
02:20:31.670 --> 02:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
council or whomever wanted to use arpa
 
02:20:31.680 --> 02:20:32.790 align:start position:0%
council or whomever wanted to use arpa
funds

02:20:32.790 --> 02:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:20:34.870 --> 02:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
for that project
 
02:20:37.830 --> 02:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
would it even be eligible and again it
 
02:20:39.750 --> 02:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
would be a policy decision to do that
 
02:20:43.030 --> 02:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:45.110 --> 02:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
um i am not as well versed on the
 
02:20:49.270 --> 02:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
allowable uses of arp um when it comes
 
02:20:51.429 --> 02:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:20:53.830 --> 02:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
the most flexible categories um i do
 
02:20:56.389 --> 02:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
know that we as a state did suffer lost
 
02:20:56.399 --> 02:20:57.670 align:start position:0%
know that we as a state did suffer lost
revenue

02:20:57.670 --> 02:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
02:21:00.150 --> 02:21:00.160 align:start position:0%
and arpa funds can be used to replace
 
02:21:02.710 --> 02:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
lost revenue so perhaps a case could be
 
02:21:04.630 --> 02:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
made if it was something the legislature
 
02:21:06.710 --> 02:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to pursue then certainly we would
 
02:21:10.230 --> 02:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
work with goford understand eligibility
 
02:21:10.240 --> 02:21:10.830 align:start position:0%
work with goford understand eligibility
and

02:21:10.830 --> 02:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:21:14.550 --> 02:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
i have talked to commissioner caswell
 
02:21:17.190 --> 02:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
previously about just in general what
 
02:21:19.429 --> 02:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
highway projects might be eligible
 
02:21:21.429 --> 02:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
but we've never pursued any so we'd have
 
02:21:24.870 --> 02:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:27.990 --> 02:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
02:21:29.910 --> 02:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
i know that you
 
02:21:32.070 --> 02:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned to me
 
02:21:34.150 --> 02:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
about a request from
 
02:21:35.830 --> 02:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
a community
 
02:21:37.510 --> 02:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
in regards to
 
02:21:37.520 --> 02:21:38.870 align:start position:0%
in regards to
um

02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:40.469 --> 02:21:40.479 align:start position:0%
toll credits
 
02:21:42.870 --> 02:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
as me everybody on the committee should
 
02:21:46.389 --> 02:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
realize the only way we do
 
02:21:48.790 --> 02:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
use any of the federal highway funds we
 
02:21:51.670 --> 02:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
get is to match them with toll credits
 
02:21:55.349 --> 02:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
if you could just go through quickly
 
02:21:57.670 --> 02:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
what not or as much time as you want
 
02:22:00.710 --> 02:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
actually we got all day
 
02:22:00.720 --> 02:22:02.710 align:start position:0%
actually we got all day
the

02:22:02.710 --> 02:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:22:04.630 --> 02:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
what the request is
 
02:22:07.590 --> 02:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
and what your thoughts is commissioner
 
02:22:11.270 --> 02:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:13.270 --> 02:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
so first of all i'll start by explaining
 
02:22:15.110 --> 02:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
what toll credits are and how they work
 
02:22:16.710 --> 02:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that the committee has
 
02:22:18.870 --> 02:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
a thorough understanding of the program
 
02:22:20.790 --> 02:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
um so toll credits are as the name
 
02:22:23.670 --> 02:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
suggests a credit they are not cash
 
02:22:25.750 --> 02:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
so most of our federal programs are
 
02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:26.950 align:start position:0%
so most of our federal programs are
funded

02:22:26.950 --> 02:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
funded
 
02:22:29.270 --> 02:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
um 80 with federal funds and then we
 
02:22:31.349 --> 02:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
have to provide a 20
 
02:22:35.510 --> 02:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
cash match to access those federal funds
 
02:22:37.510 --> 02:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
so simple terms the federal government
 
02:22:39.590 --> 02:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
gives you eighty dollars we add twenty
 
02:22:41.670 --> 02:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
dollars of cash we spend a hundred
 
02:22:41.680 --> 02:22:43.510 align:start position:0%
dollars of cash we spend a hundred
dollars

02:22:43.510 --> 02:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:22:46.150 --> 02:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
however here in new hampshire we do not
 
02:22:50.230 --> 02:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
use cash match for the state
 
02:22:51.990 --> 02:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
funded projects
 
02:22:54.309 --> 02:22:54.319 align:start position:0%
so what does that mean well the turnpike
 
02:22:57.670 --> 02:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
system as we alluded to earlier predates
 
02:22:59.590 --> 02:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
the national highway system
 
02:23:01.030 --> 02:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
many sections of turnpike were
 
02:23:01.040 --> 02:23:02.309 align:start position:0%
many sections of turnpike were
constructed

02:23:02.309 --> 02:23:02.319 align:start position:0%
constructed
 
02:23:04.630 --> 02:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
before the interstate system and the nhs
 
02:23:06.309 --> 02:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
were fully built out
 
02:23:08.309 --> 02:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
so what happens is when we invest on the
 
02:23:09.910 --> 02:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
spalding turnpike
 
02:23:12.710 --> 02:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
or invest on i-95
 
02:23:14.389 --> 02:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
and use the revenue that we have
 
02:23:16.230 --> 02:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
generated within the state
 
02:23:17.670 --> 02:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
the federal government gives us credit
 
02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
for that because we're choosing to
 
02:23:21.030 --> 02:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
generate our own revenue and keep that
 
02:23:23.270 --> 02:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
system in a good state of repair and not
 
02:23:25.349 --> 02:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
drawing on federal funds to do it
 
02:23:27.030 --> 02:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
so the more we spend on the turnpike
 
02:23:29.349 --> 02:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
system the more credits we accrue from
 
02:23:30.790 --> 02:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
02:23:33.030 --> 02:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
and the last uh
 
02:23:35.190 --> 02:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
presentation we gave you we had showed
 
02:23:37.110 --> 02:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
what the total credit balances were for
 
02:23:38.230 --> 02:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:23:40.230 --> 02:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
but as i said they're just a credit it's
 
02:23:42.630 --> 02:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
just a reward for not drawing on federal
 
02:23:45.030 --> 02:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
funds to maintain a significant portion
 
02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
of the national highway system
 
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
so what happens today
 
02:23:50.630 --> 02:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
is if
 
02:23:52.230 --> 02:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
we're given 80 from the federal
 
02:23:55.270 --> 02:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
government for a state managed project
 
02:23:58.389 --> 02:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
we apply 20 of toll credits but they
 
02:24:01.349 --> 02:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
have no value all they do is allow us to
 
02:24:03.670 --> 02:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
access the federal funds so instead of
 
02:24:05.349 --> 02:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
spending a hundred dollars
 
02:24:07.270 --> 02:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
we only spend eighty so we have the
 
02:24:09.270 --> 02:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
eighty dollars of federal money twenty
 
02:24:11.349 --> 02:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
dollars of toll credits with no cash
 
02:24:14.150 --> 02:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
value so we only spend 80.
 
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
so this is one of the challenges for us
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
to state and you know when you look at
 
02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:18.469 align:start position:0%
to state and you know when you look at
how

02:24:18.469 --> 02:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:24:21.270 --> 02:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
our condition of our infrastructure is
 
02:24:23.190 --> 02:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
changing over time compared to say our
 
02:24:25.590 --> 02:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
neighbors vermont
 
02:24:27.670 --> 02:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
vermont gets more federal funds to begin
 
02:24:29.670 --> 02:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
with but then they also because they
 
02:24:31.110 --> 02:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
don't have a turnpike system they don't
 
02:24:32.950 --> 02:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
have toll credits to use
 
02:24:35.429 --> 02:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
so they always bring a 20 match to the
 
02:24:35.439 --> 02:24:36.389 align:start position:0%
so they always bring a 20 match to the
table

02:24:36.389 --> 02:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
table
 
02:24:38.550 --> 02:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
so they're spending significantly more
 
02:24:40.710 --> 02:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
on their network every year
 
02:24:42.710 --> 02:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
so the request that has come in
 
02:24:44.710 --> 02:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
um the town of keene or sorry the city
 
02:24:46.870 --> 02:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
of keene reached out
 
02:24:49.190 --> 02:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
in the recently passed
 
02:24:51.910 --> 02:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill the iija
 
02:24:54.230 --> 02:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
there is a provision to allow states to
 
02:24:57.349 --> 02:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
sell their surplus toll credits to other
 
02:24:57.359 --> 02:24:58.389 align:start position:0%
sell their surplus toll credits to other
states

02:24:58.389 --> 02:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:24:59.510 --> 02:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:25:01.510 --> 02:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
what's authorized in the bill is for the
 
02:25:04.550 --> 02:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
usdot to establish a toll credit
 
02:25:06.790 --> 02:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
marketplace pilot
 
02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:07.590 align:start position:0%
marketplace pilot
so

02:25:07.590 --> 02:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:25:09.750 --> 02:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
as we alluded to last time
 
02:25:11.190 --> 02:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
because of the work that we've done on
 
02:25:12.550 --> 02:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system over the last
 
02:25:14.309 --> 02:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
several years we talked about the
 
02:25:16.469 --> 02:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
widening of the spalding in newington
 
02:25:18.710 --> 02:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
and dover we had accrued some pretty
 
02:25:21.190 --> 02:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
significant total credit balances
 
02:25:24.469 --> 02:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
because it's not cash
 
02:25:26.389 --> 02:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
even after we've matched every penny of
 
02:25:27.830 --> 02:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
federal funds we still have these
 
02:25:29.429 --> 02:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
credits available
 
02:25:29.439 --> 02:25:30.389 align:start position:0%
credits available
so

02:25:30.389 --> 02:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:25:32.150 --> 02:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
what other states who don't have credits
 
02:25:33.990 --> 02:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
have expressed interest in is buying
 
02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
toll credits from a state like new
 
02:25:38.150 --> 02:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire for maybe you know 20 cents or
 
02:25:40.070 --> 02:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
50 cents on the dollar
 
02:25:41.830 --> 02:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
why would that be a value to us well
 
02:25:43.270 --> 02:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
that would take a credit that's worth
 
02:25:45.670 --> 02:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
nothing and actually turn it into cash
 
02:25:47.110 --> 02:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
we would have more money to spend on our
 
02:25:47.120 --> 02:25:48.630 align:start position:0%
we would have more money to spend on our
system

02:25:48.630 --> 02:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:25:50.389 --> 02:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
why would a state want to do that well
 
02:25:52.230 --> 02:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
we just received a lot more federal
 
02:25:54.870 --> 02:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
authorization so a state like vermont is
 
02:25:56.389 --> 02:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
scrambling right now to work with their
 
02:25:58.790 --> 02:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
legislature to secure the match to
 
02:26:00.790 --> 02:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
access those federal dollars
 
02:26:03.030 --> 02:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
so they might choose to buy toll credits
 
02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
so that they wouldn't have to provide as
 
02:26:07.510 --> 02:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
much cash to access the federal funds so
 
02:26:09.270 --> 02:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
those states who are at risk of leaving
 
02:26:10.870 --> 02:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
federal money on the table because they
 
02:26:12.550 --> 02:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
can't come up with the match
 
02:26:14.550 --> 02:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
might want to buy the credits even
 
02:26:15.990 --> 02:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
though it would mean they spend less
 
02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:17.190 align:start position:0%
though it would mean they spend less
overall

02:26:17.190 --> 02:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
overall
 
02:26:19.750 --> 02:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
so keane i think had misunderstood the
 
02:26:21.830 --> 02:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
language in the iija
 
02:26:23.429 --> 02:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
they were wondering why would you sell
 
02:26:25.110 --> 02:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
toll credits to a neighboring state why
 
02:26:26.870 --> 02:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you just give the toll credits
 
02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:27.590 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you just give the toll credits
to

02:26:27.590 --> 02:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:26:29.670 --> 02:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities to use
 
02:26:31.590 --> 02:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
but what they hadn't understood is when
 
02:26:33.670 --> 02:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
we use them within the state we still
 
02:26:35.910 --> 02:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
only get so much federal funding
 
02:26:38.309 --> 02:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
so what i explained to the city of keene
 
02:26:38.319 --> 02:26:39.510 align:start position:0%
so what i explained to the city of keene
is

02:26:39.510 --> 02:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:26:42.070 --> 02:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
i can't just give them toll credits
 
02:26:43.830 --> 02:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
so for example if they had a 10 million
 
02:26:45.750 --> 02:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
dollar project
 
02:26:47.510 --> 02:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
typically you'd get 8 million of federal
 
02:26:49.510 --> 02:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
funding and the city of keene in this
 
02:26:51.910 --> 02:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
case because it's a town managed project
 
02:26:53.190 --> 02:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
or municipal managed project would
 
02:26:55.910 --> 02:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
provide a two million dollar match
 
02:26:58.150 --> 02:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
the toll credits have no value
 
02:27:00.070 --> 02:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
so if i gave them two million in toll
 
02:27:00.080 --> 02:27:01.670 align:start position:0%
so if i gave them two million in toll
credits

02:27:01.670 --> 02:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
credits
 
02:27:03.670 --> 02:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
we still only have eight million dollars
 
02:27:05.910 --> 02:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
of federal funds so i said it was not a
 
02:27:07.670 --> 02:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
decision that new hampshire d.o.t could
 
02:27:08.870 --> 02:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
make that i would bring it to the
 
02:27:08.880 --> 02:27:10.150 align:start position:0%
make that i would bring it to the
legislature

02:27:10.150 --> 02:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
02:27:12.070 --> 02:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
because in reality if their project
 
02:27:14.070 --> 02:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
still costs 10 million
 
02:27:15.990 --> 02:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
we don't just have to spend 2 million in
 
02:27:17.750 --> 02:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
total credits
 
02:27:19.590 --> 02:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
we have to spend an additional million
 
02:27:21.670 --> 02:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
in total credits to be able to convert
 
02:27:23.670 --> 02:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
that 8 million to 10 million of federal
 
02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:24.710 align:start position:0%
that 8 million to 10 million of federal
funds

02:27:24.710 --> 02:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:27:26.550 --> 02:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
and the additional 2 million of federal
 
02:27:27.910 --> 02:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
funds would have to come from another
 
02:27:29.670 --> 02:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
project or program
 
02:27:32.389 --> 02:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
so it's not a zero-sum game here we
 
02:27:33.670 --> 02:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
essentially would be adding federal
 
02:27:35.270 --> 02:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
funds to their project
 
02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:36.150 align:start position:0%
funds to their project
which

02:27:36.150 --> 02:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:27:38.070 --> 02:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
as you have said several times mr
 
02:27:39.750 --> 02:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
chairman you know as soon as we add
 
02:27:41.270 --> 02:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
money to one project we're taking it
 
02:27:43.429 --> 02:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
from something else so the department
 
02:27:44.870 --> 02:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
didn't want to be
 
02:27:47.190 --> 02:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
making those types of choices if this is
 
02:27:48.950 --> 02:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
something that the legislature supported
 
02:27:51.270 --> 02:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
because municipalities were truly
 
02:27:53.270 --> 02:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
struggling to come up with match
 
02:27:55.670 --> 02:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
then it would be a decision for you all
 
02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
as a policy body not for the department
 
02:28:01.830 --> 02:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
um so that was what we did i educated i
 
02:28:03.910 --> 02:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
replied to keen and really educated them
 
02:28:05.990 --> 02:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
on how the toll credits truly work i
 
02:28:08.870 --> 02:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
think this misunderstanding stems from
 
02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
the changes that were implemented in the
 
02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:12.389 align:start position:0%
the changes that were implemented in the
iija

02:28:12.389 --> 02:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
iija
 
02:28:13.910 --> 02:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
and i can understand at first glance you
 
02:28:15.590 --> 02:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
know why would we sell things to states
 
02:28:17.670 --> 02:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
if we could give them to our own
 
02:28:17.680 --> 02:28:19.429 align:start position:0%
if we could give them to our own
municipalities

02:28:19.429 --> 02:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
02:28:21.830 --> 02:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
but the unfortunate thing is they have
 
02:28:24.150 --> 02:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
zero value um when we use them within
 
02:28:26.630 --> 02:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
the state so you'd have to add federal
 
02:28:28.469 --> 02:28:28.479 align:start position:0%
funds to the project
 
02:28:30.710 --> 02:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
so i know this is very complicated and
 
02:28:32.550 --> 02:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
this is why i think the city didn't
 
02:28:34.550 --> 02:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
fully understand it so if there's any
 
02:28:36.550 --> 02:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
questions i can go back through how they
 
02:28:38.389 --> 02:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
work again this is something that we've
 
02:28:40.070 --> 02:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
covered many times both with this
 
02:28:42.309 --> 02:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
committee but then also with the capital
 
02:28:44.150 --> 02:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
budget overview committee
 
02:28:45.349 --> 02:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
because that's the other piece of this
 
02:28:47.030 --> 02:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
anytime we use toll credits for a
 
02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
non-traditional purpose
 
02:28:51.030 --> 02:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
we go to the capital budget overview
 
02:28:54.710 --> 02:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
committee for their concurrence
 
02:28:57.030 --> 02:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
thank you questions about
 
02:28:59.910 --> 02:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
 
02:28:59.920 --> 02:29:01.429 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
um

02:29:01.429 --> 02:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:03.429 --> 02:29:03.439 align:start position:0%
you've said repeatedly that the credits
 
02:29:05.110 --> 02:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
have no value
 
02:29:07.429 --> 02:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
how would we sell them to another state
 
02:29:10.870 --> 02:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
and what would we get for those credits
 
02:29:12.550 --> 02:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
so the reason they have no value within
 
02:29:14.230 --> 02:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
the state is because we get a fixed
 
02:29:16.389 --> 02:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
amount of federal funds every year okay
 
02:29:19.270 --> 02:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
and so if i convert the credits or try
 
02:29:20.950 --> 02:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
to use the credits
 
02:29:23.349 --> 02:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not gaining federal money i'm just
 
02:29:25.190 --> 02:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
being able to access that money without
 
02:29:27.110 --> 02:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
providing a cash match
 
02:29:29.110 --> 02:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
if we sold them to another state it
 
02:29:30.870 --> 02:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
would be up to that state to adjust the
 
02:29:33.030 --> 02:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
federal funding on their projects they
 
02:29:35.590 --> 02:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
would truly be giving us cash so that's
 
02:29:37.349 --> 02:29:37.359 align:start position:0%
why it would be beneficial if we have
 
02:29:39.270 --> 02:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
very high balances far beyond what we
 
02:29:41.910 --> 02:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
need to access federal dollars if after
 
02:29:43.670 --> 02:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
every single penny of federal money that
 
02:29:45.990 --> 02:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
we're spending has been matched we still
 
02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:46.870 align:start position:0%
we're spending has been matched we still
have

02:29:46.870 --> 02:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:29:49.110 --> 02:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
you know 250 or 300 million dollars with
 
02:29:50.870 --> 02:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
the tool credits then there would be
 
02:29:52.870 --> 02:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
value in selling them to another state
 
02:29:54.870 --> 02:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
because they would give us actual cash
 
02:29:56.150 --> 02:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
but it's unlikely they're going to give
 
02:29:58.150 --> 02:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
us dollar for dollar
 
02:29:59.429 --> 02:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
this is why they want to establish a
 
02:30:01.830 --> 02:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
marketplace to see what the market value
 
02:30:04.230 --> 02:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
of them might be would it be 10 cents 20
 
02:30:06.950 --> 02:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
cents 30 cents
 
02:30:06.960 --> 02:30:07.750 align:start position:0%
cents 30 cents
and

02:30:07.750 --> 02:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:09.510 --> 02:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things i know
 
02:30:11.510 --> 02:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
senator waters and others are interested
 
02:30:12.790 --> 02:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire being one of the states
 
02:30:15.429 --> 02:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
to participate in the pilot
 
02:30:17.349 --> 02:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
but our total credit balances aren't as
 
02:30:19.830 --> 02:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
healthy today as they once were
 
02:30:22.070 --> 02:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
because we
 
02:30:23.590 --> 02:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
aren't investing in the turnpike at the
 
02:30:25.670 --> 02:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
same rate based on the turnpike revenues
 
02:30:28.710 --> 02:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
declining and so we do have some updated
 
02:30:29.990 --> 02:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
information that we probably would want
 
02:30:31.670 --> 02:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
to bring to the committee
 
02:30:33.590 --> 02:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
at the next work session to have a
 
02:30:35.590 --> 02:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
conversation about our participation in
 
02:30:38.710 --> 02:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
the pilot but that's a separate decision
 
02:30:40.950 --> 02:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
um first and foremost we wanted to talk
 
02:30:43.190 --> 02:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
about keane's request
 
02:30:44.550 --> 02:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
and the thing that we're concerned about
 
02:30:46.790 --> 02:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
is if we granted this to keem then other
 
02:30:49.030 --> 02:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities who
 
02:30:51.110 --> 02:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
currently are required to provide a 20
 
02:30:53.349 --> 02:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
match for a locally administered project
 
02:30:55.590 --> 02:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
might ask for the same thing so then it
 
02:30:58.070 --> 02:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't just be about funding this one
 
02:30:58.080 --> 02:30:59.030 align:start position:0%
wouldn't just be about funding this one
ask

02:30:59.030 --> 02:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
ask
 
02:31:01.910 --> 02:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
it could have a significant impact um
 
02:31:03.670 --> 02:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
and overall the state would spend less
 
02:31:05.270 --> 02:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
instead of us taking the federal money
 
02:31:07.510 --> 02:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
and adding a 20 match we'd only be
 
02:31:09.030 --> 02:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
spending the federal money so the
 
02:31:10.630 --> 02:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
investment in transportation would be
 
02:31:10.640 --> 02:31:13.110 align:start position:0%
investment in transportation would be
less

02:31:13.110 --> 02:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:14.710 --> 02:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
representative jack
 
02:31:16.550 --> 02:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman uh commissioner
 
02:31:18.389 --> 02:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
is there a time limit for us to decide
 
02:31:19.830 --> 02:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
whether we want to participate in the
 
02:31:22.230 --> 02:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
pilot uh does we have to do it before we
 
02:31:22.240 --> 02:31:23.270 align:start position:0%
pilot uh does we have to do it before we
enact

02:31:23.270 --> 02:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
enact
 
02:31:26.790 --> 02:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:28.710 --> 02:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
the toll
 
02:31:28.720 --> 02:31:29.910 align:start position:0%
the toll
credit

02:31:29.910 --> 02:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
credit

02:31:31.840 --> 02:31:32.790 align:start position:0%
marketplace pilot
um

02:31:32.790 --> 02:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:35.349 --> 02:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
was only just authorized in the iija
 
02:31:37.750 --> 02:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
there's been no guidance yet released by
 
02:31:39.910 --> 02:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
federal highway or usdot as to how they
 
02:31:41.910 --> 02:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
intend to advance that program we're
 
02:31:43.429 --> 02:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
eagerly awaiting that guidance to
 
02:31:46.309 --> 02:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
understand what the time frames might be
 
02:31:48.230 --> 02:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
and how that would impact us in our
 
02:31:48.240 --> 02:31:52.389 align:start position:0%
and how that would impact us in our
preparation

02:31:52.389 --> 02:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:54.550 --> 02:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
representative ebel
 
02:31:56.230 --> 02:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
thank you this is actually a really
 
02:31:59.190 --> 02:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
simple request um many of us have taken
 
02:32:01.270 --> 02:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
many notes on toll credits and how they
 
02:32:04.070 --> 02:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
work for a really long time if if you
 
02:32:06.870 --> 02:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
if you have a letter that you wrote to
 
02:32:08.870 --> 02:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
keene that sort of goes through the
 
02:32:11.750 --> 02:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
whole litany
 
02:32:13.670 --> 02:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
if you could provide it to the committee
 
02:32:15.670 --> 02:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
i'd appreciate having it i mean we may
 
02:32:15.680 --> 02:32:16.710 align:start position:0%
i'd appreciate having it i mean we may
have

02:32:16.710 --> 02:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:32:19.270 --> 02:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
inquiries from our own municipalities
 
02:32:21.590 --> 02:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
that we represent and it would be right
 
02:32:23.590 --> 02:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
there for us to refer to yes i can
 
02:32:25.110 --> 02:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
certainly provide you with a copy that'd
 
02:32:29.910 --> 02:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:32.070 --> 02:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
representative eaton
 
02:32:34.070 --> 02:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner i sir done capital budget
 
02:32:36.150 --> 02:32:36.160 align:start position:0%
oversight for years so i used to have a
 
02:32:36.160 --> 02:32:37.110 align:start position:0%
oversight for years so i used to have a
pretty

02:32:37.110 --> 02:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
02:32:40.389 --> 02:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
accurate rundown on a yearly basis
 
02:32:43.750 --> 02:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
on what our current bank account is and
 
02:32:45.030 --> 02:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
toll credits
 
02:32:47.349 --> 02:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
do you have a rough number where we're
 
02:32:51.270 --> 02:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:52.389 --> 02:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
we had provided
 
02:32:52.399 --> 02:32:53.750 align:start position:0%
we had provided
um

02:32:53.750 --> 02:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:55.590 --> 02:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
in our first presentation to this
 
02:32:55.600 --> 02:32:57.030 align:start position:0%
in our first presentation to this
committee

02:32:57.030 --> 02:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:32:59.990 --> 02:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh the balances that were forecast back
 
02:33:01.429 --> 02:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
in october
 
02:33:03.910 --> 02:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
um as i mentioned we've been doing some
 
02:33:05.270 --> 02:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
work to
 
02:33:07.349 --> 02:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
revise our projections
 
02:33:08.630 --> 02:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
so we'd like to come back to the
 
02:33:10.630 --> 02:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
committee at the next work session with
 
02:33:12.710 --> 02:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
updated data
 
02:33:14.630 --> 02:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
the big difference between october and
 
02:33:17.110 --> 02:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
today is of course the iij was passed
 
02:33:18.469 --> 02:33:18.479 align:start position:0%
because we're now getting more federal
 
02:33:18.479 --> 02:33:19.429 align:start position:0%
because we're now getting more federal
money

02:33:19.429 --> 02:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:33:21.110 --> 02:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to spend more toll
 
02:33:23.670 --> 02:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
credits to access those dollars
 
02:33:26.230 --> 02:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
so we had to factor in
 
02:33:28.230 --> 02:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
that aspect to our calculations but then
 
02:33:30.389 --> 02:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
in addition with the concurrence from
 
02:33:31.990 --> 02:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
gaset and the governors
 
02:33:33.750 --> 02:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
to delay the
 
02:33:36.550 --> 02:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
spending on the turnpike projects that
 
02:33:37.910 --> 02:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
further impacts how quickly we're going
 
02:33:40.550 --> 02:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
to accrue toll credits so we've been
 
02:33:42.389 --> 02:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
crunching the numbers i think we were a
 
02:33:44.630 --> 02:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
little bit over um
 
02:33:47.270 --> 02:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
ambitious in our
 
02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
october projections again not
 
02:33:50.469 --> 02:33:50.479 align:start position:0%
understanding how much federal money we
 
02:33:52.150 --> 02:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
were going to be receiving
 
02:33:54.870 --> 02:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
we thought that by 2026 our balances
 
02:33:57.429 --> 02:33:57.439 align:start position:0%
might be as high as 250 million
 
02:33:58.710 --> 02:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
we're thinking right now it's probably
 
02:34:01.750 --> 02:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
closer to 180 but we need another week
 
02:34:03.429 --> 02:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
or so to refine the numbers and then
 
02:34:06.150 --> 02:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
we'll bring you an updated um
 
02:34:07.990 --> 02:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
table with what we're currently
 
02:34:09.910 --> 02:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
projecting for balances at the next work
 
02:34:09.920 --> 02:34:13.510 align:start position:0%
projecting for balances at the next work
session

02:34:13.510 --> 02:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:15.349 --> 02:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you i i think that that would be
 
02:34:15.359 --> 02:34:16.469 align:start position:0%
thank you i i think that that would be
useful

02:34:16.469 --> 02:34:16.479 align:start position:0%
useful
 
02:34:16.479 --> 02:34:17.590 align:start position:0%
useful
because

02:34:17.590 --> 02:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:34:21.750 --> 02:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
i know that the department routinely
 
02:34:24.550 --> 02:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
at the end of each federal fiscal year
 
02:34:26.630 --> 02:34:26.640 align:start position:0%
searches for states that have not been
 
02:34:29.190 --> 02:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
able to use all of their
 
02:34:32.550 --> 02:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
federal highway funds to to so that we
 
02:34:33.910 --> 02:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
can bring
 
02:34:35.429 --> 02:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
projects along
 
02:34:38.309 --> 02:34:38.319 align:start position:0%
quicker and we would need to have
 
02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
that match
 
02:34:42.710 --> 02:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
um if we were to go and say well vermont
 
02:34:45.110 --> 02:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
didn't use all of their money or
 
02:34:47.270 --> 02:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
whatever state
 
02:34:49.990 --> 02:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
we could use another 20 40 50 million
 
02:34:52.070 --> 02:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
dollars for something
 
02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:52.950 align:start position:0%
dollars for something
um

02:34:52.950 --> 02:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:56.830 --> 02:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
so that will be very helpful to to know
 
02:34:59.429 --> 02:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
projections not knowing how much money
 
02:35:00.790 --> 02:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
we may get
 
02:35:03.910 --> 02:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
at the end of any given fiscal year
 
02:35:06.389 --> 02:35:06.399 align:start position:0%
so yes that is the value of toll credits
 
02:35:07.990 --> 02:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
unlike other states we don't have to
 
02:35:10.150 --> 02:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
come back to the legislature and request
 
02:35:12.389 --> 02:35:12.399 align:start position:0%
additional state funds when there is
 
02:35:14.950 --> 02:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
opportunities to access federal dollars
 
02:35:16.550 --> 02:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
because we have this authorization to
 
02:35:18.550 --> 02:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
use total credits we can pursue what
 
02:35:21.030 --> 02:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
they call redistribution when they redis
 
02:35:23.429 --> 02:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
redistribute authority to states at the
 
02:35:25.270 --> 02:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
end of the year based on available
 
02:35:27.110 --> 02:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
balances but also the discretionary
 
02:35:30.070 --> 02:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
grants we can pursue the grants knowing
 
02:35:31.510 --> 02:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
that we'll always have the total credits
 
02:35:33.030 --> 02:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to access those additional
 
02:35:35.510 --> 02:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
dollars so it is terrific that we have
 
02:35:37.750 --> 02:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
these balances but yes it's not just
 
02:35:39.750 --> 02:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
what we project based on what's
 
02:35:41.830 --> 02:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
currently programmed we do need to hold
 
02:35:43.349 --> 02:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
back enough tool credits to be able to
 
02:35:45.510 --> 02:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
access redistribution and we've been
 
02:35:48.150 --> 02:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
receiving around 20 million on average
 
02:35:50.070 --> 02:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
each year
 
02:35:52.550 --> 02:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
in redistribution so that requires four
 
02:35:53.910 --> 02:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
million dollars of total credits
 
02:35:55.590 --> 02:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
annually potentially
 
02:35:57.510 --> 02:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
so over a five-year period that's
 
02:35:59.030 --> 02:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
another 20 million would want to hold in
 
02:35:59.040 --> 02:36:00.070 align:start position:0%
another 20 million would want to hold in
reserve

02:36:00.070 --> 02:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
reserve
 
02:36:01.750 --> 02:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
or more because there might be more
 
02:36:03.910 --> 02:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
redistribution opportunities on the
 
02:36:05.270 --> 02:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
discretionary grant side that's what's
 
02:36:07.030 --> 02:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
hard to project to
 
02:36:08.710 --> 02:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
project is what will we actually receive
 
02:36:10.070 --> 02:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
in grants and there's a lot more
 
02:36:11.990 --> 02:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
discretionary funding in this
 
02:36:13.670 --> 02:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
transportation bill than there was in
 
02:36:15.830 --> 02:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
past bills so we'd want to hold back
 
02:36:18.309 --> 02:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
credits be able to access those dollars
 
02:36:18.319 --> 02:36:19.110 align:start position:0%
credits be able to access those dollars
so

02:36:19.110 --> 02:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:36:20.950 --> 02:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
that's why we're
 
02:36:23.349 --> 02:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
um updating the projections right now on
 
02:36:24.870 --> 02:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
what's needed to match the projects
 
02:36:26.630 --> 02:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
currently in the 10-year plan
 
02:36:28.870 --> 02:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
and then we'll be talking with this
 
02:36:31.429 --> 02:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
committee and with senate transportation
 
02:36:32.870 --> 02:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
should we decide to participate in the
 
02:36:32.880 --> 02:36:33.910 align:start position:0%
should we decide to participate in the
pilot

02:36:33.910 --> 02:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
pilot
 
02:36:35.429 --> 02:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
how many toll credits would we even want
 
02:36:37.030 --> 02:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
to sell how many should we be holding in
 
02:36:39.670 --> 02:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
reserve so that we can continue to be
 
02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
nimble and secure the additional federal
 
02:36:49.190 --> 02:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:51.750 --> 02:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
senator thompson
 
02:36:53.910 --> 02:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
if we um
 
02:36:56.630 --> 02:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
are considering selling these credits to
 
02:36:59.990 --> 02:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
to other states and we have cities like
 
02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:01.270 align:start position:0%
to other states and we have cities like
keane

02:37:01.270 --> 02:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
keane
 
02:37:04.389 --> 02:37:04.399 align:start position:0%
that have asked to use them
 
02:37:06.230 --> 02:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
and correct me if i'm wrong based on a
 
02:37:08.230 --> 02:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
project where they've applied
 
02:37:10.230 --> 02:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
for federal funds and need the match
 
02:37:13.429 --> 02:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:16.150 --> 02:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
they haven't applied it's not a grant
 
02:37:17.510 --> 02:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
they are using
 
02:37:19.590 --> 02:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
formula funds but it's one of the
 
02:37:21.110 --> 02:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
categories where it's a locally
 
02:37:23.030 --> 02:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
administered project
 
02:37:23.040 --> 02:37:24.070 align:start position:0%
administered project
so

02:37:24.070 --> 02:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:37:25.510 --> 02:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
we have a number of programs the
 
02:37:27.670 --> 02:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
transportation alternatives program the
 
02:37:29.190 --> 02:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
congestion mitigation air quality
 
02:37:31.590 --> 02:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
program where we do solicitations
 
02:37:31.600 --> 02:37:32.550 align:start position:0%
program where we do solicitations
and

02:37:32.550 --> 02:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:37:34.389 --> 02:37:34.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities can compete for those
 
02:37:35.830 --> 02:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
dollars so they're regular federal
 
02:37:37.990 --> 02:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
formula funds that we distribute to the
 
02:37:39.670 --> 02:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
cities and towns so this is a
 
02:37:41.910 --> 02:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
municipally managed project that is
 
02:37:44.630 --> 02:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
funded with formula funds
 
02:37:47.510 --> 02:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is
 
02:37:49.990 --> 02:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
would we not be better off to use those
 
02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:51.030 align:start position:0%
would we not be better off to use those
credits

02:37:51.030 --> 02:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
credits
 
02:37:53.270 --> 02:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
on municipal and
 
02:37:56.309 --> 02:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
in city projects which would improve the
 
02:37:56.319 --> 02:37:58.070 align:start position:0%
in city projects which would improve the
overall

02:37:58.070 --> 02:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
overall
 
02:38:00.870 --> 02:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
highway system in new hampshire
 
02:38:00.880 --> 02:38:01.830 align:start position:0%
highway system in new hampshire
with

02:38:01.830 --> 02:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:38:03.910 --> 02:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
many of the roads that uh i'm going to
 
02:38:05.830 --> 02:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
go through the example one more time
 
02:38:07.270 --> 02:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
because this is complicated this is i
 
02:38:09.670 --> 02:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
think why keen is misunderstood so
 
02:38:11.910 --> 02:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
and representative ebal i certainly will
 
02:38:13.190 --> 02:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
share this letter so you have it in
 
02:38:15.510 --> 02:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
front of you but if so using the example
 
02:38:17.990 --> 02:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
of a 10 million dollar project
 
02:38:19.750 --> 02:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
if we have a 10 million dollar project
 
02:38:19.760 --> 02:38:20.870 align:start position:0%
if we have a 10 million dollar project
then

02:38:20.870 --> 02:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:38:22.630 --> 02:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
the typical arrangement would be 8
 
02:38:25.590 --> 02:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
million of federal funds with 2 million
 
02:38:29.590 --> 02:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
of cash match from the municipality
 
02:38:32.150 --> 02:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
toll credits have no value so i can't
 
02:38:35.990 --> 02:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
just switch out two million dollars for
 
02:38:38.389 --> 02:38:38.399 align:start position:0%
two million dollars of credit i have to
 
02:38:40.389 --> 02:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
add two million dollars of federal funds
 
02:38:43.670 --> 02:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
to make that project whole
 
02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
so so that means you've got to find the
 
02:38:47.750 --> 02:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
two million dollars from another project
 
02:38:49.590 --> 02:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
and that's why we didn't believe it was
 
02:38:51.590 --> 02:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
a decision the department should make to
 
02:38:53.190 --> 02:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
take federal funds from another project
 
02:38:55.110 --> 02:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
that's something we'd bring to
 
02:38:57.030 --> 02:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature or to gasset or the
 
02:38:58.550 --> 02:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
governor depending on what phase we were
 
02:39:00.790 --> 02:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
in to be honest with the 10-year plan
 
02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:01.990 align:start position:0%
in to be honest with the 10-year plan
um

02:39:01.990 --> 02:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:03.830 --> 02:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
unlike if we sold them to a neighboring
 
02:39:05.510 --> 02:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
state if we sold two million dollars
 
02:39:07.590 --> 02:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
worth of toll credits to vermont
 
02:39:09.349 --> 02:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
and they gave us
 
02:39:10.950 --> 02:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
this would be ambitious but 50 cents on
 
02:39:12.710 --> 02:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
the dollar i would get a million dollars
 
02:39:14.870 --> 02:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
of cash i could then give that cash to
 
02:39:18.150 --> 02:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
the city of keene to reduce their match
 
02:39:20.550 --> 02:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
which is different than trying to use
 
02:39:22.550 --> 02:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
total credits within your state
 
02:39:24.309 --> 02:39:24.319 align:start position:0%
okay i guess that's what i was asking
 
02:39:26.790 --> 02:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
why we couldn't use
 
02:39:29.510 --> 02:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
the money to help the cities and towns
 
02:39:31.590 --> 02:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
so if we participate in the marketplace
 
02:39:33.670 --> 02:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
and we're able to turn our credits into
 
02:39:35.270 --> 02:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
cash well then we could work with the
 
02:39:37.270 --> 02:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
legislature to program those additional
 
02:39:37.280 --> 02:39:38.630 align:start position:0%
legislature to program those additional
dollars

02:39:38.630 --> 02:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:39:40.070 --> 02:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
and determine how you'd want to spend
 
02:39:40.080 --> 02:39:41.670 align:start position:0%
and determine how you'd want to spend
them

02:39:41.670 --> 02:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:39:47.670 --> 02:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:50.150 --> 02:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
um right at the moment i want to take a
 
02:39:52.950 --> 02:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
little bit of time break for lunch
 
02:39:56.230 --> 02:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
i'm commissioner we have we will we'll
 
02:39:58.870 --> 02:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
get more into individual
 
02:40:00.950 --> 02:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
projects the turnpike system and all the
 
02:40:00.960 --> 02:40:02.550 align:start position:0%
projects the turnpike system and all the
rest

02:40:02.550 --> 02:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
rest
 
02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:03.429 align:start position:0%
rest
but

02:40:03.429 --> 02:40:03.439 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:40:06.309 --> 02:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
so far we have neglected rail and
 
02:40:06.319 --> 02:40:08.309 align:start position:0%
so far we have neglected rail and
aeronautics

02:40:08.309 --> 02:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
aeronautics
 
02:40:11.590 --> 02:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
but we we do need to cover those either
 
02:40:13.590 --> 02:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
today or at the next work session i
 
02:40:15.830 --> 02:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
don't know which is more convenient to
 
02:40:17.990 --> 02:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
do just to go through what's in the
 
02:40:20.550 --> 02:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
10-year plan so that we know
 
02:40:22.790 --> 02:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
what it what is going on
 
02:40:24.469 --> 02:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
and then also
 
02:40:26.870 --> 02:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
um you alluded to it and talked a little
 
02:40:28.950 --> 02:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
bit about it last time
 
02:40:32.469 --> 02:40:32.479 align:start position:0%
the 17 million dollars for
 
02:40:32.479 --> 02:40:33.469 align:start position:0%
the 17 million dollars for
ev

02:40:33.469 --> 02:40:33.479 align:start position:0%
ev
 
02:40:36.389 --> 02:40:36.399 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and when i look through
 
02:40:38.469 --> 02:40:38.479 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of planning but also
 
02:40:38.479 --> 02:40:39.910 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of planning but also
construction

02:40:39.910 --> 02:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
construction
 
02:40:39.920 --> 02:40:41.269 align:start position:0%
construction
um

02:40:41.269 --> 02:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:44.230 --> 02:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
and how will that
 
02:40:44.240 --> 02:40:45.429 align:start position:0%
and how will that
be

02:40:45.429 --> 02:40:45.439 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:40:49.670 --> 02:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
don't answer now when when we reconvene
 
02:40:51.910 --> 02:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
how will the legislature
 
02:40:55.429 --> 02:40:55.439 align:start position:0%
know what is going on with that planning
 
02:40:57.429 --> 02:40:57.439 align:start position:0%
and where it will be and what the the
 
02:40:59.110 --> 02:40:59.120 align:start position:0%
backbone will be and all the rest
 
02:41:00.389 --> 02:41:00.399 align:start position:0%
because that
 
02:41:02.309 --> 02:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
feeds into all the other things that we
 
02:41:04.309 --> 02:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
heard this morning about alternative
 
02:41:05.510 --> 02:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
fuels and
 
02:41:09.429 --> 02:41:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:11.670 --> 02:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
um so we certainly can talk about
 
02:41:14.950 --> 02:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
aeronautics rail and transit um today if
 
02:41:16.550 --> 02:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
you want to break for lunch and we're
 
02:41:16.560 --> 02:41:17.670 align:start position:0%
you want to break for lunch and we're
available

02:41:17.670 --> 02:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:41:20.150 --> 02:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
um i can reach out to director hurlihi
 
02:41:21.910 --> 02:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
and see if he's able to join us for this
 
02:41:25.190 --> 02:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
afternoon session or shelly winters or
 
02:41:27.590 --> 02:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
trish lambert who are the administrators
 
02:41:29.750 --> 02:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
for the rail and transit and aeronautics
 
02:41:32.070 --> 02:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
bureaus respectively
 
02:41:34.870 --> 02:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
this is a multimodal transportation plan
 
02:41:36.309 --> 02:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
the reason we spend a lot of time
 
02:41:38.710 --> 02:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
talking about highway projects is
 
02:41:41.110 --> 02:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
because we can only use federal funds
 
02:41:41.120 --> 02:41:43.269 align:start position:0%
because we can only use federal funds
for

02:41:43.269 --> 02:41:43.279 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:41:44.870 --> 02:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
rehab renewal and reconstruction
 
02:41:47.190 --> 02:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
projects we cannot use federal funds for
 
02:41:48.870 --> 02:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
routine operations
 
02:41:51.030 --> 02:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
and because of the
 
02:41:53.110 --> 02:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
size of the federal highway program
 
02:41:55.510 --> 02:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of decisions to be made
 
02:41:57.510 --> 02:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
what you'll hear from the rail and
 
02:42:00.469 --> 02:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
transit advocates and from
 
02:42:01.910 --> 02:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
the airports to some degrees a lot of
 
02:42:03.269 --> 02:42:03.279 align:start position:0%
the federal funding they're receiving is
 
02:42:05.990 --> 02:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
for their routine operations and so the
 
02:42:07.990 --> 02:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
funds are being
 
02:42:10.309 --> 02:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
used to maintain the existing services
 
02:42:12.870 --> 02:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
there's not as many decisions to be made
 
02:42:14.230 --> 02:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
and then with the capital dollars that
 
02:42:16.150 --> 02:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
we do receive there's separate
 
02:42:18.950 --> 02:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
discretionary or sorry separate grant
 
02:42:21.030 --> 02:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
programs that we have to follow to
 
02:42:23.429 --> 02:42:23.439 align:start position:0%
distribute those dollars um so we
 
02:42:24.469 --> 02:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
certainly can go back through the
 
02:42:26.309 --> 02:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
different categories of money make sure
 
02:42:28.469 --> 02:42:28.479 align:start position:0%
you understand the different
 
02:42:30.630 --> 02:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
federal programs in more detail we
 
02:42:32.150 --> 02:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
really went through that very quickly in
 
02:42:33.830 --> 02:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
our first presentation
 
02:42:35.349 --> 02:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
but there's just less opportunity for
 
02:42:37.429 --> 02:42:37.439 align:start position:0%
the legislature to influence how those
 
02:42:39.349 --> 02:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
dollars are spent and that's why we
 
02:42:41.830 --> 02:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
spend so much time talking about
 
02:42:44.150 --> 02:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
the highway projects in particular and
 
02:42:45.830 --> 02:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
so we can talk about that today and then
 
02:42:47.830 --> 02:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
as i explained last time you know we
 
02:42:49.269 --> 02:42:49.279 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of information yet
 
02:42:51.269 --> 02:42:51.279 align:start position:0%
about the ev charging programs but we
 
02:42:53.510 --> 02:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
certainly can talk about
 
02:42:55.590 --> 02:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
what work the department's doing
 
02:42:56.950 --> 02:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
the conversations we've been having with
 
02:42:58.469 --> 02:42:58.479 align:start position:0%
the transportation council that was
 
02:43:00.710 --> 02:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
established as well as the legislation
 
02:43:03.429 --> 02:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
that senator waters has sponsored
 
02:43:05.349 --> 02:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
and what decisions this committee might
 
02:43:08.950 --> 02:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
want to make in that area
 
02:43:10.870 --> 02:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
i guess i lost the bubble on that last
 
02:43:12.309 --> 02:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
one but
 
02:43:15.990 --> 02:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
what legislation is in the senate but um
 
02:43:19.349 --> 02:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
if if you could have
 
02:43:22.150 --> 02:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
the rail and transit folks here at one
 
02:43:24.469 --> 02:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
o'clock and we can go through that it
 
02:43:26.070 --> 02:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
should not be
 
02:43:27.910 --> 02:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
all that long
 
02:43:27.920 --> 02:43:28.790 align:start position:0%
all that long
but

02:43:28.790 --> 02:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:43:31.349 --> 02:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
it's imperative that this committee at
 
02:43:33.750 --> 02:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
least understand what is
 
02:43:36.790 --> 02:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
in the entire book
 
02:43:39.510 --> 02:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
because there will be times when people
 
02:43:40.870 --> 02:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
will ask
 
02:43:45.269 --> 02:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
why are we funding an airport in maine
 
02:43:48.469 --> 02:43:48.479 align:start position:0%
which has come up before
 
02:43:49.670 --> 02:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
02:43:52.150 --> 02:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
imperative that we at least go through
 
02:43:54.630 --> 02:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
and understand where the money is from
 
02:43:56.710 --> 02:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
and what it's going for
 
02:43:58.550 --> 02:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
over the next decade
 
02:44:01.670 --> 02:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
um and i know that yes everybody sees
 
02:44:03.910 --> 02:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
roads and highways and bridges because
 
02:44:06.070 --> 02:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
we travel on them all the time and that
 
02:44:06.080 --> 02:44:06.790 align:start position:0%
we travel on them all the time and that
is

02:44:06.790 --> 02:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:44:09.269 --> 02:44:09.279 align:start position:0%
the biggest impact but this committee
 
02:44:12.070 --> 02:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
has a responsibility to also look at at
 
02:44:13.510 --> 02:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
all the rest
 
02:44:14.950 --> 02:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:44:17.190 --> 02:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
at least
 
02:44:20.150 --> 02:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
have an understanding if not a complete
 
02:44:20.160 --> 02:44:21.349 align:start position:0%
have an understanding if not a complete
um

02:44:21.349 --> 02:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:23.269 --> 02:44:23.279 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement of of all the work that
 
02:44:25.510 --> 02:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
gets done in the background of of all of
 
02:44:25.520 --> 02:44:26.389 align:start position:0%
gets done in the background of of all of
that

02:44:26.389 --> 02:44:26.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:44:27.590 --> 02:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
02:44:32.309 --> 02:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:35.190 --> 02:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
so desire to come back and finish this
 
02:44:38.070 --> 02:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
at one o'clock
 
02:44:40.230 --> 02:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
i will say one thing
 
02:44:42.070 --> 02:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
if you want to have
 
02:44:46.389 --> 02:44:46.399 align:start position:0%
anything changed or added or
 
02:44:48.950 --> 02:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
whatever in this 10-year plan as a
 
02:44:50.710 --> 02:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
member of the committee
 
02:44:52.710 --> 02:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
you have to bring it in in writing we
 
02:44:54.389 --> 02:44:54.399 align:start position:0%
can talk about it
 
02:44:57.590 --> 02:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
but it i need it in writing
 
02:45:01.349 --> 02:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
as an amendment to house bill 2022
 
02:45:04.389 --> 02:45:04.399 align:start position:0%
so that we can talk about
 
02:45:06.630 --> 02:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
it as a committee
 
02:45:08.630 --> 02:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
i know that there will be amendments
 
02:45:11.030 --> 02:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
brought in i think the
 
02:45:12.950 --> 02:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
department will probably have at least
 
02:45:15.830 --> 02:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
one because we have to change numbers of
 
02:45:18.230 --> 02:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
bonding and authority and and all the
 
02:45:20.630 --> 02:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
rest we we do that and everyone
 
02:45:20.640 --> 02:45:22.230 align:start position:0%
rest we we do that and everyone
but

02:45:22.230 --> 02:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:45:24.070 --> 02:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
we need to
 
02:45:27.030 --> 02:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
do that as we go along if you have an
 
02:45:28.630 --> 02:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
amendment done up
 
02:45:30.870 --> 02:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
we can talk about it
 
02:45:32.630 --> 02:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
do a straw poll
 
02:45:35.510 --> 02:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
on whether or not we want to adopt it
 
02:45:37.910 --> 02:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
because we only have one amendment at
 
02:45:39.910 --> 02:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
the end of the process just like any
 
02:45:42.070 --> 02:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
other bill
 
02:45:44.630 --> 02:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
so the straw polls are just that
 
02:45:47.030 --> 02:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
um to work on it so that we know what we
 
02:45:49.110 --> 02:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
have to start putting together
 
02:45:51.110 --> 02:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
for the final thing
 
02:45:54.150 --> 02:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
one thing this year that we are
 
02:45:56.150 --> 02:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
well ahead of where we've been in some
 
02:45:58.550 --> 02:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
prior years
 
02:46:00.469 --> 02:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
we have until
 
02:46:02.790 --> 02:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
first part of march to get this finished
 
02:46:04.630 --> 02:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
i'd like to get it finished by the end
 
02:46:06.710 --> 02:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
of february
 
02:46:09.030 --> 02:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of you probably saw the email that
 
02:46:11.990 --> 02:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:14.469 --> 02:46:14.479 align:start position:0%
i did have to change one meeting from
 
02:46:18.469 --> 02:46:18.479 align:start position:0%
the 17th of february to the next week
 
02:46:21.190 --> 02:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
as i told you at one point there will be
 
02:46:24.550 --> 02:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
a house session the week of the 15th and
 
02:46:26.630 --> 02:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
that thursday
 
02:46:29.030 --> 02:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
and my estimation is probably probably
 
02:46:29.040 --> 02:46:29.830 align:start position:0%
and my estimation is probably probably
is

02:46:29.830 --> 02:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:31.269 align:start position:0%
is
um

02:46:31.269 --> 02:46:31.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:33.750 --> 02:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
going to be one of the day or days that
 
02:46:35.269 --> 02:46:35.279 align:start position:0%
we meet
 
02:46:36.950 --> 02:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know where
 
02:46:36.960 --> 02:46:38.309 align:start position:0%
i don't know where
but

02:46:38.309 --> 02:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:46:40.389 --> 02:46:40.399 align:start position:0%
rather than waiting until that week to
 
02:46:42.790 --> 02:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
change it i'm just changing i hadn't had
 
02:46:46.150 --> 02:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
a change now for planning purposes
 
02:46:46.160 --> 02:46:46.950 align:start position:0%
a change now for planning purposes
and

02:46:46.950 --> 02:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:46:49.190 --> 02:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
even after that
 
02:46:51.830 --> 02:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
which would include the uh an exec
 
02:46:54.070 --> 02:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
session in 2022 if we can't agree on
 
02:46:56.309 --> 02:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
amendment we'll come back on another day
 
02:46:58.950 --> 02:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
um it's just that simple
 
02:46:58.960 --> 02:46:59.910 align:start position:0%
um it's just that simple
um

02:46:59.910 --> 02:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:01.990 --> 02:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
but commissioner i do
 
02:47:04.389 --> 02:47:04.399 align:start position:0%
appreciate you and your staff taking all
 
02:47:06.870 --> 02:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
of this time
 
02:47:06.880 --> 02:47:09.110 align:start position:0%
of this time
even

02:47:09.110 --> 02:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
even
 
02:47:11.110 --> 02:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
more so than i think any of us can
 
02:47:11.120 --> 02:47:12.230 align:start position:0%
more so than i think any of us can
express

02:47:12.230 --> 02:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
express
 
02:47:14.469 --> 02:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
and with that we'll be in recess until
 
02:47:17.190 --> 02:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:19.510 --> 02:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much

04:03:20.389 --> 04:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
if we could
 
04:03:22.950 --> 04:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
reassemble and continue the work session
 
04:03:25.910 --> 04:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
i did um
 
04:03:27.990 --> 04:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner to

talk briefly about
 
04:03:34.070 --> 04:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
or as long as you all have
 
04:03:37.670 --> 04:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
questions about rail transit and uh
 
04:03:40.630 --> 04:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
aeronautics and where we are and how
 
04:03:40.640 --> 04:03:41.910 align:start position:0%
aeronautics and where we are and how
much

04:03:41.910 --> 04:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:03:41.920 --> 04:03:42.790 align:start position:0%
much
um

04:03:42.790 --> 04:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:45.110 --> 04:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
is within the
 
04:03:47.189 --> 04:03:47.199 align:start position:0%
scope of the current intermodal plan and
 
04:03:48.790 --> 04:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
that's what this is
 
04:03:51.429 --> 04:03:51.439 align:start position:0%
so that we should know what's going on
 
04:03:51.439 --> 04:03:53.349 align:start position:0%
so that we should know what's going on
and

04:03:53.349 --> 04:03:53.359 align:start position:0%

is just briefly go over
 
04:03:59.189 --> 04:03:59.199 align:start position:0%
and i think they're broken out by
 
04:04:01.429 --> 04:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
projects and probably better on your
 
04:04:01.439 --> 04:04:02.469 align:start position:0%
projects and probably better on your
maps

04:04:02.469 --> 04:04:02.479 align:start position:0%
maps
 
04:04:04.150 --> 04:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
i i don't
 
04:04:08.469 --> 04:04:08.479 align:start position:0%

04:04:29.189 --> 04:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
i brought shelley so we could address
 
04:04:31.429 --> 04:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
more of your rail and transit questions
 
04:04:33.750 --> 04:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
i will do my best to field all things
 
04:04:35.030 --> 04:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
aeronautics but of course we have
 
04:04:36.630 --> 04:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
another work session next week if
 
04:04:38.630 --> 04:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
necessary i can have
 
04:04:41.030 --> 04:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
patrick or trisha come with me
 
04:04:42.550 --> 04:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
and we can certainly follow up with any
 
04:04:44.070 --> 04:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have
 
04:04:45.990 --> 04:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
so i was going to skip over aeronautics
 
04:04:49.189 --> 04:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
for now and focus on transit first of
 
04:04:50.950 --> 04:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
all and i don't know if folks have a
 
04:04:52.870 --> 04:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
copy of the presentation that we gave
 
04:04:55.670 --> 04:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
the first time we met with this body
 
04:04:59.110 --> 04:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
um we went through the colors of money
 
04:05:01.510 --> 04:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
and we went through this presentation at
 
04:05:03.670 --> 04:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
a very rapid pace so
 
04:05:05.670 --> 04:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
i thought we'd go back and
 
04:05:06.870 --> 04:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
04:05:09.269 --> 04:05:09.279 align:start position:0%
the individual programs
 
04:05:11.429 --> 04:05:11.439 align:start position:0%
um so before the lunch break i had
 
04:05:13.590 --> 04:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
explained that you know we are working
 
04:05:15.030 --> 04:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
on a
 
04:05:17.269 --> 04:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
multimodal transportation plan
 
04:05:19.030 --> 04:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
however we spend a lot of time talking
 
04:05:21.349 --> 04:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
about highway projects because
 
04:05:23.510 --> 04:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
04:05:26.150 --> 04:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
flexibility in terms of how we spend our
 
04:05:27.590 --> 04:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
highway dollars
 
04:05:28.870 --> 04:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
and of course
 
04:05:30.070 --> 04:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
the majority of the funding that we
 
04:05:31.670 --> 04:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
receive is for
 
04:05:33.349 --> 04:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
highway projects
 
04:05:34.710 --> 04:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
the transit side of the house is a
 
04:05:37.349 --> 04:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
little more complicated because we're
 
04:05:38.950 --> 04:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
receiving federal funds for both
 
04:05:38.960 --> 04:05:40.389 align:start position:0%
receiving federal funds for both
operations

04:05:40.389 --> 04:05:40.399 align:start position:0%
operations
 
04:05:42.630 --> 04:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
and for capital improvements
 
04:05:42.640 --> 04:05:43.510 align:start position:0%
and for capital improvements
and

04:05:43.510 --> 04:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:05:45.510 --> 04:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
in many cases we're trying to sustain
 
04:05:47.750 --> 04:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
our existing services with the funding
 
04:05:49.670 --> 04:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
that we're receiving there's not as many
 
04:05:51.670 --> 04:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities to talk about adding
 
04:05:53.670 --> 04:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
service or expanding
 
04:05:55.269 --> 04:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
uh based on the amount of federal
 
04:05:57.349 --> 04:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
funding that we've received
 
04:06:00.150 --> 04:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
so in this 10-year plan we have 378
 
04:06:01.670 --> 04:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
million programmed you know
 
04:06:06.469 --> 04:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
approximately 37.8 million annually
 
04:06:08.870 --> 04:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
the primary source of funds is the
 
04:06:12.389 --> 04:06:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:14.790 --> 04:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
the funds are split into two categories
 
04:06:18.469 --> 04:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
capital and then operating and planning
 
04:06:18.479 --> 04:06:19.990 align:start position:0%
capital and then operating and planning
um

04:06:19.990 --> 04:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:21.830 --> 04:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
the funds cannot be transferred for any
 
04:06:24.389 --> 04:06:24.399 align:start position:0%
other purpose so what we're spending on
 
04:06:24.399 --> 04:06:25.429 align:start position:0%
other purpose so what we're spending on
transit

04:06:25.429 --> 04:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
transit
 
04:06:28.950 --> 04:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
can only be used for that purpose
 
04:06:30.229 --> 04:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that we had noted
 
04:06:32.630 --> 04:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
previously is the capital corridor rail
 
04:06:34.870 --> 04:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
project people get confused by this it's
 
04:06:37.030 --> 04:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
a passenger rail project but it is
 
04:06:40.950 --> 04:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
funded with transit dollars because
 
04:06:43.349 --> 04:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
when we did the feasibility study it was
 
04:06:45.349 --> 04:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
determined that
 
04:06:47.670 --> 04:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
a commuter service
 
04:06:47.680 --> 04:06:48.870 align:start position:0%
a commuter service
would

04:06:48.870 --> 04:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:06:50.389 --> 04:06:50.399 align:start position:0%
more appropriately meet the needs of the
 
04:06:53.429 --> 04:06:53.439 align:start position:0%
state than an intercity rail service and
 
04:06:55.269 --> 04:06:55.279 align:start position:0%
so that's why it's a federal transit
 
04:06:55.279 --> 04:06:56.950 align:start position:0%
so that's why it's a federal transit
project

04:06:56.950 --> 04:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
project
 
04:06:58.630 --> 04:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
because we're looking at a commuter type
 
04:06:58.640 --> 04:06:59.910 align:start position:0%
because we're looking at a commuter type
frequency

04:06:59.910 --> 04:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
frequency
 
04:07:02.070 --> 04:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
rather than a more intermittent
 
04:07:04.070 --> 04:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
intercity type frequency that would be
 
04:07:06.389 --> 04:07:06.399 align:start position:0%
an fra project
 
04:07:08.309 --> 04:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
so that's sort of how the the funding
 
04:07:10.229 --> 04:07:10.239 align:start position:0%
works at the macro level
 
04:07:12.229 --> 04:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
um from the colors of money presentation
 
04:07:14.070 --> 04:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
you'll recall this number of different
 
04:07:16.550 --> 04:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
categories so in our world we're always
 
04:07:20.830 --> 04:07:20.840 align:start position:0%
talking about the 53s 5307 5310
 
04:07:25.189 --> 04:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
5311. and 53 39 and so
 
04:07:27.110 --> 04:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
these are all subcategories of federal
 
04:07:29.030 --> 04:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
funds so we don't just get one big
 
04:07:30.950 --> 04:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
bucket of federal transit administration
 
04:07:30.960 --> 04:07:32.630 align:start position:0%
bucket of federal transit administration
dollars

04:07:32.630 --> 04:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:07:35.990 --> 04:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of the distribution of fta funds
 
04:07:38.229 --> 04:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
is done in accordance with
 
04:07:39.750 --> 04:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
census data
 
04:07:39.760 --> 04:07:40.950 align:start position:0%
census data
and

04:07:40.950 --> 04:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:07:42.710 --> 04:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
so we have
 
04:07:45.269 --> 04:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
urbanized area funds um so that's money
 
04:07:47.110 --> 04:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
that's going specifically
 
04:07:50.149 --> 04:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
to services that operate either within
 
04:07:52.070 --> 04:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
an urbanized area or
 
04:07:53.910 --> 04:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
to an urbanized area
 
04:07:56.790 --> 04:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
and so even in that 5307 urbanized
 
04:07:59.910 --> 04:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
categories we then have subcategories
 
04:08:01.990 --> 04:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
for example we have the boston urbanized
 
04:08:02.000 --> 04:08:02.870 align:start position:0%
for example we have the boston urbanized
area

04:08:02.870 --> 04:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
area
 
04:08:06.469 --> 04:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
and the boston uca and we use funding
 
04:08:08.309 --> 04:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
that we receive from the fta to support
 
04:08:10.389 --> 04:08:10.399 align:start position:0%
the boston express bus service that the
 
04:08:10.399 --> 04:08:11.429 align:start position:0%
the boston express bus service that the
dot

04:08:11.429 --> 04:08:11.439 align:start position:0%
dot
 
04:08:15.189 --> 04:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
provides with some of that 5307 funding
 
04:08:16.950 --> 04:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
and then the other recipients of the
 
04:08:19.590 --> 04:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
5307 categories are
 
04:08:19.600 --> 04:08:20.710 align:start position:0%
5307 categories are
nashua

04:08:20.710 --> 04:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
04:08:23.030 --> 04:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
and the small ucas
 
04:08:25.510 --> 04:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
so the coast that operates on the
 
04:08:28.469 --> 04:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
seacoast manchester transit nashua
 
04:08:28.479 --> 04:08:30.070 align:start position:0%
seacoast manchester transit nashua
transit

04:08:30.070 --> 04:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
transit
 
04:08:31.750 --> 04:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
wildcat the service that's run by the
 
04:08:33.750 --> 04:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
university of new hampshire and these
 
04:08:35.750 --> 04:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
are all services that are eligible for
 
04:08:38.149 --> 04:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
these urbanized area funds
 
04:08:38.159 --> 04:08:39.750 align:start position:0%
these urbanized area funds
um

04:08:39.750 --> 04:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:42.149 --> 04:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
in contrast we then have rural programs
 
04:08:44.389 --> 04:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
that's the 5311 category
 
04:08:47.590 --> 04:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
and so we receive money by formula um to
 
04:08:50.229 --> 04:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
service rural areas the majority of that
 
04:08:52.710 --> 04:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
money is going to the smaller rural
 
04:08:55.269 --> 04:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
transit providers however we do receive
 
04:08:56.950 --> 04:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
another category of money which is the
 
04:08:59.510 --> 04:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
5311 f program
 
04:09:01.189 --> 04:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
and i apologize this is just the
 
04:09:03.429 --> 04:09:03.439 align:start position:0%
terminology that fta uses
 
04:09:03.439 --> 04:09:04.229 align:start position:0%
terminology that fta uses
um

04:09:04.229 --> 04:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:06.710 --> 04:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
but 5311f is specifically for us to
 
04:09:09.590 --> 04:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
provide inter-city connections um so
 
04:09:11.750 --> 04:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
we've done procurements in the past to
 
04:09:11.760 --> 04:09:13.990 align:start position:0%
we've done procurements in the past to
identify

04:09:13.990 --> 04:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
identify
 
04:09:16.790 --> 04:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
bus companies that be willing to provide
 
04:09:16.800 --> 04:09:18.309 align:start position:0%
bus companies that be willing to provide
service

04:09:18.309 --> 04:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
service
 
04:09:20.070 --> 04:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
between cities so we have a service as
 
04:09:21.830 --> 04:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
an example from littleton down to the
 
04:09:24.790 --> 04:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
boston area that we fund with some of
 
04:09:27.510 --> 04:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
our rural intercity funding
 
04:09:29.910 --> 04:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
and then the
 
04:09:32.870 --> 04:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
other major category is 5310
 
04:09:35.030 --> 04:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
so that's the service for
 
04:09:36.229 --> 04:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
seniors and individuals with
 
04:09:36.239 --> 04:09:38.309 align:start position:0%
seniors and individuals with
disabilities

04:09:38.309 --> 04:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
04:09:40.630 --> 04:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
and we have in new hampshire
 
04:09:42.229 --> 04:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
a state coordinating council and then
 
04:09:44.389 --> 04:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
regional coordinating councils which
 
04:09:46.070 --> 04:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
help us work with all the non-profits
 
04:09:48.149 --> 04:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
and local governments to
 
04:09:49.910 --> 04:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
distribute those dollars and meet the
 
04:09:51.910 --> 04:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
needs of the
 
04:09:53.990 --> 04:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
different areas of the state when it
 
04:09:55.670 --> 04:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
comes to transportation for that
 
04:09:57.750 --> 04:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
population so those are the three big
 
04:10:00.510 --> 04:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
categories and then lastly we have the
 
04:10:03.429 --> 04:10:03.439 align:start position:0%
5339 which is all about
 
04:10:05.189 --> 04:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
replacing buses
 
04:10:05.199 --> 04:10:06.229 align:start position:0%
replacing buses
and

04:10:06.229 --> 04:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:10:08.469 --> 04:10:08.479 align:start position:0%
upgrading bus facilities so we do
 
04:10:10.070 --> 04:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
separate solicitations then to
 
04:10:12.630 --> 04:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
distribute the 53-39
 
04:10:14.309 --> 04:10:14.319 align:start position:0%
so that sort of gives you the four major
 
04:10:17.990 --> 04:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
categories so it's urbanized money 5307
 
04:10:20.710 --> 04:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
rural money 5311.
 
04:10:23.030 --> 04:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
5310 for seniors individuals with
 
04:10:24.870 --> 04:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities and then sort of more
 
04:10:27.990 --> 04:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
capital type money the 53.39 for buses
 
04:10:29.510 --> 04:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
and bus facilities
 
04:10:31.269 --> 04:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
and shelly is truly the expert so when
 
04:10:32.710 --> 04:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
it comes to the
 
04:10:35.349 --> 04:10:35.359 align:start position:0%
how we push the money out
 
04:10:36.630 --> 04:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
you know the different providers in the
 
04:10:38.550 --> 04:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
different regions she can talk about our
 
04:10:40.870 --> 04:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
relationship with all of
 
04:10:42.630 --> 04:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
the different entities
 
04:10:42.640 --> 04:10:44.070 align:start position:0%
the different entities
um

04:10:44.070 --> 04:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:46.229 --> 04:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
the last thing i would just say is we do
 
04:10:49.349 --> 04:10:49.359 align:start position:0%
have some flexibility we can transfer
 
04:10:51.590 --> 04:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
highway money to transit we can't take
 
04:10:53.670 --> 04:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
transit money and move it to highway but
 
04:10:55.110 --> 04:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
we can move
 
04:10:57.590 --> 04:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
some categories of highway funds over to
 
04:10:59.269 --> 04:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
support transit
 
04:11:01.030 --> 04:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
um so we do have an additional 30
 
04:11:03.189 --> 04:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
million it's about 3 million per year
 
04:11:04.950 --> 04:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
that we're transferring from federal
 
04:11:08.389 --> 04:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
highway to fta for transit
 
04:11:10.389 --> 04:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
that was something that was supported in
 
04:11:12.790 --> 04:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
past 10-year plans because we received
 
04:11:15.590 --> 04:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
so much advocacy for expanding transit
 
04:11:15.600 --> 04:11:16.950 align:start position:0%
so much advocacy for expanding transit
options

04:11:16.950 --> 04:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
options
 
04:11:18.790 --> 04:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
and there really is a compelling need to
 
04:11:20.550 --> 04:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
invest more in transit
 
04:11:22.469 --> 04:11:22.479 align:start position:0%
that was a determination that was made
 
04:11:24.790 --> 04:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
in past 10-year plans
 
04:11:26.389 --> 04:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
and really three million per year when
 
04:11:27.750 --> 04:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
you consider how much we're receiving in
 
04:11:29.429 --> 04:11:29.439 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
04:11:31.189 --> 04:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't really hinder our ability
 
04:11:33.510 --> 04:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
significantly on the highway side to
 
04:11:36.550 --> 04:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:38.149 --> 04:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
so i i guess
 
04:11:40.710 --> 04:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
the services themselves we have 11 local
 
04:11:43.030 --> 04:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
transit providers that we partner with
 
04:11:45.670 --> 04:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
there are seven intercity bus routes
 
04:11:48.469 --> 04:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
that we're supporting
 
04:11:50.469 --> 04:11:50.479 align:start position:0%
there's two passenger rail services that
 
04:11:51.590 --> 04:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
currently new hampshire does not
 
04:11:53.590 --> 04:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
contribute to but there is passenger
 
04:11:54.870 --> 04:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
rail service in the state with the
 
04:11:57.030 --> 04:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
downeaster operating
 
04:12:00.149 --> 04:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
on the seacoast side and the vermonter
 
04:12:02.630 --> 04:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
servicing claremont
 
04:12:04.469 --> 04:12:04.479 align:start position:0%
associated with these services we talked
 
04:12:05.910 --> 04:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
about this briefly at one of the past
 
04:12:08.630 --> 04:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
meetings we do have a number of transit
 
04:12:08.640 --> 04:12:10.309 align:start position:0%
meetings we do have a number of transit
terminals

04:12:10.309 --> 04:12:10.319 align:start position:0%
terminals
 
04:12:13.110 --> 04:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
um along the 93 corridor as well as
 
04:12:16.070 --> 04:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
terminals in portsmouth and dover in
 
04:12:17.670 --> 04:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
addition to that we have the other park
 
04:12:19.269 --> 04:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
and ride lots that aren't serviced by
 
04:12:23.349 --> 04:12:23.359 align:start position:0%
transit but certainly are part of
 
04:12:25.510 --> 04:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
ensuring that folks have options beyond
 
04:12:28.710 --> 04:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
driving individually in vehicles
 
04:12:31.349 --> 04:12:31.359 align:start position:0%
and a big piece of meeting
 
04:12:34.710 --> 04:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
the needs of our senior population
 
04:12:37.030 --> 04:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
is our volunteer driver programs to the
 
04:12:40.309 --> 04:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
197 communities in the state have
 
04:12:42.229 --> 04:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
volunteer driver programs
 
04:12:43.990 --> 04:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
and so that's what we can afford to pay
 
04:12:45.429 --> 04:12:45.439 align:start position:0%
for and that's what we
 
04:12:47.030 --> 04:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
are supporting today
 
04:12:48.710 --> 04:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
and this committee has received i
 
04:12:51.590 --> 04:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
believe some testimony from
 
04:12:53.349 --> 04:12:53.359 align:start position:0%
some of the transit providers around
 
04:12:55.750 --> 04:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
their thoughts and concerns
 
04:12:57.349 --> 04:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
and the biggest issue you'll hear them
 
04:12:59.030 --> 04:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
talk about is just
 
04:13:00.710 --> 04:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
coming up with the matching dollars to
 
04:13:00.720 --> 04:13:01.750 align:start position:0%
coming up with the matching dollars to
access

04:13:01.750 --> 04:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
access
 
04:13:03.910 --> 04:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
all of these federal funds
 
04:13:06.550 --> 04:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
on the operating side it's a 50 50
 
04:13:08.630 --> 04:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
program so it's 50 federal you have to
 
04:13:11.110 --> 04:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
bring a 50 match to the table
 
04:13:13.429 --> 04:13:13.439 align:start position:0%
and then on the capital side it's an 80
 
04:13:16.710 --> 04:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
20 split like our highway projects are
 
04:13:16.720 --> 04:13:17.750 align:start position:0%
20 split like our highway projects are
um

04:13:17.750 --> 04:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:20.229 --> 04:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
and so the state does provide assistance
 
04:13:22.950 --> 04:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the matching of capital
 
04:13:24.870 --> 04:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
dollars but when we're talking about
 
04:13:27.189 --> 04:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
operating the only assistance that the
 
04:13:29.110 --> 04:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
state currently provides is two hundred
 
04:13:32.229 --> 04:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that was budgeted
 
04:13:35.110 --> 04:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
through hb1 for that purpose
 
04:13:37.269 --> 04:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
um and so i know a number of the transit
 
04:13:38.830 --> 04:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
agencies are concerned this year in
 
04:13:40.870 --> 04:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
particular with the increase in the
 
04:13:42.790 --> 04:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
amount of federal funding being made
 
04:13:44.870 --> 04:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
available through the iija
 
04:13:46.550 --> 04:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
they now have to come up with the
 
04:13:48.309 --> 04:13:48.319 align:start position:0%
corresponding match to be able to access
 
04:13:50.469 --> 04:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
those dollars
 
04:13:52.070 --> 04:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
so i'll pause there i think that gives
 
04:13:55.590 --> 04:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
you a pretty good overview
 
04:13:57.510 --> 04:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
but we can take more specific questions
 
04:14:00.469 --> 04:14:00.479 align:start position:0%
from the comm any any representative
 
04:14:00.479 --> 04:14:02.550 align:start position:0%
from the comm any any representative
faulkner

04:14:02.550 --> 04:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
faulkner
 
04:14:05.429 --> 04:14:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:07.349 --> 04:14:07.359 align:start position:0%
we've been talking a little bit about
 
04:14:09.590 --> 04:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
the capital corridor project earlier
 
04:14:09.600 --> 04:14:10.790 align:start position:0%
the capital corridor project earlier
today

04:14:10.790 --> 04:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:14:12.550 --> 04:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
what funds
 
04:14:14.469 --> 04:14:14.479 align:start position:0%
federal funds might be used for that is
 
04:14:16.630 --> 04:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
that one of these programs or is
 
04:14:20.070 --> 04:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:22.309 --> 04:14:22.319 align:start position:0%
so currently we are advancing what's
 
04:14:24.389 --> 04:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
called the project development phase of
 
04:14:26.710 --> 04:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
the capital corridor project
 
04:14:30.229 --> 04:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
that means we are doing the engineering
 
04:14:31.990 --> 04:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to come up with accurate cost
 
04:14:32.000 --> 04:14:33.670 align:start position:0%
to be able to come up with accurate cost
estimates

04:14:33.670 --> 04:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
04:14:35.189 --> 04:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
for both the
 
04:14:38.149 --> 04:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
capital construction as well as
 
04:14:40.630 --> 04:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
working with the mbta who has the
 
04:14:42.550 --> 04:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
operating rights of the corridor to
 
04:14:44.149 --> 04:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
understand what the true cost of
 
04:14:46.309 --> 04:14:46.319 align:start position:0%
operating the system would be
 
04:14:47.670 --> 04:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
we're also
 
04:14:51.590 --> 04:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:53.750 --> 04:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
based on the final design
 
04:14:55.750 --> 04:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
and what i've been saying repeatedly is
 
04:14:57.269 --> 04:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
the most important piece of this phase
 
04:14:58.950 --> 04:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
is developing a financial plan to
 
04:15:01.030 --> 04:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
explore all of those options as to how
 
04:15:03.030 --> 04:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
we might pay for construction
 
04:15:06.070 --> 04:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
and or pay for the operating should the
 
04:15:08.389 --> 04:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
state decide to progress
 
04:15:09.830 --> 04:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
so the department
 
04:15:11.510 --> 04:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
over the years has been a lot of
 
04:15:13.189 --> 04:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
advocacy for the rail project there's
 
04:15:15.990 --> 04:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
also been a lot of skepticism around
 
04:15:17.429 --> 04:15:17.439 align:start position:0%
whether or not we can afford the rail
 
04:15:19.750 --> 04:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
project so the project development phase
 
04:15:23.030 --> 04:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
gives us the opportunity to truly vet
 
04:15:23.040 --> 04:15:23.910 align:start position:0%
gives us the opportunity to truly vet
um

04:15:23.910 --> 04:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:25.269 --> 04:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
all of the different options available
 
04:15:27.189 --> 04:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
to us when it comes to to paying for
 
04:15:28.710 --> 04:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
this service
 
04:15:31.189 --> 04:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
and we are looking at a commuter service
 
04:15:33.670 --> 04:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
so the discretionary grant programs that
 
04:15:35.110 --> 04:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:15:37.429 --> 04:15:37.439 align:start position:0%
possible sources of funding for the
 
04:15:37.439 --> 04:15:38.950 align:start position:0%
possible sources of funding for the
construction

04:15:38.950 --> 04:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
construction
 
04:15:41.189 --> 04:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
are what's called new starts or small
 
04:15:41.199 --> 04:15:42.550 align:start position:0%
are what's called new starts or small
starts

04:15:42.550 --> 04:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
starts
 
04:15:44.790 --> 04:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
those are fta administered discretionary
 
04:15:46.469 --> 04:15:46.479 align:start position:0%
grant programs
 
04:15:48.389 --> 04:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
we perhaps could pursue
 
04:15:50.950 --> 04:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
those dollars to construct the project
 
04:15:52.309 --> 04:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
however we still have to come up with
 
04:15:55.189 --> 04:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:57.110 --> 04:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
over the years there has been private
 
04:16:00.309 --> 04:16:00.319 align:start position:0%
sector as well as municipal support for
 
04:16:02.790 --> 04:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
the project indications that
 
04:16:06.309 --> 04:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
there might be a desire to set up
 
04:16:08.710 --> 04:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
tif districts and and have development
 
04:16:10.950 --> 04:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
around the stations that might lead to
 
04:16:12.630 --> 04:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
new sources of revenue
 
04:16:14.630 --> 04:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
to help pay for either the capital
 
04:16:16.710 --> 04:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
construction if it was bonded
 
04:16:20.149 --> 04:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
or to pay for the operating expenses
 
04:16:22.630 --> 04:16:22.640 align:start position:0%
we do know that if we were to build this
 
04:16:22.640 --> 04:16:23.670 align:start position:0%
we do know that if we were to build this
project

04:16:23.670 --> 04:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
project
 
04:16:26.149 --> 04:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
we would be eligible for more
 
04:16:29.110 --> 04:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
fta funding for operations and so we
 
04:16:30.790 --> 04:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
would have access to some additional
 
04:16:32.630 --> 04:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
federal funding
 
04:16:34.790 --> 04:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
and of course we'd charge fares for the
 
04:16:36.469 --> 04:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
use of the system
 
04:16:38.950 --> 04:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
but it's unlikely that there would be
 
04:16:41.269 --> 04:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
sufficient funding purely from farebox
 
04:16:44.070 --> 04:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
recovery to cover the operating expenses
 
04:16:45.510 --> 04:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
so this is why we're doing this project
 
04:16:46.950 --> 04:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
development phase we're going through
 
04:16:48.550 --> 04:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
all the options
 
04:16:50.389 --> 04:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
um you know as part of the feasibility
 
04:16:52.149 --> 04:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
study and also as part of the financial
 
04:16:54.149 --> 04:16:54.159 align:start position:0%
plan we have looked at how other states
 
04:16:56.630 --> 04:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
have funded projects but based on
 
04:16:58.229 --> 04:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
current law in new hampshire some of
 
04:17:00.389 --> 04:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
those funding mechanisms
 
04:17:02.309 --> 04:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
would not be permitted
 
04:17:05.510 --> 04:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature would have to
 
04:17:07.189 --> 04:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
be willing to embrace new revenue
 
04:17:09.510 --> 04:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
streams to pay for rail
 
04:17:09.520 --> 04:17:11.110 align:start position:0%
streams to pay for rail
um

04:17:11.110 --> 04:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:12.870 --> 04:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
depending on the different alternatives
 
04:17:14.229 --> 04:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
there might be different degrees of
 
04:17:14.239 --> 04:17:15.429 align:start position:0%
there might be different degrees of
support

04:17:15.429 --> 04:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:17:15.439 --> 04:17:16.229 align:start position:0%
support
so

04:17:16.229 --> 04:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:17:18.389 --> 04:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
the department is just
 
04:17:20.469 --> 04:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
tasked with finding options
 
04:17:21.910 --> 04:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to develop this financial
 
04:17:24.469 --> 04:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
plan but the goal of this project phase
 
04:17:26.309 --> 04:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
was to present the information to the
 
04:17:28.630 --> 04:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
legislature and other elected leaders so
 
04:17:30.229 --> 04:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
once and for all we could have a
 
04:17:32.309 --> 04:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
discussion around whether or not any of
 
04:17:33.590 --> 04:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
these revenue
 
04:17:35.510 --> 04:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
sources are acceptable
 
04:17:36.950 --> 04:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
and if they aren't
 
04:17:38.469 --> 04:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
how could we afford to pay for the
 
04:17:41.590 --> 04:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
project with real cost information both
 
04:17:43.830 --> 04:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
for construction and for operating
 
04:17:45.269 --> 04:17:45.279 align:start position:0%
so our goal is to provide that
 
04:17:47.189 --> 04:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
information for the legislature to make
 
04:17:48.389 --> 04:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
a decision
 
04:17:50.229 --> 04:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
so we're currently funding this phase
 
04:17:52.469 --> 04:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
with fta dollars matched with toll
 
04:17:52.479 --> 04:17:53.510 align:start position:0%
with fta dollars matched with toll
credits

04:17:53.510 --> 04:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
credits
 
04:17:56.550 --> 04:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
so there's no state funds being used um
 
04:17:58.149 --> 04:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
04:18:00.149 --> 04:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
and we are what's in the 10-year plan is
 
04:18:02.469 --> 04:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
purely this project development phase
 
04:18:04.229 --> 04:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
if at the conclusion of this phase there
 
04:18:06.229 --> 04:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
is a desire to move into construction
 
04:18:08.229 --> 04:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
then we'd have to pursue grants and
 
04:18:10.469 --> 04:18:10.479 align:start position:0%
program those dollars at that time
 
04:18:12.790 --> 04:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
so our goal was to get this phase done
 
04:18:15.189 --> 04:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
so in the next 10-year plan cycle
 
04:18:17.830 --> 04:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
we could talk about securing the funding
 
04:18:20.389 --> 04:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
if the desire of the legislature was to
 
04:18:25.670 --> 04:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:25.680 --> 04:18:26.710 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:18:26.710 --> 04:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:18:29.429 --> 04:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
commissioner when is the uh expected
 
04:18:31.750 --> 04:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
completion date for all this
 
04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
for the project development phase
 
04:18:37.510 --> 04:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
so our goal was to be
 
04:18:39.750 --> 04:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
wrapping up the financial planning phase
 
04:18:41.910 --> 04:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
which is really the last piece in
 
04:18:43.590 --> 04:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
january of 23.
 
04:18:44.870 --> 04:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:18:46.469 --> 04:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
thank you we're really just starting the
 
04:18:48.229 --> 04:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
financial planning work now we had to do
 
04:18:50.389 --> 04:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
enough of the design work to know the
 
04:18:51.990 --> 04:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
costs better
 
04:18:54.309 --> 04:18:54.319 align:start position:0%
without the estimates we can't start to
 
04:18:58.870 --> 04:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:00.870 --> 04:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
representative ebal
 
04:19:02.790 --> 04:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:19:02.800 --> 04:19:03.670 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

04:19:03.670 --> 04:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:05.269 --> 04:19:05.279 align:start position:0%
when you're with the work that you're
 
04:19:07.590 --> 04:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
doing for the capitol court or are you
 
04:19:09.990 --> 04:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
looking at um
 
04:19:12.469 --> 04:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
costs and how well it could be supported
 
04:19:14.550 --> 04:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
if it just goes to nashua then if it
 
04:19:16.790 --> 04:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
just goes to manchester then if it goes
 
04:19:18.950 --> 04:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
all the way to concord are you breaking
 
04:19:21.750 --> 04:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
it up that way
 
04:19:23.349 --> 04:19:23.359 align:start position:0%
based on the
 
04:19:25.990 --> 04:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
outcomes from the feasibility study what
 
04:19:28.070 --> 04:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
was deemed to be the most viable was a
 
04:19:28.080 --> 04:19:29.110 align:start position:0%
was deemed to be the most viable was a
commuter

04:19:29.110 --> 04:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
commuter
 
04:19:31.590 --> 04:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
frequency service to manchester so that
 
04:19:33.590 --> 04:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
is what the project development is for
 
04:19:40.870 --> 04:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:43.750 --> 04:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
on on federal transit
 
04:19:43.760 --> 04:19:44.870 align:start position:0%
on on federal transit
funding

04:19:44.870 --> 04:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:19:47.510 --> 04:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that for the state portion
 
04:19:49.750 --> 04:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
we use toll credits
 
04:19:53.590 --> 04:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
are are there not some of these in the
 
04:19:56.710 --> 04:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
transit arena that also require a local
 
04:19:58.870 --> 04:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
match or is it all
 
04:20:03.189 --> 04:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
federal transit and total credits
 
04:20:05.670 --> 04:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
so we do not use total credits typically
 
04:20:07.110 --> 04:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
for transit
 
04:20:08.630 --> 04:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
um we
 
04:20:10.149 --> 04:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
i think i reference the use of total
 
04:20:12.229 --> 04:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
credit specifically for the project
 
04:20:13.510 --> 04:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
development phase of the capital
 
04:20:13.520 --> 04:20:15.110 align:start position:0%
development phase of the capital
corridor

04:20:15.110 --> 04:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
corridor
 
04:20:16.630 --> 04:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned
 
04:20:18.309 --> 04:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
this morning when we were talking about
 
04:20:20.389 --> 04:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
total credit balances
 
04:20:23.429 --> 04:20:23.439 align:start position:0%
we are authorized to use toll credits
 
04:20:25.429 --> 04:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
to match federal funds
 
04:20:27.990 --> 04:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
for highway projects road and bridge
 
04:20:30.550 --> 04:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
projects anytime we use total credits
 
04:20:32.870 --> 04:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
for a purpose beyond that we have to go
 
04:20:32.880 --> 04:20:33.670 align:start position:0%
for a purpose beyond that we have to go
to

04:20:33.670 --> 04:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:20:35.750 --> 04:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
cboc for their approval
 
04:20:38.550 --> 04:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
so we have on occasion use turnpike
 
04:20:41.590 --> 04:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
total credits to match federal funds
 
04:20:43.750 --> 04:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
for example for the bx the boston
 
04:20:45.189 --> 04:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
express service
 
04:20:47.910 --> 04:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
for the capital corridor project
 
04:20:50.550 --> 04:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
but the majority of the time when we're
 
04:20:53.429 --> 04:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
funding the transit providers
 
04:20:56.630 --> 04:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
they are required to secure the match
 
04:20:58.229 --> 04:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
on the operating side
 
04:21:01.670 --> 04:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
on the capital side we go through hb 25
 
04:21:02.630 --> 04:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
and we
 
04:21:05.429 --> 04:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
secure matching dollars
 
04:21:08.630 --> 04:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
to support the capital purchases but all
 
04:21:11.429 --> 04:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
that we have currently budgeted
 
04:21:13.510 --> 04:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
in general funds is two hundred thousand
 
04:21:15.910 --> 04:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
to support the operating
 
04:21:18.950 --> 04:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
um the local transit agencies are coming
 
04:21:20.710 --> 04:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
up with the match
 
04:21:22.870 --> 04:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
beyond that to access the operating
 
04:21:22.880 --> 04:21:30.870 align:start position:0%
beyond that to access the operating
dollars

04:21:30.870 --> 04:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:30.880 --> 04:21:33.110 align:start position:0%
 
thompson

04:21:33.110 --> 04:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
thompson
 
04:21:35.030 --> 04:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner
 
04:21:36.630 --> 04:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
04:21:39.670 --> 04:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
projection on what ridership would be
 
04:21:41.990 --> 04:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
out of manchester and nashville
 
04:21:43.910 --> 04:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
which i assume are the only two stations
 
04:21:45.030 --> 04:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
you'd have
 
04:21:47.030 --> 04:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
so we have some forecasts around
 
04:21:47.040 --> 04:21:48.389 align:start position:0%
so we have some forecasts around
ridership

04:21:48.389 --> 04:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
ridership
 
04:21:49.990 --> 04:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
shelly is with me today but we could
 
04:21:52.070 --> 04:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
certainly come back and walk this
 
04:21:53.349 --> 04:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
committee through
 
04:21:55.349 --> 04:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
the most recent presentation materials
 
04:21:56.790 --> 04:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
04:21:58.870 --> 04:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
shared at public meetings on the capitol
 
04:22:00.790 --> 04:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
corridor project
 
04:22:02.710 --> 04:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine
 
04:22:04.710 --> 04:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
coming out of the pandemic
 
04:22:04.720 --> 04:22:05.750 align:start position:0%
coming out of the pandemic
um

04:22:05.750 --> 04:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:08.630 --> 04:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
we've seen a lasting shift in commuter
 
04:22:11.110 --> 04:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh patterns there's a lot of companies
 
04:22:13.830 --> 04:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
are embracing telework on a permanent
 
04:22:13.840 --> 04:22:14.870 align:start position:0%
are embracing telework on a permanent
basis

04:22:14.870 --> 04:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
basis
 
04:22:17.590 --> 04:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
and so the mbta has been adjusting their
 
04:22:20.070 --> 04:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
service and frequency of service to
 
04:22:21.349 --> 04:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
better match
 
04:22:23.189 --> 04:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
what they see is the needs of commuters
 
04:22:25.429 --> 04:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
moving forward so we've been having a
 
04:22:27.670 --> 04:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
lot of conversations with our colleagues
 
04:22:29.349 --> 04:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
down in massachusetts
 
04:22:32.070 --> 04:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that as we discuss the
 
04:22:32.080 --> 04:22:33.189 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that as we discuss the
service

04:22:33.189 --> 04:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
service
 
04:22:34.710 --> 04:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
it really is
 
04:22:36.149 --> 04:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
aligned with what they're providing
 
04:22:37.590 --> 04:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
today and what they believe they'll be
 
04:22:39.189 --> 04:22:39.199 align:start position:0%
providing for frequency of service into
 
04:22:40.710 --> 04:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
the future you have to remember there
 
04:22:42.630 --> 04:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
are trains already running from lowell
 
04:22:44.630 --> 04:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
massachusetts to boston
 
04:22:46.469 --> 04:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is extending
 
04:22:48.630 --> 04:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
the service up to manchester
 
04:22:51.349 --> 04:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
so you're not running dedicated trains
 
04:22:52.790 --> 04:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
you're running trains that would pick up
 
04:22:54.389 --> 04:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
passengers in new hampshire and then
 
04:22:56.550 --> 04:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
continue to pick up passengers
 
04:22:58.710 --> 04:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
from lowell south
 
04:23:03.189 --> 04:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
that's why the the cost of operations um
 
04:23:04.630 --> 04:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
is a little different to calculate
 
04:23:06.389 --> 04:23:06.399 align:start position:0%
because we're extending existing service
 
04:23:10.309 --> 04:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:10.319 --> 04:23:10.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:23:10.950 --> 04:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:23:12.389 --> 04:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
yeah so we don't i don't have all the
 
04:23:13.990 --> 04:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
numbers on the capital card or with me
 
04:23:15.910 --> 04:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
but we can certainly bring that to next
 
04:23:17.269 --> 04:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
week's work session if that's something
 
04:23:18.550 --> 04:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
you'd like to spend some time going
 
04:23:20.710 --> 04:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
through so this is called the capitol
 
04:23:23.269 --> 04:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
corridor project but it doesn't come to
 
04:23:24.870 --> 04:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
the capitol
 
04:23:26.830 --> 04:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
the rail corridor
 
04:23:29.670 --> 04:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
between concord and boston is known as
 
04:23:32.710 --> 04:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
the capital corridor so the project that
 
04:23:36.710 --> 04:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
we are proposing would be to construct
 
04:23:38.950 --> 04:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
the rail line between lowell
 
04:23:40.870 --> 04:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
and manchester there is a line there
 
04:23:40.880 --> 04:23:41.830 align:start position:0%
and manchester there is a line there
today

04:23:41.830 --> 04:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:23:43.830 --> 04:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
it's just a freight line
 
04:23:45.349 --> 04:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
really what we're doing is upgrading
 
04:23:47.990 --> 04:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
that line to meet passenger standards
 
04:23:52.710 --> 04:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:56.469 --> 04:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
if the transit authorities all however
 
04:23:56.479 --> 04:23:57.670 align:start position:0%
if the transit authorities all however
many

04:23:57.670 --> 04:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
many
 
04:23:59.670 --> 04:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
do not come up with
 
04:24:01.990 --> 04:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
the match of all the new federal money
 
04:24:03.590 --> 04:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
are we going to leave that money on the
 
04:24:05.590 --> 04:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
table or how does that how will that
 
04:24:05.600 --> 04:24:08.149 align:start position:0%
table or how does that how will that
work

04:24:08.149 --> 04:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:10.149 --> 04:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
yes if you don't have adequate match to
 
04:24:11.830 --> 04:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
access federal funds you know as we
 
04:24:12.950 --> 04:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
talked about this morning with the
 
04:24:15.429 --> 04:24:15.439 align:start position:0%
highway programs you would be at risk of
 
04:24:17.670 --> 04:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
leaving those federal funds on the table
 
04:24:19.590 --> 04:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
the one thing i will say is during the
 
04:24:22.309 --> 04:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
covid pandemic there were several relief
 
04:24:24.550 --> 04:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
bills that were passed so there was the
 
04:24:26.149 --> 04:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
cares act
 
04:24:27.510 --> 04:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
there was another
 
04:24:29.670 --> 04:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
relief bill chrisa and then there was
 
04:24:31.590 --> 04:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
the american rescue plan
 
04:24:31.600 --> 04:24:32.630 align:start position:0%
the american rescue plan
so

04:24:32.630 --> 04:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:24:34.870 --> 04:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
transit did receive a significant amount
 
04:24:36.830 --> 04:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
of relief funding
 
04:24:40.630 --> 04:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
um so we have been able to use federal
 
04:24:42.469 --> 04:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
funds at a hundred percent
 
04:24:44.950 --> 04:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
if we have relief dollars we can use
 
04:24:47.590 --> 04:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
those to supplement traditional formula
 
04:24:47.600 --> 04:24:48.870 align:start position:0%
those to supplement traditional formula
dollars

04:24:48.870 --> 04:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:24:50.389 --> 04:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:24:51.830 --> 04:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
that might provide a little bit of a
 
04:24:53.830 --> 04:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
buffer to the transit agencies because
 
04:24:56.469 --> 04:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
we're still spending down those balances
 
04:24:58.469 --> 04:24:58.479 align:start position:0%
of relief funds
 
04:25:00.389 --> 04:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
and that's why we're you know now that
 
04:25:02.149 --> 04:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
the care is sorry the
 
04:25:04.550 --> 04:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
iija has been passed we're working with
 
04:25:07.189 --> 04:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
the transit agencies to understand
 
04:25:09.590 --> 04:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
what match gaps they have
 
04:25:10.790 --> 04:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
but of course this all happened in
 
04:25:13.590 --> 04:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
december so it's fairly recent that we
 
04:25:15.349 --> 04:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
started these conversations
 
04:25:17.110 --> 04:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
if i can just add on relative to whether
 
04:25:18.950 --> 04:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
the funds would go away the federal
 
04:25:20.309 --> 04:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
transit administration is a little
 
04:25:22.070 --> 04:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
different than federal highway
 
04:25:23.750 --> 04:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
and that when funds are apportioned for
 
04:25:25.990 --> 04:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
a federal fiscal year depending on the
 
04:25:28.229 --> 04:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
program we have between three to five
 
04:25:30.630 --> 04:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
years by which we have to obligate those
 
04:25:33.349 --> 04:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
funds in a grant we don't have to spend
 
04:25:34.790 --> 04:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
them in the year they're apportioned we
 
04:25:36.389 --> 04:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
have a three to five year window in
 
04:25:37.910 --> 04:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
which we have to just
 
04:25:39.750 --> 04:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
um obligate them in a grant and by
 
04:25:41.910 --> 04:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
obligating them in a grant we have to
 
04:25:44.870 --> 04:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
confirm that we have a a match available
 
04:25:47.189 --> 04:25:47.199 align:start position:0%
and then we can continue to spend those
 
04:25:49.990 --> 04:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
funds until expended so we there is a
 
04:25:52.630 --> 04:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
little bit more liberal use but
 
04:25:54.710 --> 04:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
if the state has a heavy bounds or a
 
04:25:57.110 --> 04:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
high balance of the formula funds
 
04:25:59.110 --> 04:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
when transit systems or the state goes
 
04:26:02.070 --> 04:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
in for a discretionary grant sometimes
 
04:26:04.309 --> 04:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
that's held against the state because
 
04:26:05.990 --> 04:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
there's a backlog of funds that we can't
 
04:26:07.830 --> 04:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
access already so there's a question as
 
04:26:12.550 --> 04:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:14.309 --> 04:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
so there is some ramp up time that's the
 
04:26:16.710 --> 04:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
positive thing on the transit side
 
04:26:18.309 --> 04:26:18.319 align:start position:0%
because we have this three to five year
 
04:26:20.309 --> 04:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
window to spend the money there's time
 
04:26:22.870 --> 04:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
to work with municipalities and others
 
04:26:24.950 --> 04:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
to try and increase the amount of match
 
04:26:26.790 --> 04:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
available but at the end of the day you
 
04:26:29.670 --> 04:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
still have to find the money
 
04:26:31.429 --> 04:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
to be able to access the dollars they do
 
04:26:33.830 --> 04:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
expire eventually
 
04:26:34.870 --> 04:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
and what we've seen is in
 
04:26:36.870 --> 04:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
reauthorization bills they sustain or
 
04:26:39.030 --> 04:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
increase funding they don't reduce it
 
04:26:41.510 --> 04:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
so it's not as if we could
 
04:26:43.590 --> 04:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
match at a lower level
 
04:26:45.830 --> 04:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
carry the balances forward you're always
 
04:26:47.189 --> 04:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
going to be getting more federal funds
 
04:26:49.349 --> 04:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
that you need to access
 
04:26:51.349 --> 04:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
representative jack
 
04:26:53.269 --> 04:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman there were numbers
 
04:26:54.870 --> 04:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
developed in the alternatives analysis
 
04:26:57.030 --> 04:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
was completed in 16 or 18 that you
 
04:26:58.550 --> 04:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
referred to earlier i would refer
 
04:27:00.070 --> 04:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
representative thompson that the
 
04:27:01.429 --> 04:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
question is
 
04:27:03.750 --> 04:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
is the financial plan using those
 
04:27:05.910 --> 04:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
numbers or have they developed updated
 
04:27:07.750 --> 04:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
numbers for ridership and economic
 
04:27:10.710 --> 04:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
activity that they're using
 
04:27:11.990 --> 04:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
so we're jumping back to the capital
 
04:27:14.149 --> 04:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
corridor we have updated the ridership
 
04:27:16.550 --> 04:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
numbers there's some different forecasts
 
04:27:18.070 --> 04:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
based on different scenarios with
 
04:27:19.990 --> 04:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
respect to the pandemic and we can
 
04:27:21.429 --> 04:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
certainly walk the committee through all
 
04:27:24.469 --> 04:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
of that next week if you'd like us to
 
04:27:28.790 --> 04:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:30.389 --> 04:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:27:36.149 --> 04:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:38.550 --> 04:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative ebal
 
04:27:41.830 --> 04:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm looking at the cmac
 
04:27:41.840 --> 04:27:43.269 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm looking at the cmac
funds

04:27:43.269 --> 04:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
funds
 
04:27:43.279 --> 04:27:44.630 align:start position:0%
funds
um

04:27:44.630 --> 04:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:47.030 --> 04:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
how much i mean i feel like there have
 
04:27:49.110 --> 04:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
been times that we've used the cmaq
 
04:27:51.349 --> 04:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
funds for other things like park and
 
04:27:51.359 --> 04:27:52.389 align:start position:0%
funds for other things like park and
rides

04:27:52.389 --> 04:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
rides
 
04:27:54.630 --> 04:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
i mean you can't use those as a mat i
 
04:27:56.870 --> 04:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
mean what's the flexibility with their
 
04:27:56.880 --> 04:28:01.189 align:start position:0%
mean what's the flexibility with their
usage

04:28:01.189 --> 04:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:03.590 --> 04:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
um so where cmac is concerned we could
 
04:28:05.510 --> 04:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
use it for transit
 
04:28:09.590 --> 04:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
if you're providing say a new service
 
04:28:11.750 --> 04:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
in an effort to reduce congestion by
 
04:28:13.670 --> 04:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
encouraging people to ride public
 
04:28:13.680 --> 04:28:14.630 align:start position:0%
encouraging people to ride public
transit

04:28:14.630 --> 04:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
transit
 
04:28:14.640 --> 04:28:17.510 align:start position:0%
transit
however

04:28:17.510 --> 04:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:19.110 --> 04:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
you still have to find a way to pay for
 
04:28:22.389 --> 04:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
the operations of that service long term
 
04:28:24.950 --> 04:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
so if you use cmac to start up a new
 
04:28:26.309 --> 04:28:26.319 align:start position:0%
transit service
 
04:28:28.469 --> 04:28:28.479 align:start position:0%
then you have three years
 
04:28:30.229 --> 04:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
before you have to find a way to make
 
04:28:32.469 --> 04:28:32.479 align:start position:0%
that service self-sufficient
 
04:28:34.389 --> 04:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
from an operating perspective
 
04:28:36.149 --> 04:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
so that's why it's been challenging to
 
04:28:39.510 --> 04:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
use cmac for transit specifically
 
04:28:41.269 --> 04:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
but there are many different types of
 
04:28:44.070 --> 04:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
projects that are eligible under cmaq
 
04:28:45.750 --> 04:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
from constructing park and rides because
 
04:28:48.630 --> 04:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
it encourages both carpooling as well as
 
04:28:50.469 --> 04:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
perhaps could provide access to transit
 
04:28:52.309 --> 04:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
if we have a terminal at that park and
 
04:28:54.710 --> 04:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
ride location
 
04:28:56.309 --> 04:28:56.319 align:start position:0%
to some of the corridor improvements
 
04:28:58.710 --> 04:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
that we have invested in
 
04:29:00.389 --> 04:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
walking and biking projects that we've
 
04:29:02.550 --> 04:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
invested in
 
04:29:04.950 --> 04:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
anything that's giving people options
 
04:29:10.070 --> 04:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:14.469 --> 04:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:14.479 --> 04:29:15.429 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:29:15.429 --> 04:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:17.349 --> 04:29:17.359 align:start position:0%
does it deal with what i asked her to
 
04:29:20.389 --> 04:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
come back for as far as transit rail
 
04:29:20.399 --> 04:29:21.830 align:start position:0%
come back for as far as transit rail
aeronautics

04:29:21.830 --> 04:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
aeronautics
 
04:29:23.670 --> 04:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
before we just start jumping around the
 
04:29:28.950 --> 04:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:30.830 --> 04:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
i was just going to ask how it's
 
04:29:34.149 --> 04:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
determined what we get for cmac funding
 
04:29:37.990 --> 04:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
what that formula is did you hear me
 
04:29:42.309 --> 04:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
so cmac is one of the set-aside programs
 
04:29:44.630 --> 04:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
so it's a federal highway program it's
 
04:29:46.950 --> 04:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
not a federal transit program
 
04:29:49.429 --> 04:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
but what happens is we receive a total
 
04:29:49.439 --> 04:29:50.790 align:start position:0%
but what happens is we receive a total
apportionment

04:29:50.790 --> 04:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
apportionment
 
04:29:52.469 --> 04:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
and then we're required to spend a
 
04:29:54.550 --> 04:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
certain amount in these sub-allocations
 
04:29:55.750 --> 04:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
of c-mac
 
04:29:58.389 --> 04:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
tap which is transportation alternatives
 
04:30:00.309 --> 04:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
h-sip the highway safety improvement
 
04:30:00.319 --> 04:30:01.830 align:start position:0%
h-sip the highway safety improvement
program

04:30:01.830 --> 04:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:30:03.990 --> 04:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
and then we have to use at least 50
 
04:30:06.229 --> 04:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
percent of what we are
 
04:30:09.590 --> 04:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
what you calculate by set aside for cmac
 
04:30:11.590 --> 04:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
you can flex some of it to other more
 
04:30:13.830 --> 04:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
general purposes but what we have seen
 
04:30:15.349 --> 04:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
04:30:17.269 --> 04:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
with programs like tap and see mac is
 
04:30:19.269 --> 04:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
they can sometimes be oversubscribed so
 
04:30:20.870 --> 04:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
if we're receiving
 
04:30:22.870 --> 04:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
more project applications than we have
 
04:30:24.870 --> 04:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
dollars then it's hard to justify
 
04:30:24.880 --> 04:30:26.309 align:start position:0%
dollars then it's hard to justify
flexing

04:30:26.309 --> 04:30:26.319 align:start position:0%
flexing
 
04:30:29.030 --> 04:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
that money to another category um cmac
 
04:30:31.030 --> 04:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
there has to be you do a cost benefit
 
04:30:33.030 --> 04:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
analysis and you have to show that there
 
04:30:35.590 --> 04:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
truly is an air quality benefit
 
04:30:37.269 --> 04:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
from the project so there's been times
 
04:30:39.510 --> 04:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
when individuals have asked for
 
04:30:41.750 --> 04:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
you know a sidewalk project
 
04:30:43.349 --> 04:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
or something of that nature to be cmaq
 
04:30:46.550 --> 04:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
funded but we can't justify it based on
 
04:30:48.950 --> 04:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
how they calculate the air quality
 
04:30:48.960 --> 04:30:50.469 align:start position:0%
how they calculate the air quality
improvement

04:30:50.469 --> 04:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
improvement
 
04:30:52.070 --> 04:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
that's why those projects are better
 
04:30:53.510 --> 04:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
candidates for tap transportation
 
04:30:57.030 --> 04:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
alternatives but we have had projects
 
04:30:58.309 --> 04:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:31:00.070 --> 04:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
the rail trail project that we're doing
 
04:31:02.710 --> 04:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
on the seacoast extending the greenway
 
04:31:04.950 --> 04:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
and that's a project where we did use
 
04:31:07.349 --> 04:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
cmac funds to acquire the corridor and
 
04:31:09.830 --> 04:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
are advancing that rail trail because it
 
04:31:11.830 --> 04:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
could be a commuting corridor
 
04:31:14.469 --> 04:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
because the number of points of access
 
04:31:16.630 --> 04:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
based on the forecasted use of that card
 
04:31:22.149 --> 04:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:24.630 --> 04:31:24.640 align:start position:0%
representative faulkner thank you
 
04:31:26.790 --> 04:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
jeremiah uh you mentioned beforehand
 
04:31:28.070 --> 04:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
that if
 
04:31:29.670 --> 04:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
we have additional
 
04:31:32.149 --> 04:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
services we may get additional
 
04:31:34.950 --> 04:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
money out of the federal programs
 
04:31:36.950 --> 04:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
could you just maybe explain what what
 
04:31:39.349 --> 04:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
elements go into the formula both
 
04:31:42.790 --> 04:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
transit and perhaps even highways things
 
04:31:44.469 --> 04:31:44.479 align:start position:0%
so each of the different programs the
 
04:31:47.349 --> 04:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner explained before the 53s
 
04:31:48.550 --> 04:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
they all have a slightly different
 
04:31:50.870 --> 04:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
funding basis on the national level and
 
04:31:53.429 --> 04:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
some of them are based on population so
 
04:31:55.110 --> 04:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
different subsets of the population in
 
04:31:57.510 --> 04:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
those geographic areas and some
 
04:32:00.550 --> 04:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
are based on revenue miles and passenger
 
04:32:02.389 --> 04:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
trips so i think the commissioner was
 
04:32:03.670 --> 04:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
explaining in the case of the new
 
04:32:05.670 --> 04:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire capital corridor after so many
 
04:32:05.680 --> 04:32:07.110 align:start position:0%
hampshire capital corridor after so many
years

04:32:07.110 --> 04:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:32:07.120 --> 04:32:08.389 align:start position:0%
years
of

04:32:08.389 --> 04:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:32:09.910 --> 04:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
providing that information to the
 
04:32:11.750 --> 04:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
federal government through the formula
 
04:32:13.750 --> 04:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
we would then generate additional
 
04:32:16.149 --> 04:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
dollars based on those additional rail
 
04:32:18.710 --> 04:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
miles those revenue miles and through
 
04:32:20.229 --> 04:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
the passenger trips but it would
 
04:32:23.030 --> 04:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
probably take about three years before
 
04:32:24.870 --> 04:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
that data went in that we would see that
 
04:32:26.870 --> 04:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
incremental increase in the funding
 
04:32:34.229 --> 04:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:37.590 --> 04:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
any further questions about transit and
 
04:32:39.269 --> 04:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
the transit project
 
04:32:41.910 --> 04:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
i they're
 
04:32:44.710 --> 04:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
broken up within our um
 
04:32:46.229 --> 04:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:32:46.239 --> 04:32:47.349 align:start position:0%
the the
proposed

04:32:47.349 --> 04:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
04:32:47.359 --> 04:32:48.469 align:start position:0%
proposed
plan

04:32:48.469 --> 04:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
plan
 
04:32:51.510 --> 04:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
based on location if i if i remember
 
04:32:53.830 --> 04:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
correctly going through it
 
04:32:57.910 --> 04:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:59.670 --> 04:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
just under
 
04:32:59.680 --> 04:33:01.030 align:start position:0%
just under
area

04:33:01.030 --> 04:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
area
 
04:33:03.030 --> 04:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
just so that people can start looking
 
04:33:04.150 --> 04:33:04.160 align:start position:0%
for it
 
04:33:06.390 --> 04:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
and the reason i bring that up is all of
 
04:33:08.709 --> 04:33:08.719 align:start position:0%
a sudden you if you're walking around
 
04:33:10.470 --> 04:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
the state house you are now the subject
 
04:33:13.429 --> 04:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
matter experts on the intermodal uh
 
04:33:16.869 --> 04:33:16.879 align:start position:0%
transportation plan from your colleagues
 
04:33:19.349 --> 04:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
so at least be able to show them where
 
04:33:22.390 --> 04:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:24.230 --> 04:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
yes if you are looking at your 10-year
 
04:33:26.070 --> 04:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
plan book and you go to the back of the
 
04:33:26.080 --> 04:33:27.429 align:start position:0%
plan book and you go to the back of the
book

04:33:27.429 --> 04:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
book
 
04:33:28.551 --> 04:33:28.561 align:start position:0%
that's where we have all of the
 
04:33:31.590 --> 04:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
state-wide programmatics
 
04:33:33.670 --> 04:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
that's all the
 
04:33:35.670 --> 04:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
the programs we don't have an individual
 
04:33:38.470 --> 04:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
project location so for example on page
 
04:33:41.830 --> 04:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
2 212 and 213 you'll see the funding for
 
04:33:44.310 --> 04:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
manchester transit
 
04:33:46.230 --> 04:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
and nashua transit
 
04:33:47.590 --> 04:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
and so it's all accounted for in the
 
04:33:49.189 --> 04:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
10-year plan
 
04:33:51.990 --> 04:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's their operating assistance
 
04:33:54.230 --> 04:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
for their fixed route service
 
04:33:55.590 --> 04:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
or what they're
 
04:33:57.670 --> 04:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
providing for service to seniors
 
04:33:59.189 --> 04:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities we have it
 
04:34:01.029 --> 04:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
all called out separately so you'll see
 
04:34:03.349 --> 04:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
the same transit agency appear multiple
 
04:34:07.269 --> 04:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
times because it'll be their use of 5307
 
04:34:07.279 --> 04:34:08.390 align:start position:0%
times because it'll be their use of 5307
or

04:34:08.390 --> 04:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:34:10.310 --> 04:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
5311 depending on whether they're urban
 
04:34:12.310 --> 04:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
or rural as well as their allocation of
 
04:34:12.320 --> 04:34:13.830 align:start position:0%
or rural as well as their allocation of
5310

04:34:13.830 --> 04:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
5310
 
04:34:15.990 --> 04:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
as well as any capital projects that we
 
04:34:18.230 --> 04:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
anticipate being funded
 
04:34:19.590 --> 04:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
it is by
 
04:34:21.990 --> 04:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
to your point it is by geographic so the
 
04:34:23.670 --> 04:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
systems that are in the large urbanized
 
04:34:25.590 --> 04:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
areas who have to put their grants in
 
04:34:27.590 --> 04:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
directly to the federal transit
 
04:34:29.830 --> 04:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
administration are specifically called
 
04:34:31.429 --> 04:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
out like the commissioner showed with
 
04:34:34.230 --> 04:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
manchester and nashua but the 5311 the
 
04:34:36.230 --> 04:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
rural transit operators are like concord
 
04:34:38.709 --> 04:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
area transit advanced transit those are
 
04:34:41.029 --> 04:34:41.039 align:start position:0%
all in one statewide programmatic that
 
04:34:43.510 --> 04:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
would be fta section 5311 because the
 
04:34:45.510 --> 04:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
department is the one who administers
 
04:34:47.349 --> 04:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
the grant funds and therefore we make
 
04:34:49.189 --> 04:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
the funding decisions so those go in as
 
04:34:54.709 --> 04:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:57.429 --> 04:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
any further questions about transit
 
04:35:01.429 --> 04:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
funding transit projects within the
 
04:35:05.510 --> 04:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:05.520 --> 04:35:06.830 align:start position:0%
 
see

04:35:06.830 --> 04:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
see
 
04:35:11.670 --> 04:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:14.150 --> 04:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
i just i mean
 
04:35:16.470 --> 04:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
what i i'm looking at the c-max section
 
04:35:18.470 --> 04:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
when you have a category that's called
 
04:35:21.029 --> 04:35:21.039 align:start position:0%
mandated federal what what does that
 
04:35:21.039 --> 04:35:22.709 align:start position:0%
mandated federal what what does that
mean

04:35:22.709 --> 04:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
mean
 
04:35:25.269 --> 04:35:25.279 align:start position:0%
so as i said before these are required
 
04:35:27.510 --> 04:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
programs so we get our total
 
04:35:29.670 --> 04:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
apportionment and then we have these
 
04:35:31.670 --> 04:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
mandated programs that we have to set
 
04:35:34.390 --> 04:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
aside funding for like tap c-mac and
 
04:35:34.400 --> 04:35:35.750 align:start position:0%
aside funding for like tap c-mac and
h-zip

04:35:35.750 --> 04:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
h-zip
 
04:35:38.789 --> 04:35:38.799 align:start position:0%
we do have flexibility that some of the
 
04:35:41.510 --> 04:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
so you calculate how much by formula you
 
04:35:43.990 --> 04:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
should be allocating to those programs
 
04:35:46.310 --> 04:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
and you then have some discretion
 
04:35:48.390 --> 04:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
to move up to 50 percent of the funding
 
04:35:50.869 --> 04:35:50.879 align:start position:0%
out of that category into something else
 
04:35:53.990 --> 04:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
but you're mandated to spend at least 50
 
04:35:56.390 --> 04:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
percent of what you calculated at cmac
 
04:35:58.310 --> 04:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
on cmac you're mandated to spend at
 
04:35:59.429 --> 04:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
least 50
 
04:36:01.510 --> 04:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
of transportation alternatives on
 
04:36:03.590 --> 04:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
projects of that type
 
04:36:05.109 --> 04:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
so across all of the different
 
04:36:08.070 --> 04:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
subcategories of federal funds
 
04:36:09.349 --> 04:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
we've talked a lot about the federal
 
04:36:11.429 --> 04:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
highway program
 
04:36:14.150 --> 04:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
but it's not just cmak and tap and hcip
 
04:36:15.670 --> 04:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:36:15.680 --> 04:36:16.830 align:start position:0%
we have
stp

04:36:16.830 --> 04:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
stp
 
04:36:19.189 --> 04:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
nhpp there's all these different
 
04:36:19.199 --> 04:36:20.789 align:start position:0%
nhpp there's all these different
subcategories

04:36:20.789 --> 04:36:20.799 align:start position:0%
subcategories
 
04:36:22.470 --> 04:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:36:24.551 --> 04:36:24.561 align:start position:0%
you know we have bridge funds off system
 
04:36:27.109 --> 04:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
bridge funds we're balancing all the
 
04:36:29.269 --> 04:36:29.279 align:start position:0%
time our allocations in each of those
 
04:36:32.949 --> 04:36:32.959 align:start position:0%
subcategories it's not just one giant
 
04:36:41.349 --> 04:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:45.269 --> 04:36:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:46.949 --> 04:36:46.959 align:start position:0%
the sections
 
04:36:48.949 --> 04:36:48.959 align:start position:0%
just if we could go over
 
04:36:50.310 --> 04:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
rail funding
 
04:36:51.830 --> 04:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
and the fact that
 
04:36:51.840 --> 04:36:52.629 align:start position:0%
and the fact that
what

04:36:52.629 --> 04:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:36:54.949 --> 04:36:54.959 align:start position:0%
does this money pay for and where it
 
04:36:57.189 --> 04:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
comes from i know we went over it
 
04:37:00.230 --> 04:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
briefly at one of our prior meetings on
 
04:37:03.029 --> 04:37:03.039 align:start position:0%
the source of funding but what does it
 
04:37:03.039 --> 04:37:04.230 align:start position:0%
the source of funding but what does it
benefit

04:37:04.230 --> 04:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
04:37:05.750 --> 04:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
what type of
 
04:37:07.269 --> 04:37:07.279 align:start position:0%
state-owned rails
 
04:37:12.070 --> 04:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:13.750 --> 04:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
within the 10-year plan we only have
 
04:37:16.949 --> 04:37:16.959 align:start position:0%
10.6 million programmed for
 
04:37:16.959 --> 04:37:17.910 align:start position:0%
10.6 million programmed for
rail

04:37:17.910 --> 04:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
rail
 
04:37:21.029 --> 04:37:21.039 align:start position:0%
and that's about 1.1 million per year
 
04:37:22.949 --> 04:37:22.959 align:start position:0%
that is general funds
 
04:37:24.709 --> 04:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
so we're prohibited from using highway
 
04:37:26.629 --> 04:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
funds for anything other than a highway
 
04:37:26.639 --> 04:37:27.910 align:start position:0%
funds for anything other than a highway
purpose

04:37:27.910 --> 04:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
04:37:30.230 --> 04:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
so when we're funding aeronautics rail
 
04:37:32.310 --> 04:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
and transit beyond federal dollars it's
 
04:37:33.510 --> 04:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
always general funds that we're
 
04:37:33.520 --> 04:37:35.429 align:start position:0%
always general funds that we're
accessing

04:37:35.429 --> 04:37:35.439 align:start position:0%
accessing
 
04:37:36.789 --> 04:37:36.799 align:start position:0%
we have what's called the special
 
04:37:39.750 --> 04:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
railroad fund so approximately 600 000
 
04:37:42.629 --> 04:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
per year flows into the special railroad
 
04:37:45.029 --> 04:37:45.039 align:start position:0%
fund that's primarily coming from the
 
04:37:46.551 --> 04:37:46.561 align:start position:0%
lease agreements that we have with
 
04:37:48.470 --> 04:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
private rail operators who use the
 
04:37:50.789 --> 04:37:50.799 align:start position:0%
state-owned corridors
 
04:37:52.949 --> 04:37:52.959 align:start position:0%
the funds that we raise
 
04:37:54.949 --> 04:37:54.959 align:start position:0%
through those operating agreements go
 
04:37:56.949 --> 04:37:56.959 align:start position:0%
right back into the rail corridor so
 
04:37:59.109 --> 04:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
we're using those funds for maintenance
 
04:38:01.029 --> 04:38:01.039 align:start position:0%
and construction on the state-owned
 
04:38:01.039 --> 04:38:02.230 align:start position:0%
and construction on the state-owned
lines

04:38:02.230 --> 04:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
lines
 
04:38:03.990 --> 04:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
so that's why it's beneficial you know
 
04:38:06.230 --> 04:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
we release the lines to the operators
 
04:38:07.910 --> 04:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
and then we take a piece of the revenue
 
04:38:09.590 --> 04:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
to keep those lines in a good state of
 
04:38:09.600 --> 04:38:10.949 align:start position:0%
to keep those lines in a good state of
repair

04:38:10.949 --> 04:38:10.959 align:start position:0%
repair
 
04:38:12.709 --> 04:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
in addition we have the
 
04:38:15.910 --> 04:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
railroad revolving loan fund um so
 
04:38:17.830 --> 04:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
we wait till the balances build up and
 
04:38:19.910 --> 04:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
it ends up being about 1.5 million
 
04:38:22.551 --> 04:38:22.561 align:start position:0%
that's available every three years or so
 
04:38:25.670 --> 04:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
um that's a state bonded program
 
04:38:28.150 --> 04:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
for capital work on their class 3 and
 
04:38:31.029 --> 04:38:31.039 align:start position:0%
cog railroads so those operators can
 
04:38:33.910 --> 04:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
come to us and ask to borrow money from
 
04:38:35.990 --> 04:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
the revolving loan fund
 
04:38:37.510 --> 04:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
so that's another way that we can pay
 
04:38:39.910 --> 04:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
for projects in the state
 
04:38:42.070 --> 04:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day um we have six
 
04:38:43.990 --> 04:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
railroad operators under service
 
04:38:46.310 --> 04:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
agreements to work on or to operate on
 
04:38:48.150 --> 04:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
the state-owned lines four of them are
 
04:38:49.990 --> 04:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
freight service and then we have our two
 
04:38:52.551 --> 04:38:52.561 align:start position:0%
tourist and excursion services
 
04:38:55.910 --> 04:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
we have in total about 153 miles of
 
04:38:57.830 --> 04:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
active track that is part of these
 
04:38:59.510 --> 04:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
operating agreements
 
04:39:01.910 --> 04:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
and then about 41 miles of track that's
 
04:39:04.949 --> 04:39:04.959 align:start position:0%
really used less frequently
 
04:39:08.310 --> 04:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
and then beyond the active corridors we
 
04:39:11.750 --> 04:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
have 339 miles of abandoned track
 
04:39:13.750 --> 04:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
or sorry abandoned corridor
 
04:39:13.760 --> 04:39:14.551 align:start position:0%
or sorry abandoned corridor
um

04:39:14.551 --> 04:39:14.561 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:17.670 --> 04:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
and a lot of that is included in
 
04:39:21.349 --> 04:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
managed rail trail agreements
 
04:39:21.359 --> 04:39:22.869 align:start position:0%
managed rail trail agreements
so

04:39:22.869 --> 04:39:22.879 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:39:22.879 --> 04:39:24.709 align:start position:0%
so
our

04:39:24.709 --> 04:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:39:27.910 --> 04:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
rail programs are much smaller than our
 
04:39:30.869 --> 04:39:30.879 align:start position:0%
other transportation programs
 
04:39:32.390 --> 04:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
and we are very
 
04:39:34.390 --> 04:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
dependent on general funds to support
 
04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
those programs although we do through hb
 
04:39:40.390 --> 04:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
25 also try to secure dollars to invest
 
04:39:42.150 --> 04:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
in the rail corridors when it's deemed
 
04:39:42.160 --> 04:39:43.510 align:start position:0%
in the rail corridors when it's deemed
necessary

04:39:43.510 --> 04:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
04:39:45.270 --> 04:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
in past budgets we've received some
 
04:39:48.230 --> 04:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
funding to do work on bridges or
 
04:39:48.240 --> 04:39:49.910 align:start position:0%
funding to do work on bridges or
culverts

04:39:49.910 --> 04:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
culverts
 
04:39:51.350 --> 04:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
and then some of the private railroads
 
04:39:52.470 --> 04:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
have also
 
04:39:53.910 --> 04:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
come before
 
04:39:55.830 --> 04:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
the legislature during the development
 
04:39:58.390 --> 04:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
of hb 25 and requested
 
04:39:59.990 --> 04:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
funding to supplement what they're
 
04:40:02.708 --> 04:40:02.718 align:start position:0%
investing in their corridors
 
04:40:04.310 --> 04:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
because we do have a lot of privately
 
04:40:07.110 --> 04:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
owned rail corridors in the state
 
04:40:09.190 --> 04:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
that are important to the shippers that
 
04:40:16.788 --> 04:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:17.910 --> 04:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
04:40:19.830 --> 04:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
the point that this committee needs to
 
04:40:21.990 --> 04:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
make when anybody asks about rail
 
04:40:23.510 --> 04:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
funding in this
 
04:40:26.470 --> 04:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
that there is no funding other than
 
04:40:30.070 --> 04:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
for for passenger rail at this time it
 
04:40:31.830 --> 04:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
is for freight rail
 
04:40:34.230 --> 04:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
and the the two uh
 
04:40:37.430 --> 04:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
tourists and ex excursions services that
 
04:40:40.070 --> 04:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
we are working with um because that
 
04:40:41.830 --> 04:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
question will come up why is there
 
04:40:44.708 --> 04:40:44.718 align:start position:0%
railroad money in the 10-year plan it is
 
04:40:46.868 --> 04:40:46.878 align:start position:0%
not for
 
04:40:49.670 --> 04:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
passenger rail it is for state owned
 
04:40:52.948 --> 04:40:52.958 align:start position:0%
rail corridors that we work with the
 
04:40:55.430 --> 04:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
people who lease the corridor so that
 
04:40:58.070 --> 04:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
they can use it
 
04:41:01.030 --> 04:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
did i say that right commissioner
 
04:41:03.990 --> 04:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
you did mr chairman and um
 
04:41:05.030 --> 04:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
yeah the
 
04:41:06.550 --> 04:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
important thing to remember about the
 
04:41:08.948 --> 04:41:08.958 align:start position:0%
capital corridor project yes it's a rail
 
04:41:12.948 --> 04:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
line it's a rail project but it's not
 
04:41:14.788 --> 04:41:14.798 align:start position:0%
a project where we're using federal
 
04:41:17.350 --> 04:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
railroad administration grants it's not
 
04:41:19.190 --> 04:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
funded with the rail dollars that are in
 
04:41:21.910 --> 04:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan it's it's a transit
 
04:41:23.910 --> 04:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
funded project because we're looking at
 
04:41:26.708 --> 04:41:26.718 align:start position:0%
commuter frequency
 
04:41:28.390 --> 04:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
so it's actually in the transit side not
 
04:41:31.110 --> 04:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:33.990 --> 04:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um any other questions
 
04:41:36.550 --> 04:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
or comments about rail
 
04:41:38.708 --> 04:41:38.718 align:start position:0%
freight rail and and what's in
 
04:41:44.150 --> 04:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:46.948 --> 04:41:46.958 align:start position:0%
see none um
 
04:41:46.958 --> 04:41:50.868 align:start position:0%
see none um
aeronautics

04:41:50.868 --> 04:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:53.990 --> 04:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
so aeronautics uh
 
04:41:55.270 --> 04:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
is a little different from these other
 
04:41:57.750 --> 04:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
programs again because
 
04:41:59.430 --> 04:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
aeronautics is not part of surface
 
04:41:59.440 --> 04:42:01.110 align:start position:0%
aeronautics is not part of surface
transportation

04:42:01.110 --> 04:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
04:42:04.868 --> 04:42:04.878 align:start position:0%
so uh when they passed the iija
 
04:42:06.628 --> 04:42:06.638 align:start position:0%
it was both a surface transportation
 
04:42:06.638 --> 04:42:08.628 align:start position:0%
it was both a surface transportation
reauthorization

04:42:08.628 --> 04:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
reauthorization
 
04:42:11.510 --> 04:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
bill and an infrastructure bill so in
 
04:42:14.230 --> 04:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
the iija we're receiving yes more money
 
04:42:16.230 --> 04:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
for airports in the state
 
04:42:17.990 --> 04:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
but those dollars are truly above and
 
04:42:20.070 --> 04:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
beyond what's currently authorized in
 
04:42:22.390 --> 04:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
law for aeronautics and we've got one
 
04:42:25.750 --> 04:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
more year left on the appropriations for
 
04:42:28.550 --> 04:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
or the authorization for aeronautics um
 
04:42:30.230 --> 04:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
so what's in this 10-year plan we have
 
04:42:32.788 --> 04:42:32.798 align:start position:0%
382 million programs so it works out to
 
04:42:36.788 --> 04:42:36.798 align:start position:0%
about 38.2 million per year the primary
 
04:42:39.510 --> 04:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
source of funds is the federal aviation
 
04:42:42.948 --> 04:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:45.030 --> 04:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
like the transit side of the house these
 
04:42:48.550 --> 04:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
are all grant-based programs so while we
 
04:42:50.230 --> 04:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
anticipate a certain amount of money by
 
04:42:50.240 --> 04:42:51.350 align:start position:0%
anticipate a certain amount of money by
formula

04:42:51.350 --> 04:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
formula
 
04:42:52.868 --> 04:42:52.878 align:start position:0%
every individual project has to be
 
04:42:55.030 --> 04:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
submitted to fta in these different
 
04:42:56.868 --> 04:42:56.878 align:start position:0%
grant categories and receive their
 
04:42:58.948 --> 04:42:58.958 align:start position:0%
concurrence so that we can advance the
 
04:42:58.958 --> 04:42:59.990 align:start position:0%
concurrence so that we can advance the
project

04:42:59.990 --> 04:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
project
 
04:43:01.750 --> 04:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
and so that's why we refer to it as
 
04:43:04.310 --> 04:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
discretionary entitlement and state
 
04:43:04.320 --> 04:43:06.150 align:start position:0%
discretionary entitlement and state
apportioned

04:43:06.150 --> 04:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
apportioned
 
04:43:07.350 --> 04:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
we've got these funding in different
 
04:43:09.830 --> 04:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
buckets that we're constantly managing
 
04:43:12.310 --> 04:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
as we submit projects to faa for their
 
04:43:12.320 --> 04:43:15.830 align:start position:0%
as we submit projects to faa for their
consideration

04:43:15.830 --> 04:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:18.788 --> 04:43:18.798 align:start position:0%
what we receive by formula is based on
 
04:43:21.270 --> 04:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
faa's designation of
 
04:43:23.590 --> 04:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
the priorities nationally to support
 
04:43:23.600 --> 04:43:24.788 align:start position:0%
the priorities nationally to support
aviation

04:43:24.788 --> 04:43:24.798 align:start position:0%
aviation
 
04:43:26.310 --> 04:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
and the most important thing to know is
 
04:43:28.150 --> 04:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
that not every airport in the state is
 
04:43:31.350 --> 04:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
eligible for the federal funds
 
04:43:33.110 --> 04:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
and these funds are restricted purely to
 
04:43:34.868 --> 04:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
aviation we cannot move them to any
 
04:43:36.708 --> 04:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
other category
 
04:43:38.628 --> 04:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
most of the funding programs that are
 
04:43:41.190 --> 04:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
administered by the faa are
 
04:43:43.990 --> 04:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
90 10 programs so it's 90 federal with a
 
04:43:47.110 --> 04:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
10 match and here in new hampshire
 
04:43:48.948 --> 04:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
we provide 5
 
04:43:51.030 --> 04:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
state match with 5
 
04:43:53.350 --> 04:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
coming from the municipalities to make
 
04:43:55.110 --> 04:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
up that 10 percent
 
04:43:57.270 --> 04:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
and so we only have 14 projects in this
 
04:44:00.390 --> 04:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
10-year plan called out by town
 
04:44:01.750 --> 04:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
an airport name
 
04:44:03.270 --> 04:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
and that's based on the projects that we
 
04:44:05.990 --> 04:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
know have been approved by faa
 
04:44:08.230 --> 04:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
the rest of the money is anticipated
 
04:44:08.240 --> 04:44:09.350 align:start position:0%
the rest of the money is anticipated
funding

04:44:09.350 --> 04:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:44:11.430 --> 04:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
that we have like the fta money
 
04:44:13.190 --> 04:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
programmed in these programmatic
 
04:44:13.200 --> 04:44:14.550 align:start position:0%
programmed in these programmatic
categories

04:44:14.550 --> 04:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
categories
 
04:44:16.550 --> 04:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
and then we work with every airport to
 
04:44:19.030 --> 04:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
develop airport improvement plans
 
04:44:21.350 --> 04:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
through that process they identify their
 
04:44:22.708 --> 04:44:22.718 align:start position:0%
projects and then they submit those
 
04:44:26.070 --> 04:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
projects to faa and as they're funded
 
04:44:27.990 --> 04:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
we support the airports and moving them
 
04:44:28.000 --> 04:44:29.190 align:start position:0%
we support the airports and moving them
forward

04:44:29.190 --> 04:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:44:30.868 --> 04:44:30.878 align:start position:0%
so we have three commercial airports in
 
04:44:33.430 --> 04:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
the state that's portsmouth manchester
 
04:44:34.708 --> 04:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
and lebanon
 
04:44:37.110 --> 04:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
um those commercial airports receive
 
04:44:38.550 --> 04:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
direct funding
 
04:44:40.948 --> 04:44:40.958 align:start position:0%
as well as partnering with us to be able
 
04:44:42.708 --> 04:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
to access
 
04:44:45.110 --> 04:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
some of the different grant programs
 
04:44:47.350 --> 04:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
and then we have only nine publicly
 
04:44:47.360 --> 04:44:48.470 align:start position:0%
and then we have only nine publicly
owned

04:44:48.470 --> 04:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
owned
 
04:44:50.230 --> 04:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
airports that are eligible for federal
 
04:44:50.240 --> 04:44:51.430 align:start position:0%
airports that are eligible for federal
funds

04:44:51.430 --> 04:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
funds
 
04:44:55.030 --> 04:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:57.110 --> 04:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
yes there's a giant poster on the wall
 
04:44:59.510 --> 04:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
that might be the easiest way for you to
 
04:44:59.520 --> 04:45:00.470 align:start position:0%
that might be the easiest way for you to
um

04:45:00.470 --> 04:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:01.990 --> 04:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
look up one of the airports and the
 
04:45:03.510 --> 04:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
materials that we've passed out you have
 
04:45:05.510 --> 04:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
the maps to reference but i think that
 
04:45:07.590 --> 04:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
larger scale one is probably the easiest
 
04:45:09.270 --> 04:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
for you to reference
 
04:45:11.190 --> 04:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
in addition to the fed aid eligible
 
04:45:13.510 --> 04:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
airports we have 12 what we call general
 
04:45:15.510 --> 04:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
aviation airports they're open to the
 
04:45:18.070 --> 04:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
public and privately owned and because
 
04:45:19.350 --> 04:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
they're privately owned they're not
 
04:45:22.628 --> 04:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
eligible for federal funds
 
04:45:23.990 --> 04:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
but they are an important part of the
 
04:45:24.000 --> 04:45:25.190 align:start position:0%
but they are an important part of the
overall

04:45:25.190 --> 04:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
overall
 
04:45:27.750 --> 04:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
network in new hampshire
 
04:45:29.590 --> 04:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
um so the like i said there's a lot less
 
04:45:31.910 --> 04:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
discussion of
 
04:45:33.830 --> 04:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh the airport projects just because of
 
04:45:35.430 --> 04:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
the nature of the programs and how
 
04:45:36.868 --> 04:45:36.878 align:start position:0%
they're administered
 
04:45:37.990 --> 04:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
and we're not sitting with this
 
04:45:39.590 --> 04:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
committee trying to identify where you'd
 
04:45:41.270 --> 04:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
like to spend the money
 
04:45:42.550 --> 04:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
in the way that we are in the highway
 
04:45:42.560 --> 04:45:44.788 align:start position:0%
in the way that we are in the highway
side

04:45:44.788 --> 04:45:44.798 align:start position:0%
side
 
04:45:46.390 --> 04:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
and certainly if there's very detailed
 
04:45:48.628 --> 04:45:48.638 align:start position:0%
questions i can have trish lambert
 
04:45:50.948 --> 04:45:50.958 align:start position:0%
attend next week's work session but i
 
04:45:52.550 --> 04:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
can do my best to answer any questions
 
04:45:55.270 --> 04:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
that you might have today
 
04:45:59.910 --> 04:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:03.110 --> 04:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
is there a need to have
 
04:46:04.788 --> 04:46:04.798 align:start position:0%
the department to come back and talk
 
04:46:07.270 --> 04:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
about it next week
 
04:46:14.390 --> 04:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:15.670 --> 04:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
the one thing i would be remiss if i
 
04:46:17.350 --> 04:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
didn't point out
 
04:46:18.948 --> 04:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
so like
 
04:46:20.390 --> 04:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
public transportation
 
04:46:22.070 --> 04:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of relief funding made
 
04:46:23.750 --> 04:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
available for airports as you can
 
04:46:26.310 --> 04:46:26.320 align:start position:0%
imagine you know day one of the pandemic
 
04:46:27.830 --> 04:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
especially our commercial airports they
 
04:46:30.310 --> 04:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
were significantly impacted
 
04:46:30.320 --> 04:46:31.350 align:start position:0%
were significantly impacted
by

04:46:31.350 --> 04:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:46:34.708 --> 04:46:34.718 align:start position:0%
covet 19. and so once again
 
04:46:36.948 --> 04:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
just like transit you know the cares act
 
04:46:39.750 --> 04:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
chrisa arp
 
04:46:41.190 --> 04:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
through those different relief bills new
 
04:46:42.788 --> 04:46:42.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire did receive a significant
 
04:46:44.310 --> 04:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
amount of funding
 
04:46:46.788 --> 04:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
i think in total it's about 36 million
 
04:46:48.788 --> 04:46:48.798 align:start position:0%
that we received in covert relief for
 
04:46:51.110 --> 04:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
aeronautics purposes
 
04:46:53.030 --> 04:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
some of those funds went directly to the
 
04:46:54.868 --> 04:46:54.878 align:start position:0%
airports like at the three commercial
 
04:46:56.708 --> 04:46:56.718 align:start position:0%
airports they receive operating
 
04:46:58.390 --> 04:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
assistance directly
 
04:47:01.110 --> 04:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
and we helped disperse the funding to
 
04:47:02.868 --> 04:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
the other nine fed eight eligible
 
04:47:02.878 --> 04:47:04.310 align:start position:0%
the other nine fed eight eligible
airports

04:47:04.310 --> 04:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
airports
 
04:47:06.868 --> 04:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
um unlike transit we were able to take
 
04:47:09.510 --> 04:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
that 10 match and convert it to federal
 
04:47:12.150 --> 04:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
so if we had existing projects that were
 
04:47:14.948 --> 04:47:14.958 align:start position:0%
you know grants that were already funded
 
04:47:16.788 --> 04:47:16.798 align:start position:0%
we could
 
04:47:19.590 --> 04:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
remove the state and local match and add
 
04:47:21.190 --> 04:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
some of the federal relief funds to make
 
04:47:22.788 --> 04:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
them a hundred percent
 
04:47:24.868 --> 04:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
um so that's certainly been um
 
04:47:26.708 --> 04:47:26.718 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the airports as they've
 
04:47:33.430 --> 04:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:38.708 --> 04:47:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:40.070 --> 04:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
there are
 
04:47:42.708 --> 04:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
quite a few mandated federal programs as
 
04:47:44.708 --> 04:47:44.718 align:start position:0%
you get especially towards the back of
 
04:47:46.948 --> 04:47:46.958 align:start position:0%
the book i would just ask the committee
 
04:47:48.550 --> 04:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
to look at them some of them will
 
04:47:50.788 --> 04:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
surprise you
 
04:47:50.798 --> 04:47:52.550 align:start position:0%
surprise you
that

04:47:52.550 --> 04:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:47:54.868 --> 04:47:54.878 align:start position:0%
that big bucket of money starts getting
 
04:47:57.670 --> 04:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
smaller as you start taking out some of
 
04:48:01.110 --> 04:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
those mandated programs
 
04:48:03.110 --> 04:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
not saying that they're good bad or
 
04:48:05.350 --> 04:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
indifferent it's just it's been mandated
 
04:48:08.470 --> 04:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
that we spend them in a certain way
 
04:48:10.708 --> 04:48:10.718 align:start position:0%
but i'll go back to
 
04:48:13.270 --> 04:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
04:48:16.070 --> 04:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative evil brought up cmac i
 
04:48:18.150 --> 04:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
know that there is a process for
 
04:48:20.708 --> 04:48:20.718 align:start position:0%
determining how that is
 
04:48:24.070 --> 04:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
however in the 10-year plan all we have
 
04:48:24.080 --> 04:48:25.270 align:start position:0%
however in the 10-year plan all we have
is

04:48:25.270 --> 04:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:48:27.430 --> 04:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
year and how much is going to be spent
 
04:48:29.110 --> 04:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
on certain
 
04:48:29.120 --> 04:48:30.390 align:start position:0%
on certain
um

04:48:30.390 --> 04:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:34.550 --> 04:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
things on the programmatic page 199
 
04:48:36.390 --> 04:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
preliminary engineering but it doesn't
 
04:48:37.590 --> 04:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
say where
 
04:48:43.830 --> 04:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:45.750 --> 04:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
so this is funding that has not yet been
 
04:48:48.470 --> 04:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
assigned to cmac projects
 
04:48:51.190 --> 04:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
so what we have done over the last 10
 
04:48:54.150 --> 04:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
year plan cycles is to alternate between
 
04:48:56.390 --> 04:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
a c-max solicitation and a tap
 
04:48:56.400 --> 04:48:57.750 align:start position:0%
a c-max solicitation and a tap
solicitation

04:48:57.750 --> 04:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
solicitation
 
04:48:59.430 --> 04:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
so this time around it was a tap a
 
04:49:01.030 --> 04:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
transportation alternatives program
 
04:49:01.040 --> 04:49:02.550 align:start position:0%
transportation alternatives program
solicitation

04:49:02.550 --> 04:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
solicitation
 
04:49:04.470 --> 04:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
so we had
 
04:49:07.270 --> 04:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
released that notice received project
 
04:49:09.990 --> 04:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
candidates from municipalities scored
 
04:49:11.510 --> 04:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
those projects
 
04:49:13.590 --> 04:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
and then worked with gasset to
 
04:49:13.600 --> 04:49:14.948 align:start position:0%
and then worked with gasset to
incorporate

04:49:14.948 --> 04:49:14.958 align:start position:0%
incorporate
 
04:49:16.628 --> 04:49:16.638 align:start position:0%
the ones that we could fund and
 
04:49:18.550 --> 04:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
recommended supporting into the draft
 
04:49:19.830 --> 04:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
10-year plan
 
04:49:22.310 --> 04:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
so this time around we were doing tap
 
04:49:24.948 --> 04:49:24.958 align:start position:0%
next 10 year plan cycle we will do a
 
04:49:27.110 --> 04:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
round of cmak so if you look through the
 
04:49:29.430 --> 04:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
book you will find cmaq funded projects
 
04:49:31.590 --> 04:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
those are ones that
 
04:49:33.590 --> 04:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
we've done a prior solicitation and
 
04:49:33.600 --> 04:49:34.868 align:start position:0%
we've done a prior solicitation and
selected

04:49:34.868 --> 04:49:34.878 align:start position:0%
selected
 
04:49:37.750 --> 04:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
in a previous 10-year plan round
 
04:49:39.270 --> 04:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
what you're seeing here is the balance
 
04:49:42.470 --> 04:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:44.230 --> 04:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
what's really challenging about the
 
04:49:47.110 --> 04:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
federal highway programs is we receive
 
04:49:49.590 --> 04:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
an annual apportionment
 
04:49:51.190 --> 04:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
and we actually have three years to
 
04:49:51.200 --> 04:49:52.550 align:start position:0%
and we actually have three years to
spend

04:49:52.550 --> 04:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
spend
 
04:49:55.830 --> 04:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
that category of money
 
04:49:57.670 --> 04:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
what's different from the transit
 
04:50:00.150 --> 04:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
programs and the aeronautics programs is
 
04:50:02.230 --> 04:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
we still have to obligate a total amount
 
04:50:03.990 --> 04:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
each year
 
04:50:05.910 --> 04:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
so this is one of the most complicated
 
04:50:08.708 --> 04:50:08.718 align:start position:0%
things to describe to communities
 
04:50:10.470 --> 04:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
because they see their cmaq project as
 
04:50:13.030 --> 04:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
an example in the 10-year plan they
 
04:50:15.750 --> 04:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
think that money is secure
 
04:50:17.030 --> 04:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
and then something happens they don't
 
04:50:19.430 --> 04:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
deliver it on time
 
04:50:21.910 --> 04:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
and because we're capped in how much we
 
04:50:24.628 --> 04:50:24.638 align:start position:0%
can spend each annual year
 
04:50:27.270 --> 04:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
and the fact that the allocations also
 
04:50:29.990 --> 04:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
expire on a three-year cycle sometimes
 
04:50:32.390 --> 04:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
we might lose that color of money if
 
04:50:33.990 --> 04:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
they don't advance their project quickly
 
04:50:34.000 --> 04:50:35.510 align:start position:0%
they don't advance their project quickly
enough

04:50:35.510 --> 04:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
enough
 
04:50:37.270 --> 04:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
so that's what we're constantly working
 
04:50:40.070 --> 04:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
to resolve with communities
 
04:50:40.080 --> 04:50:41.030 align:start position:0%
to resolve with communities
um

04:50:41.030 --> 04:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:43.510 --> 04:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
so as an example under the fast act our
 
04:50:45.270 --> 04:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
annual apportionment what we received by
 
04:50:47.390 --> 04:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
formula in total was about
 
04:50:50.708 --> 04:50:50.718 align:start position:0%
185 million a little shy of that
 
04:50:52.470 --> 04:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
but our annual amount that we could
 
04:50:55.190 --> 04:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
actually obligate was only 160 something
 
04:50:55.200 --> 04:50:56.150 align:start position:0%
actually obligate was only 160 something
million

04:50:56.150 --> 04:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
million
 
04:50:57.590 --> 04:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
the reason being is you always want to
 
04:50:59.270 --> 04:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
have more projects going forward then
 
04:51:00.788 --> 04:51:00.798 align:start position:0%
you have dollars available because
 
04:51:03.030 --> 04:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
inevitable with the permitting process
 
04:51:05.190 --> 04:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
you know and design progression
 
04:51:06.708 --> 04:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
public input
 
04:51:08.708 --> 04:51:08.718 align:start position:0%
some things might slip but we always
 
04:51:10.550 --> 04:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
have three years to spend that category
 
04:51:12.390 --> 04:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
of money so usually you can manage it
 
04:51:15.750 --> 04:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
year to year and what's challenging is
 
04:51:17.190 --> 04:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
if something goes wrong with a project
 
04:51:18.948 --> 04:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
and people don't get it over the finish
 
04:51:20.788 --> 04:51:20.798 align:start position:0%
line within that three year window you
 
04:51:23.430 --> 04:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
might lose that color of money
 
04:51:25.110 --> 04:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
usually we're getting enough
 
04:51:26.470 --> 04:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
additional apportionment in each of
 
04:51:28.550 --> 04:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
these subcategories that we can free up
 
04:51:31.030 --> 04:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
money of that type but it's
 
04:51:33.990 --> 04:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's very um challenging for us
 
04:51:34.000 --> 04:51:34.948 align:start position:0%
it's very um challenging for us
to

04:51:34.948 --> 04:51:34.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:51:37.750 --> 04:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
balance all of this and you lapse money
 
04:51:39.670 --> 04:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
in these categories
 
04:51:41.350 --> 04:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
which does not mean we give federal
 
04:51:43.670 --> 04:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
funding back
 
04:51:45.750 --> 04:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
we might have consciously decided not to
 
04:51:47.990 --> 04:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
spend a certain color of money but i can
 
04:51:49.990 --> 04:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
guarantee you we obligate every penny
 
04:51:52.150 --> 04:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
that we have available to us every year
 
04:51:54.708 --> 04:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
what we might let lapse is a color of
 
04:51:56.948 --> 04:51:56.958 align:start position:0%
money because we chose not to do that
 
04:51:58.628 --> 04:51:58.638 align:start position:0%
type of project we chose to do something
 
04:52:01.750 --> 04:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
else so it's the difference between
 
04:52:04.150 --> 04:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
authorization apportionment
 
04:52:06.628 --> 04:52:06.638 align:start position:0%
contract authority and obligation it's
 
04:52:08.070 --> 04:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
and it's one of the hardest things for
 
04:52:10.390 --> 04:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
us to communicate to the rpcs and to the
 
04:52:10.400 --> 04:52:12.628 align:start position:0%
us to communicate to the rpcs and to the
municipalities

04:52:12.628 --> 04:52:12.638 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
04:52:14.150 --> 04:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line what we try to do is
 
04:52:16.628 --> 04:52:16.638 align:start position:0%
keep it simple we gave you money we gave
 
04:52:18.708 --> 04:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
it to you in a certain year please try
 
04:52:20.628 --> 04:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
to advance your project within this time
 
04:52:22.948 --> 04:52:22.958 align:start position:0%
frame and then there's no risk you'll
 
04:52:30.230 --> 04:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:30.240 --> 04:52:31.590 align:start position:0%
 
any

04:52:31.590 --> 04:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:52:33.830 --> 04:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
further questions of the commissioner
 
04:52:36.390 --> 04:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
she's been here a couple of hours now
 
04:52:38.230 --> 04:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
with us
 
04:52:40.628 --> 04:52:40.638 align:start position:0%
that burning questions you'd like to
 
04:52:43.430 --> 04:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
have answered today
 
04:52:47.670 --> 04:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
she will be available with us next week
 
04:52:47.680 --> 04:52:49.910 align:start position:0%
she will be available with us next week
if

04:52:49.910 --> 04:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:52:52.788 --> 04:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
looking ahead for next week
 
04:52:55.830 --> 04:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
if you have something specific that you
 
04:52:58.310 --> 04:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
would like the commission
 
04:53:00.788 --> 04:53:00.798 align:start position:0%
commissioner or or anyone in the
 
04:53:03.110 --> 04:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
department to answer
 
04:53:07.110 --> 04:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
about projects funding where we go from
 
04:53:07.120 --> 04:53:09.110 align:start position:0%
about projects funding where we go from
here

04:53:09.110 --> 04:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:53:09.120 --> 04:53:10.708 align:start position:0%
here
please

04:53:10.708 --> 04:53:10.718 align:start position:0%
please
 
04:53:12.948 --> 04:53:12.958 align:start position:0%
let me know and i will get it to
 
04:53:16.070 --> 04:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
probably kathy's the best or to you
 
04:53:16.080 --> 04:53:17.990 align:start position:0%
probably kathy's the best or to you
commissioner

04:53:17.990 --> 04:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
04:53:20.948 --> 04:53:20.958 align:start position:0%
kathy's actually on vacation um until
 
04:53:23.110 --> 04:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
early february so you can just send it
 
04:53:25.110 --> 04:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
to me directly um
 
04:53:26.948 --> 04:53:26.958 align:start position:0%
we have several people out for various
 
04:53:29.110 --> 04:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
reasons so that's why you're
 
04:53:30.550 --> 04:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
going to spend so much quality time with
 
04:53:32.868 --> 04:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
me personally
 
04:53:36.708 --> 04:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:40.788 --> 04:53:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:43.190 --> 04:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
but any questions right
 
04:53:45.510 --> 04:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative edgar
 
04:53:47.830 --> 04:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:53:49.670 --> 04:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
i'd like to at least bring up the topic
 
04:53:51.590 --> 04:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
not for discussion right now necessarily
 
04:53:54.230 --> 04:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
but for at least next week that has to
 
04:53:58.310 --> 04:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
do with any resiliency funds
 
04:53:59.750 --> 04:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
maybe i can find out what what that
 
04:53:59.760 --> 04:54:01.270 align:start position:0%
maybe i can find out what what that
means

04:54:01.270 --> 04:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
means
 
04:54:03.590 --> 04:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh by that i mean is what private
 
04:54:05.510 --> 04:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
programs if any there is if there's
 
04:54:07.910 --> 04:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
additional funds for that on any
 
04:54:10.070 --> 04:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
programs and how it's being decided and
 
04:54:11.750 --> 04:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
where they would be like i said not
 
04:54:13.110 --> 04:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily to discuss now but if we
 
04:54:14.310 --> 04:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
could discuss it next week i'd
 
04:54:16.708 --> 04:54:16.718 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
04:54:19.270 --> 04:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you just briefly um in the iija
 
04:54:20.628 --> 04:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
there was new
 
04:54:23.670 --> 04:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
mandatory programs established so
 
04:54:24.708 --> 04:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
in your
 
04:54:26.868 --> 04:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
presentations from the previous sessions
 
04:54:28.830 --> 04:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
you know we talk a lot about these other
 
04:54:31.670 --> 04:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
programs like i said there's alphabet
 
04:54:34.070 --> 04:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
soup stp nhpp
 
04:54:35.430 --> 04:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
believe it or not there's additional
 
04:54:37.590 --> 04:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
ones that were funded in the iija some
 
04:54:39.750 --> 04:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
of them relate to resiliency and climate
 
04:54:41.430 --> 04:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
change so one of the new ones is the
 
04:54:43.910 --> 04:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
protect program
 
04:54:43.920 --> 04:54:46.390 align:start position:0%
protect program
protect

04:54:46.390 --> 04:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
protect
 
04:54:48.470 --> 04:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
actually we have dollars coming by
 
04:54:50.470 --> 04:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
formula but then protect also has a
 
04:54:52.070 --> 04:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
discretionary component where you could
 
04:54:53.990 --> 04:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
apply for grants so we have a lot of
 
04:54:57.430 --> 04:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
culvert work um slope stabilization work
 
04:54:59.510 --> 04:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
and other types of projects that we were
 
04:55:01.110 --> 04:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
already trying to use are flexible
 
04:55:03.270 --> 04:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
categories of federal funding for
 
04:55:04.788 --> 04:55:04.798 align:start position:0%
we're hoping to either do more of that
 
04:55:07.430 --> 04:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
work or fund those projects with protect
 
04:55:09.190 --> 04:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
so i can have
 
04:55:11.190 --> 04:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
pete stamnis and glenn davison pulled
 
04:55:13.350 --> 04:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
together some examples of where we would
 
04:55:15.190 --> 04:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
hope to spend those dollars for next
 
04:55:15.200 --> 04:55:17.510 align:start position:0%
hope to spend those dollars for next
week

04:55:17.510 --> 04:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:18.550 --> 04:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
very good thank you because we're
 
04:55:20.150 --> 04:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
probably going to get flooded out again
 
04:55:22.150 --> 04:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
this weekend down in hampton so it could
 
04:55:24.390 --> 04:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
be a nice topic next week thank you
 
04:55:26.390 --> 04:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
well ocean boulevard is a probably a
 
04:55:27.910 --> 04:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
perfect candidate to apply for
 
04:55:30.470 --> 04:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
discretionary grants um once we have
 
04:55:32.310 --> 04:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
done some of the initial design work um
 
04:55:33.830 --> 04:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
so there's certainly projects we could
 
04:55:36.390 --> 04:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
talk about that would be ideal
 
04:55:36.400 --> 04:55:38.948 align:start position:0%
talk about that would be ideal
candidates

04:55:38.948 --> 04:55:38.958 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
04:55:40.390 --> 04:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:55:42.948 --> 04:55:42.958 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
04:55:44.230 --> 04:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:55:46.510 --> 04:55:46.520 align:start position:0%

um

04:55:49.110 --> 04:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:49.120 --> 04:55:51.030 align:start position:0%
um
portsmouth

04:55:51.030 --> 04:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
portsmouth
 
04:55:54.550 --> 04:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
it's a the sound wall along i-95 in
 
04:55:54.560 --> 04:55:56.070 align:start position:0%
it's a the sound wall along i-95 in
portsmouth

04:55:56.070 --> 04:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
portsmouth
 
04:55:58.230 --> 04:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
we've chatted quite a bit about sound
 
04:55:58.240 --> 04:55:59.190 align:start position:0%
we've chatted quite a bit about sound
walls

04:55:59.190 --> 04:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
walls
 
04:56:04.550 --> 04:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
um i see a total project cost of 10 mil
 
04:56:09.190 --> 04:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
10 million 500 000. how how large of a
 
04:56:11.030 --> 04:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
i guess what is the distance of that
 
04:56:13.270 --> 04:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
sound wall
 
04:56:15.030 --> 04:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
so i'll be happy to bring the map that
 
04:56:17.270 --> 04:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
shows the locations that qualified for a
 
04:56:18.550 --> 04:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
sound wall
 
04:56:18.560 --> 04:56:19.910 align:start position:0%
sound wall
um

04:56:19.910 --> 04:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:23.110 --> 04:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
so that project is associated with the
 
04:56:24.310 --> 04:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
shoulder running project that i
 
04:56:26.070 --> 04:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
discussed this morning so what happened
 
04:56:27.910 --> 04:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
in the gasset phase was we had planned
 
04:56:30.470 --> 04:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
to advance the shoulder running project
 
04:56:32.470 --> 04:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
and then subsequently
 
04:56:34.230 --> 04:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
build the sound walls with turnpike
 
04:56:36.310 --> 04:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
funds based on the advocacy that we
 
04:56:36.320 --> 04:56:37.190 align:start position:0%
funds based on the advocacy that we
heard

04:56:37.190 --> 04:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
heard
 
04:56:39.830 --> 04:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
during the 10-year plan hearings
 
04:56:42.150 --> 04:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
working with them counseling stevens we
 
04:56:44.310 --> 04:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
moved up the sound wall project we
 
04:56:46.470 --> 04:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
switched the funding to federal funds
 
04:56:48.070 --> 04:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
and so now both projects are being
 
04:56:50.390 --> 04:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
advanced in parallel then i can bring
 
04:56:51.510 --> 04:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
you the map so you can see which
 
04:56:52.708 --> 04:56:52.718 align:start position:0%
segments of sound wall are being
 
04:56:52.718 --> 04:56:54.788 align:start position:0%
segments of sound wall are being
constructed

04:56:54.788 --> 04:56:54.798 align:start position:0%
constructed
 
04:56:59.990 --> 04:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:02.470 --> 04:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
what was that after
 
04:57:02.480 --> 04:57:04.070 align:start position:0%
what was that after
um

04:57:04.070 --> 04:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:06.310 --> 04:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the delay in the concord
 
04:57:09.910 --> 04:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
um the stretch out here on 93 in concord
 
04:57:11.830 --> 04:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
is there any opportunity there to do
 
04:57:15.830 --> 04:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
shoulder running for the exiting traffic
 
04:57:18.788 --> 04:57:18.798 align:start position:0%
because it's always right at
 
04:57:21.510 --> 04:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
rush hour that we also get the influx
 
04:57:25.270 --> 04:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
from out of state headed north
 
04:57:26.708 --> 04:57:26.718 align:start position:0%
so when we have
 
04:57:28.230 --> 04:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
races at the
 
04:57:31.030 --> 04:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire motor speedway at loudoun
 
04:57:32.948 --> 04:57:32.958 align:start position:0%
we do use the shoulder
 
04:57:32.958 --> 04:57:34.150 align:start position:0%
we do use the shoulder
however

04:57:34.150 --> 04:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:57:35.590 --> 04:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges and the reason
 
04:57:37.030 --> 04:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
that we
 
04:57:38.948 --> 04:57:38.958 align:start position:0%
need to advance the bill concord project
 
04:57:41.910 --> 04:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
is the spacing of the exits
 
04:57:43.910 --> 04:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
and how short some of those ramps and
 
04:57:45.270 --> 04:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
merges are
 
04:57:47.670 --> 04:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
so actually when we do shoulder running
 
04:57:50.150 --> 04:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
to support race traffic we close some of
 
04:57:52.868 --> 04:57:52.878 align:start position:0%
the on-ramps because there wouldn't be
 
04:57:52.878 --> 04:57:54.470 align:start position:0%
the on-ramps because there wouldn't be
adequate

04:57:54.470 --> 04:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
04:57:56.310 --> 04:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
acceleration space for traffic that was
 
04:57:58.708 --> 04:57:58.718 align:start position:0%
trying to merge into the corridor so
 
04:58:00.230 --> 04:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
that's what really has hindered us from
 
04:58:02.390 --> 04:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
looking at a shoulder running option
 
04:58:05.030 --> 04:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
because of the safety concerns
 
04:58:06.788 --> 04:58:06.798 align:start position:0%
the way that those
 
04:58:09.510 --> 04:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
exits or interchanges are spaced it's
 
04:58:10.628 --> 04:58:10.638 align:start position:0%
not as
 
04:58:12.070 --> 04:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
conducive to that
 
04:58:13.910 --> 04:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
unlike the 95 scenario where we're
 
04:58:15.430 --> 04:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
looking at a bridge we're just going to
 
04:58:17.430 --> 04:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
do the shoulder running for a location
 
04:58:19.670 --> 04:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
section where the merges wouldn't be as
 
04:58:23.510 --> 04:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:28.788 --> 04:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:30.230 --> 04:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
any other
 
04:58:32.390 --> 04:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
questions for today
 
04:58:37.110 --> 04:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:40.070 --> 04:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh again and it's more
 
04:58:41.830 --> 04:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
for you mr chairman so if we have any
 
04:58:43.430 --> 04:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
questions about specific projects should
 
04:58:44.788 --> 04:58:44.798 align:start position:0%
we reach out to the commission in
 
04:58:46.708 --> 04:58:46.718 align:start position:0%
advance of next week i just want to be
 
04:58:48.390 --> 04:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
clear about that or who should we
 
04:58:50.550 --> 04:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
contact you can reach out to me directly
 
04:58:52.628 --> 04:58:52.638 align:start position:0%
or reach out through
 
04:58:53.910 --> 04:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
the chair and
 
04:58:56.868 --> 04:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
compile a list but um okay we'll do our
 
04:58:58.708 --> 04:58:58.718 align:start position:0%
best to be ready with whatever questions
 
04:58:59.990 --> 04:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
you have okay
 
04:59:01.830 --> 04:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
the only thing i would ask if the
 
04:59:03.590 --> 04:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
members reach out directly to the
 
04:59:06.310 --> 04:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner they put me as a courtesy
 
04:59:08.310 --> 04:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
copy on the email so at least i know
 
04:59:13.830 --> 04:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:15.990 --> 04:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
represent faulkner
 
04:59:18.470 --> 04:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
can i just express my appreciation for
 
04:59:20.550 --> 04:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner i'm impressed with your
 
04:59:22.470 --> 04:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the details and your
 
04:59:24.390 --> 04:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
willingness to share all them with us
 
04:59:24.400 --> 04:59:25.430 align:start position:0%
willingness to share all them with us
and

04:59:25.430 --> 04:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:59:27.430 --> 04:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
i think we're lucky to have
 
04:59:31.350 --> 04:59:31.360 align:start position:0%
this level of support appreciate it
 
04:59:34.470 --> 04:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:36.070 --> 04:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and
 
04:59:38.708 --> 04:59:38.718 align:start position:0%
he stole my thunder but thank you
 
04:59:41.590 --> 04:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner uh it is
 
04:59:43.510 --> 04:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
important that we get
 
04:59:45.990 --> 04:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
as much information as we can not just
 
04:59:48.948 --> 04:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
about the the federal highway piece but
 
04:59:50.948 --> 04:59:50.958 align:start position:0%
our entire intermodal
 
04:59:52.708 --> 04:59:52.718 align:start position:0%
transportation because it's going to
 
04:59:52.718 --> 04:59:54.230 align:start position:0%
transportation because it's going to
become

04:59:54.230 --> 04:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
become
 
04:59:57.430 --> 04:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
in my opinion even more important as
 
05:00:00.310 --> 05:00:00.320 align:start position:0%
we try to revitalize some some freight
 
05:00:02.948 --> 05:00:02.958 align:start position:0%
rail and and other things within the
 
05:00:05.030 --> 05:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
state to take
 
05:00:07.030 --> 05:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
some of the traffic off of the highways
 
05:00:09.270 --> 05:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
because we're not going to keep
 
05:00:11.910 --> 05:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
adding lanes to the turnpikes or the
 
05:00:13.510 --> 05:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
interstates so
 
05:00:16.390 --> 05:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
we need to be looking at at how this
 
05:00:19.510 --> 05:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
entire process fits together
 
05:00:22.628 --> 05:00:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:24.070 --> 05:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
before we conclude mr chairman i just
 
05:00:25.590 --> 05:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
want to
 
05:00:27.750 --> 05:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
touch on the action items from the
 
05:00:29.510 --> 05:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
department so i mentioned this morning
 
05:00:31.830 --> 05:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
that we're updating our projections for
 
05:00:33.350 --> 05:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
toll credits
 
05:00:35.590 --> 05:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
to reflect the federal bill as well as
 
05:00:37.910 --> 05:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
the timing of all the turnpike work
 
05:00:39.590 --> 05:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
i also committed to reaching out to the
 
05:00:41.750 --> 05:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
representatives for hudson to talk about
 
05:00:43.350 --> 05:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
hudson boulevard
 
05:00:46.150 --> 05:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
and what their specific request might be
 
05:00:47.590 --> 05:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
and then based on the conversation this
 
05:00:49.110 --> 05:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
afternoon we were going to get the
 
05:00:51.190 --> 05:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
ridership projections for the capital
 
05:00:52.868 --> 05:00:52.878 align:start position:0%
corridor project
 
05:00:54.550 --> 05:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
that's what i have is our three actions
 
05:00:56.310 --> 05:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know if there's anything that we
 
05:00:56.320 --> 05:00:59.590 align:start position:0%
i don't know if there's anything that we
missed

05:00:59.590 --> 05:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:01.670 --> 05:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
oh keen letter
 
05:01:02.948 --> 05:01:02.958 align:start position:0%
that i was going to send that separately
 
05:01:05.350 --> 05:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
not wait for the work session um yes i
 
05:01:07.030 --> 05:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
have a the keen
 
05:01:08.470 --> 05:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
item and then i also have an item to
 
05:01:09.750 --> 05:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
follow up with representative eaton on
 
05:01:13.110 --> 05:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
so i have some sidebar things to do and
 
05:01:16.150 --> 05:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
the piece on the resiliency
 
05:01:25.430 --> 05:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:27.270 --> 05:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
i will send before the hearing the sound
 
05:01:39.350 --> 05:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:41.430 --> 05:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
represent thompson
 
05:01:43.590 --> 05:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner on the
 
05:01:47.110 --> 05:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
we discussed the other day about um
 
05:01:50.708 --> 05:01:50.718 align:start position:0%
the 17 million for the eb charging
 
05:01:50.718 --> 05:01:52.390 align:start position:0%
the 17 million for the eb charging
infrastructure

05:01:52.390 --> 05:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
05:01:52.400 --> 05:01:54.390 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
um

05:01:54.390 --> 05:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:56.708 --> 05:01:56.718 align:start position:0%
and at the time you said you
 
05:01:58.550 --> 05:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
were still waiting for details from the
 
05:02:01.670 --> 05:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
federal government is that still true or
 
05:02:03.510 --> 05:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's something that's really important
 
05:02:05.190 --> 05:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
i think particularly for our committee
 
05:02:05.200 --> 05:02:05.990 align:start position:0%
i think particularly for our committee
but

05:02:05.990 --> 05:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:02:07.910 --> 05:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
others as well because there's a number
 
05:02:10.948 --> 05:02:10.958 align:start position:0%
of bills pending
 
05:02:12.708 --> 05:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
that need to know
 
05:02:14.628 --> 05:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
that information
 
05:02:17.270 --> 05:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
really before those bills proceed
 
05:02:20.230 --> 05:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:22.150 --> 05:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
um so with respect to the ev charging
 
05:02:25.990 --> 05:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
there's been no guidance released yet by
 
05:02:26.000 --> 05:02:29.190 align:start position:0%
there's been no guidance released yet by
usdot

05:02:29.190 --> 05:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:31.350 --> 05:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
there was a guidance document about
 
05:02:34.868 --> 05:02:34.878 align:start position:0%
ensuring that if you are going to have
 
05:02:37.510 --> 05:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
a fee associated with using a charging
 
05:02:37.520 --> 05:02:38.628 align:start position:0%
a fee associated with using a charging
station

05:02:38.628 --> 05:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
station
 
05:02:40.550 --> 05:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
that it be
 
05:02:42.948 --> 05:02:42.958 align:start position:0%
solely to cover the costs of operating
 
05:02:45.270 --> 05:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
that charging station and not a revenue
 
05:02:47.190 --> 05:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
generating opportunity
 
05:02:49.350 --> 05:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
um that's the only piece of information
 
05:02:51.590 --> 05:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
that we've received recently and so you
 
05:02:51.600 --> 05:02:52.550 align:start position:0%
that we've received recently and so you
can

05:02:52.550 --> 05:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
can
 
05:02:54.788 --> 05:02:54.798 align:start position:0%
charge a fee for charging
 
05:02:54.798 --> 05:02:57.350 align:start position:0%
charge a fee for charging
um

05:02:57.350 --> 05:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:59.270 --> 05:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure but it has to discover
 
05:03:02.550 --> 05:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
the cost of the maintenance
 
05:03:04.550 --> 05:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
and we're still there was a
 
05:03:06.830 --> 05:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
request for information issued by
 
05:03:09.510 --> 05:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
usdot that different entities have been
 
05:03:11.910 --> 05:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
responding to so i assume that on the
 
05:03:14.550 --> 05:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
conclusion of that comment period
 
05:03:16.150 --> 05:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
they will digest all of that and then
 
05:03:18.470 --> 05:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
turn it into a guidance document
 
05:03:20.390 --> 05:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
what we did in the ten year plan as we
 
05:03:21.910 --> 05:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
touched on previously was we've just
 
05:03:23.590 --> 05:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
programmed the dollars they are dollars
 
05:03:25.430 --> 05:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
that cannot be used for any purpose
 
05:03:26.628 --> 05:03:26.638 align:start position:0%
other than this
 
05:03:29.110 --> 05:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
um so we're receiving the 17.5 million
 
05:03:30.470 --> 05:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
by formula
 
05:03:32.470 --> 05:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
and then there is a discretionary grant
 
05:03:34.310 --> 05:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
program in addition that new hampshire
 
05:03:36.868 --> 05:03:36.878 align:start position:0%
could apply for should we want to pursue
 
05:03:38.310 --> 05:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
additional funding for charging
 
05:03:38.320 --> 05:03:39.830 align:start position:0%
additional funding for charging
infrastructure

05:03:39.830 --> 05:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
05:03:41.590 --> 05:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
the transportation council that was
 
05:03:45.190 --> 05:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:47.030 --> 05:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
their charge is to work with the
 
05:03:49.910 --> 05:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
department and help inform
 
05:03:52.070 --> 05:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
deployment of new and emerging
 
05:03:52.080 --> 05:03:53.430 align:start position:0%
deployment of new and emerging
technologies

05:03:53.430 --> 05:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
technologies
 
05:03:55.270 --> 05:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
so they believe they have a role to play
 
05:03:57.030 --> 05:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
when it comes to ev charging
 
05:03:57.040 --> 05:03:58.868 align:start position:0%
when it comes to ev charging
infrastructure

05:03:58.868 --> 05:03:58.878 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
05:04:00.070 --> 05:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
we have
 
05:04:01.750 --> 05:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
we know that to be able to access these
 
05:04:03.110 --> 05:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
federal dollars we have to develop a
 
05:04:05.110 --> 05:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
plan as to where we would install the
 
05:04:07.830 --> 05:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
units and over what time period
 
05:04:07.840 --> 05:04:09.590 align:start position:0%
units and over what time period
so

05:04:09.590 --> 05:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:04:11.350 --> 05:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
it has been suggested
 
05:04:13.510 --> 05:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
that perhaps we would consult with the
 
05:04:15.430 --> 05:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
transportation council it's a diverse
 
05:04:15.440 --> 05:04:17.190 align:start position:0%
transportation council it's a diverse
group

05:04:17.190 --> 05:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
group
 
05:04:19.750 --> 05:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
that perhaps could help us
 
05:04:21.510 --> 05:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
with that process but of course as i had
 
05:04:24.628 --> 05:04:24.638 align:start position:0%
mentioned in one of our earlier sessions
 
05:04:25.750 --> 05:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
we aren't
 
05:04:27.270 --> 05:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
in this alone while the funding would
 
05:04:29.350 --> 05:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
flow through usdot to the department of
 
05:04:31.590 --> 05:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
transportation we've been working really
 
05:04:32.948 --> 05:04:32.958 align:start position:0%
closely first with the office of
 
05:04:35.110 --> 05:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
strategic initiatives which has now of
 
05:04:35.120 --> 05:04:36.470 align:start position:0%
strategic initiatives which has now of
course

05:04:36.470 --> 05:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
course
 
05:04:39.350 --> 05:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
been replaced by
 
05:04:41.350 --> 05:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
the department of energy
 
05:04:42.550 --> 05:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
but also with the department of
 
05:04:44.550 --> 05:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
environmental services
 
05:04:46.868 --> 05:04:46.878 align:start position:0%
so we plan to collaborate with them
 
05:04:48.788 --> 05:04:48.798 align:start position:0%
irrespective of what paths the
 
05:04:48.798 --> 05:04:50.628 align:start position:0%
irrespective of what paths the
legislature

05:04:50.628 --> 05:04:50.638 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
05:04:53.270 --> 05:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
decides to pursue i know senator waters
 
05:04:53.280 --> 05:04:54.470 align:start position:0%
decides to pursue i know senator waters
has

05:04:54.470 --> 05:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
has
 
05:04:56.788 --> 05:04:56.798 align:start position:0%
two bills i believe this session that
 
05:04:56.798 --> 05:04:58.470 align:start position:0%
two bills i believe this session that
are

05:04:58.470 --> 05:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:05:00.470 --> 05:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
working their way through the process
 
05:05:04.070 --> 05:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
one is to establish the
 
05:05:07.830 --> 05:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
electric uh vehicle infrastructure
 
05:05:07.840 --> 05:05:09.110 align:start position:0%
electric uh vehicle infrastructure
fund

05:05:09.110 --> 05:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
fund
 
05:05:10.550 --> 05:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
which is where these federal dollars
 
05:05:12.310 --> 05:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
might flow into
 
05:05:14.150 --> 05:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
um and then a separate bill talking
 
05:05:14.160 --> 05:05:15.030 align:start position:0%
um and then a separate bill talking
about

05:05:15.030 --> 05:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:05:17.430 --> 05:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
um conversion
 
05:05:21.430 --> 05:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
of the fleet um for projects like uh
 
05:05:22.948 --> 05:05:22.958 align:start position:0%
replacement of school buses as an
 
05:05:24.628 --> 05:05:24.638 align:start position:0%
example and that being something that
 
05:05:26.628 --> 05:05:26.638 align:start position:0%
would be administered by the department
 
05:05:28.868 --> 05:05:28.878 align:start position:0%
of environmental services
 
05:05:30.550 --> 05:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
so we need to learn more about the
 
05:05:30.560 --> 05:05:32.310 align:start position:0%
so we need to learn more about the
programs

05:05:32.310 --> 05:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
programs
 
05:05:34.470 --> 05:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
and what role then the state agencies
 
05:05:37.190 --> 05:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
will play to administer those programs
 
05:05:38.788 --> 05:05:38.798 align:start position:0%
but for the moment we know the money is
 
05:05:41.510 --> 05:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
flowing through usdot to dot so we have
 
05:05:43.030 --> 05:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
it just accounted for in the 10-year
 
05:05:43.040 --> 05:05:45.830 align:start position:0%
it just accounted for in the 10-year
plan

05:05:45.830 --> 05:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:47.590 --> 05:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:05:49.430 --> 05:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go back to how you started
 
05:05:51.510 --> 05:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
that explanation
 
05:05:53.750 --> 05:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
you said part of the initial guidance
 
05:05:57.510 --> 05:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
that you are aware of says that
 
05:06:00.150 --> 05:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
if you set up the the charging station
 
05:06:02.708 --> 05:06:02.718 align:start position:0%
all you can do is collect for the the
 
05:06:04.470 --> 05:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
cost of the the station and the
 
05:06:04.480 --> 05:06:06.070 align:start position:0%
cost of the the station and the
electricity

05:06:06.070 --> 05:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
05:06:08.310 --> 05:06:08.320 align:start position:0%
so that if somebody from another state
 
05:06:10.948 --> 05:06:10.958 align:start position:0%
came in and charged it would just be the
 
05:06:13.750 --> 05:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
minimal cost of the electricity whereas
 
05:06:15.430 --> 05:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
if they bought gas we'd at least get
 
05:06:17.350 --> 05:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
some money for our roads
 
05:06:19.350 --> 05:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
is that kind of
 
05:06:19.360 --> 05:06:20.628 align:start position:0%
is that kind of
correct

05:06:20.628 --> 05:06:20.638 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:06:22.470 --> 05:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
on what you understand now from the
 
05:06:22.480 --> 05:06:24.788 align:start position:0%
on what you understand now from the
rules

05:06:24.788 --> 05:06:24.798 align:start position:0%
rules
 
05:06:27.270 --> 05:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding but like i said
 
05:06:30.070 --> 05:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
there's been this comment period um and
 
05:06:30.080 --> 05:06:30.788 align:start position:0%
there's been this comment period um and
there's

05:06:30.788 --> 05:06:30.798 align:start position:0%
there's
 
05:06:32.470 --> 05:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
there's concerns if we're using federal
 
05:06:35.110 --> 05:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
funds we have to comply with buy america
 
05:06:37.430 --> 05:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
um there's a lack of
 
05:06:39.510 --> 05:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
buy america compliant equipment being
 
05:06:41.590 --> 05:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
produced right now
 
05:06:44.788 --> 05:06:44.798 align:start position:0%
so some of this is to spur industry
 
05:06:48.150 --> 05:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
to ramp up production to meet the needs
 
05:06:49.270 --> 05:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
because of course we want to buy
 
05:06:50.708 --> 05:06:50.718 align:start position:0%
american products but there has to be
 
05:06:52.708 --> 05:06:52.718 align:start position:0%
one on the market otherwise these
 
05:06:55.350 --> 05:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
dollars will go unspent um so there's
 
05:06:58.070 --> 05:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know numerous aspects of the rollout
 
05:07:00.708 --> 05:07:00.718 align:start position:0%
of these new programs that
 
05:07:02.470 --> 05:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
federal highway wants to hear from all
 
05:07:04.230 --> 05:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders so they can address
 
05:07:07.990 --> 05:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:11.590 --> 05:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:13.590 --> 05:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
05:07:15.430 --> 05:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner
 
05:07:17.590 --> 05:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
you mentioned next week you'll have some
 
05:07:19.510 --> 05:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
information on
 
05:07:24.310 --> 05:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
i think you said projections or at least
 
05:07:26.310 --> 05:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
rough ideas of
 
05:07:26.320 --> 05:07:27.430 align:start position:0%
rough ideas of
potential

05:07:27.430 --> 05:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
potential
 
05:07:29.270 --> 05:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
ridership on
 
05:07:31.510 --> 05:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
commuter rail
 
05:07:32.708 --> 05:07:32.718 align:start position:0%
and we can
 
05:07:34.868 --> 05:07:34.878 align:start position:0%
either ahead of next week's work session
 
05:07:36.708 --> 05:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
or during the work session share some of
 
05:07:38.310 --> 05:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
the presentation materials that we've
 
05:07:40.390 --> 05:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
been using at the public meetings
 
05:07:41.990 --> 05:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
associated with the capitol corridor
 
05:07:45.030 --> 05:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
okay could i follow up mr chairman yes
 
05:07:47.670 --> 05:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner um will will that also
 
05:07:49.510 --> 05:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
include some of the
 
05:07:52.550 --> 05:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
i guess how the research was obtained
 
05:07:54.070 --> 05:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
in other words
 
05:07:56.310 --> 05:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
people will be going from north to south
 
05:07:58.708 --> 05:07:58.718 align:start position:0%
there will be ridership
 
05:08:02.310 --> 05:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
from south to north like boston north
 
05:08:05.430 --> 05:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
and and southern new hampshire south
 
05:08:07.430 --> 05:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
um it is
 
05:08:09.670 --> 05:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
so there'll be some indication on how
 
05:08:11.190 --> 05:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
the research was up or how your
 
05:08:13.510 --> 05:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
information was obtained we have
 
05:08:16.788 --> 05:08:16.798 align:start position:0%
forecasts for the number of riders from
 
05:08:18.390 --> 05:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
each station
 
05:08:20.628 --> 05:08:20.638 align:start position:0%
down to boston
 
05:08:22.788 --> 05:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
as we're doing this analysis there's
 
05:08:24.788 --> 05:08:24.798 align:start position:0%
standard fta models that you use to
 
05:08:26.550 --> 05:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
project ridership
 
05:08:26.560 --> 05:08:29.430 align:start position:0%
project ridership
so

05:08:29.430 --> 05:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:31.030 --> 05:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
all the methodology that goes into that
 
05:08:33.350 --> 05:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
modeling um if the committee wants to
 
05:08:34.788 --> 05:08:34.798 align:start position:0%
see some of that documentation we can
 
05:08:36.628 --> 05:08:36.638 align:start position:0%
certainly share it but we'll we can give
 
05:08:38.628 --> 05:08:38.638 align:start position:0%
you the what we used as the tool to
 
05:08:42.628 --> 05:08:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:42.638 --> 05:08:43.750 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

05:08:43.750 --> 05:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:08:46.230 --> 05:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
but don't inand date the commun this
 
05:08:48.788 --> 05:08:48.798 align:start position:0%
enough you uh to the commissioner don't
 
05:08:51.190 --> 05:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
inundate the the committee with
 
05:08:51.200 --> 05:08:52.628 align:start position:0%
inundate the the committee with
um

05:08:52.628 --> 05:08:52.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:55.190 --> 05:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
the entire model and how it all all the
 
05:08:58.550 --> 05:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
algorithms work please
 
05:09:00.310 --> 05:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
as i've i can reference the model that
 
05:09:02.150 --> 05:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
we're using but yes i wasn't intending
 
05:09:03.910 --> 05:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
to go through all the details yeah i
 
05:09:07.110 --> 05:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
agree i mean it too much is too much
 
05:09:07.120 --> 05:09:07.830 align:start position:0%
agree i mean it too much is too much
how

05:09:07.830 --> 05:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
how
 
05:09:11.190 --> 05:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
will the uh i would just ask
 
05:09:13.430 --> 05:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
for um i guess just for discussion
 
05:09:16.470 --> 05:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
purposes when we see the information
 
05:09:18.230 --> 05:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
is it
 
05:09:20.948 --> 05:09:20.958 align:start position:0%
um was it um i don't know how to put
 
05:09:22.470 --> 05:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
this together in other words we've got
 
05:09:24.830 --> 05:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
information that was there
 
05:09:28.150 --> 05:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic and now we're in pandemic
 
05:09:31.270 --> 05:09:31.280 align:start position:0%
and looking to go post-pandemic so is
 
05:09:32.628 --> 05:09:32.638 align:start position:0%
there a
 
05:09:36.150 --> 05:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:38.470 --> 05:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
she's shaking her head apparently so
 
05:09:41.350 --> 05:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yeah we used a few
 
05:09:43.430 --> 05:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
different models that showed pandemic
 
05:09:45.750 --> 05:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
impact so a slight impact
 
05:09:47.990 --> 05:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
a medium impact and a heavier impact so
 
05:09:49.510 --> 05:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
yeah we've been taking that into account
 
05:09:50.868 --> 05:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
and we're working with the federal
 
05:09:53.910 --> 05:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
transit administration we're using
 
05:09:56.868 --> 05:09:56.878 align:start position:0%
a model that they approve of for
 
05:09:58.948 --> 05:09:58.958 align:start position:0%
projecting ridership and we're going
 
05:10:01.190 --> 05:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
back and forth with them on a much more
 
05:10:02.788 --> 05:10:02.798 align:start position:0%
detailed to the chairs point that you
 
05:10:04.070 --> 05:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
probably don't want to look at document
 
05:10:04.080 --> 05:10:04.868 align:start position:0%
probably don't want to look at document
that

05:10:04.868 --> 05:10:04.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:10:07.190 --> 05:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes codifies all that but
 
05:10:08.470 --> 05:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so we have some projections
 
05:10:10.470 --> 05:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
basically for projections
 
05:10:12.150 --> 05:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
in what we provided to the public and we
 
05:10:13.910 --> 05:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
could share with you
 
05:10:15.670 --> 05:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:10:17.750 --> 05:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
and for the committee's edification we
 
05:10:23.270 --> 05:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:25.590 --> 05:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
study and planning
 
05:10:27.990 --> 05:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
understanding that it's over a year away
 
05:10:29.670 --> 05:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
about a year away before it'll be
 
05:10:29.680 --> 05:10:31.030 align:start position:0%
about a year away before it'll be
finalized

05:10:31.030 --> 05:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
finalized
 
05:10:33.510 --> 05:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
we can get some information but it's not
 
05:10:35.830 --> 05:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
going to impact on what we have to do
 
05:10:39.270 --> 05:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
with the current 10-year plan
 
05:10:42.150 --> 05:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
for those of us or you who may be back
 
05:10:42.160 --> 05:10:42.948 align:start position:0%
for those of us or you who may be back
here

05:10:42.948 --> 05:10:42.958 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:10:45.590 --> 05:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
two years from now it may be more
 
05:10:48.070 --> 05:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
pertinent to have that study in front of
 
05:10:48.080 --> 05:10:49.030 align:start position:0%
pertinent to have that study in front of
you

05:10:49.030 --> 05:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:10:51.910 --> 05:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
but it will be finished in 23 after the
 
05:10:57.110 --> 05:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:00.150 --> 05:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
anything else from the committee for
 
05:11:03.110 --> 05:11:03.120 align:start position:0%

05:11:06.070 --> 05:11:06.080 align:start position:0%

we do appreciate
 
05:11:11.350 --> 05:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
all the support that the department
 
05:11:12.788 --> 05:11:12.798 align:start position:0%
gives us
 
05:11:14.948 --> 05:11:14.958 align:start position:0%
um both
 
05:11:18.948 --> 05:11:18.958 align:start position:0%
with the rpc's the gasset and then with
 
05:11:18.958 --> 05:11:19.670 align:start position:0%
with the rpc's the gasset and then with
us

05:11:19.670 --> 05:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
us
 
05:11:21.670 --> 05:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
as it works through
 
05:11:23.990 --> 05:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
the house and then the senate
 
05:11:26.150 --> 05:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
so you can start the whole process again
 
05:11:37.350 --> 05:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:39.110 --> 05:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
true dad
 
05:11:41.510 --> 05:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you all for seeing those who
 
05:11:43.510 --> 05:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
did um
 
05:11:46.708 --> 05:11:46.718 align:start position:0%
i will see you all next week
 
05:11:48.628 --> 05:11:48.638 align:start position:0%
but please
 
05:11:50.708 --> 05:11:50.718 align:start position:0%
the two things if you have something you
 
05:11:52.390 --> 05:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
need the
 
05:11:55.750 --> 05:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
department to clarify get it in early
 
05:11:57.750 --> 05:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
so we're not playing let me go see if
 
05:11:59.750 --> 05:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
somebody's in the office to get the
 
05:11:59.760 --> 05:12:00.708 align:start position:0%
somebody's in the office to get the
answer

05:12:00.708 --> 05:12:00.718 align:start position:0%
answer
 
05:12:03.190 --> 05:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
and two if you think you want to have a
 
05:12:04.550 --> 05:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
change made
 
05:12:07.990 --> 05:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
to the 10-year plan work with lls about
 
05:12:11.670 --> 05:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
having a an amendment drawn up we will
 
05:12:13.510 --> 05:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
look at all of them
 
05:12:16.628 --> 05:12:16.638 align:start position:0%
and then work on a
 
05:12:18.868 --> 05:12:18.878 align:start position:0%
consolidated amendment that we may be
 
05:12:21.430 --> 05:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
able to agree to and commissioner
 
05:12:25.430 --> 05:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:25.440 --> 05:12:26.948 align:start position:0%
 
for

05:12:26.948 --> 05:12:26.958 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:12:26.958 --> 05:12:28.390 align:start position:0%
for
inclusion

05:12:28.390 --> 05:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
inclusion
 
05:12:30.788 --> 05:12:30.798 align:start position:0%
um i would appreciate that too there's
 
05:12:32.230 --> 05:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
always something that that the
 
05:12:35.190 --> 05:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:37.190 --> 05:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
um as you referenced earlier there's the
 
05:12:39.990 --> 05:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
standard sections that we have to add
 
05:12:42.390 --> 05:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
into the 10-year plan bill so i just
 
05:12:43.750 --> 05:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
want to be clear on timeline do you want
 
05:12:45.430 --> 05:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
us to bring all of that draft language
 
05:12:47.350 --> 05:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
for next week's work session or be
 
05:12:49.670 --> 05:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
thinking about it and work online if you
 
05:12:52.470 --> 05:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
could bring it the next one in draft
 
05:12:54.628 --> 05:12:54.638 align:start position:0%
because then we'll try to
 
05:12:57.110 --> 05:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
work on a consolidated one for two weeks
 
05:13:00.550 --> 05:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
later for an executive session
 
05:13:03.510 --> 05:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
so that we can finalize this and get it
 
05:13:05.670 --> 05:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
to the senate
 
05:13:07.990 --> 05:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
because time is fleeting
 
05:13:09.190 --> 05:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
that's fine and we'll just bring the
 
05:13:10.788 --> 05:13:10.798 align:start position:0%
suggested language and we can convert it
 
05:13:12.550 --> 05:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
into an actual amendment at a later date
 
05:13:12.560 --> 05:13:16.390 align:start position:0%
into an actual amendment at a later date
perfect

05:13:16.390 --> 05:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:18.788 --> 05:13:18.798 align:start position:0%
again thank you we'll see you all next
 
05:13:18.798 --> 05:18:03.830 align:start position:0%
again thank you we'll see you all next
week

05:18:03.830 --> 05:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:03.840 --> 05:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
you
