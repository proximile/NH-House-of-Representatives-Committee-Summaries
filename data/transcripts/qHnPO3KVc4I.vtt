numerous members are having travel
 
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
difficulties today so
 
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
that's the reason for our late start
 
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
but it is now time to start so I welcome
 
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 align:start position:0%
everybody to the January 24th meeting of

of America and to the Republic for which
 
00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:06.199 align:start position:0%
it stands one nation under God

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:15.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
day weather-wise here in the state and
 
00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
it's affected numerous members of this
 
00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:22.490 align:start position:0%
it's affected numerous members of this
committee

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:24.300 align:start position:0%
I know that representative Harrington
 
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
will not be joining us today because
 
00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
he's had some significant electrical
 
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:32.340 align:start position:0%
problems at his house caused by
 
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
power surges
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki indicated that he
 
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
was having trouble getting out of his
 
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
town due to closed roads
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
and I see a lot of other Empty Chairs
 
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
here so
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's indicative of the fact that the
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
weather has caused us significant issues
 
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
one of this and give significant issues
 
00:07:58.930 --> 00:07:58.940 align:start position:0%
it caused was it forced us to cancel
 
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
yesterday's activity which included
 
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.129 align:start position:0%
yesterday's activity which included
um

00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:04.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
presentations and Bill hearings
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
the bills that we were supposed to hear
 
00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
Yesterday would have been the subject of
 
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
an executive session today
 
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
but since we did not hear those bills
 
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:21.300 align:start position:0%
yesterday today's executive session
 
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:22.860 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
either canceled or postponed I have to
 
00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:29.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:31.860 align:start position:0%
and what we've done to make up for the
 
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
loss of yesterday is we've added another
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:40.860 align:start position:0%
so I regret to inform the members of the
 
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
committee that you're going to have a
 
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
very busy week next week we're going to
 
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
be meeting on Monday
 
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.750 align:start position:0%
be meeting on Monday
Tuesday

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
Tuesday
 
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:49.860 align:start position:0%
and Friday
 
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
and there is a house session on Thursday
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
therefore you're going to be in Concord
 
00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:57.959 align:start position:0%
a lot next week sorry to say
 
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:00.180 align:start position:0%
but we have to do it because we have to
 
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:03.180 align:start position:0%
get caught up we have 39 bills and we
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
need to get them all through executive
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
session by the 7th of March
 
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
so today we'll be hearing
 
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:18.140 align:start position:0%
or having public hearings on three Bills
 
00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:21.899 align:start position:0%
starting at 10 30 this morning
 
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
but before we get there
 
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:27.300 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a presentation about
 
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:30.300 align:start position:0%
the community power Coalition of New
 
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.610 align:start position:0%
the community power Coalition of New
Hampshire

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:31.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm pleased to welcome the honorable
 
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:40.860 align:start position:0%
Clifton below to make this presentation
 
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
Mr below is one of the most
 
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.150 align:start position:0%
Mr below is one of the most
knowledgeable

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable
 
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
persons in our state about energy
 
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.269 align:start position:0%
persons in our state about energy
matters

00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
matters
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
having a member been a member of the
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
general court both in the house and the
 
00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:53.459 align:start position:0%
Senate have having served on the Public
 
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission
 
00:09:58.810 --> 00:09:58.820 align:start position:0%
for the past 25 or almost 30 years now
 
00:10:03.889 --> 00:10:03.899 align:start position:0%
Mr Bulow has been involved deeply in New
 
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire energy issues
 
00:10:08.449 --> 00:10:08.459 align:start position:0%
so there's no better person I think to
 
00:10:11.449 --> 00:10:11.459 align:start position:0%
make this presentation than the
 
00:10:14.449 --> 00:10:14.459 align:start position:0%
honorable Clifton below so Cliff it's
 
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
all yours and welcome to sdne thank you
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative good morning everyone
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
thanks for making the trip today
 
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.449 align:start position:0%
thanks for making the trip today
um

00:10:23.449 --> 00:10:23.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:26.329 --> 00:10:26.339 align:start position:0%
let me start with some Basics and then
 
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go into some background and
 
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
kind of bring us up to date
 
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:31.370 align:start position:0%
kind of bring us up to date
um

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.810 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:32.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
um just the basics what is community
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
power and it's uh
 
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
provision in the law that allows New
 
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cities towns and counties to
 
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
become alternative default service
 
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:49.140 align:start position:0%
electricity providers for their
 
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
residents and businesses and provide
 
00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
related service services so the basic
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
idea is that
 
00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:02.060 align:start position:0%
Municipal aggregation also known as
 
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
can pool uh purchasing power to buy
 
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
electricity Supply meaning the
 
00:11:11.449 --> 00:11:11.459 align:start position:0%
generation that puts power into the grid
 
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
to match what consumers take out the
 
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
utility company still delivers the power
 
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
and provides grid reliability and the
 
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
community can benefit from value-added
 
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
services and programs and uh
 
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:29.160 align:start position:0%
expectation of lower rates and more
 
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
product choices it's RSA 53e
 
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
relative to the aggregation of electric
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
customers by municipalities and counties
 
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
that enables this
 
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
um a couple of the key points is that
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
customers may always switch back or opt
 
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
out in the first instance and stay on
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
the utility default Service Supply or
 
00:11:50.569 --> 00:11:50.579 align:start position:0%
take service from a competitive supplier
 
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
Community power programs must be paid
 
00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
for out of revenues received by
 
00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
participating customers it can't come
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
from any taxpayer subsidy
 
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
one of our member communities the town
 
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
of Durham came up with this graphic to
 
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
kind of explain the basics as they were
 
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:11.700 align:start position:0%
developing electrical aggregation plan
 
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
it sort of starts with the uh governing
 
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
body of the community select board or
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
city council creating and electric
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
aggregation committee
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
often it's their existing energy
 
00:12:26.569 --> 00:12:26.579 align:start position:0%
committee and they draft an electric
 
00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
aggregation plan that has to be approved
 
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
by the Public Utilities Commission
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
um and then it uh goes to the Town
 
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
Council in Durham's case which is their
 
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
legislative body as well as their
 
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
governing body or town meeting
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
um in in a town with town meeting so the
 
00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
legislative body has to prove the
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
electric aggregation plan
 
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
um points
 
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
the governing body appoints the

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
helped create and govern the community

power Coalition alongside other member
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
communities the Coalition will serve as

member of it
 
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
um the utility will continue to deliver
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
the power provide metering and

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
even
 
00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative once has a
 
00:13:47.399 --> 00:13:48.230 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative once has a
question

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
coming in just a question on your
 
00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
previous Slide the um the approval by
 
00:13:58.970 --> 00:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
the puc does that is it a requirement
 
00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
that that happens before the plan is
 
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
submitted to the um the Town Council or
 
00:14:08.449 --> 00:14:08.459 align:start position:0%
the town meeting or is it can it happen
 
00:14:08.459 --> 00:14:10.850 align:start position:0%
the town meeting or is it can it happen
whenever

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
whenever
 
00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
it can happen either way
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
um it can be submitted in advance of the
 
00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:18.300 align:start position:0%
legislative body approval of course then
 
00:14:20.569 --> 00:14:20.579 align:start position:0%
they would have to approve it as the
 
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:22.740 align:start position:0%
commission approved it or can be
 
00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
submitted afterwards mostly these have
 
00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
been submitted after uh the legislative
 
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839 align:start position:0%
bodies approved the plan quick follow-up
 
00:14:30.839 --> 00:14:32.690 align:start position:0%
bodies approved the plan quick follow-up
follow-up

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:32.700 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
um so if it if it gets submitted to the
 
00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
puc afterwards and the puc makes a
 
00:14:40.189 --> 00:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
change does it then have to go back to
 
00:14:43.329 --> 00:14:43.339 align:start position:0%
the the governing body for for
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
reapproval they did do that with some of
 
00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:47.220 align:start position:0%
the first plans
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
um for instance
 
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
um our our city submitted a plan
 
00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:54.779 align:start position:0%
um roughly a year ago and um they hadn't
 
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
completed the rulemaking process so they
 
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:01.980 align:start position:0%
uh uh rejected it essentially they had a
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
couple of issues and we went back and
 
00:15:05.689 --> 00:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
amended the plan to address the issues
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
and kind of waited till the rules were
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
far enough along that they could be
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
comfortable that it would be consistent
 
00:15:13.009 --> 00:15:13.019 align:start position:0%
with the rules
 
00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:14.519 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.290 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
yes

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:15:20.569 --> 00:15:20.579 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and again thanks
 
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
for being here today sure
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
so if
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
if I understand correctly
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
every community that wants to
 
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
participate in um
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
take advantage of community power has to
 
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
submit its own electric aggregation plan
 
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
to the puc yes what would distinguish
 
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:46.740 align:start position:0%
one communities what might distinguish
 
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
one community's electric aggregation
 
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
plan from another what are the what are
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
the major features of the of an electric
 
00:15:56.449 --> 00:15:56.459 align:start position:0%
aggregation plan
 
00:15:56.459 --> 00:15:58.310 align:start position:0%
aggregation plan
um

00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:59.930 --> 00:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
we'll get into that a little later on
 
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
but um I I would say that
 
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:03.470 align:start position:0%
but um I I would say that
um

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
that often they reflect
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
um tied into it as any policies or goals
 
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
that a local community has adopted and
 
00:16:14.689 --> 00:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
the plan May reflect different emphasis
 
00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
on those uh there are a couple different
 
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
approaches one is is the Coalition
 
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:23.220 align:start position:0%
approach another approach is to engage a
 
00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.710 align:start position:0%
approach another approach is to engage a
broker

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
broker
 
00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
um to put the loadout to bid so there's
 
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
a couple of different models for how to
 
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
do this so some communities have adopted
 
00:16:32.689 --> 00:16:32.699 align:start position:0%
plans that go one way or the other and a
 
00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
few communities have adopted a plan that
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
allows a future Choice as to whether
 
00:16:39.769 --> 00:16:39.779 align:start position:0%
they go with the with the broker model
 
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
uh the chair has a question sure so my
 
00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:48.860 align:start position:0%
assumption is that the the community
 
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
power Coalition they would serve de
 
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
facto as the energy portion of the uh of
 
00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
the residents uh electric bill correct
 
00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.249 align:start position:0%
the residents uh electric bill correct
yes

00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:01.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you and so as a quick
 
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up on their electric bill it
 
00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
would show Community power aggregation
 
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
or yeah it we haven't quite finalized
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
that with the utilities whether it'll
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
just say community power or Durham or uh
 
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
Hudson community power whatever
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
Community it is
 
00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
um or I don't think it's going to say
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
community power Coalition it might just
 
00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:30.059 align:start position:0%
say community power but
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
um that that's a detail that we're still
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
sort of working on
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you by the way I can email
 
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
these slides because I realize the the
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
printout it's a little hard to uh read
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
if you want to follow up so I can do
 
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
that if you'd like
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
um I I want to run through some
 
00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
background and context to sort of bring
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
us where we
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
you know our and and sort of from my
 
00:17:57.409 --> 00:17:57.419 align:start position:0%
point of view how Community power has
 
00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
come about
 
00:18:00.409 --> 00:18:00.419 align:start position:0%
um but it also provides a little bit of
 
00:18:03.409 --> 00:18:03.419 align:start position:0%
history as to how
 
00:18:06.289 --> 00:18:06.299 align:start position:0%
um electric utility policies have
 
00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
evolved in this state and I'll just
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
start I'm going to try to run through
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
this fairly quickly
 
00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
um but this could be you know a whole uh
 
00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:16.700 align:start position:0%
a course uh
 
00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:19.980 align:start position:0%
you know just if we look at the electric
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
power industry started
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
um in the late 1800s
 
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
um it was very distributed it was on
 
00:18:28.669 --> 00:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
Municipal by Municipal basis started
 
00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
primarily in industrial centers or where
 
00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:32.940 align:start position:0%
there was hydropower
 
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
um so we had lots of little uh systems
 
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
that over time got Consolidated and over
 
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
time there was a basically a
 
00:18:42.289 --> 00:18:42.299 align:start position:0%
century-long trend towards economies of
 
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
scale bigger was better uh Power
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
Generation became much much more
 
00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:48.299 align:start position:0%
economic at a larger scale so there was
 
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
this tendency to get larger generation
 
00:18:54.529 --> 00:18:54.539 align:start position:0%
and in fact some of the smaller old
 
00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
hydras were discontinued over the course
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
of the 50s and 60s as this was occurring
 
00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:02.100 align:start position:0%
um we saw the first major energy price
 
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
shock with the 7374 air Oil Embargo at
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
that time a lot of electric generation
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
was from oil including in New England
 
00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
um you know part of the reaction to that
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
was a movement to go ahead head with the
 
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
Seabrook Nuclear Station which began in
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
1976 in 1977 this legislature enacted
 
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire limited electrical
 
00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:28.220 align:start position:0%
producers act RSA 362 a
 
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
which was enacted a full year before
 
00:19:33.049 --> 00:19:33.059 align:start position:0%
purpa and if if you look at you know if
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
you perpa and the Lipa act were
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
basically based on the same model a
 
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
policy model which said independent
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
power producers also known eventually as
 
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
small power producers or qualified
 
00:19:51.169 --> 00:19:51.179 align:start position:0%
facilities under purple could sell their
 
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:55.799 align:start position:0%
generation to the Monopoly utility if
 
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
they could sell it at or below the
 
00:19:59.690 --> 00:19:59.700 align:start position:0%
utilities avoided cost and the utility
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
had to contract with them for that power
 
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
um that's significant because several
 
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
things happened over the next decade
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
um in May 1979 Governor Hugh Allen who
 
00:20:13.789 --> 00:20:13.799 align:start position:0%
was elected on running on anti-quip
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
which is uh against allowing
 
00:20:18.169 --> 00:20:18.179 align:start position:0%
construction work in progress to be in
 
00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
the rate base which was about secret
 
00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
Seabrook that was put into law
 
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
and at the same time the cost of sleep
 
00:20:27.289 --> 00:20:27.299 align:start position:0%
work of rising and there was this
 
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
initiative by some of the smaller hydros
 
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
to restart those and a larger wood to
 
00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
energy power plants that sought
 
00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
long-term contracts with eversource that
 
00:20:39.169 --> 00:20:39.179 align:start position:0%
were based on seabrook's avoided cost
 
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
projections that kind of kept growing to
 
00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:43.980 align:start position:0%
justify continued investment which it
 
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
had to do because there was a period of
 
00:20:48.409 --> 00:20:48.419 align:start position:0%
high inflation and the interest on the
 
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.039 align:start position:0%
money they borrowed to build the plant
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
they couldn't recover from rates so they
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
had to kind of justify a continued
 
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
investment by projecting that future
 
00:20:59.690 --> 00:20:59.700 align:start position:0%
costs would be high and that's what
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
those contracts were based on on in 84
 
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:05.900 align:start position:0%
you unit 2 was canceled
 
00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
PSNH went through a three or four year
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy process Northeast Utilities
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
acquired them and part of that deal was
 
00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
for seven years of five and a half
 
00:21:18.529 --> 00:21:18.539 align:start position:0%
percent annual rate increases which
 
00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
ended up leading us to the uh as a state
 
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
the average highest rates in the whole
 
00:21:26.029 --> 00:21:26.039 align:start position:0%
country even higher than Alaska and
 
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
Hawaii which was exceptional at the time
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
um and so what that led to I was first
 
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
elected to this committee exactly 30
 
00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
years ago I was sitting in our seats as
 
00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
a freshman legislator and in my first
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
term one of the bills that got
 
00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
introduced um one of the big issues was
 
00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:46.140 align:start position:0%
the above market cost for these small
 
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
power producers and I was appointed to a
 
00:21:52.029 --> 00:21:52.039 align:start position:0%
study committee that and PSNH
 
00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
renegotiations legislative oversight
 
00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
committee and the purpose of that was to
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
try to
 
00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:02.700 align:start position:0%
um encourage uh PSNH was arguing that
 
00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
part of their high cost problem was
 
00:22:06.049 --> 00:22:06.059 align:start position:0%
these independent power producer
 
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
contracts and they wanted to renegotiate
 
00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
them because at that point by 94 they
 
00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
were way over market and projected to
 
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
continue to be way over market and um
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
and and so you know we started thinking
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
about how do we unwind these or or kind
 
00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
of uh address this problem that led in
 
00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
95 to the creation of a retail willing
 
00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:30.659 align:start position:0%
and restructuring study committee and at
 
00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
that time this concept of retail willing
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
was just sort of a new idea that was
 
00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:37.860 align:start position:0%
being talked about a lot could you have
 
00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
more competition and just sort of a
 
00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:44.220 align:start position:0%
context to this is part of what purpa
 
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
did drive because it allowed code
 
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
generation with some innovation in
 
00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
getting higher efficiencies from
 
00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:52.980 align:start position:0%
combined heat and power generation and
 
00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
there was also deregulation going on in
 
00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
the natural gas side which ended up
 
00:22:59.390 --> 00:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
driving combined cycle natural gas
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
generation which was sort of a new thing
 
00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:05.220 align:start position:0%
in in the in the in the 90s uh which
 
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
which was to say you could kind of
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
double the efficiency of burning natural
 
00:23:10.669 --> 00:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
gas by having two cycles a turbine like
 
00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
a jet engine that drives a a a turbine
 
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
to make electricity and then you also
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
make Steam from the heat that's left
 
00:23:19.549 --> 00:23:19.559 align:start position:0%
over so you had two cycle combined cycle
 
00:23:21.649 --> 00:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
and you've doubled the efficiency from
 
00:23:24.529 --> 00:23:24.539 align:start position:0%
the 25 to 33 range to roughly double
 
00:23:24.539 --> 00:23:25.730 align:start position:0%
the 25 to 33 range to roughly double
that

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:25.740 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
um so that this this was sort of
 
00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:29.940 align:start position:0%
happening in industries were saying in
 
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:32.220 align:start position:0%
many areas not just New Hampshire hey we
 
00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
could buy one of these uh combined heat
 
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
and power plants and um and produce our
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
own electricity cheaper than we're
 
00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
buying it from from eversource so you
 
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
know let give us a break
 
00:23:45.789 --> 00:23:45.799 align:start position:0%
um out of that study committee became
 
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
our re electric utility restructuring
 
00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:49.730 align:start position:0%
our re electric utility restructuring
act

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
act
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
um which was enacted in 1996 it went
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
there was a whole lot of work that went
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
into it and a very broad bipartisan
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
consensus was developed
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
um in the legislature at the time it
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
passed basically almost unanimously
 
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
through the House and Senate
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
um and it was a new paradigm it said
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
let's make it's sort of recognized that
 
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
we had screwed up at several levels the
 
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
the utility had screwed up by over
 
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
investing arguably they built we're
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
building a single project fifty percent
 
00:24:19.549 --> 00:24:19.559 align:start position:0%
over a thousand megawatts which was
 
00:24:21.049 --> 00:24:21.059 align:start position:0%
going to more than double their entire
 
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
generation capacity in one project and
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
that you know the cost went from a
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
billion dollars to 6.6 billion dollars
 
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
and that was billion dollars for two
 
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
units to 6.6 billion for one unit
 
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:36.900 align:start position:0%
um and so that was sort of a uh a
 
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
monopoly mistake and then Regulators
 
00:24:42.169 --> 00:24:42.179 align:start position:0%
then legislators kind of compounded that
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
by creating a law that linked these
 
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:47.220 align:start position:0%
independent power producers to that
 
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
price and cost and then Regulators all
 
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
encourage this to go on in until sort of
 
00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:56.460 align:start position:0%
the the House of Cards sort of collapsed
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
and the bankruptcy occurred and we found
 
00:25:00.529 --> 00:25:00.539 align:start position:0%
ourselves trying to figure out how do we
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
do things differently so that
 
00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
legislators regulators and the Monopoly
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
don't make this kind of mistake in the
 
00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
future and part of the answer was we
 
00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
could move you know generation no longer
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
had to be a monopoly that you could have
 
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
a choice of generation and there could
 
00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:18.059 align:start position:0%
be a competitive wholesale market for
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
generation and there could be customer
 
00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
Joyce choice of the generation Supply
 
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:24.900 align:start position:0%
but let's keep the wires vertically
 
00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.269 align:start position:0%
but let's keep the wires vertically
integrated

00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
integrated
 
00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
um I mean a monopoly because it only
 
00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
makes sense to have one set of wires let
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
me interrupt you just a second
 
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas Doug Thomas has a
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr chair going
 
00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
back to your previous statement um I'm
 
00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:40.980 align:start position:0%
just curious you said that they
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
recognized that the the power company at
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
the time had overbuilt
 
00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:50.820 align:start position:0%
given today's situation do you feel that
 
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:53.940 align:start position:0%
they still overbuilt or are we on a
 
00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:55.029 align:start position:0%
they still overbuilt or are we on a
different

00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
line of what maybe should have happened
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious if if maybe they were
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
before their time or not
 
00:26:02.039 --> 00:26:05.390 align:start position:0%
before their time or not
um

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
it's hard to say I mean it it's it the
 
00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:10.860 align:start position:0%
history is is what it is
 
00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:12.950 align:start position:0%
history is is what it is
um I

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
I I think
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
the the idea of the time in the 60s was
 
00:26:18.769 --> 00:26:18.779 align:start position:0%
that each of the major investor in
 
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
utilities New England would sponsor a
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
nuclear project and then others would
 
00:26:25.549 --> 00:26:25.559 align:start position:0%
buy shares of it this was sort of at the
 
00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:28.140 align:start position:0%
extreme end of that PSNH was a
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
standalone company in New Hampshire
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
alone their total demand was only about
 
00:26:33.769 --> 00:26:33.779 align:start position:0%
a thousand megawatts and they owned
 
00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:35.460 align:start position:0%
something less than that in generation
 
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
and they were kind of doubling that and
 
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
they were rejecting a huge amount of
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
growth in electricity consumption
 
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
um roughly you know projecting a
 
00:26:45.169 --> 00:26:45.179 align:start position:0%
doubling now we have gotten there you
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
know over several decades but it wasn't
 
00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
there there's just a whole combination
 
00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:53.220 align:start position:0%
of things High inflation High interest
 
00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.649 align:start position:0%
of things High inflation High interest
rates

00:26:54.649 --> 00:26:54.659 align:start position:0%
rates
 
00:26:58.010 --> 00:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
um that and and and and natural gas
 
00:27:00.049 --> 00:27:00.059 align:start position:0%
prices coming down from the deregulation
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
and natural gas that made natural gas
 
00:27:03.289 --> 00:27:03.299 align:start position:0%
very competitive with this Capital
 
00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:04.980 align:start position:0%
intensive project
 
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
and and quite honestly the uh uh the
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
federal Regulators you know said this is
 
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
a case study in red tape that that
 
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
Seabrook was mired in it
 
00:27:16.669 --> 00:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
um Three Mile Island happened in the
 
00:27:18.289 --> 00:27:18.299 align:start position:0%
middle of this and they kind of redid a
 
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of things that added to the
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
cost it's it's a whole complex case
 
00:27:24.649 --> 00:27:24.659 align:start position:0%
study that
 
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:26.820 align:start position:0%
um I I don't want to try to speculate
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
um but what's interesting about this is
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
that in parallel with this house
 
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
committee passing over to the Senate the
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
restructuring Statute in the same
 
00:27:42.169 --> 00:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
crossover the Senate sent to the house a
 
00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:45.799 align:start position:0%
bill to create chapter RSA 53e
 
00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:48.059 align:start position:0%
aggregation of electric customers by
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities and counties now the
 
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
interesting thing is Jeb Bradley was the
 
00:27:54.289 --> 00:27:54.299 align:start position:0%
chair of the committee at the time and
 
00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:56.220 align:start position:0%
the bill came over allowing the
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
possibility to do this on an opt-out
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
basis Jeb thought that we this was a New
 
00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
Concept nobody else had done it
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
um so he he sort of said let's do this
 
00:28:09.409 --> 00:28:09.419 align:start position:0%
on an opt-in-only basis initially enable
 
00:28:12.649 --> 00:28:12.659 align:start position:0%
it and that's how we uh this committee
 
00:28:15.529 --> 00:28:15.539 align:start position:0%
unanimously amended the bill and um
 
00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
basically it's that dormant for the next
 
00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
20 years so um that but I'll kind of
 
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:22.380 align:start position:0%
catch up with this in a moment
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
um so at that same time like a month
 
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
later after we passed and the New
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house was the first
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
legislative State legislative body to
 
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
pass this kind of restructuring Bill uh
 
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
to saying let's spin off generation into
 
00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
a competitive market
 
00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:38.690 align:start position:0%
a competitive market
um

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:38.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:41.940 align:start position:0%
so for I should order 888 and that was
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
you know we knew that was in development
 
00:28:45.289 --> 00:28:45.299 align:start position:0%
and the title that case was promoting
 
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:46.860 align:start position:0%
wholesale competition through Open
 
00:28:48.769 --> 00:28:48.779 align:start position:0%
Access non-discriminatory transmission
 
00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
services and it was a reformulation of
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
the federal role in power regulation and
 
00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
said let's move towards transmission
 
00:28:59.210 --> 00:28:59.220 align:start position:0%
systems that are open access because
 
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
they had been what were called pancake
 
00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:04.740 align:start position:0%
rates like you you you you paid for uh
 
00:29:06.649 --> 00:29:06.659 align:start position:0%
pass passing through each different
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
section of the transmission system and
 
00:29:10.669 --> 00:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
they sort of said let's do this more
 
00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
like a postage stamp rate and have an
 
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
open access tariff where any supplier
 
00:29:18.769 --> 00:29:18.779 align:start position:0%
and any consumer any uh load serving
 
00:29:21.289 --> 00:29:21.299 align:start position:0%
entity has access to this competitive
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
wholesale market and that's where ISO
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
New England Nepal sort of evolved uh um
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
spun off part of its role in the iso New
 
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
England became a regional transmission
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
organization an independent system
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
operator that's sort of where that came
 
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
out of uh for that fork order 888
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
and we were very you know engaged at
 
00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
that time in looking at what that meant
 
00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
and the implications of it and how our
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
legislation fit with that
 
00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:47.700 align:start position:0%
um subsequent to that I worked with with
 
00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.039 align:start position:0%
Jeb in the committee on a leap of Reform
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
to an end the obligation of utilities
 
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
under state law to buy it took some
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
years before uh for got around to
 
00:29:59.450 --> 00:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
changing uh ferc in the same way so he
 
00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
said no longer uh did the utilities have
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
to buy from these small power producers
 
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
that avoided costs
 
00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
um they can you know sell through the uh
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
wholesale Market if they want
 
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
um uh but we also created net metering
 
00:30:15.289 --> 00:30:15.299 align:start position:0%
as part of that same legislation that
 
00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:17.820 align:start position:0%
particular Bill uh went through eight 18
 
00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:19.799 align:start position:0%
work sessions
 
00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
um and and uh it was Gemini who had
 
00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
sponsored that uh keeping it all very
 
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.909 align:start position:0%
sponsored that uh keeping it all very
bipartisan

00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
bipartisan
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
um and created net metering as an
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
alternative under under the leap of
 
00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.210 align:start position:0%
alternative under under the leap of
Statute

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:31.220 align:start position:0%
Statute
 
00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:31.549 align:start position:0%
Statute
[Music]

00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:31.559 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:30:31.559 --> 00:30:32.330 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
in two thoughts just jump way ahead
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
um 2017 or 2016 metering uh was expanded
 
00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
from the initial caps when we first
 
00:30:45.529 --> 00:30:45.539 align:start position:0%
enacted it we were thinking of it more
 
00:30:48.049 --> 00:30:48.059 align:start position:0%
as primarily for early adopters we tried
 
00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
to enable the notion of limited
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
producers able also being able to sell
 
00:30:54.169 --> 00:30:54.179 align:start position:0%
independently of net metered but that
 
00:30:57.049 --> 00:30:57.059 align:start position:0%
never really got taken advantage of
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
um uh but that called for the puc to
 
00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:02.700 align:start position:0%
look at developing new uh tariffs um to
 
00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:04.980 align:start position:0%
sort of update the original a formula
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
from from 1998. so in 2017 the puc
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
issued an order after a long proceeding
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
to approve all new alternative metering
 
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
tariffs sometimes called net metering
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
2.0 at that time I was representing the
 
00:31:21.649 --> 00:31:21.659 align:start position:0%
city of Lebanon and we proposed a pilot
 
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
of what could be considered a
 
00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
transactive energy framework where the
 
00:31:27.409 --> 00:31:27.419 align:start position:0%
customer generator could both buy and
 
00:31:30.049 --> 00:31:30.059 align:start position:0%
sell at real-time prices reflecting the
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
wholesale market and get credit for
 
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
actual avoided transmission and capacity
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
cost using the RSA 53e Municipal
 
00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
aggregation statute on an opt-in only
 
00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
basis and
 
00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
um but as in the in Liberty worked with
 
00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
us on that the commission ordered
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
Liberty to try to work with us to make
 
00:31:50.269 --> 00:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
that pilot work we ran into multiple
 
00:31:53.169 --> 00:31:53.179 align:start position:0%
obstacles including some provisions of
 
00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
53e that were catch-22s like we had to
 
00:31:58.909 --> 00:31:58.919 align:start position:0%
do a mailing to all customers but a
 
00:32:00.289 --> 00:32:00.299 align:start position:0%
subsequent law said that utility
 
00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
couldn't give us the names and addresses
 
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
of customers unless we got their
 
00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
individual permission so we couldn't
 
00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:10.460 align:start position:0%
comply with the law so that that
 
00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
leads us to the last bit of background
 
00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
um which was an initiative in 2019 to
 
00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:19.740 align:start position:0%
update the statute to offer opt out
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
alternative default service and expand
 
00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
some of the authorities and straighten
 
00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:25.740 align:start position:0%
out the glitches in the law now that
 
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
Bill happened to be co-sponsored by Jeb
 
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
Bradley who you know 25 years earlier
 
00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.789 align:start position:0%
Bradley who you know 25 years earlier
had

00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
um argued it should be opt-in only but
 
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
he was persuaded that opt-out made sense
 
00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
at this point it had never been used
 
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
other states had done it only on an
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
opt-out basis so we started an
 
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
organizing group that resulted in the
 
00:32:48.529 --> 00:32:48.539 align:start position:0%
Coalition in late 2019 at the same time
 
00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:51.179 align:start position:0%
uh uh rule making stakeholder groups at
 
00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
the puc started and the first draft of
 
00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
rules were ready by late 2020 and we'd
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
also developed our joint Powers
 
00:33:00.289 --> 00:33:00.299 align:start position:0%
agreement I'll explain that in a minute
 
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
um but in 2021 House Bill 315 was
 
00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
introduced representative Oz was the
 
00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:08.220 align:start position:0%
sponsor and but it had been drafted by
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
you know eversource
 
00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
um and it it in some ways sought to
 
00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
straighten out some issues in 53 but in
 
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
other ways we felt it sort of you know
 
00:33:22.009 --> 00:33:22.019 align:start position:0%
tried to undo the progress we had just
 
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
made a couple years early or and had all
 
00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:26.519 align:start position:0%
sorts of problems this committee
 
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:29.220 align:start position:0%
understood those and um there's a lot of
 
00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:32.700 align:start position:0%
public engagement and uh representative
 
00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:33.710 align:start position:0%
public engagement and uh representative
Vos

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
Vos
 
00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:35.220 align:start position:0%
um this was in in the middle of the
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
pandemic but he encouraged us to work
 
00:33:39.529 --> 00:33:39.539 align:start position:0%
with the utilities to find compromise
 
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
and helped facilitate a very intensive
 
00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
four or five day everyday meetings that
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
were virtual so it was it was time
 
00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
efficient but we eventually worked with
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders with utilities with
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and came up
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
with a compromise that was supported
 
00:34:03.649 --> 00:34:03.659 align:start position:0%
broadly by by essentially everyone and I
 
00:34:06.769 --> 00:34:06.779 align:start position:0%
think you know it it um in a lot of ways
 
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
it did improve the statute provided much
 
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
clearer consumer protection uh uh
 
00:34:13.609 --> 00:34:13.619 align:start position:0%
Clarity on some of the authorities and
 
00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
the roles
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
um and created the requirement for puc
 
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
EAP review and also created the
 
00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:23.220 align:start position:0%
possibility of a purchase of receivables
 
00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:24.349 align:start position:0%
possibility of a purchase of receivables
program

00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
so but then in July of 2021 the doe was
 
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
created the POC was reorganized so sort
 
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
of this sort of languished for a bit
 
00:34:37.129 --> 00:34:37.139 align:start position:0%
until late 2021 we and the doe
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
petitioned for rulemaking with working
 
00:34:42.109 --> 00:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
off of the rules that had been developed
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
a couple years earlier and then
 
00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:47.700 align:start position:0%
um after the Senate Bill 315 was enacted
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
you know looking at how the rules need
 
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
to change there
 
00:34:53.329 --> 00:34:53.339 align:start position:0%
so um that resulted in a final proposal
 
00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
by the puc in Late July of last year the
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
city of lebanon's electric aggregation
 
00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.470 align:start position:0%
city of lebanon's electric aggregation
uh

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
plan was the first approved in August of
 
00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
last year oh says 2023 that's 2022.
 
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
um and jailcar approved the rules in
 
00:35:10.849 --> 00:35:10.859 align:start position:0%
September and there was a final option
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
adoption by the puc in late
 
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.370 align:start position:0%
adoption by the puc in late
October

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
October
 
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
or early October
 
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
so um what is the community power
 
00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:23.940 align:start position:0%
Coalition we're Community uh governed
 
00:35:26.329 --> 00:35:26.339 align:start position:0%
power supplier uh looking to launch
 
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
community power programs hopefully in
 
00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.630 align:start position:0%
community power programs hopefully in
April

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
April
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
um we were created as a non-profit joint
 
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
power agency in on October 1st of 2021
 
00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
um I kind of forgot I don't really have
 
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
slides on this but we're we're organized
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA 53a which is a law that
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
is about
 
00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
um enabling uh subdivisions the state to
 
00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.390 align:start position:0%
um enabling uh subdivisions the state to
work

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
um uh to
 
00:35:59.870 --> 00:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
work collaboratively by sharing
 
00:36:02.329 --> 00:36:02.339 align:start position:0%
authorities legislatively granted
 
00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:04.820 align:start position:0%
authorities to exercise those jointly
 
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
including through creation of a separate
 
00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
entity in this case we're called what's
 
00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
called a governmental instrumentality
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
we're separate non-profit Corporation
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire law but we are an
 
00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
instrument of our Municipal members and
 
00:36:22.609 --> 00:36:22.619 align:start position:0%
County member and and so we've we've we
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
are not a subdivision of the state but
 
00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:25.740 align:start position:0%
we are governmental instrumentality
 
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
subject to RSA 91a the right to know law
 
00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:30.300 align:start position:0%
so we're you know our meetings are
 
00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
considered public meetings
 
00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:34.740 align:start position:0%
um we have 27 members at present almost
 
00:36:36.349 --> 00:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
about double from one when we were
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
originally Incorporated represent and
 
00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:41.220 align:start position:0%
another one in the next week we'll join
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
um representing about 21 percent of New
 
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's population at this point
 
00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:47.220 align:start position:0%
potentially these are default service
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
only customers including sort of some
 
00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
attrition we assume some may not want to
 
00:36:54.829 --> 00:36:54.839 align:start position:0%
come over but it would be about 125 000
 
00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:57.180 align:start position:0%
customers over a million megawatt hours
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
per year on the order of
 
00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:03.300 align:start position:0%
140 million dollars a year in revenues
 
00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
um and there's about 12 communities that
 
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
are aiming to launch this spring and
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
more next year and that sort of
 
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
just turn myself off on a button so um
 
00:37:17.569 --> 00:37:17.579 align:start position:0%
how did this come about well it it is we
 
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
spent three years on trying to adapt
 
00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
National best practices for a joint
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
power agency in a lot of ways it's
 
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
modeled on the Public Power experience
 
00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
there's over 2 000 Municipal Electric
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
Systems in the country they often
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
operate they operate the distribution
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
system usually on a Town by Town basis
 
00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
or city some big cities like Austin and
 
00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
Sacramento uh Jacksonville Florida or
 
00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:42.660 align:start position:0%
our Municipal systems but a lot of them
 
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
are smaller and so a lot of them over
 
00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:47.460 align:start position:0%
the past 50 or 60 years joined together
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
to create joint power agencies
 
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
um to do things like uh uh do joint
 
00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
generation projects or to procure power
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
in competitive markets and so the map
 
00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
sort of shows some of those that exist
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
so in a lot of ways our joint power
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
model is based on that it's designed for
 
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
robust Democratic governance and
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
oversight economies of scale
 
00:38:13.609 --> 00:38:13.619 align:start position:0%
risk management of a portfolio power
 
00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
supply contracts Advanced retail
 
00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:19.140 align:start position:0%
customer services it's a proven model
 
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
for new project development and local
 
00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
programs to be supported by a team of
 
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
professional staff and advisors uh of
 
00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
which there's a whole industry
 
00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
um maybe I won't repeat all this but um
 
00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
there's some more detail on some of the
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
local policy goals that we hope to
 
00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.170 align:start position:0%
local policy goals that we hope to
achieve

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
achieve
 
00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:47.700 align:start position:0%
um including for basic products lower
 
00:38:50.569 --> 00:38:50.579 align:start position:0%
cost uh options
 
00:38:52.609 --> 00:38:52.619 align:start position:0%
um as well as opt-out projects for
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
higher renewable content or clean energy
 
00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:57.300 align:start position:0%
content we hope to be involved in local
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
project development uh working in
 
00:39:01.849 --> 00:39:01.859 align:start position:0%
collaboration with utilities on local
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
infrastructure issues particularly
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
bringing back Community scale solar and
 
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
storage we'd like to help provide
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
commercial Innovation particularly to
 
00:39:12.589 --> 00:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
smaller businesses there's been a lot of
 
00:39:14.569 --> 00:39:14.579 align:start position:0%
competition for larger businesses and a
 
00:39:16.609 --> 00:39:16.619 align:start position:0%
fair amount of innovation but there's a
 
00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839 align:start position:0%
lot more that can be done and also
 
00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
building equity and economic development
 
00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:24.270 align:start position:0%
in our Energy System

um

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:26.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
this there's a lot of words here
 
00:39:30.589 --> 00:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
the design context here and what I've
 
00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:36.780 align:start position:0%
done is I pulled the slides for that we
 
00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:39.300 align:start position:0%
have for multiple uses
 
00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
um and and so that a little bit is more
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
detailed and redundant than perhaps
 
00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
necessary but um they were what was at
 
00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:46.490 align:start position:0%
necessary but um they were what was at
hand

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
hand
 
00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:48.180 align:start position:0%
um there there are basically two models
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh contract with a for-profit supplier
 
00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:53.339 align:start position:0%
by using a broker uh that puts the load
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
out to bid there's some uh advantages to
 
00:39:59.329 --> 00:39:59.339 align:start position:0%
that so it's relatively simple it's it's
 
00:40:01.069 --> 00:40:01.079 align:start position:0%
um widely used in States like
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts another model is to create
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
a community-owned supplier like uh
 
00:40:07.849 --> 00:40:07.859 align:start position:0%
Public Power agencies have done co-ops
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
have also done this uh in a lot of areas
 
00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
Although our Co-op provides all their
 
00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:14.700 align:start position:0%
own Services in-house mostly
 
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
um and uh and there's some advantages to
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
that not the least of which I think is
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
demystifying how the power sector works
 
00:40:25.609 --> 00:40:25.619 align:start position:0%
and creating more uh understanding and
 
00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
informed decision making that will
 
00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
support Innovation over time I mean the
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
well we we have all of our board members
 
00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
have been sort of
 
00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:38.220 align:start position:0%
um like you a little bit overwhelmed at
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
times in terms of understanding the
 
00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
complexity of our electric power system
 
00:40:43.849 --> 00:40:43.859 align:start position:0%
and everything that goes into it
 
00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
um but also feeling like they're getting
 
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
a better understanding of what works and
 
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't what doesn't work
 
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
um because sometimes there's there's a
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
tendency to sort of suggest simplistic
 
00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
Solutions when
 
00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
the solutions are really pretty
 
00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:58.430 align:start position:0%
the solutions are really pretty
complicated

00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
um so where does it exist the green
 
00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
states are where uh Community Choice has
 
00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
existed for a period of time uh some of
 
00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
those dates of when states have been
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
enabled it it says New Hampshire 2019
 
00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
because that was the update of awe in
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
fact New Hampshire's law was the first
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
it just sat dormant for a long time the
 
00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Market all the sort of
 
00:41:19.609 --> 00:41:19.619 align:start position:0%
colored communities are ones that either
 
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
this is from a couple years ago either
 
00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.170 align:start position:0%
this is from a couple years ago either
had

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:23.180 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:41:25.849 --> 00:41:25.859 align:start position:0%
Municipal aggregation or I think the
 
00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
blue ones might be ones who were in
 
00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
process of of doing that they've had
 
00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:33.260 align:start position:0%
some relative they get race stability
 
00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
usually two to three year contract they
 
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
usually have some moderate savings
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
they're usually able to add somewhat
 
00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
more renewable content there's minimum a
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
minimum amount of in Innovation and um
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
and and limited public advocacy uh there
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
is and this is a little bit more about
 
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
the broker it's fairly simple stay steps
 
00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
there's three active brokers in
 
00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:55.670 align:start position:0%
there's three active brokers in
Massachusetts

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
two of which colonial power and good
 
00:41:59.210 --> 00:41:59.220 align:start position:0%
energy have partnered with new
 
00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:00.710 align:start position:0%
energy have partnered with new
hampshire-based

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire-based
 
00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
Brokers or aggregators a freedom energy
 
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
Logistics with colonial power standard
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
power with good energy that are
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
basically offering this same model in
 
00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
and there's that some communities have
 
00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
signed up with them the Massachusetts
 
00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:18.540 align:start position:0%
compact model was something of an
 
00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:20.339 align:start position:0%
exception they were actually the first
 
00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:23.900 align:start position:0%
Municipal aggregation and it was uh um
 
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
1997 and it was 21 towns on Cape Cod
 
00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:30.300 align:start position:0%
Martha's Vineyard who sort of joined
 
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
together to create a joint power entity
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
like our joint power agency pursuant to
 
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
laws that enable that like our laws um
 
00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
joint exercise of powers
 
00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:41.820 align:start position:0%
um and and there is some value there's
 
00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
some things that they have done that are
 
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
different and unique
 
00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
um part of that was because they were
 
00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:48.300 align:start position:0%
early on in restructuring and kind of
 
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
captured the operation of the Energy
 
00:42:53.329 --> 00:42:53.339 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs on the cape if I
 
00:42:54.349 --> 00:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
could interrupt for a second
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
00:42:58.490 --> 00:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question when there's a broker
 
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
I assume the broker takes some sort of
 
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
cut of what's going on can you give us
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
some some sense as to what that would be
 
00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
um I used to have that number on the top
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
of my head but I don't right now it's
 
00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:17.460 align:start position:0%
it's on the order of a tenth of a cent
 
00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:20.460 align:start position:0%
it's yeah it's on that order
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
um it might be
 
00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:24.900 align:start position:0%
a couple well yeah it's on the order of
 
00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:26.820 align:start position:0%
a tenth of a cent
 
00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:27.170 align:start position:0%
a tenth of a cent

um
 
00:43:30.349 --> 00:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
representative muns would like to ask
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
sure thanks Mr chairman
 
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
um if a community creates their own uh
 
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
aggregation plan and and you know
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
initially decides that they want to go
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
on going on their own yes
 
00:43:46.849 --> 00:43:46.859 align:start position:0%
how difficult is it for them if they
 
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
then want to join the join your
 
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:52.140 align:start position:0%
Coalition and and then as a follow-up
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
What what is the what is the procedure
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
that they would have to go through I
 
00:43:57.890 --> 00:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
mean what what do you have any kind of
 
00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:01.460 align:start position:0%
vetting standards well um
 
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
they have to execute the joint Powers
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
agreement so they have to kind of come
 
00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:06.780 align:start position:0%
in with the terms that have already been
 
00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:08.010 align:start position:0%
in with the terms that have already been
established

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:08.020 align:start position:0%
established
 
00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:08.390 align:start position:0%
established

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.349 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:11.329 --> 00:44:11.339 align:start position:0%
they um
 
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
but you know the only caveats the board
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
has to approve admit them as a member
 
00:44:17.569 --> 00:44:17.579 align:start position:0%
which we've done with everybody who
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
wants to join so far
 
00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:20.530 align:start position:0%
wants to join so far
um

00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:20.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
uh I mean typically uh the experience in
 
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has been they usually come
 
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
up with two or three contracts and that
 
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
that has worked well particularly in
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
this period because a lot of these were
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
started before the recent run up in
 
00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
prices this particular slide has a
 
00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:39.300 align:start position:0%
couple of hyperlinks that also detail
 
00:44:41.809 --> 00:44:41.819 align:start position:0%
um situations where the retail supplier
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
because they were aggregations were
 
00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
depending on a single supplier uh went
 
00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
bankrupt because they didn't you know
 
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
weren't sufficiently hedged for the
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
market conditions and uh programs have
 
00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
had to shut down as a result of that and
 
00:44:58.490 --> 00:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts in some cases a year
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
number of years back they went into
 
00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:02.220 align:start position:0%
three you know some went into three year
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
contracts and two or in the second or
 
00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:06.780 align:start position:0%
third year out the market prices came
 
00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
down the default utility default service
 
00:45:11.569 --> 00:45:11.579 align:start position:0%
came down and uh you know customers
 
00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:13.140 align:start position:0%
migrated back to the utility default
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
service so they had to shut down the
 
00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
program so it kind of so the point would
 
00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
be after that contract Runs Out somebody
 
00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
could consider training transitioning to
 
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
the coalition
 
00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.870 align:start position:0%
the coalition
follow-up

00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
thank you of the 27 members in the
 
00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
Coalition now are there any that
 
00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:31.250 align:start position:0%
Coalition now are there any that
um

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
that initially created their own plan
 
00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:37.140 align:start position:0%
and have now decided to join the
 
00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.890 align:start position:0%
and have now decided to join the
coalition

00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
um I Peterborough was sort of like that
 
00:45:44.569 --> 00:45:44.579 align:start position:0%
they they kind of um forged their own
 
00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:46.740 align:start position:0%
way they kind of did a hybrid plan based
 
00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
on ours and Keen which was with standard
 
00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
power and good energy and uh and then
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
they decided to do this fall sort of uh
 
00:45:58.670 --> 00:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
request for proposals and we responded
 
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
to that along with at least one of the
 
00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:01.790 align:start position:0%
to that along with at least one of the
Brokers

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
Brokers
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
um and they ended up deciding to go with
 
00:46:04.079 --> 00:46:04.970 align:start position:0%
um and they ended up deciding to go with
us

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:04.980 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
um so they kind of had their feet in
 
00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:09.060 align:start position:0%
both camps for a while
 
00:46:10.849 --> 00:46:10.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
and nashua's plan is also written to
 
00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
provide those options but their energy
 
00:46:17.329 --> 00:46:17.339 align:start position:0%
committee is or electric aggregation
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
committee has recently recommended to
 
00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:20.700 align:start position:0%
the board aldermen that they proceed
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
with the Coalition they've been a member
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
of the Coalition since the start so this
 
00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:27.300 align:start position:0%
is just a slide that illustrates some of
 
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
the joint power agencies of course this
 
00:46:31.609 --> 00:46:31.619 align:start position:0%
has taken off the most in California I'm
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
just going to share a little bit of that
 
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
real quick
 
00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
um oops I'm going the wrong direction
 
00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
page down not up whoa okay
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
um sorry about that
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
get way back there real quick somehow I
 
00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:46.980 align:start position:0%
went to the end of the slides okay I'm
 
00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
going to try to speed up some of these
 
00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
um okay here so um in California ccas
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
have uh expanded a lot in in over the
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
past decade
 
00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
um California is a sort of weird thing
 
00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
they started with customer choice they
 
00:47:05.809 --> 00:47:05.819 align:start position:0%
had a big problem
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
um from a legislative mistake they they
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
un froze the supply costs but they froze
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
the retail rate and didn't that didn't
 
00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.290 align:start position:0%
the retail rate and didn't that didn't
work

00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
um and so they shut down customer Choice
 
00:47:19.849 --> 00:47:19.859 align:start position:0%
except for large cni customers but then
 
00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
they reintroduced it with Community
 
00:47:24.589 --> 00:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
Choice aggregation in which customers
 
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
can choose between the aggregation and
 
00:47:29.569 --> 00:47:29.579 align:start position:0%
the utility default service and large
 
00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
customers can go to third-party
 
00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:33.060 align:start position:0%
suppliers but not small customers so
 
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
we're a little bit different from that
 
00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
it's too small to see but the picture on
 
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.839 align:start position:0%
the right there just shows details a
 
00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:42.660 align:start position:0%
bunch of projects that uh the ccas in
 
00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
California have been developing and this
 
00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:46.380 align:start position:0%
is just sort of a summary of the impact
 
00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:48.300 align:start position:0%
of course the scale of California is
 
00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:50.940 align:start position:0%
much larger than the scale that we're at
 
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
although we are at approximately at the
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
scales of one of the couple of the small
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
opening over 6 000 megawatts of new
 
00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:01.740 align:start position:0%
solar thousand megawatts of wind uh 2.6
 
00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
megawatts it's 2.6 000 megawatts of new
 
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
energy storage as well some geothermal
 
00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
and biogas they're doing this through a
 
00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079 align:start position:0%
variety of means uh some of you know
 
00:48:14.569 --> 00:48:14.579 align:start position:0%
some of them have received investment
 
00:48:16.609 --> 00:48:16.619 align:start position:0%
grade ratings so they're direct project
 
00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:18.780 align:start position:0%
developers although most of them are uh
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
through Power purchase agreements
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
um just to comment on this is a little
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
bit dated now but looked at over like a
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
a 10 or 11 year period
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
the performance of all the 50 states the
 
00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
ones on the left hand side of the
 
00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:36.900 align:start position:0%
spectrum with the black bars are
 
00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
investor owned are vertically integrated
 
00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:41.460 align:start position:0%
uh States they don't have any form of
 
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
customer choice the Green Line shows
 
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
states with customer choice and
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
competitive power supply markets and at
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
that point in time all the other states
 
00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:53.940 align:start position:0%
that had that approach were doing better
 
00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
in terms of the annual year over year uh
 
00:48:59.569 --> 00:48:59.579 align:start position:0%
or the change in prices over this period
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
of time New Hampshire was right on on
 
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
the margin there
 
00:49:05.329 --> 00:49:05.339 align:start position:0%
um so we felt that there's you know ways
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
to do oops I'll still pause here
 
00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much Mr chair
 
00:49:14.089 --> 00:49:14.099 align:start position:0%
um I'm just going back to that other
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
slide but you don't have to go back to
 
00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
it okay um just the reference to
 
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
geothermal in California
 
00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:21.290 align:start position:0%
geothermal in California
um

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:21.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:23.089 --> 00:49:23.099 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we're a Granite State
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
so geothermal can be difficult in
 
00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
California there are an earthquake state
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
so does that
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
impact him obviously it's going to
 
00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
impact you have some kind of a cap on
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
geothermal or anything like that
 
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
no you do not okay no I I mean there's
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
no geothermal electric production in the
 
00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
Northeast that I'm aware of there's a
 
00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:49.260 align:start position:0%
few somewhat hot spots but I they
 
00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:52.140 align:start position:0%
haven't been proven out is viable
 
00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:58.130 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:49:58.130 --> 00:49:58.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:58.140 --> 00:49:59.450 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:49:59.450 --> 00:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
um what if we has happened over the
 
00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
first year of operation
 
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
um and we're not operational still in
 
00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
startup phase so none of these programs
 
00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
have actually started yet
 
00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
um but we've held over 110 public
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
meetings of our uh because we're driven
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
by volunteers and a handful of some
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
Municipal staff members who've been
 
00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:21.470 align:start position:0%
Municipal staff members who've been
involved

00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
um uh but you know you know we're we and
 
00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
and we've had a couple of Consultants
 
00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:31.140 align:start position:0%
um uh we did raise you know roughly 150
 
00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:34.020 align:start position:0%
000 in Grants and donations to help us
 
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
through our first year uh but um you
 
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
know we've we've been focusing on the
 
00:50:41.569 --> 00:50:41.579 align:start position:0%
rules development
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
um and then in the spring we did a
 
00:50:47.569 --> 00:50:47.579 align:start position:0%
full-blown request for proposals to
 
00:50:50.089 --> 00:50:50.099 align:start position:0%
solicit all the range of services that
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
we need to launch
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
um with uh vendors who are willing to
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
work on an at-risk basis meaning we're
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
not going to pay them until the program
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
becomes operational so that our success
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
or their success or them getting paid is
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
dependent on our success and fortunately
 
00:51:09.410 --> 00:51:09.420 align:start position:0%
uh because I think of a fair really
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
compelling case we got some really good
 
00:51:15.849 --> 00:51:15.859 align:start position:0%
responses on our RFP and over the summer
 
00:51:19.069 --> 00:51:19.079 align:start position:0%
we worked on evaluating those and so
 
00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:21.900 align:start position:0%
we've executed uh contracts that were
 
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
negotiated over the course of the Fall
 
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
to give us the full capabilities of a
 
00:51:29.089 --> 00:51:29.099 align:start position:0%
competitive electric power supplier
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
um to uh to stand up a joint power
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
agency and provide these services
 
00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:36.660 align:start position:0%
including securing 750
 
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:38.700 align:start position:0%
000 and startup funds and eight and a
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
half million dollars in credit support
 
00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:42.780 align:start position:0%
were actually in the process of kind of
 
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
concluding the arrangement uh with a
 
00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
contractor lse that provides additional
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
credit support we've adopted a bunch of
 
00:51:53.089 --> 00:51:53.099 align:start position:0%
major policies that have taken a lot of

00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:05.220 align:start position:0%
policy we've adopted cost sharing

agreement and member services contract
 
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
for complete service bundle which will
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
you know operate which is sort of our
 
00:52:14.089 --> 00:52:14.099 align:start position:0%
initial product offering there may be
 
00:52:16.609 --> 00:52:16.619 align:start position:0%
more things in the future and then we
 
00:52:18.829 --> 00:52:18.839 align:start position:0%
also simulated our performance and
 
00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:21.180 align:start position:0%
financial stability under 13 different
 
00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:24.300 align:start position:0%
scenarios uh using stochastic modeling
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh which means you run multiple 100
 
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
scenarios with different assumptions
 
00:52:31.549 --> 00:52:31.559 align:start position:0%
about weather economic conditions and so
 
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
forth and they confirm that um uh that
 
00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:37.740 align:start position:0%
we are are very viable and and to the
 
00:52:39.049 --> 00:52:39.059 align:start position:0%
best of our knowledge are almost
 
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
certainly this is the first such entity
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's launched using this very
 
00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:45.230 align:start position:0%
that's launched using this very
sophisticated

00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
sophisticated
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
um uh robust stochastic modeling
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
approach usually people just do a a
 
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
projected result and maybe a high case
 
00:52:56.450 --> 00:52:56.460 align:start position:0%
in a low case we did 100 cases and 13
 
00:52:59.329 --> 00:52:59.339 align:start position:0%
variations off those cases
 
00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:02.220 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman could you talk a little
 
00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:07.740 align:start position:0%
bit more about the stress test and and
 
00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
what your what you're testing for
 
00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
yes I think there'll be a few more
 
00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:15.900 align:start position:0%
slides on that yep okay I can wait
 
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
um so we've had this fairly rapid
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
membership growth
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
um this is a bar showing the top of the
 
00:53:23.089 --> 00:53:23.099 align:start position:0%
dashed lines on the right or the current
 
00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:25.260 align:start position:0%
default service load of the four
 
00:53:26.809 --> 00:53:26.819 align:start position:0%
different utilities
 
00:53:30.829 --> 00:53:30.839 align:start position:0%
other than the few number of small munis
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
um and our current membership if they
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
were all the launch would Place us as
 
00:53:38.089 --> 00:53:38.099 align:start position:0%
the second largest default service
 
00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:41.220 align:start position:0%
provider uh the interested communities
 
00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
that have expressed interest in possibly
 
00:53:47.089 --> 00:53:47.099 align:start position:0%
joining uh would if they all joined and
 
00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:50.220 align:start position:0%
um uh uh we would potentially be the
 
00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:52.140 align:start position:0%
largest default service supplier in the
 
00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:54.829 align:start position:0%
largest default service supplier in the
state

00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:56.930 --> 00:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
um just going to run through some of our
 
00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:58.130 align:start position:0%
um just going to run through some of our
governance

00:53:58.130 --> 00:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
governance
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
um we're governing four communities by
 
00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:01.670 align:start position:0%
um we're governing four communities by
communities

00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
um interesting point we have a former uh
 
00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
eversource executive as our vice chair
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
Kevin charette was
 
00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
um early in his career with eversource
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
23 years based in Connecticut he was in
 
00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
charge of their audit functions but then
 
00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
he rose to become in charge of all their
 
00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
customer service functions and so he was
 
00:54:23.569 --> 00:54:23.579 align:start position:0%
really helpful in evaluating the
 
00:54:25.849 --> 00:54:25.859 align:start position:0%
customer services proposal on our RFP
 
00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
and more recently uh uh Brentwood has
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
joined us and the former director of
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources for
 
00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:36.660 align:start position:0%
eversource Richard lebreck has also
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
joined our board of directors so that
 
00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:41.460 align:start position:0%
that's kind of interesting
 
00:54:43.549 --> 00:54:43.559 align:start position:0%
um he only retired from eversource a
 
00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
year or two ago
 
00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:46.130 align:start position:0%
year or two ago
um

00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:46.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
and and so we've really benefited from a
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
really interesting diversity of talent
 
00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh from from across our members uh some
 
00:54:58.010 --> 00:54:58.020 align:start position:0%
retirees uh some professionals just just
 
00:55:01.609 --> 00:55:01.619 align:start position:0%
really uh valuable contributions
 
00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
um we've engaged um expert contractors
 
00:55:06.049 --> 00:55:06.059 align:start position:0%
who are the who are the top of their
 
00:55:06.059 --> 00:55:07.370 align:start position:0%
who are the who are the top of their
fields

00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:07.380 align:start position:0%
fields
 
00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
um Ascend analytics for energy hedging
 
00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:12.660 align:start position:0%
planning portfolio risk management
 
00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:15.119 align:start position:0%

energy New Hampshire is helping with
 
00:55:25.609 --> 00:55:25.619 align:start position:0%
member services and public engagement uh
 
00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:27.180 align:start position:0%
we've had a law firmer of Duncan
 
00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
Weinberg ginser and Pembroke as our
 
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
general counsel they were originally
 
00:55:34.990 --> 00:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
selected through competitive RFQ process
 
00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
when we were first working on developing
 
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
our jpa and a couple of startup
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
consultants and also a specialized bank
 
00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:44.940 align:start position:0%
that specializes in what's called
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
multi-party lock box which provides
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
additional credit support and we're now
 
00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
in the process of working with true
 
00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
search to identify and hire our first
 
00:55:55.609 --> 00:55:55.619 align:start position:0%
staff person a full-time CEO with
 
00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
additional staff in the future this is
 
00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
just sort of an orc shock we're
 
00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
accountable to our communities the
 
00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
governing bodies appoint the board
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
member representatives to constitute the
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
board of directors we've had a number of
 
00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
operational committees we have a few
 
00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
more to stand up
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
um and it's you know until we have a CEO
 
00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sort of in the middle of it as the
 
00:56:19.609 --> 00:56:19.619 align:start position:0%
board chair I really look forward to
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
getting a CEO on board because this role
 
00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
has become a full-time volunteer job
 
00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
um uh but you know we have the power
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
agency operations and it eventually will
 
00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:31.740 align:start position:0%
um and so we have a lot of people
 
00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:34.380 align:start position:0%
working to help make this happen I am
 
00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
not going to go into this slide but it
 
00:56:38.329 --> 00:56:38.339 align:start position:0%
does provide a breakdown into some of
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
the detail cells of the kind of services
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
that we are both contracted for the
 
00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:44.700 align:start position:0%
black text and the blue text as things
 
00:56:46.849 --> 00:56:46.859 align:start position:0%
that we hope to achieve over the course
 
00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:48.260 align:start position:0%
of time
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
the technical assessment
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
um uh on the lower left you can see
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
um I hope you know that's the hundred
 
00:56:58.069 --> 00:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
different scenarios with probably the
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
blue line in the middle representing
 
00:57:03.049 --> 00:57:03.059 align:start position:0%
What's called the p50 probability case
 
00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:04.980 align:start position:0%
um uh you know it's sort of the midpoint
 
00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
of of the modeling and that is showing
 
00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
up the the build up the cash reserves
 
00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:12.540 align:start position:0%
over time and you'll see a seasonal dip
 
00:57:14.569 --> 00:57:14.579 align:start position:0%
with winners because you know part of
 
00:57:16.849 --> 00:57:16.859 align:start position:0%
this in standing this up is to create a
 
00:57:19.250 --> 00:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
financial reserves so that we can you
 
00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
know you have to use that to stabilize
 
00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
prices through the winter when costs are
 
00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
highest but also to provide stability
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
and unexpected events
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
um there there's a whole lot to this
 
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
technical analysis but and uh but but
 
00:57:35.210 --> 00:57:35.220 align:start position:0%
essentially and this has already been
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
updated once so we're about to release a
 
00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
revised version of this because this was
 
00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:40.730 align:start position:0%
done back in December
 
00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:42.309 align:start position:0%
done back in December
[Music]

00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
but the the bottom line is it shows that
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
we seem to have a business model that's
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
going to be quite viable
 
00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
um oops wrong direction
 
00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I show all the stress
 
00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
tests that were done but basically we
 
00:57:59.690 --> 00:57:59.700 align:start position:0%
did about 14 scenarios I'm not sure I
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
put all those slides in here off of that
 
00:58:04.790 --> 00:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
um but this serves a shows a breakdown
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
of what the revenue uh picture would
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
look like
 
00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:10.980 align:start position:0%
um the vast majority the Orange is the
 
00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
or yellow is the energy cost
 
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
um for the project there's capacity cost
 
00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
um in the wholesale Market RPS
 
00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:24.200 align:start position:0%
compliance costs some other things uh
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
operating costs very small
 
00:58:32.589 --> 00:58:32.599 align:start position:0%
um are deferred compensation uh
 
00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
for startup cost works out to less than
 
00:58:41.329 --> 00:58:41.339 align:start position:0%
1 100 of one percent so that's uh not
 
00:58:43.370 --> 00:58:43.380 align:start position:0%
one tenth of a sentence
 
00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
um one uh
 
00:58:49.849 --> 00:58:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
to that's just 0.01 percent of Revenue
 
00:58:55.370 --> 00:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
is 0.02 percent of revenues it's it's a
 
00:58:56.809 --> 00:58:56.819 align:start position:0%
small number
 
00:58:59.870 --> 00:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
um and so you know we happen to be in a
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
situation where prices have actually
 
00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
dropped rather dramatically since
 
00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
December so the utilities have walked in
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
relatively High rates so you'll see that
 
00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
the first period uh potentially March or
 
00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:13.380 align:start position:0%
April April really through through July
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
the green bar show there's there's a lot
 
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
of Headroom even if we offer a discount
 
00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:20.220 align:start position:0%
and and um we haven't decided what the
 
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
discount is off of the utility rate but
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
but it'll be significant and uh there's
 
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to build up some reserves
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
because market prices are so much lower
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
but that also puts us subject to
 
00:59:32.809 --> 00:59:32.819 align:start position:0%
competition retail customers are finding
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
that they can now get private contracts
 
00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:37.740 align:start position:0%
uh that that beat the default service
 
00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
rate as well so we'll be operating in a
 
00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
competitive environment that provides a
 
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
certain amount of fiscal discipline
 
00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
um local project context the inflation
 
00:59:50.450 --> 00:59:50.460 align:start position:0%
reduction act provides a lot of
 
00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
increased incentives which can be
 
00:59:54.289 --> 00:59:54.299 align:start position:0%
monetizable by municipalities and
 
00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
non-profits so there's a lot of
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh particularly there's a
 
00:59:59.690 --> 00:59:59.700 align:start position:0%
bill that came through this committee
 
01:00:01.970 --> 01:00:01.980 align:start position:0%
last year Senate Bill 321 which enabled
 
01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
some Pilots
 
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
um that still and process the POC
 
01:00:07.809 --> 01:00:07.819 align:start position:0%
looking at the
 
01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:09.900 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional issues but potentially
 
01:00:12.589 --> 01:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
that is is a big benefit there are
 
01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
adders for Brownfield sites or projects
 
01:00:19.609 --> 01:00:19.619 align:start position:0%
that benefit low-income communities in
 
01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
terms of the monetizable tax credits
 
01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:25.260 align:start position:0%
um and uh the the the the the some of
 
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
that picture shows some of these areas
 
01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
uh where there's additional incentives
 
01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
available for various reasons
 
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
um just a quick overview of the process
 
01:00:38.049 --> 01:00:38.059 align:start position:0%
for Community to launch the excellent
 
01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
Coalition agreements authorized
 
01:00:41.809 --> 01:00:41.819 align:start position:0%
procurement select rates and launch
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the step that the wave
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
one communities are in right now uh the
 
01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
steps that we've been through
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
um most recently eight communities have
 
01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
so far approved the cost sharing
 
01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
agreement the complete service bundle
 
01:00:56.690 --> 01:00:56.700 align:start position:0%
and all the policies that we need to get
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
going and we're and we're working to to
 
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
make that happen
 
01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
um we're about to launch public
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
engagement campaigns for the different
 
01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:07.980 align:start position:0%
Community power programs these are some
 
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
of the logos that have been developed
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
the enabling agreements the kind of work
 
01:01:15.289 --> 01:01:15.299 align:start position:0%
with each other
 
01:01:17.089 --> 01:01:17.099 align:start position:0%
um our energy portfolio risk management
 
01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:19.140 align:start position:0%
policy retail rates policy financial
 
01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:22.260 align:start position:0%
reserve policies sort of create create a
 
01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
a setup a framework to to manage this
 
01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:28.140 align:start position:0%
prudently and that flows into cost share
 
01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
carrying agreement and in the member
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
services contract so that this is sort
 
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
of equity herbal and durable based on
 
01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:36.180 align:start position:0%
best practices from all the other
 
01:01:38.450 --> 01:01:38.460 align:start position:0%
experience I'm just going to race
 
01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:39.900 align:start position:0%
through some reference slides to
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
acquaint with you with those and then we
 
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
I can pause and have any questions that
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
you might have
 
01:01:48.829 --> 01:01:48.839 align:start position:0%
um our startup team this is a theme
 
01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
that's been with us for over a year now
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
um uh clean energy New Hampshire is
 
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
providing some specific limited Services
 
01:01:59.809 --> 01:01:59.819 align:start position:0%
under a contract uh River City Bank has
 
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
this specialized structure uh that that
 
01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
we're about to go live with the energy
 
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:07.980 align:start position:0%
risk management team from Ascend
 
01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:09.470 align:start position:0%

um

01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
and that what they do they offer really
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
state-of-the-art portfolio risk
 
01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:19.380 align:start position:0%
management software oops and we'll be
 
01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:20.450 align:start position:0%
management software oops and we'll be
using

01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
using
 
01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
um uh several of these products
 
01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:25.980 align:start position:0%
um their portfolio uh uh Power portfolio
 
01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
manager as well as their spark bidding
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
and scheduling software and eventually
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
the power planner software is to help
 
01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
evaluate potential projects
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
um and of course they do Market you know
 
01:02:42.109 --> 01:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
Intelligence on a view of the New
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
England Market their their software
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
incorporates a detailed view of the
 
01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:48.839 align:start position:0%
Dynamics of the market I I won't go into
 
01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
detail on this but
 
01:02:53.450 --> 01:02:53.460 align:start position:0%
um it is it's it's it's it's an approach
 
01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:02:59.210 --> 01:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
really pretty much state of the art
 
01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
which is what attracted them to us and
 
01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:03.410 align:start position:0%
which is what attracted them to us and
um uh

01:03:03.410 --> 01:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:03:06.289 --> 01:03:06.299 align:start position:0%
uh uh and what and they were attracted
 
01:03:07.789 --> 01:03:07.799 align:start position:0%
to the model that we've created here
 
01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
with the legislative and Regulatory
 
01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:11.210 align:start position:0%
with the legislative and Regulatory
structure

01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:11.220 align:start position:0%
structure
 
01:03:13.069 --> 01:03:13.079 align:start position:0%
um if you go to their website you'll see
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
the broad range of entities that
 
01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:17.220 align:start position:0%
contract for their services including
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
ISO New England and a lot of utilities
 
01:03:25.069 --> 01:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
um Calpine is the predominant provider
 
01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:27.780 align:start position:0%
they felt launch over 20 CPA joint power
 
01:03:30.049 --> 01:03:30.059 align:start position:0%
agencies like the Coalition in
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
California serving over 4 million uh
 
01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:34.609 align:start position:0%
California serving over 4 million uh
customers

01:03:34.609 --> 01:03:34.619 align:start position:0%
customers
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
um have a dedicated call center of all
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
U.S based employees it happens to be an
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
IBEW Union shop but they specialize in
 
01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:47.099 align:start position:0%
the community power model so that
 
01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
they'll be uh people who who are good
 
01:03:53.089 --> 01:03:53.099 align:start position:0%
customer support people
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
um they you know do provide the EDI
 
01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
transactions and so forth there's
 
01:03:59.270 --> 01:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
there's more detail on the kind of
 
01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
services they'll be providing here
 
01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:04.140 align:start position:0%
value-added data services ultimately
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
they've helped do recurve analytics
 
01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
planner and a demand Flex Market which
 
01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:15.660 align:start position:0%
is to say uh in the California ISO
 
01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
context and there's some of this in New
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
England although we're still I have a
 
01:04:22.450 --> 01:04:22.460 align:start position:0%
lot of opportunity here where you can
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
harness a lot of distributed energy
 
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
resources both storage generation and
 
01:04:31.549 --> 01:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
demand response to help lower the peak
 
01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:34.140 align:start position:0%
demand at critical times
 
01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
um so that that's part of what they do
 
01:04:39.289 --> 01:04:39.299 align:start position:0%
and I'm just going to conclude with a
 
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
few slides that sort of illustrate the
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
challenge in New England
 
01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:46.250 align:start position:0%
that we have
um

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:46.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
and this is a slide from a storage study
 
01:04:51.289 --> 01:04:51.299 align:start position:0%
from a few years back in in
 
01:04:53.210 --> 01:04:53.220 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but what it illustrates
 
01:04:56.270 --> 01:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
this is a a one-year period with the ups
 
01:04:59.690 --> 01:04:59.700 align:start position:0%
and down of uh the power hourly demand
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
um and you can see the summer The
 
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
Summer's in the middle of that
 
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
um and the peak hits that red line and
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
that's the peak demand and so the entire
 
01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
Energy System transmission distribution
 
01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
and generation has to be sized to meet
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
that uh Peak Demand with the safety
 
01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:18.770 align:start position:0%
that uh Peak Demand with the safety
margin

01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
margin
 
01:05:20.809 --> 01:05:20.819 align:start position:0%
um and most of the cost in the whole
 
01:05:22.730 --> 01:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
Electric System are these fixed asset
 
01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
costs it's it's it's not the fuel to run
 
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
generation it's the capacity to meet
 
01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
Peak demand
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
um so a key Dynamic that has been
 
01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:35.700 align:start position:0%
occurring over time in New England
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
um is is a shift in What's called the
 
01:05:40.849 --> 01:05:40.859 align:start position:0%
load duration curve it's also can be
 
01:05:43.609 --> 01:05:43.619 align:start position:0%
called an asset utilization rate this is
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
taking all the hours of a given year in
 
01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you're inserting them from
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
the highest hours of demand to the
 
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
lowest hours of demand and you can see
 
01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
the Steep part of the curve of high
 
01:05:54.849 --> 01:05:54.859 align:start position:0%
demand is
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
is quite steep so the top five percent
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
of demand was just for uh five tenths of
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
a percent of the hours for just 48 Hours
 
01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
the top ten ten percent of the demand
 
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
was for just over one percent of the
 
01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.190 align:start position:0%
was for just over one percent of the
hours

01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
hours
 
01:06:12.890 --> 01:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
um and what's significant is going back
 
01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
the decading in 2000 we had an average
 
01:06:18.829 --> 01:06:18.839 align:start position:0%
um asset utilization rate of 67 percent
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
meaning on average the load was 67
 
01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
percent of our capacity
 
01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
um but over the ensuing decade it
 
01:06:30.049 --> 01:06:30.059 align:start position:0%
dropped to 57 percent meaning we became
 
01:06:32.270 --> 01:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
a peak year region in fact the most
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
peaky region in the entire country
 
01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
um in part because we have just as
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
intense heat waves as down south or out
 
01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
west but they don't persist for very
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
long so we get these big spikes and air
 
01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
conditioning loads in the summertime
 
01:06:49.549 --> 01:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
from hot weather but the declining asset
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
utilization rates meaning we're
 
01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
spreading the fixed cost of all that
 
01:06:56.569 --> 01:06:56.579 align:start position:0%
capacity over fewer kilowatt hours so
 
01:06:59.089 --> 01:06:59.099 align:start position:0%
the cost per kilowatt hour has gone up
 
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799 align:start position:0%
and now this is my final slide or next
 
01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
to final
 
01:07:05.089 --> 01:07:05.099 align:start position:0%
um which is the so-called duck curve and
 
01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
and this is an actual hour of of New
 
01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
England's load
 
01:07:13.309 --> 01:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
um the black line and as we've added
 
01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
more solar in the middle of the day
 
01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
um those lines have been dropping this
 
01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:19.260 align:start position:0%
is from an ISO New England projection
 
01:07:21.529 --> 01:07:21.539 align:start position:0%
from a few years back or almost a decade
 
01:07:21.539 --> 01:07:22.970 align:start position:0%
from a few years back or almost a decade
ago

01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
um of and we're actually sort of in the
 
01:07:27.849 --> 01:07:27.859 align:start position:0%
middle of that yellow to Orange to Red
 
01:07:30.049 --> 01:07:30.059 align:start position:0%
dip in the middle of the day typically
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
from solar that is uh producing in the
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
middle of the day and then we typically
 
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
have a peak in the evening and the
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
question is can we provide the right
 
01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
price signals the price right sort of
 
01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
structural elements so that we have
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
appropriate incentives to shift load off
 
01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
a peak particularly as we add new
 
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
flexible loads electric vehicles uh
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
buildings the the inflation reduction
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
acts as incentives for thermal energy
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
storage for air conditioning loads for
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
instance where you could make ice
 
01:08:03.410 --> 01:08:03.420 align:start position:0%
there's this is a commercial you know
 
01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:05.700 align:start position:0%
well commercialized product use your air
 
01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
conditioning system uh on the far left
 
01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
side of the graph when demand is load to
 
01:08:13.849 --> 01:08:13.859 align:start position:0%
charge up a block of ice that you can
 
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
then use to pull off of to meet your
 
01:08:18.769 --> 01:08:18.779 align:start position:0%
building air conditioning load at the in
 
01:08:22.249 --> 01:08:22.259 align:start position:0%
the in the peak and and or can we use
 
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
solar which is in Surplus in the middle
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
of the day use it to charge storage and
 
01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
use that to discharge that storage uh
 
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
and and demand response at that peak
 
01:08:35.209 --> 01:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
time so that's that's part of our
 
01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
Challenge and what we would like to see
 
01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
the vision that we have is that
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
Community powered generators battery
 
01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
storage demand response programs can
 
01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:47.470 align:start position:0%
storage demand response programs can
help

01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
help
 
01:08:50.329 --> 01:08:50.339 align:start position:0%
shave those Peaks fill those valleys and
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
lower the cost per kilowatt hour for all
 
01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:55.140 align:start position:0%
this installed capacity and to do so
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
under State jurisdictional Interstate
 
01:08:59.390 --> 01:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
Market that works in coordinate Nation
 
01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
with the first jurisdictional interstate
 
01:09:05.450 --> 01:09:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:07.070 align:start position:0%
 
wow

01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
wow
 
01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:09.900 align:start position:0%
it was like consuming information from a
 
01:09:12.769 --> 01:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
fire hose Cliff but we're used to that
 
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
with you so we thank you for that
 
01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
excellent presentation I'm going to
 
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
start off the questioning here by
 
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
asking this question
 
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
one of this
 
01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
primary selling points for the community
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
power Coalition is that it will lower
 
01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:30.289 align:start position:0%
power Coalition is that it will lower
costs

01:09:30.289 --> 01:09:30.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:34.010 --> 01:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
you showed us one slide about all the
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
different Community power organizations
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
in California
 
01:09:40.370 --> 01:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
but California has a reputation for
 
01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
hiring having some of the highest costs
 
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
well it's a big state
 
01:09:57.290 --> 01:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:59.390 align:start position:0%
um and
um

01:09:59.390 --> 01:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
in general the the Community Choice
 
01:10:04.729 --> 01:10:04.739 align:start position:0%
aggregations are offering a lower price
 
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
on average than the utilities it's a
 
01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:09.780 align:start position:0%
little complicated because the utilities
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
still owns some a generation or had
 
01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
contracts for it so as they have a
 
01:10:19.130 --> 01:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
complex overlay of when customers depart
 
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
they're able to charge some of that back
 
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
to the Community Choice aggregation to
 
01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:24.290 align:start position:0%
to the Community Choice aggregation to
recoup

01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
recoup
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
but what would otherwise be stranded
 
01:10:26.159 --> 01:10:27.649 align:start position:0%
but what would otherwise be stranded
cost

01:10:27.649 --> 01:10:27.659 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:10:27.659 --> 01:10:28.450 align:start position:0%
cost
um

01:10:28.450 --> 01:10:28.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:30.169 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:10:30.169 --> 01:10:30.179 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:30.179 --> 01:10:31.490 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:10:31.490 --> 01:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:33.900 align:start position:0%
I you know I would just observe that
 
01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:34.910 align:start position:0%
I you know I would just observe that
like

01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:38.209 align:start position:0%
like
us

01:10:38.209 --> 01:10:38.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:38.219 --> 01:10:39.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:43.630 --> 01:10:43.640 align:start position:0%
you know I think there to some extent
 
01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
out on the edge of the pipelines if you
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
will I I
 
01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
um I and so
 
01:10:54.890 --> 01:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
in California they just historically had
 
01:10:57.290 --> 01:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
high prices but the joint power agencies
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
the ccas are competing with that and
 
01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
what they're doing and one of the things
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
that has attracted us to send analytics
 
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
is their robust way of evaluating
 
01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
proposed deals both the credit risk of
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
the counterparty the performance risk of
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
the counterparty but also the economics
 
01:11:17.570 --> 01:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
of it and at this point the joint power
 
01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
agencies feel like they're making
 
01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
decisions that are going to help
 
01:11:24.050 --> 01:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
stabilize those long-term power costs
 
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
um through
 
01:11:27.970 --> 01:11:27.980 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:11:31.610 --> 01:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
you know the various mechanisms
 
01:11:34.010 --> 01:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
you know but but I can't I don't I don't
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not a student of that market in
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
detail to understand all the factors
 
01:11:41.209 --> 01:11:41.219 align:start position:0%
that have gone into their relatively
 
01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:42.900 align:start position:0%
high prices although I don't know that
 
01:11:44.689 --> 01:11:44.699 align:start position:0%
they're much higher than we are
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
um at this point but obviously they've
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
also had a huge amount of weather
 
01:11:51.649 --> 01:11:51.659 align:start position:0%
influence climate influenced uh events
 
01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
uh that have caused a huge cost to
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
invest in distribution infrastructure
 
01:11:59.930 --> 01:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
because stuff is burned down and
 
01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:00.590 align:start position:0%
because stuff is burned down and
um

01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:04.370 --> 01:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
uh you know had had to be rebuilt
 
01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
so my follow-up question would be what
 
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
do you see as the key cost saving
 
01:12:14.689 --> 01:12:14.699 align:start position:0%
structures within the community power
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
Coalition I think the biggest element is
 
01:12:20.810 --> 01:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
having active portfolio management
 
01:12:23.770 --> 01:12:23.780 align:start position:0%
um uh that is very much risk informed
 
01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
meaning that in both the utility current
 
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
model as well as the broker model is
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
load is going out to bid for a fixed
 
01:12:37.610 --> 01:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
term at a particular point in time the
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
broker model is able to pick and choose
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
when they go to market although once a
 
01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
contract is expired they you know have
 
01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
to go to market again at the end of that
 
01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
contract expiration
 
01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
but through that mechanism alone perhaps
 
01:12:52.729 --> 01:12:52.739 align:start position:0%
they've been able to come up with better
 
01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
better rates just by being able to have
 
01:12:57.649 --> 01:12:57.659 align:start position:0%
flexibility when they play the market if
 
01:12:58.930 --> 01:12:58.940 align:start position:0%
you will
 
01:13:01.729 --> 01:13:01.739 align:start position:0%
portfolio risk management is an ongoing
 
01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:04.020 align:start position:0%
process where we're
 
01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
not probably board members but are
 
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
contractors in analytics and eventually
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
in-house staff will be looking at our
 
01:13:13.850 --> 01:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
portfolio and what's going on in the
 
01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:15.900 align:start position:0%
market every single day it'll be
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
actively managed on a daily basis with
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
adjusting our positions in various ways
 
01:13:24.890 --> 01:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
both physical and financial hedging
 
01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
um and the the long
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
term value proposition is I think to
 
01:13:36.770 --> 01:13:36.780 align:start position:0%
look at where we can engage in local
 
01:13:38.890 --> 01:13:38.900 align:start position:0%
projects and local
 
01:13:42.530 --> 01:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
demand response such that we're able to
 
01:13:45.709 --> 01:13:45.719 align:start position:0%
bring on new power from Transportation
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
electrification perhaps more beat
 
01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
building uh thermal loads
 
01:13:52.669 --> 01:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
um being electrified so we're able to
 
01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
bring on more of that but manage the
 
01:13:57.770 --> 01:13:57.780 align:start position:0%
peak demand so that we are helping to
 
01:13:59.870 --> 01:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
spread those costs over over more
 
01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours if you will
 
01:14:06.490 --> 01:14:06.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:09.649 --> 01:14:09.659 align:start position:0%
what what has been shown is that where
 
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
these things are enabled there is
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
actually a lot of demand response
 
01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
capability and if if demand
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
and storage can respond to very
 
01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
short-term price signals they can pull
 
01:14:23.149 --> 01:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
down those prices at the high end and
 
01:14:24.530 --> 01:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
actually pull them up a little bit at
 
01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
the low end although pulling down at the
 
01:14:28.189 --> 01:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
high end is more dramatic than pulling
 
01:14:31.010 --> 01:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
up at the low end uh meaning if we shift
 
01:14:33.530 --> 01:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
load into low demand hours it actually
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
raises the clearing price but because of
 
01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
the supply demand curve you know there's
 
01:14:41.330 --> 01:14:41.340 align:start position:0%
a the everyday generators and storage
 
01:14:43.850 --> 01:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
bids into the iso New England market and
 
01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
there's a bit Stark and the lower end of
 
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
that is small steps and when you get
 
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
towards higher demand the steps go up
 
01:14:51.410 --> 01:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
really quick so if you can shave those
 
01:14:53.810 --> 01:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
Peaks and fill them in The Valleys you
 
01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
see you have much bigger reduction in
 
01:14:58.250 --> 01:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
the in reducing costs at the high end
 
01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
than you see in bringing the cost up at
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
the low end
 
01:15:04.010 --> 01:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
um so so that is a way in which there's
 
01:15:05.570 --> 01:15:05.580 align:start position:0%
ultimately a lot more value to be
 
01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:07.250 align:start position:0%
ultimately a lot more value to be
realized

01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
realized
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
another attractive
 
01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
aspect of
 
01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
the community power Coalition is the
 
01:15:16.490 --> 01:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
fact that it's a non-profit entity
 
01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
does your contracts with companies like
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
Ascend and Calpine which are undoubtedly
 
01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
for-profit companies dilute
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
at all the attractiveness of that
 
01:15:30.530 --> 01:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
non-profit nature
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
it does a little bit you know we're
 
01:15:35.090 --> 01:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
paying more for their services than we
 
01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
would if we could do it in-house
 
01:15:39.890 --> 01:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
fortunately uh both of them are
 
01:15:41.630 --> 01:15:41.640 align:start position:0%
accustomed to a model that they've
 
01:15:44.450 --> 01:15:44.460 align:start position:0%
experienced in California of
 
01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:45.370 align:start position:0%
experienced in California of
um

01:15:45.370 --> 01:15:45.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
transferring and we've built it into our
 
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
contracts that over time
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
we can transfer to more of that in-house
 
01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:55.140 align:start position:0%
and develop and replace their credit
 
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
support with our credit support So once
 
01:15:59.209 --> 01:15:59.219 align:start position:0%
we have Financial reserves and a track
 
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
record we'll actually be able to lower
 
01:16:04.130 --> 01:16:04.140 align:start position:0%
our financing costs our our credit
 
01:16:06.530 --> 01:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
support uh compared to what we're having
 
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
to pay for it from for-profit entities
 
01:16:11.570 --> 01:16:11.580 align:start position:0%
if you will the other analogy here is
 
01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:12.900 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire electric car but
 
01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I don't have the slide on
 
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
that but over the past decade they do
 
01:16:19.370 --> 01:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
active portfolio management which they
 
01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
have a small staff that's looking at the
 
01:16:24.169 --> 01:16:24.179 align:start position:0%
market every day adjusting their
 
01:16:24.179 --> 01:16:25.669 align:start position:0%
market every day adjusting their
position

01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:16:29.390 --> 01:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
um and they have achieved on average
 
01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
something I can't remember the number so
 
01:16:33.290 --> 01:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
don't quote me on this something like a
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
16 average lower default service rate uh
 
01:16:39.709 --> 01:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
than the investor in utilities through
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
the fixed price procurement but there's
 
01:16:44.090 --> 01:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
risk with that too I mean part of the
 
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
nature of this is there are risk when
 
01:16:49.610 --> 01:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
you start managing a portfolio the way
 
01:16:51.410 --> 01:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
the utilities do it there's no risk to
 
01:16:52.669 --> 01:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
the utility because they just go out to
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
bid on schedule but there's risk to the
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
customers because we end up paying
 
01:16:58.990 --> 01:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
really high prices for periods of time
 
01:17:02.450 --> 01:17:02.460 align:start position:0%
so so ultimately I mean there there's
 
01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
not there's more than a zero percent
 
01:17:07.490 --> 01:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
chance that that we may someday fail
 
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
um but we're structured so we insulate
 
01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
that from our member communities there's
 
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
no recourse back to the taxpayers of the
 
01:17:15.649 --> 01:17:15.659 align:start position:0%
communities except for the rates we
 
01:17:15.659 --> 01:17:16.669 align:start position:0%
communities except for the rates we
charge

01:17:16.669 --> 01:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
charge
 
01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:18.060 align:start position:0%
um but so there's also a good chance
 
01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:21.060 align:start position:0%
that you know we see the opportunity to
 
01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
succeed and that's what we're going to
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
try to do
 
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
to be a representative Reynolds has a
 
01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:26.330 align:start position:0%
to be a representative Reynolds has a
question

01:17:26.330 --> 01:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:17:29.450 --> 01:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
no representative uh Carmen has a
 
01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:30.590 align:start position:0%
no representative uh Carmen has a
question

01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:33.659 align:start position:0%
again for taking my question this is
 
01:17:35.689 --> 01:17:35.699 align:start position:0%
actually a three-part question but the
 
01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
second two depend on the first so I'm in
 
01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
Lebanon and we're going to be online
 
01:17:40.679 --> 01:17:41.870 align:start position:0%
Lebanon and we're going to be online
soon

01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
soon
 
01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
now my understanding is that not only is
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
it opt out but that I will have a choice
 
01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
of getting power from renewable sources
 
01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
okay good so
 
01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:54.179 align:start position:0%
next two parts
 
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
is there a price differential for that
 
01:18:00.530 --> 01:18:00.540 align:start position:0%
compared with other sources and then is
 
01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
that going to be a model available in
 
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
other communities as well beyond Lebanon
 
01:18:07.370 --> 01:18:07.380 align:start position:0%
um we're we're expecting at this point
 
01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
to launch with four products
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
um and they're we're calling the first
 
01:18:15.310 --> 01:18:15.320 align:start position:0%
two Granite basic and granite plus
 
01:18:18.649 --> 01:18:18.659 align:start position:0%
Granite basic would just match the
 
01:18:20.810 --> 01:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
minimum RPS compliance so that'll be the
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
lowest cost product
 
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh Granite plus which which right now
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
that's around 23 24
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
renewable uh component
 
01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
um Granite plus would be 33 or about 10
 
01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
percent more we expect that we'll also
 
01:18:40.370 --> 01:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
be under the default service price
 
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
although how much we don't know and
 
01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
that's that's going to be achieved by a
 
01:18:46.370 --> 01:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
combination of renewable energy credits
 
01:18:49.010 --> 01:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
and what are called ibts internal
 
01:18:52.490 --> 01:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
bilateral transactions with large hydro
 
01:18:55.010 --> 01:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
and carbon free so we're building that
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
as 30 percent 33 renewable or carbon
 
01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
free Carbon free is large hydro and and
 
01:19:03.890 --> 01:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
nuclear basically in New England and you
 
01:19:06.050 --> 01:19:06.060 align:start position:0%
you can actually do what's called an a
 
01:19:08.090 --> 01:19:08.100 align:start position:0%
contract where you're actually buying
 
01:19:11.090 --> 01:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
the output of that that is used to
 
01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
offset your you know it's part of your
 
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
settlement with ISO New England
 
01:19:16.729 --> 01:19:16.739 align:start position:0%
um and so likewise we'll be doing a
 
01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
clean 50 and a clean 100 which is 50 to
 
01:19:22.669 --> 01:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
100 renewable or clean energy those we
 
01:19:24.770 --> 01:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
expect to be more expensive because we
 
01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
have to buy more wrecks
 
01:19:29.810 --> 01:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
um uh uh than the default service price
 
01:19:31.729 --> 01:19:31.739 align:start position:0%
but it would give people the option to
 
01:19:34.729 --> 01:19:34.739 align:start position:0%
up upgrade to 50 to 100 renewable what
 
01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
that means is that we either through
 
01:19:40.030 --> 01:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
direct bilateral contracts or through
 
01:19:43.010 --> 01:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
acquiring renewable energy credits we
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
are offsetting that portion of your load
 
01:19:47.090 --> 01:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
with renewable or clean energy that's
 
01:19:49.010 --> 01:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
putting into the grid
 
01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair this is
 
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
regarding uh slide 44 which um is the
 
01:20:01.810 --> 01:20:01.820 align:start position:0%
peak demand slide and the date on it is
 
01:20:04.370 --> 01:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
2016. we've been hearing information
 
01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:06.719 align:start position:0%
that the peak demand is moving to the
 
01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
winter in New Hampshire
 
01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:12.300 align:start position:0%
um and so this is quite outdated are you
 
01:20:14.090 --> 01:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
finding that the peak load for for this
 
01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
is moving to the winter months and is
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
that affecting what you offer and how
 
01:20:19.790 --> 01:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
you how you approach it
 
01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:23.390 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
I I think there has been that Trend
 
01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
um and part of it is the increase of uh
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
heat pumps
 
01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
um and that's expected to kind of
 
01:20:33.649 --> 01:20:33.659 align:start position:0%
continue although air conditioning loads
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
may also continue to grow in the summer
 
01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:36.950 align:start position:0%
may also continue to grow in the summer
months

01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
months
 
01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:37.850 align:start position:0%
months
um

01:20:37.850 --> 01:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:40.370 --> 01:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
and I mean this happens I don't know
 
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
this may have been even Massachusetts
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
data yeah I think this was actually
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts data but it doesn't look
 
01:20:48.890 --> 01:20:48.900 align:start position:0%
that different uh for New Hampshire
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
specific or more recent data you can see
 
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
at the very far left and Far Right edge
 
01:20:55.490 --> 01:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
of the graph there's there's some high
 
01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
particularly on the left which is
 
01:20:59.930 --> 01:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
January and February that year you can
 
01:21:01.970 --> 01:21:01.980 align:start position:0%
see some relatively high prices and you
 
01:21:04.370 --> 01:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
can see the dip in the spring as well as
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
in the fall
 
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:06.709 align:start position:0%
in the fall
um

01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:08.570 --> 01:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
uh but yeah I think that's going to
 
01:21:11.090 --> 01:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
affect how this is is thought about and
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
I think they'll be increasing a thought
 
01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:15.719 align:start position:0%
about you know even even for those
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
heating demands if there's storage
 
01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
opportunities for that traditionally
 
01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
there have been ways to um
 
01:21:24.530 --> 01:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
uh store
 
01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
um you know I
 
01:21:28.189 --> 01:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
for instance I have a buffer tank off of
 
01:21:30.290 --> 01:21:30.300 align:start position:0%
a pallet boiler but there's now
 
01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:32.940 align:start position:0%
um uh water uh air-to-water heat pumps
 
01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
coming online that could actually uh you
 
01:21:37.729 --> 01:21:37.739 align:start position:0%
could actually build up a store of hot
 
01:21:41.090 --> 01:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
water at those lower demand times and
 
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
then draw in that for both your domestic
 
01:21:45.290 --> 01:21:45.300 align:start position:0%
hot water and your heating load that's
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
that's a very commercially feasible
 
01:21:49.370 --> 01:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
technology if you had access to the
 
01:21:52.330 --> 01:21:52.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:54.890 --> 01:21:54.900 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
01:21:57.770 --> 01:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman in one of your one
 
01:21:59.570 --> 01:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
of your slides
 
01:22:02.209 --> 01:22:02.219 align:start position:0%
um I think you you showed that there was
 
01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
a potential
 
01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:05.149 align:start position:0%
a potential
for

01:22:05.149 --> 01:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
um you to become a even larger supplier
 
01:22:08.159 --> 01:22:09.410 align:start position:0%
um you to become a even larger supplier
than

01:22:09.410 --> 01:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:22:12.770 --> 01:22:12.780 align:start position:0%
um the utilities eversource I think
 
01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:14.390 align:start position:0%
um the utilities eversource I think
um

01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:17.209 --> 01:22:17.219 align:start position:0%
given the fact that you're relying on
 
01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
the utilities eversource you until
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
Liberty for distribution
 
01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:24.169 align:start position:0%
Liberty for distribution
um

01:22:24.169 --> 01:22:24.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:27.770 --> 01:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
it do you foresee at some point that you
 
01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
know you may have to get into the
 
01:22:32.330 --> 01:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
distribution business
 
01:22:34.130 --> 01:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
um simply because it's not going to be
 
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
economically viable for those utilities
 
01:22:38.810 --> 01:22:38.820 align:start position:0%
to continue to provide that service well
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
I think the actual utilities are quite
 
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.729 align:start position:0%
I think the actual utilities are quite
ambivalent

01:22:43.729 --> 01:22:43.739 align:start position:0%
ambivalent
 
01:22:47.149 --> 01:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
about their role in power supply meaning
 
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
they don't they don't make a profit on
 
01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
their power procurement for default
 
01:22:54.290 --> 01:22:54.300 align:start position:0%
service it's a they get to pass through
 
01:22:56.330 --> 01:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
their cost so they recover their cost
 
01:22:58.850 --> 01:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
they account for their cost of issuing
 
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
the RFP evaluating the RFP the time at
 
01:23:04.330 --> 01:23:04.340 align:start position:0%
the puc getting it approved
 
01:23:07.610 --> 01:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
but they don't make a profit on it what
 
01:23:10.729 --> 01:23:10.739 align:start position:0%
they make a profit on is investment in
 
01:23:14.090 --> 01:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
in distribution facilities
 
01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
um and that's really the business
 
01:23:18.890 --> 01:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
they're in now now I I would say that I
 
01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
think some of the utilities have mixed
 
01:23:22.189 --> 01:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
feelings about this some of them are
 
01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:24.060 align:start position:0%
indicating they'd like to be in charge
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
of developing distributed energy
 
01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:27.830 align:start position:0%
of developing distributed energy
resources

01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:29.149 align:start position:0%
resources
um and

01:23:29.149 --> 01:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:23:31.250 --> 01:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
um you know there's a proposal right now
 
01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
for Unitil develop a 4.99 uh uh megawatt
 
01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
solar project possibly with storage
 
01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
um based on the same kind of value stack
 
01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
that we were looking at it at Senate
 
01:23:46.729 --> 01:23:46.739 align:start position:0%
Bill 321 and they're saying this can
 
01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
provide benefits to you know all the
 
01:23:50.810 --> 01:23:50.820 align:start position:0%
customers because it's actually a lower
 
01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
cost option than than the market price
 
01:23:55.010 --> 01:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
of electricity and it lowers
 
01:23:58.010 --> 01:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
transmission costs and so forth
 
01:23:58.020 --> 01:23:59.390 align:start position:0%
transmission costs and so forth
um

01:23:59.390 --> 01:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:01.250 --> 01:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
so what's my point
 
01:24:05.090 --> 01:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
um um I'm sorry uh
 
01:24:07.010 --> 01:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
that happens to me all the time yeah
 
01:24:08.990 --> 01:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
your question again
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
um I was concerned that I was concerned
 
01:24:12.239 --> 01:24:13.189 align:start position:0%
um I was concerned that I was concerned
that

01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:24:13.199 --> 01:24:14.090 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:24:14.090 --> 01:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:15.729 --> 01:24:15.739 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:24:21.229 --> 01:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
a situation may develop where utilities
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
are oh yeah are not interested in
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
providing distribution well yeah so I
 
01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:27.719 align:start position:0%
they I mean
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
so they don't I mean a couple of the
 
01:24:31.970 --> 01:24:31.980 align:start position:0%
utilities of including the cop have been
 
01:24:33.770 --> 01:24:33.780 align:start position:0%
quite encouraging
 
01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:35.820 align:start position:0%
um and saying that this is this is a
 
01:24:37.550 --> 01:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
model that seems to make sense for for
 
01:24:39.290 --> 01:24:39.300 align:start position:0%
the community I mean the co-op's an odd
 
01:24:41.149 --> 01:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
one because they keep telling us they
 
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
they you know want to help make this
 
01:24:45.169 --> 01:24:45.179 align:start position:0%
happen but in their case we kind of tell
 
01:24:46.729 --> 01:24:46.739 align:start position:0%
communities that have the co-op that
 
01:24:48.290 --> 01:24:48.300 align:start position:0%
you're probably best off just with the
 
01:24:49.370 --> 01:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
co-op we're probably not going to beat
 
01:24:51.229 --> 01:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
the co-op price and it is a
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
democratically managed organization and
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
they're doing some pretty cool things
 
01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
with a transactive energy pilot
 
01:24:59.810 --> 01:24:59.820 align:start position:0%
um but aside from that
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
um I what what I hope we you know we're
 
01:25:05.630 --> 01:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
we're in a little bit of uh issues with
 
01:25:08.030 --> 01:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
the utilities trying to work out our
 
01:25:09.890 --> 01:25:09.900 align:start position:0%
data needs and how this is all going to
 
01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:10.790 align:start position:0%
data needs and how this is all going to
work

01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:25:13.729 --> 01:25:13.739 align:start position:0%
um on the one hand and they really you
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
know want to control their metering
 
01:25:17.630 --> 01:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
systems and limit the options that we
 
01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
can do for billing but on the other hand
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh there's um we're I'm also working
 
01:25:24.770 --> 01:25:24.780 align:start position:0%
with the utilities on the data platform
 
01:25:26.930 --> 01:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
governance Council so there's also a
 
01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
sense that this is a opportunity for a
 
01:25:31.130 --> 01:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
new level of collaboration that could be
 
01:25:33.770 --> 01:25:33.780 align:start position:0%
very good for both the utilities and the
 
01:25:35.570 --> 01:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
local communities that they support over
 
01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:37.669 align:start position:0%
local communities that they support over
time

01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:25:37.679 --> 01:25:39.470 align:start position:0%
time
well

01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
it was an excellent session and we thank
 
01:25:44.630 --> 01:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
you Cliff for driving over here to be
 
01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
with us today
 
01:25:49.130 --> 01:25:49.140 align:start position:0%
and we're going to take a five or three
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
minute or five yeah five minute break
 
01:25:54.530 --> 01:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
before we start our public hearings on
 
01:25:58.490 --> 01:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
Senate bill on House Bill 418 so for the
 
01:26:00.770 --> 01:26:00.780 align:start position:0%
next five minutes we're in recess I
 
01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:02.940 align:start position:0%
encourage everybody to talk to Cliff
 
01:26:05.149 --> 01:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
offline he will send us this
 
01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:11.209 --> 01:26:11.219 align:start position:0%
uh we'll go from there so we're in
 
01:32:34.490 --> 01:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:58.450 --> 01:32:58.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:04.430 --> 01:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open the hill hearing on
 
01:33:10.490 --> 01:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
House Bill 419.
 
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
and before I introduce the 418 rather
 
01:33:17.149 --> 01:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
before I introduce the prime sponsor I
 
01:33:19.610 --> 01:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
want alert to alert everyone
 
01:33:21.890 --> 01:33:21.900 align:start position:0%
to the fact that if you want to speak on
 
01:33:22.850 --> 01:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:33:27.410 --> 01:33:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
including if you are the sponsor
 
01:33:32.810 --> 01:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
please submit a pink card these go into
 
01:33:35.330 --> 01:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
the official record that our clerk
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi keeps on every
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
bill so these pink cards need to be in
 
01:33:43.370 --> 01:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
the in the folder
 
01:33:47.570 --> 01:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
these pink cards also help us as we go
 
01:33:51.229 --> 01:33:51.239 align:start position:0%
through the hearing process decide
 
01:33:54.290 --> 01:33:54.300 align:start position:0%
how much time will be allocated to each
 
01:33:56.990 --> 01:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
speaker if we have a lot of pink cards
 
01:33:59.450 --> 01:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
then we'll have fewer
 
01:34:02.689 --> 01:34:02.699 align:start position:0%
minutes allocated to each speaker but we
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
can't make that decision until we get
 
01:34:07.370 --> 01:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
the pink card so I urge you all if
 
01:34:09.169 --> 01:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
you're interested in speaking
 
01:34:12.189 --> 01:34:12.199 align:start position:0%
thank you to
 
01:34:16.430 --> 01:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
01:34:20.689 --> 01:34:20.699 align:start position:0%
will now turn the floor over to the
 
01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of House Bill 418
 
01:34:29.950 --> 01:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:32.270 --> 01:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
thank you chair Bose
 
01:34:34.250 --> 01:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is representative
 
01:34:36.890 --> 01:34:36.900 align:start position:0%
Rebecca McWilliams I represent South
 
01:34:38.390 --> 01:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
Concord which includes this District
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
Welcome to my district it's a pleasure
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
to host you I'm a member of this
 
01:34:45.169 --> 01:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm thrilled to be
 
01:34:47.570 --> 01:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
presenting our first bill at our first
 
01:34:50.090 --> 01:34:50.100 align:start position:0%
hearing because yesterday's was canceled
 
01:34:52.250 --> 01:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
due to snow so here we are kicking it
 
01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
off for the legislative session in 2023.
 
01:34:59.629 --> 01:34:59.639 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to start by saying
 
01:35:01.129 --> 01:35:01.139 align:start position:0%
that it's important that we as the
 
01:35:02.810 --> 01:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy committee
 
01:35:05.810 --> 01:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
uh cite our sources I know
 
01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
um chair Bose mentioned this at our
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
initial orientation and so what I've
 
01:35:11.870 --> 01:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
done is I've emailed everybody on the
 
01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:12.890 align:start position:0%
done is I've emailed everybody on the
committee

01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:12.900 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
um a PDF of different hyperlinks and
 
01:35:18.770 --> 01:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
documents many of them are voluminous so
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
instead of printing out hundreds of
 
01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
pages to hand to all of you I just sent
 
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
around an email that has links so you're
 
01:35:26.450 --> 01:35:26.460 align:start position:0%
welcome to peruse that after this
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
hearing that's just the reference
 
01:35:30.410 --> 01:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
material that I will be speaking to some
 
01:35:32.570 --> 01:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
of it is very dense
 
01:35:34.729 --> 01:35:34.739 align:start position:0%
all right so let's talk about how spell
 
01:35:34.739 --> 01:35:36.649 align:start position:0%
all right so let's talk about how spell
418

01:35:36.649 --> 01:35:36.659 align:start position:0%
418
 
01:35:38.930 --> 01:35:38.940 align:start position:0%
um the affectionate nickname of this
 
01:35:42.110 --> 01:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
bill is to end wreck sweeping
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
so let's start with just a quick
 
01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
overview of the renewable greenhouse gas
 
01:35:47.870 --> 01:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
initiative in New Hampshire which will
 
01:35:49.370 --> 01:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
give you some background as to why we
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
need this bill and what this bill is all
 
01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:52.010 align:start position:0%
need this bill and what this bill is all
about

01:35:52.010 --> 01:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
first according to the Department of
 
01:35:56.450 --> 01:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
energy the renewable greenhouse gas
 
01:35:58.510 --> 01:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
initiative is a multi-state initiative
 
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
including many states in the Northeast
 
01:36:02.810 --> 01:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Connecticut Delaware Maine
 
01:36:04.250 --> 01:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
Maryland Massachusetts New Jersey and
 
01:36:06.590 --> 01:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
New York Rhode Island and Vermont it's a
 
01:36:09.050 --> 01:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
cap and trade program to address CO2
 
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
emissions from the power sector
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire adopted Reggie in 2008
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
we joined many of these states is just
 
01:36:19.129 --> 01:36:19.139 align:start position:0%
listed and we created a market for
 
01:36:19.139 --> 01:36:20.709 align:start position:0%
listed and we created a market for
emissions

01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
emissions
 
01:36:23.209 --> 01:36:23.219 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire emissions allowances are
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
then sold at quarterly auctions and the
 
01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
proceeds fund our Energy Efficiency fund
 
01:36:31.970 --> 01:36:31.980 align:start position:0%
the Energy Efficiency fund is a
 
01:36:35.810 --> 01:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund and it comes from these
 
01:36:39.189 --> 01:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
Reggie auction proceeds
 
01:36:41.870 --> 01:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
in an effort to limit
 
01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
and this is the words of the Department
 
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
of energy
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
the financial impact of Reggie on New
 
01:36:48.890 --> 01:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ratepayers statute currently
 
01:36:51.530 --> 01:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
dictates that all amounts in excess of
 
01:36:54.229 --> 01:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
the threshold price of one dollar for
 
01:36:57.050 --> 01:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
any allowance sale shall be rebated to
 
01:36:59.629 --> 01:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
all retail electric rate payers in the
 
01:37:02.450 --> 01:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
state on a kilowatt per hour basis and
 
01:37:04.850 --> 01:37:04.860 align:start position:0%
this is the problem that house bill 418
 
01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
aims to solve
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
so let's just talk about the amount of
 
01:37:12.610 --> 01:37:12.620 align:start position:0%
money from Reggie auction proceeds
 
01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
specifically this is based on data from
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
eversource but generally you know
 
01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
there's an average you know we're
 
01:37:21.890 --> 01:37:21.900 align:start position:0%
talking about the amount of money that
 
01:37:23.810 --> 01:37:23.820 align:start position:0%
is being refunded every year to rate
 
01:37:26.689 --> 01:37:26.699 align:start position:0%
payers across the state so this is an
 
01:37:31.209 --> 01:37:31.219 align:start position:0%
average my math is based on the rate of
 
01:37:34.250 --> 01:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
0.362 cents per kilowatt hour
 
01:37:38.450 --> 01:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
and then the assumed amount of
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
usage per month
 
01:37:43.189 --> 01:37:43.199 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at an average of 650
 
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours per month for residential
 
01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:46.550 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours per month for residential
customer

01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
customer
 
01:37:49.490 --> 01:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
so that means that you receive 2.35
 
01:37:52.729 --> 01:37:52.739 align:start position:0%
cents per month or 28 dollars and 24
 
01:37:56.510 --> 01:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
cents per year rebated on average as a
 
01:37:58.910 --> 01:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
residential Electric customer
 
01:38:00.530 --> 01:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
so this is once again just based on
 
01:38:02.030 --> 01:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
eversource it's an average the number
 
01:38:03.830 --> 01:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
May Vary depending on your usage and
 
01:38:05.689 --> 01:38:05.699 align:start position:0%
your family size and your household side
 
01:38:08.510 --> 01:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
Etc et cetera but about 2.35 cents a
 
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
month about 28.24 cents per year rebate
 
01:38:16.129 --> 01:38:16.139 align:start position:0%
so what is Rec Sweeping in New Hampshire
 
01:38:18.290 --> 01:38:18.300 align:start position:0%
all right so New Hampshire is one of 29
 
01:38:20.810 --> 01:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
states that have implemented the
 
01:38:23.570 --> 01:38:23.580 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard
 
01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
these are state level policies they're
 
01:38:27.470 --> 01:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for approximately half of
 
01:38:29.629 --> 01:38:29.639 align:start position:0%
all growth in the U.S renewable electric
 
01:38:32.810 --> 01:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
generation and capacity since 2000 so 23
 
01:38:34.850 --> 01:38:34.860 align:start position:0%
years of growth and that's a good thing
 
01:38:36.649 --> 01:38:36.659 align:start position:0%
I think we're talking about switching
 
01:38:38.209 --> 01:38:38.219 align:start position:0%
our source from fossil fuels to
 
01:38:40.970 --> 01:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
Renewables as the market shifts that way
 
01:38:43.970 --> 01:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
and it's become sort of the next step in
 
01:38:46.729 --> 01:38:46.739 align:start position:0%
energy across the nation
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire's RPS our renewable
 
01:38:51.410 --> 01:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard obligates electric
 
01:38:53.930 --> 01:38:53.940 align:start position:0%
suppliers like eversource unit sale
 
01:38:55.610 --> 01:38:55.620 align:start position:0%
Liberty we've all had presentations from
 
01:38:57.950 --> 01:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
them they are required to acquire a
 
01:39:00.169 --> 01:39:00.179 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of their electricity
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
mixed from renewable energy sources
 
01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
every year
 
01:39:05.390 --> 01:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
so there are four categories number
 
01:39:08.090 --> 01:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
class one new renewable energy class two
 
01:39:10.910 --> 01:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
new solar class 3 existing bio mass and
 
01:39:13.850 --> 01:39:13.860 align:start position:0%
methane less for existing small Hydro
 
01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:16.790 align:start position:0%
methane less for existing small Hydro
hmm

01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
so there are three ways that electricity
 
01:39:21.229 --> 01:39:21.239 align:start position:0%
suppliers can comply with renewable
 
01:39:23.330 --> 01:39:23.340 align:start position:0%
energy obligations under the renewable
 
01:39:25.550 --> 01:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
portfolio standards and this is where we
 
01:39:27.110 --> 01:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
get into the Crux of the matter the
 
01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
first is to buy renewable energy credits
 
01:39:33.410 --> 01:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
we call them Rex Recs so every megawatt
 
01:39:35.330 --> 01:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
hour of electricity generated from a
 
01:39:38.450 --> 01:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
renewable energy system produces a wreck
 
01:39:41.629 --> 01:39:41.639 align:start position:0%
this is a certificate acknowledging its
 
01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
potential contribution to the renewable
 
01:39:46.010 --> 01:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard so electricity
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
suppliers can purchase wrecks from
 
01:39:50.750 --> 01:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
homeowners businesses municipalities or
 
01:39:52.729 --> 01:39:52.739 align:start position:0%
other owners of renewable energy systems
 
01:39:55.729 --> 01:39:55.739 align:start position:0%
to comply with their RPS obligations
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
using the rec Market this is the carrot
 
01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
this is really what we were intending I
 
01:40:05.090 --> 01:40:05.100 align:start position:0%
believe as a state when we set up this
 
01:40:08.270 --> 01:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism for renewable energy
 
01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:10.550 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism for renewable energy
credits

01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
credits
 
01:40:13.310 --> 01:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
the second way that the utilities can
 
01:40:15.110 --> 01:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
electric suppliers it's not just
 
01:40:17.149 --> 01:40:17.159 align:start position:0%
utilities obviously constellation is
 
01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
subject to this as well the second way
 
01:40:21.890 --> 01:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
that they can meet this criteria is to
 
01:40:24.410 --> 01:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
pay an alternative compliance payment or
 
01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:25.669 align:start position:0%
pay an alternative compliance payment or
ACP

01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
ACP
 
01:40:27.950 --> 01:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
so instead of purchasing Rex electricity
 
01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
suppliers can pay into the state
 
01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund and the Public
 
01:40:34.129 --> 01:40:34.139 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission uses the money that
 
01:40:36.229 --> 01:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
is generated by these acps alternative
 
01:40:38.330 --> 01:40:38.340 align:start position:0%
compliance payments to fund rebate
 
01:40:39.649 --> 01:40:39.659 align:start position:0%
programs for residential commercial
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
Municipal and low-income renewable
 
01:40:42.830 --> 01:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
energy projects
 
01:40:44.570 --> 01:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
the Third Way
 
01:40:48.590 --> 01:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
is to build Renewables so if uh energy
 
01:40:51.709 --> 01:40:51.719 align:start position:0%
supplier wanted to put in a new solar
 
01:40:54.770 --> 01:40:54.780 align:start position:0%
panel solar array they could do that but
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we have heavy regulation
 
01:40:58.129 --> 01:40:58.139 align:start position:0%
that prevents that from happening so
 
01:41:00.649 --> 01:41:00.659 align:start position:0%
this option is scarcely used
 
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
so let's get back to the Crux of this
 
01:41:04.729 --> 01:41:04.739 align:start position:0%
bill wreck sweeping
 
01:41:06.770 --> 01:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
we can call it the Rex sweeping Loop
 
01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:08.689 align:start position:0%
we can call it the Rex sweeping Loop
loophole

01:41:08.689 --> 01:41:08.699 align:start position:0%
loophole
 
01:41:08.699 --> 01:41:09.830 align:start position:0%
loophole
so

01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative McWilliams
 
01:41:14.510 --> 01:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
could you suspend for a couple of
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
minutes I'm going to call a brief recess
 
01:41:18.770 --> 01:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
of three minutes and we will resume
 
01:42:56.410 --> 01:42:56.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:59.050 --> 01:42:59.060 align:start position:0%
okay recess over
 
01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams will continue
 
01:43:05.629 --> 01:43:05.639 align:start position:0%
thank you chair Vos
 
01:43:08.209 --> 01:43:08.219 align:start position:0%
um so let me just
 
01:43:10.609 --> 01:43:10.619 align:start position:0%
set the tone here I apologize I'm taking
 
01:43:12.649 --> 01:43:12.659 align:start position:0%
you very far afield
 
01:43:14.689 --> 01:43:14.699 align:start position:0%
and I want to redirect back into the
 
01:43:17.629 --> 01:43:17.639 align:start position:0%
language of this specific bill I am
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
speaking to a preview of coming
 
01:43:22.189 --> 01:43:22.199 align:start position:0%
attractions for House Bill 234 and so
 
01:43:23.870 --> 01:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
we'll talk more about that when that one
 
01:43:26.830 --> 01:43:26.840 align:start position:0%
comes up but back to house bill 418
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
which is a very simple Bill we're going
 
01:43:31.729 --> 01:43:31.739 align:start position:0%
to repeal
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
the Energy Efficiency fund and use of
 
01:43:36.890 --> 01:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
auction proceeds the entire purpose of
 
01:43:38.689 --> 01:43:38.699 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:43:42.350 --> 01:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
is to remove the rebate
 
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
um so what that means is
 
01:43:49.250 --> 01:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
instead of giving money back to our rate
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
payers that I talked about instead of
 
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
having a rebate of a value about 28
 
01:43:56.930 --> 01:43:56.940 align:start position:0%
dollars a year per household that money
 
01:43:59.149 --> 01:43:59.159 align:start position:0%
instead stays in the fund
 
01:44:04.010 --> 01:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
and So based on the history of this bill
 
01:44:06.890 --> 01:44:06.900 align:start position:0%
um and the history of the the Energy
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
Efficiency fund the intention has been
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
to use that money to
 
01:44:16.010 --> 01:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
turn it into three to four times
 
01:44:18.290 --> 01:44:18.300 align:start position:0%
multiplied for Energy Efficiency
 
01:44:21.229 --> 01:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
projects across the state and so we have
 
01:44:23.629 --> 01:44:23.639 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of good data showing that
 
01:44:25.490 --> 01:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
when we take money from the Energy
 
01:44:28.669 --> 01:44:28.679 align:start position:0%
Efficiency fund we get that money back
 
01:44:32.149 --> 01:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
times three or times four in reducing
 
01:44:33.950 --> 01:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
the amount of energy that is then used
 
01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
in the future for
 
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
for our constituents and rate payers so
 
01:44:42.649 --> 01:44:42.659 align:start position:0%
big picture this bill is really about
 
01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:44.820 align:start position:0%
returning the program to the way that it
 
01:44:46.970 --> 01:44:46.980 align:start position:0%
was intended to be used
 
01:44:49.490 --> 01:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
um and that's really the the Crux of it
 
01:44:52.010 --> 01:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
all is bringing it back to let's get to
 
01:44:53.930 --> 01:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill let's make sure
 
01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
that we're actually bringing in all of
 
01:44:58.189 --> 01:44:58.199 align:start position:0%
the money we intended to bring in and
 
01:45:00.169 --> 01:45:00.179 align:start position:0%
therefore tripling or quadrupling the
 
01:45:03.470 --> 01:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
benefit for ratepayers and for the
 
01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
entire state to reduce overall energy
 
01:45:08.689 --> 01:45:08.699 align:start position:0%
consumption right if you recall one of
 
01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
our esteemed experts has spoken about
 
01:45:14.930 --> 01:45:14.940 align:start position:0%
the negawatt meaning that the most
 
01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:17.750 align:start position:0%
the negawatt meaning that the most
valuable

01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
valuable
 
01:45:19.970 --> 01:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
increment of measurement for energy that
 
01:45:23.570 --> 01:45:23.580 align:start position:0%
we don't use is is the negawatt not
 
01:45:26.270 --> 01:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
using energy at all so Energy Efficiency
 
01:45:29.090 --> 01:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
allows us to reduce and not use energy
 
01:45:31.490 --> 01:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
that we don't need to use in layman's
 
01:45:33.229 --> 01:45:33.239 align:start position:0%
terms that means we're no longer heating
 
01:45:35.570 --> 01:45:35.580 align:start position:0%
buildings and the outside we don't have
 
01:45:37.550 --> 01:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
heat going out the windows or out the
 
01:45:39.229 --> 01:45:39.239 align:start position:0%
roof because we've done Energy
 
01:45:40.729 --> 01:45:40.739 align:start position:0%
Efficiency work to make the building
 
01:45:42.109 --> 01:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
more efficient
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
and so that's the purpose of House Bill
 
01:45:49.250 --> 01:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
418 is to get us back to Simply
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
funding the fund completely tripling or
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
quadrupling that fund into reducing
 
01:45:55.790 --> 01:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
energy use
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm happy to take
 
01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:00.950 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm happy to take
questions

01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:03.649 --> 01:46:03.659 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McWilliams I'll
 
01:46:06.530 --> 01:46:06.540 align:start position:0%
start off with a quick question on line
 
01:46:09.770 --> 01:46:09.780 align:start position:0%
seven of the bill
 
01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
there is language that refers to
 
01:46:15.770 --> 01:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
current or Future Energy Efficiency
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
resource standards programs can you
 
01:46:22.970 --> 01:46:22.980 align:start position:0%
describe exactly what those programs
 
01:46:26.930 --> 01:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:29.159 align:start position:0%
okay give me one second I'll pull up the
 
01:46:45.890 --> 01:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
so the the first two million dollars of
 
01:46:52.250 --> 01:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
the program I believe are required to be
 
01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:53.510 align:start position:0%
the program I believe are required to be
um

01:46:53.510 --> 01:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:57.229 --> 01:46:57.239 align:start position:0%
put into Energy Efficiency at
 
01:46:59.570 --> 01:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
the municipal scale
 
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm just struggling to find the
 
01:47:04.430 --> 01:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
exact reference but I believe the first
 
01:47:06.530 --> 01:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
two million is earmarked of the entire
 
01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:08.270 align:start position:0%
two million is earmarked of the entire
fund

01:47:08.270 --> 01:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:09.229 align:start position:0%
fund
um

01:47:09.229 --> 01:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:11.390 --> 01:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
oh here we go there's a there's a
 
01:47:14.689 --> 01:47:14.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:20.330 --> 01:47:20.340 align:start position:0%
so under current law
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
if we assume the auction revenue is 43
 
01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:24.050 align:start position:0%
if we assume the auction revenue is 43
million

01:47:24.050 --> 01:47:24.060 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:47:25.790 --> 01:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
that goes into the Energy Efficiency
 
01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:26.950 align:start position:0%
that goes into the Energy Efficiency
fund

01:47:26.950 --> 01:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:47:30.109 --> 01:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
3.21 million would go to utilities for
 
01:47:32.090 --> 01:47:32.100 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency programs
 
01:47:36.350 --> 01:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
and 39.4 million would be rebated back
 
01:47:37.729 --> 01:47:37.739 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about the Energy
 
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs You've Got 2 million
 
01:47:41.629 --> 01:47:41.639 align:start position:0%
to Municipal and local governments
 
01:47:44.209 --> 01:47:44.219 align:start position:0%
that's the one I was thinking of and
 
01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
that could be things like
 
01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:46.970 align:start position:0%
that could be things like
um

01:47:46.970 --> 01:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:48.590 align:start position:0%
um
addressing

01:47:48.590 --> 01:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
01:47:50.930 --> 01:47:50.940 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency at your local school
 
01:47:53.689 --> 01:47:53.699 align:start position:0%
your high school needs to be weatherized
 
01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
just as an example
 
01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
then there's a 15 minimum after that 2
 
01:48:01.370 --> 01:48:01.380 align:start position:0%
million that goes to low income Energy
 
01:48:03.169 --> 01:48:03.179 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
and we currently have
 
01:48:08.750 --> 01:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
um when I say 0.48 million you know it's
 
01:48:10.970 --> 01:48:10.980 align:start position:0%
less than a million we currently have a
 
01:48:13.310 --> 01:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
long wait list of folks who qualify for
 
01:48:15.050 --> 01:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
low-income Energy Efficiency and just
 
01:48:17.209 --> 01:48:17.219 align:start position:0%
can't seem to get ahead on the wait list
 
01:48:20.330 --> 01:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
so funding this program would be
 
01:48:23.510 --> 01:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
a good first step to reducing that
 
01:48:26.870 --> 01:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
megawatt and then finally 0.73 million
 
01:48:30.550 --> 01:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
so 730 000 goes to the all fuels program
 
01:48:32.330 --> 01:48:32.340 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:48:33.770 --> 01:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
administered through the Public
 
01:48:35.689 --> 01:48:35.699 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission with a request for
 
01:48:38.330 --> 01:48:38.340 align:start position:0%
proposals process so those are currently
 
01:48:40.370 --> 01:48:40.380 align:start position:0%
the three buckets for the way that it is
 
01:48:41.930 --> 01:48:41.940 align:start position:0%
under current law to answer your
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
question share bows
 
01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you my follow-up question would
 
01:48:49.850 --> 01:48:49.860 align:start position:0%
would be a clarification really
 
01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:50.689 align:start position:0%
would be a clarification really
um

01:48:50.689 --> 01:48:50.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
the language resource standards
 
01:48:56.510 --> 01:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
typically applies to
 
01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:58.010 align:start position:0%
typically applies to
uh

01:48:58.010 --> 01:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:49:02.090 --> 01:49:02.100 align:start position:0%
a program that is defined in statute
 
01:49:04.490 --> 01:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
to accomplish certain things
 
01:49:06.770 --> 01:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
and your use of the word Energy
 
01:49:09.290 --> 01:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
Efficiency resource standard
 
01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
standards here is confusing so I was
 
01:49:14.990 --> 01:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
wondering if you had clarification but I
 
01:49:17.810 --> 01:49:17.820 align:start position:0%
think I understand now what you were
 
01:49:20.750 --> 01:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
attempting to achieve so thank you thank
 
01:49:22.189 --> 01:49:22.199 align:start position:0%
you cheervos
 
01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
further questions for representative
 
01:49:26.330 --> 01:49:26.340 align:start position:0%
McWilliams representative munz ask a
 
01:49:28.609 --> 01:49:28.619 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
you for introducing this bill
 
01:49:33.590 --> 01:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
um just as a follow-up to the Chairman's
 
01:49:36.169 --> 01:49:36.179 align:start position:0%
question if I'm if I understand
 
01:49:38.709 --> 01:49:38.719 align:start position:0%
correctly and maybe you can confirm this
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
the money that you this that H that this
 
01:49:44.930 --> 01:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
bill would allocate towards those Energy
 
01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs
 
01:49:49.970 --> 01:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
um it's it the the programs are no
 
01:49:51.530 --> 01:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
different than what the money is already
 
01:49:53.810 --> 01:49:53.820 align:start position:0%
the the smaller amount of money is
 
01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
already being spent on correct
 
01:49:58.669 --> 01:49:58.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much for the question
 
01:50:02.090 --> 01:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
uh representative munz yes the intention
 
01:50:05.870 --> 01:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
here is to increase the overall fund not
 
01:50:07.669 --> 01:50:07.679 align:start position:0%
to redirect or create additional
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
programs to put money into it simply as
 
01:50:13.850 --> 01:50:13.860 align:start position:0%
I mentioned there is this 480 000 for
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
low income 15 of the overall dollars
 
01:50:19.310 --> 01:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
that are in the amount that can be used
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
that number really does need to go up in
 
01:50:23.570 --> 01:50:23.580 align:start position:0%
order for us to make strides to reduce
 
01:50:26.750 --> 01:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
energy use and so we're just broadening
 
01:50:28.310 --> 01:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
the pot
 
01:50:31.550 --> 01:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:50:34.970 --> 01:50:34.980 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a question
 
01:50:38.030 --> 01:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:50:41.629 --> 01:50:41.639 align:start position:0%
so representative McWilliams you say
 
01:50:45.470 --> 01:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
that uh by doing this program we're
 
01:50:49.010 --> 01:50:49.020 align:start position:0%
gonna we're going to uh give money back
 
01:50:53.209 --> 01:50:53.219 align:start position:0%
three to fourfold to rate payers yet uh
 
01:50:55.370 --> 01:50:55.380 align:start position:0%
the average customer is going to have
 
01:50:59.050 --> 01:50:59.060 align:start position:0%
around thirty dollars a year
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
more in their electric bill they're not
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
going to receive thirty dollars but
 
01:51:06.830 --> 01:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
they're not going to receive not uh 90
 
01:51:10.550 --> 01:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
to 120 dollars benefit by doing this
 
01:51:14.510 --> 01:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
program or my misconstruing your your
 
01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:19.070 --> 01:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:51:21.950 --> 01:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi so I think there
 
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
are two different pieces to this let me
 
01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
parse it out the first piece is the
 
01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:27.900 align:start position:0%
individual rebate that we currently have
 
01:51:29.629 --> 01:51:29.639 align:start position:0%
you're rounding you know 28 to 30
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
dollars per rate payer to reduce their
 
01:51:35.390 --> 01:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
use that number would go down but big
 
01:51:37.129 --> 01:51:37.139 align:start position:0%
picture when I'm talking about the three
 
01:51:39.590 --> 01:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
to four times return that's not for an
 
01:51:41.629 --> 01:51:41.639 align:start position:0%
individual that's for the entire market
 
01:51:43.669 --> 01:51:43.679 align:start position:0%
and so when we're talking about doing
 
01:51:45.590 --> 01:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
some of these large projects like the
 
01:51:47.149 --> 01:51:47.159 align:start position:0%
local high school has a weatherization
 
01:51:48.830 --> 01:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
effort to reduce the amount of energy
 
01:51:51.169 --> 01:51:51.179 align:start position:0%
that they're using that reduces the
 
01:51:53.090 --> 01:51:53.100 align:start position:0%
amount of energy that is being used in
 
01:51:55.490 --> 01:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
the great pool that is all of New
 
01:51:57.950 --> 01:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's energy users and therefore
 
01:51:59.570 --> 01:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
when we talk about the three to four
 
01:52:02.090 --> 01:52:02.100 align:start position:0%
times return on that initial value of
 
01:52:03.830 --> 01:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
dollars invested what we're really
 
01:52:06.410 --> 01:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
talking about is reducing the amount of
 
01:52:09.169 --> 01:52:09.179 align:start position:0%
energy used in the state and therefore
 
01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
when we look at it from a very simple
 
01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
economics perspective we're looking at
 
01:52:16.490 --> 01:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
supply and demand because the demand has
 
01:52:19.729 --> 01:52:19.739 align:start position:0%
gone down the supply technically has
 
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
gone up and the goal goal here is to
 
01:52:24.649 --> 01:52:24.659 align:start position:0%
have sort of an overall leveraging of
 
01:52:26.689 --> 01:52:26.699 align:start position:0%
supply and demand because we've done
 
01:52:28.490 --> 01:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
these smart projects to reduce Energy
 
01:52:30.290 --> 01:52:30.300 align:start position:0%
Efficiency at a large scale at things
 
01:52:33.109 --> 01:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
like high schools we therefore see more
 
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
available supply for those individual
 
01:52:37.189 --> 01:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
rate payers who were receiving a 28
 
01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
rebate and are now expected to see at
 
01:52:42.709 --> 01:52:42.719 align:start position:0%
least some greater availability of the
 
01:52:44.450 --> 01:52:44.460 align:start position:0%
supply and demand in energy in New
 
01:52:44.460 --> 01:52:45.950 align:start position:0%
supply and demand in energy in New
Hampshire

01:52:45.950 --> 01:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:47.090 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
what

01:52:47.090 --> 01:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:52:51.649 --> 01:52:51.659 align:start position:0%
follow-up so then if I understand what
 
01:52:54.229 --> 01:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
you're saying is the average customer is
 
01:52:56.689 --> 01:52:56.699 align:start position:0%
still going to see around a thirty
 
01:52:58.669 --> 01:52:58.679 align:start position:0%
dollar increase in their electric bill
 
01:53:01.790 --> 01:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
if we were to adopt this uh and and
 
01:53:04.609 --> 01:53:04.619 align:start position:0%
maybe a minuscule drop in that because
 
01:53:08.149 --> 01:53:08.159 align:start position:0%
the high school was uh upgraded in its
 
01:53:10.370 --> 01:53:10.380 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
so you're talking about thirty dollars a
 
01:53:15.530 --> 01:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
year I'm talking about a custom what
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
right now we've had a massive increase
 
01:53:20.330 --> 01:53:20.340 align:start position:0%
in electric rates and you're proposing
 
01:53:22.729 --> 01:53:22.739 align:start position:0%
to add another thirty dollars on top of
 
01:53:25.370 --> 01:53:25.380 align:start position:0%
that uh so I I want to understand is
 
01:53:27.109 --> 01:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
that what you're saying
 
01:53:28.669 --> 01:53:28.679 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi that it's not
 
01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
what I am saying
 
01:53:33.290 --> 01:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
I want to be very clear this program
 
01:53:36.530 --> 01:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
takes the thirty dollars and it refunds
 
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
it back okay so that thirty dollars has
 
01:53:41.149 --> 01:53:41.159 align:start position:0%
already been taken and a piece of that
 
01:53:42.410 --> 01:53:42.420 align:start position:0%
has been charged for administrative
 
01:53:44.330 --> 01:53:44.340 align:start position:0%
costs in order to take it and return it
 
01:53:46.609 --> 01:53:46.619 align:start position:0%
okay the thirty dollars does not belong
 
01:53:49.010 --> 01:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
to the rate payer but we've decided as a
 
01:53:51.709 --> 01:53:51.719 align:start position:0%
legislature to refund it over time this
 
01:53:53.629 --> 01:53:53.639 align:start position:0%
bill corrects that and instead of doing
 
01:53:56.689 --> 01:53:56.699 align:start position:0%
a refund the money stays in the fund
 
01:53:59.450 --> 01:53:59.460 align:start position:0%
where it was intended to have long-term
 
01:54:03.530 --> 01:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
10 to 15 to 20 year Market impacts to
 
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
adjust for are over Reliance on
 
01:54:08.930 --> 01:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
individual fossil fuel natural gas in
 
01:54:11.709 --> 01:54:11.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:15.649 --> 01:54:15.659 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
01:54:17.570 --> 01:54:17.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:54:17.580 --> 01:54:19.310 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:20.990 --> 01:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams when you're
 
01:54:23.930 --> 01:54:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:27.290 --> 01:54:27.300 align:start position:0%
advocating this bill would instead of
 
01:54:27.300 --> 01:54:30.109 align:start position:0%
advocating this bill would instead of
rebating

01:54:30.109 --> 01:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
the money that's already been collected
 
01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
from ratepayers instead of rebating it
 
01:54:36.410 --> 01:54:36.420 align:start position:0%
to them in their bills it would
 
01:54:38.810 --> 01:54:38.820 align:start position:0%
retain it for the Energy Efficiency
 
01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
programs that all rate payers
 
01:54:46.669 --> 01:54:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:49.729 --> 01:54:49.739 align:start position:0%
you're so you're talking about
 
01:54:52.430 --> 01:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
that money being invested in Energy
 
01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:53.750 align:start position:0%
that money being invested in Energy
Efficiency

01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
Efficiency
 
01:54:57.470 --> 01:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
by homeowners businesses communities
 
01:54:57.480 --> 01:54:59.330 align:start position:0%
by homeowners businesses communities
that

01:54:59.330 --> 01:54:59.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
that have the opportunity you have
 
01:55:03.470 --> 01:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
achieved efficiency yes they do could
 
01:55:05.870 --> 01:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
you be referring to
 
01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:08.689 align:start position:0%
you be referring to
the

01:55:08.689 --> 01:55:08.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
when ISO New England was here last week
 
01:55:15.050 --> 01:55:15.060 align:start position:0%
they showed us one particular picture
 
01:55:17.090 --> 01:55:17.100 align:start position:0%
in which they showed that Energy
 
01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:19.129 align:start position:0%
in which they showed that Energy
Efficiency

01:55:19.129 --> 01:55:19.139 align:start position:0%
Efficiency
 
01:55:21.709 --> 01:55:21.719 align:start position:0%
and behind the meter solar had reduced
 
01:55:25.189 --> 01:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
was reducing the growth of the demand
 
01:55:26.810 --> 01:55:26.820 align:start position:0%
curve in New England
 
01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
by four percent below what it would have
 
01:55:31.669 --> 01:55:31.679 align:start position:0%
been without those resources is that
 
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
what you're referring to having New
 
01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:34.310 align:start position:0%
what you're referring to having New
Hampshire

01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:55:37.010 --> 01:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
invest in Energy Efficiency through the
 
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire saves program so that we
 
01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:41.450 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire saves program so that we
reduce

01:55:41.450 --> 01:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
demand in the marketplace and thereby
 
01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:45.109 align:start position:0%
demand in the marketplace and thereby
reduce

01:55:45.109 --> 01:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
01:55:48.830 --> 01:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
Energy prices for all consumers
 
01:55:50.770 --> 01:55:50.780 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds for the question
 
01:55:53.090 --> 01:55:53.100 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned we're really talking
 
01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
about a 10 15-year strategy and so the
 
01:55:58.430 --> 01:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
data that you're referring to from ISO
 
01:56:00.530 --> 01:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
New England in regards to overall four
 
01:56:03.050 --> 01:56:03.060 align:start position:0%
percent reduction because of Energy
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
Efficiency projects is exactly the point
 
01:56:08.570 --> 01:56:08.580 align:start position:0%
that I'm trying to make we're at four
 
01:56:10.910 --> 01:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
percent now and we know that that number
 
01:56:13.550 --> 01:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
will go up if we put more money in this
 
01:56:16.149 --> 01:56:16.159 align:start position:0%
fund thank you for the question
 
01:56:18.109 --> 01:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
representative Summers asked your
 
01:56:18.119 --> 01:56:19.189 align:start position:0%
representative Summers asked your
question

01:56:19.189 --> 01:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:56:20.990 --> 01:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
um look at these numbers and also
 
01:56:24.410 --> 01:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
falling off of uh representative
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
Bernardi's question I understand and I
 
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
see on here the uh the current rebate 30
 
01:56:33.530 --> 01:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
and it's it's very close 39.83 to 39.44
 
01:56:36.410 --> 01:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
million for rebates and then it shows
 
01:56:39.169 --> 01:56:39.179 align:start position:0%
that on January 1st middle of the winter
 
01:56:42.649 --> 01:56:42.659 align:start position:0%
next year the rebate goes down to zero
 
01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
and um just to clarify on the
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
understanding of the uh
 
01:56:51.109 --> 01:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
of the amount that the gets passed
 
01:56:54.169 --> 01:56:54.179 align:start position:0%
through to the constituents and also how
 
01:56:57.350 --> 01:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
much they rebate how much would their
 
01:56:59.209 --> 01:56:59.219 align:start position:0%
bill go up
 
01:57:06.590 --> 01:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:08.870 --> 01:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
so I think you you asked the question
 
01:57:10.609 --> 01:57:10.619 align:start position:0%
and answered the question representative
 
01:57:10.619 --> 01:57:11.629 align:start position:0%
and answered the question representative
Summers

01:57:11.629 --> 01:57:11.639 align:start position:0%
Summers
 
01:57:11.639 --> 01:57:13.070 align:start position:0%
Summers
um

01:57:13.070 --> 01:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:15.229 --> 01:57:15.239 align:start position:0%
we were talking about about say two
 
01:57:16.910 --> 01:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
dollars and fifty cents a month on the
 
01:57:19.570 --> 01:57:19.580 align:start position:0%
average consumer's bill is rebated back
 
01:57:23.770 --> 01:57:23.780 align:start position:0%
and so that is that 28 dollars per year
 
01:57:26.570 --> 01:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
that has been historically rebated back
 
01:57:31.430 --> 01:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:35.410 --> 01:57:35.420 align:start position:0%
follow up so with with the average
 
01:57:38.450 --> 01:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
constituents build and go up 28 dollars
 
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
in January 1st 2024 when that's not
 
01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:42.169 align:start position:0%
in January 1st 2024 when that's not
rebated

01:57:42.169 --> 01:57:42.179 align:start position:0%
rebated
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
so representative Summers I just want to
 
01:57:46.430 --> 01:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
be super clear this money is already
 
01:57:49.910 --> 01:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
taken out of their automatic debit or
 
01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
their checks that they're writing each
 
01:57:53.689 --> 01:57:53.699 align:start position:0%
month to their energy supplier the money
 
01:57:56.570 --> 01:57:56.580 align:start position:0%
has been taken and it is refunded back
 
01:57:59.089 --> 01:57:59.099 align:start position:0%
okay so we're not talking about an
 
01:58:00.530 --> 01:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
increase because they've already written
 
01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
the check
 
01:58:04.070 --> 01:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
and then they get it refunded back so
 
01:58:05.810 --> 01:58:05.820 align:start position:0%
they've written the check and therefore
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
they've committed to pay they're just
 
01:58:10.430 --> 01:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
getting a refund because that's the way
 
01:58:13.370 --> 01:58:13.380 align:start position:0%
it's structured right now
 
01:58:16.129 --> 01:58:16.139 align:start position:0%
okay representative lewicki has a
 
01:58:17.689 --> 01:58:17.699 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:58:17.699 --> 01:58:18.890 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
representative

01:58:18.890 --> 01:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:58:21.129 --> 01:58:21.139 align:start position:0%
um I keep hearing invest and I'm getting
 
01:58:24.290 --> 01:58:24.300 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know who will all of the
 
01:58:27.770 --> 01:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
investors so-called benefit from this or
 
01:58:29.870 --> 01:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
will some investors benefit greatly and
 
01:58:32.450 --> 01:58:32.460 align:start position:0%
other benefit investors receive nothing
 
01:58:37.129 --> 01:58:37.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:38.689 --> 01:58:38.699 align:start position:0%
so I understand your question
 
01:58:40.310 --> 01:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki you're trying to
 
01:58:42.410 --> 01:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
look for winners and losers in a program
 
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
that we have agreed already to
 
01:58:47.330 --> 01:58:47.340 align:start position:0%
administer for Energy Efficiency because
 
01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:50.639 align:start position:0%
of long-term planning to reduce the
 
01:58:53.390 --> 01:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
demand on our electric and energy needs
 
01:58:55.310 --> 01:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire Market
 
01:58:56.990 --> 01:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
so when you're looking for winners and
 
01:58:58.910 --> 01:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
losers there's always going to be
 
01:59:00.709 --> 01:59:00.719 align:start position:0%
somebody who feels like they've had to
 
01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
contribute and they're not seeing an
 
01:59:04.490 --> 01:59:04.500 align:start position:0%
immediate result but we're talking about
 
01:59:07.430 --> 01:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
10 to 15 year planning so the overall
 
01:59:09.229 --> 01:59:09.239 align:start position:0%
Market is the winner
 
01:59:11.089 --> 01:59:11.099 align:start position:0%
and therefore there will always be
 
01:59:13.370 --> 01:59:13.380 align:start position:0%
someone who complains that they had to
 
01:59:15.109 --> 01:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
pay something in order to benefit the
 
01:59:16.729 --> 01:59:16.739 align:start position:0%
greater good
 
01:59:20.270 --> 01:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up okay thank you Mr chairman
 
01:59:22.390 --> 01:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
um so now that we're talking about
 
01:59:25.970 --> 01:59:25.980 align:start position:0%
contributors rather than investors it
 
01:59:28.609 --> 01:59:28.619 align:start position:0%
appears that would this bill then pick
 
01:59:30.410 --> 01:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
winners and losers and some of the
 
01:59:32.629 --> 01:59:32.639 align:start position:0%
losers unlike a real investment where
 
01:59:34.270 --> 01:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
one has a hope of a return
 
01:59:38.030 --> 01:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
in this case we are asked to invest and
 
01:59:39.530 --> 01:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
some of us who have already made
 
01:59:41.270 --> 01:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
ourselves efficient and have already
 
01:59:43.990 --> 01:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
done everything we could are going to be
 
01:59:48.290 --> 01:59:48.300 align:start position:0%
subsidizing those who are chosen by some
 
01:59:51.470 --> 01:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
organization to be the beneficiaries of
 
01:59:53.810 --> 01:59:53.820 align:start position:0%
our contributions is that correct
 
01:59:56.450 --> 01:59:56.460 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki
 
01:59:59.030 --> 01:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
I understand what you're getting at
 
02:00:00.770 --> 02:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
and as someone who supports public
 
02:00:03.709 --> 02:00:03.719 align:start position:0%
education even if I didn't have children
 
02:00:05.450 --> 02:00:05.460 align:start position:0%
who would benefit from public education
 
02:00:07.850 --> 02:00:07.860 align:start position:0%
it's the same situation where we're
 
02:00:09.709 --> 02:00:09.719 align:start position:0%
talking about a market
 
02:00:11.810 --> 02:00:11.820 align:start position:0%
that is a monopoly that we the
 
02:00:13.669 --> 02:00:13.679 align:start position:0%
legislature control
 
02:00:15.890 --> 02:00:15.900 align:start position:0%
and therefore we do have to decide how
 
02:00:18.050 --> 02:00:18.060 align:start position:0%
to fund the next steps for the market
 
02:00:19.970 --> 02:00:19.980 align:start position:0%
just like we the legislature decide how
 
02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
we fund public education and so when you
 
02:00:25.310 --> 02:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
try to make it pitting one side versus
 
02:00:27.229 --> 02:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
the other winners versus losers we're
 
02:00:29.030 --> 02:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
really just talking about long-term
 
02:00:32.030 --> 02:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
planning for what happens and how it's
 
02:00:34.310 --> 02:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
going to play out and so I would posit
 
02:00:36.050 --> 02:00:36.060 align:start position:0%
that the long-term plan for our energy
 
02:00:38.330 --> 02:00:38.340 align:start position:0%
market right now is
 
02:00:41.510 --> 02:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
capitalism let the market decide there's
 
02:00:44.030 --> 02:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
really no guard rails this Returns the
 
02:00:47.330 --> 02:00:47.340 align:start position:0%
funding back to our goal in 2009 when
 
02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
this all started was to work on the
 
02:00:52.010 --> 02:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
transition to Renewables and to focus on
 
02:00:55.729 --> 02:00:55.739 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency this refunds as in
 
02:00:58.189 --> 02:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
continues to fund the program as it was
 
02:01:00.470 --> 02:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
initially meant to be funded so we can
 
02:01:02.570 --> 02:01:02.580 align:start position:0%
get back on that plan
 
02:01:03.970 --> 02:01:03.980 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
02:01:06.169 --> 02:01:06.179 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
 
02:01:08.149 --> 02:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:01:10.250 --> 02:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh for
 
02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
clarification can you uh under the
 
02:01:14.649 --> 02:01:14.659 align:start position:0%
current plan
 
02:01:17.390 --> 02:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
how do our
 
02:01:21.709 --> 02:01:21.719 align:start position:0%
citizens get rebated right now with that
 
02:01:27.290 --> 02:01:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:29.330 --> 02:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question and I
 
02:01:31.250 --> 02:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
believe it's on the electric bill that
 
02:01:32.930 --> 02:01:32.940 align:start position:0%
the consumer receives they see that
 
02:01:35.570 --> 02:01:35.580 align:start position:0%
rebate come back
 
02:01:37.370 --> 02:01:37.380 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
02:01:41.330 --> 02:01:41.340 align:start position:0%
so I guess my point is I I see what
 
02:01:46.129 --> 02:01:46.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:49.189 --> 02:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
is it not do we not
 
02:01:51.410 --> 02:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
believe that right now in today's
 
02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
situation our residents need immediate
 
02:01:59.810 --> 02:01:59.820 align:start position:0%
relief not relief 10 years from now so
 
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
anything that we can do
 
02:02:06.530 --> 02:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
to keep their electric bills lower right
 
02:02:10.129 --> 02:02:10.139 align:start position:0%
now would be a plus in them seeing that
 
02:02:11.870 --> 02:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
we are trying to do something for them
 
02:02:15.649 --> 02:02:15.659 align:start position:0%
so why would you want to
 
02:02:19.550 --> 02:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
take that away now when our our
 
02:02:22.850 --> 02:02:22.860 align:start position:0%
residents need immediate relief
 
02:02:25.490 --> 02:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
so um you may recall last session at the
 
02:02:27.250 --> 02:02:27.260 align:start position:0%
end of the session we had an emergency
 
02:02:29.930 --> 02:02:29.940 align:start position:0%
bipartisan Bill to provide refunds for
 
02:02:33.350 --> 02:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
our rate payers because I think everyone
 
02:02:35.870 --> 02:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
in sitting in this room agrees that we
 
02:02:37.850 --> 02:02:37.860 align:start position:0%
are in an emergency situation when it
 
02:02:39.530 --> 02:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
comes to cost of energy in New Hampshire
 
02:02:41.930 --> 02:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
and it was the right thing to do to
 
02:02:44.330 --> 02:02:44.340 align:start position:0%
provide at least some tangible dollars
 
02:02:46.550 --> 02:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
back to ratepayers so that they would
 
02:02:48.410 --> 02:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
feel less of the hurt when the spikes
 
02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:50.639 align:start position:0%
happened which they did so I would agree
 
02:02:52.550 --> 02:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
with you that we are currently in a dire
 
02:02:55.070 --> 02:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
situation but then I think this is where
 
02:02:57.350 --> 02:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
you and I differ philosophically because
 
02:02:59.870 --> 02:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
I would say this dire situation that we
 
02:03:01.910 --> 02:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
are in needs to be addressed with a 10
 
02:03:04.490 --> 02:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
to 15 year solution and that's what this
 
02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
bill does it funds a 10 to 15 year
 
02:03:10.250 --> 02:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
solution to get us back on track to
 
02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
where we were in 2009 with the guard
 
02:03:13.669 --> 02:03:13.679 align:start position:0%
rails to make sure that we are
 
02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
protecting the energy strategy for the
 
02:03:18.410 --> 02:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
state so when you talk about wouldn't it
 
02:03:20.270 --> 02:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
be best to give pennies back to
 
02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
individual rate payers I think that
 
02:03:24.770 --> 02:03:24.780 align:start position:0%
that's short-term thinking I think that
 
02:03:26.570 --> 02:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
that may feel like a Band-Aid right now
 
02:03:30.109 --> 02:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
but the wound is requiring a surgeon not
 
02:03:31.370 --> 02:03:31.380 align:start position:0%
a Band-Aid
 
02:03:33.649 --> 02:03:33.659 align:start position:0%
are you representative Nutter has a
 
02:03:33.659 --> 02:03:38.270 align:start position:0%
are you representative Nutter has a
question

02:03:38.270 --> 02:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:40.490 --> 02:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
02:03:42.830 --> 02:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
02:03:44.450 --> 02:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
um and thank you representative
 
02:03:47.089 --> 02:03:47.099 align:start position:0%
McWilliams for this um for for this bill
 
02:03:49.790 --> 02:03:49.800 align:start position:0%
and for taking my question
 
02:03:51.830 --> 02:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
um pretty straightforward question if we
 
02:03:53.810 --> 02:03:53.820 align:start position:0%
had a more robust Energy Efficiency
 
02:03:56.750 --> 02:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
program might we all have avoided the
 
02:03:59.089 --> 02:03:59.099 align:start position:0%
Christmas Eve debacle
 
02:04:01.070 --> 02:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
oh um that's an excellent question
 
02:04:03.290 --> 02:04:03.300 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas
 
02:04:06.050 --> 02:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
um I believe that there are two pieces
 
02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
that go into avoiding spikes the first
 
02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
is a diversity of sources of energy and
 
02:04:14.089 --> 02:04:14.099 align:start position:0%
we've kind of created our own pathway
 
02:04:16.550 --> 02:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
for that by committing to Natural Gas to
 
02:04:19.070 --> 02:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
the level that we have as a state I
 
02:04:20.450 --> 02:04:20.460 align:start position:0%
think that there was going to be a spike
 
02:04:22.729 --> 02:04:22.739 align:start position:0%
due to Ukraine and international issues
 
02:04:24.530 --> 02:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
that I don't know that we could have
 
02:04:26.270 --> 02:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
avoided aside from making different
 
02:04:28.970 --> 02:04:28.980 align:start position:0%
decisions in 2009 or you know even five
 
02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
years ago so we we are where we are in
 
02:04:34.370 --> 02:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
terms of our diversity and our our lack
 
02:04:37.189 --> 02:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
of portfolio mix but the other piece Yes
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency works with the
 
02:04:41.570 --> 02:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
portfolio mix so it's something we can
 
02:04:44.570 --> 02:04:44.580 align:start position:0%
do and we should do to mitigate some of
 
02:04:46.790 --> 02:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
the effects of the spike but it's it's
 
02:04:49.790 --> 02:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
not a silver bullet unfortunately
 
02:04:52.390 --> 02:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
02:04:54.589 --> 02:04:54.599 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the office of the
 
02:04:57.370 --> 02:04:57.380 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocates character race
 
02:04:59.930 --> 02:04:59.940 align:start position:0%
characterization of the Christmas Eve
 
02:05:03.350 --> 02:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
event as a debacle it was simply a
 
02:05:06.709 --> 02:05:06.719 align:start position:0%
capacity efficient deficiency was not a
 
02:05:06.719 --> 02:05:08.290 align:start position:0%
capacity efficient deficiency was not a
debacle

02:05:08.290 --> 02:05:08.300 align:start position:0%
debacle
 
02:05:11.330 --> 02:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
02:05:13.850 --> 02:05:13.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um just referring
 
02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
back to representative Doug Thomas's
 
02:05:22.270 --> 02:05:22.280 align:start position:0%
question and his desire for
 
02:05:25.850 --> 02:05:25.860 align:start position:0%
consumers rate payers to see immediate
 
02:05:28.430 --> 02:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
relief from the high prices the high
 
02:05:31.070 --> 02:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
bills that they're facing is it not true
 
02:05:33.290 --> 02:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
that the New Hampshire saves program
 
02:05:33.300 --> 02:05:35.750 align:start position:0%
that the New Hampshire saves program
which

02:05:35.750 --> 02:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:05:38.689 --> 02:05:38.699 align:start position:0%
These funds support
 
02:05:42.589 --> 02:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
are immediately available to all rate
 
02:05:46.070 --> 02:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
payers and could not anyone any
 
02:05:48.890 --> 02:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
homeowner any business who is hurting
 
02:05:52.310 --> 02:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
from high bills could they not
 
02:05:54.109 --> 02:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
Avail themselves of the New Hampshire
 
02:05:58.189 --> 02:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
stage programs say upgrade some lighting
 
02:06:01.669 --> 02:06:01.679 align:start position:0%
or some controls or install some
 
02:06:04.430 --> 02:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
insulation in their home or business and
 
02:06:06.770 --> 02:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
see immediate relief
 
02:06:10.310 --> 02:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
from high energy bills next month and
 
02:06:11.629 --> 02:06:11.639 align:start position:0%
for the rest of the year and in
 
02:06:11.639 --> 02:06:13.850 align:start position:0%
for the rest of the year and in
perpetuity

02:06:13.850 --> 02:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
perpetuity
 
02:06:16.070 --> 02:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds that is the
 
02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:18.649 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds that is the
concept

02:06:18.649 --> 02:06:18.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:20.390 --> 02:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
of the level of funding that we would
 
02:06:22.250 --> 02:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
like to have in order to make sure that
 
02:06:24.530 --> 02:06:24.540 align:start position:0%
that really is how it works out in
 
02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:26.450 align:start position:0%
that really is how it works out in
practice

02:06:26.450 --> 02:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
practice
 
02:06:28.189 --> 02:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
follow-up quick follow Mr chairman
 
02:06:31.609 --> 02:06:31.619 align:start position:0%
follow-up so that's not how it works in
 
02:06:34.189 --> 02:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
practice because the Energy Efficiency
 
02:06:36.470 --> 02:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
fund the New Hampshire Safe program is
 
02:06:39.470 --> 02:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
underfunded it isn't what your bill
 
02:06:42.530 --> 02:06:42.540 align:start position:0%
seeks to achieve is to refund that
 
02:06:45.229 --> 02:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
program so that everyone who calls can
 
02:06:47.330 --> 02:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
Avail can get the resources to help the
 
02:06:49.430 --> 02:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
immediate help they need yes absolutely
 
02:06:50.990 --> 02:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that is the
 
02:06:52.729 --> 02:06:52.739 align:start position:0%
thank you obvious answer yes that's
 
02:06:55.250 --> 02:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
where we're headed what's what we need
 
02:06:58.129 --> 02:06:58.139 align:start position:0%
to clarify none of the funds from this
 
02:06:58.139 --> 02:06:59.450 align:start position:0%
to clarify none of the funds from this
program

02:06:59.450 --> 02:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:07:01.250 --> 02:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
go into the New Hampshire saves program
 
02:07:03.050 --> 02:07:03.060 align:start position:0%
that program is funded by the system
 
02:07:04.669 --> 02:07:04.679 align:start position:0%
benefits charge
 
02:07:07.370 --> 02:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
it's confusing but that's the way it
 
02:07:07.380 --> 02:07:08.390 align:start position:0%
it's confusing but that's the way it
works

02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
works
 
02:07:11.089 --> 02:07:11.099 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative McWilliams
 
02:07:13.010 --> 02:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
for oops one more question
 
02:07:15.530 --> 02:07:15.540 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr chair
 
02:07:18.109 --> 02:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
yeah my question we just saw a
 
02:07:19.550 --> 02:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
presentation that talked about the duck
 
02:07:22.910 --> 02:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
curve and how in the state
 
02:07:25.310 --> 02:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
um part of what contributes to our
 
02:07:29.530 --> 02:07:29.540 align:start position:0%
problems with rates is uh is the Peaks
 
02:07:32.209 --> 02:07:32.219 align:start position:0%
and you talked about supply and demand
 
02:07:34.910 --> 02:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
so I guess the question is
 
02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:36.890 align:start position:0%
so I guess the question is
um

02:07:36.890 --> 02:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:39.290 --> 02:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
there's a concern for a lack of plan at
 
02:07:40.609 --> 02:07:40.619 align:start position:0%
this point you talk about long-range
 
02:07:43.070 --> 02:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
planning right a lack of plan for
 
02:07:45.410 --> 02:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
shaving that peak in a way that actually
 
02:07:47.330 --> 02:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
lowers rates for everybody because we
 
02:07:49.250 --> 02:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
need less energy coming into the state
 
02:07:52.550 --> 02:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
right we have to pay for Less so
 
02:07:54.709 --> 02:07:54.719 align:start position:0%
um I guess is there any way you could
 
02:07:57.589 --> 02:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
speak to what this is about 10 times the
 
02:07:57.599 --> 02:07:58.310 align:start position:0%
speak to what this is about 10 times the
money

02:07:58.310 --> 02:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:08:00.050 --> 02:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
uh that's currently going into the
 
02:08:03.229 --> 02:08:03.239 align:start position:0%
program from Reggie that would be added
 
02:08:03.239 --> 02:08:04.010 align:start position:0%
program from Reggie that would be added
um

02:08:04.010 --> 02:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:06.050 --> 02:08:06.060 align:start position:0%
can you talk about how you would expect
 
02:08:07.910 --> 02:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
that to work over time or what kind of
 
02:08:09.589 --> 02:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
economies of scale you think we would
 
02:08:12.290 --> 02:08:12.300 align:start position:0%
get in terms of being able to
 
02:08:15.649 --> 02:08:15.659 align:start position:0%
um better manage our demand
 
02:08:16.550 --> 02:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:08:19.189 --> 02:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
representative McGee I think that they
 
02:08:20.810 --> 02:08:20.820 align:start position:0%
that may actually be a better question
 
02:08:23.330 --> 02:08:23.340 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Environmental
 
02:08:26.209 --> 02:08:26.219 align:start position:0%
Services and I know they're here but I
 
02:08:28.669 --> 02:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
do think that in Broad Strokes as a
 
02:08:31.669 --> 02:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
legislator the goal here of course is to
 
02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
make a large impact so we can address
 
02:08:36.589 --> 02:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
that low-hanging fruit which is Energy
 
02:08:38.689 --> 02:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
Efficiency we know that there are
 
02:08:40.430 --> 02:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
projects that can be funded if the funds
 
02:08:43.370 --> 02:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
are available it's just been starved for
 
02:08:45.530 --> 02:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
money for so long that we can't even get
 
02:08:46.910 --> 02:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
at the low-hanging fruit in the state
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
and we all suffer because of it so I
 
02:08:50.270 --> 02:08:50.280 align:start position:0%
think that if you could ask that
 
02:08:52.129 --> 02:08:52.139 align:start position:0%
question when Des is up I think that's
 
02:08:54.649 --> 02:08:54.659 align:start position:0%
probably the best way to respond okay
 
02:08:56.810 --> 02:08:56.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:08:58.729 --> 02:08:58.739 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:08:58.739 --> 02:09:00.050 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
so

02:09:00.050 --> 02:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:02.330 --> 02:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
uh we thank you representative uh
 
02:09:04.129 --> 02:09:04.139 align:start position:0%
McWilliams for introducing your bill
 
02:09:08.030 --> 02:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
I'll next call on Mr Griffin robarge
 
02:09:27.290 --> 02:09:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:29.990 --> 02:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh
 
02:09:32.149 --> 02:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
for the record uh Griffin Roberts from
 
02:09:33.970 --> 02:09:33.980 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of energy
 
02:09:36.470 --> 02:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh testifying in opposition to House
 
02:09:40.430 --> 02:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
Bill 418 FN as introduced
 
02:09:42.530 --> 02:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
um in referencing the fiscal note
 
02:09:44.810 --> 02:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
um just wanted to clear up some uh
 
02:09:46.129 --> 02:09:46.139 align:start position:0%
confusion that might be had in the
 
02:09:47.689 --> 02:09:47.699 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
02:09:49.250 --> 02:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
um if you look at the funding source
 
02:09:52.129 --> 02:09:52.139 align:start position:0%
that's the gray shaded box here you'll
 
02:09:54.410 --> 02:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
see that there's a indication that it
 
02:09:57.430 --> 02:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
impacts General funds and Highway funds
 
02:10:00.109 --> 02:10:00.119 align:start position:0%
we believe that to be an error that's
 
02:10:02.209 --> 02:10:02.219 align:start position:0%
been made this is only impacting Energy
 
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
Efficiency related Energy Efficiency
 
02:10:07.250 --> 02:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
fund related dollars
 
02:10:07.260 --> 02:10:08.030 align:start position:0%
fund related dollars
um

02:10:08.030 --> 02:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:10.850 --> 02:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
regarding the Department's opposition
 
02:10:12.830 --> 02:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
again just referencing the fiscal note
 
02:10:16.129 --> 02:10:16.139 align:start position:0%
and using last year's Reggie proceeds as
 
02:10:17.470 --> 02:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
a reference
 
02:10:20.109 --> 02:10:20.119 align:start position:0%
there was some
 
02:10:22.790 --> 02:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
39.32 million that was approximately
 
02:10:27.709 --> 02:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
rebated back to ratepayers if this bill
 
02:10:29.510 --> 02:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
were to go forward it would instead
 
02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
rebate all or allocate all Reggie
 
02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
proceeds into Energy Efficiency programs
 
02:10:36.290 --> 02:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
with no rebates going back to Electric
 
02:10:40.250 --> 02:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
customers in a time of historically High
 
02:10:43.250 --> 02:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
electric costs the department feels that
 
02:10:44.810 --> 02:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
passing on another
 
02:10:47.089 --> 02:10:47.099 align:start position:0%
approximately 40 million dollars onto
 
02:10:48.709 --> 02:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
rate payers
 
02:10:50.810 --> 02:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
um might be ill-advised just at this
 
02:10:54.109 --> 02:10:54.119 align:start position:0%
time given the give again given where
 
02:10:57.770 --> 02:10:57.780 align:start position:0%
rates are obviously uh the the fiscal
 
02:10:59.750 --> 02:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
note uh was put together by both
 
02:11:01.250 --> 02:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
Departments of energy and the Department
 
02:11:03.229 --> 02:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services
 
02:11:05.330 --> 02:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
um there would be a a near-term increase
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
in electric costs if these rebates were
 
02:11:09.470 --> 02:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
done away with for electric customers
 
02:11:11.629 --> 02:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
but the both departments do acknowledge
 
02:11:13.189 --> 02:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
that over the long term increased
 
02:11:16.430 --> 02:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
investments in Energy Efficiency would
 
02:11:18.229 --> 02:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
save ratepayers money over the long term
 
02:11:20.810 --> 02:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
but again focusing on the short-term
 
02:11:23.390 --> 02:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
implications of this bill that's where
 
02:11:25.810 --> 02:11:25.820 align:start position:0%
our opposition lies
 
02:11:28.370 --> 02:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
regarding current Energy Efficiency
 
02:11:31.010 --> 02:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
programs as this body is aware House
 
02:11:33.589 --> 02:11:33.599 align:start position:0%
Bill 549 was signed into law last year
 
02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
that made some increases to the budgets
 
02:11:37.850 --> 02:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire saves programs and
 
02:11:40.189 --> 02:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency programs so New
 
02:11:41.870 --> 02:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not devoid of Energy
 
02:11:44.570 --> 02:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs currently
 
02:11:44.580 --> 02:11:45.350 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs currently
um

02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:47.870 --> 02:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
people can obviously whether you're a
 
02:11:49.609 --> 02:11:49.619 align:start position:0%
commercial or industrial customer or
 
02:11:52.490 --> 02:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
resident can certainly work with your uh
 
02:11:55.129 --> 02:11:55.139 align:start position:0%
utility and see what types of programs
 
02:11:57.470 --> 02:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state offers see what you
 
02:11:59.390 --> 02:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
might qualify for and then determine the
 
02:12:01.070 --> 02:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
best path forward but again an
 
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
additional 40 million dollars based on
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
last year's data on to rate payers at
 
02:12:07.070 --> 02:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
this time is something the department
 
02:12:10.850 --> 02:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
strongly has concerns with and with that
 
02:12:12.709 --> 02:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
that concludes my testimony and I'll
 
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
02:12:17.870 --> 02:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr robarge one quick question
 
02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
is it your understanding that the
 
02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
language of this bill would redirect
 
02:12:28.010 --> 02:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
some of these auction proceeds refunds
 
02:12:32.149 --> 02:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire saves program so
 
02:12:34.550 --> 02:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
and how would that work yes and thank
 
02:12:36.890 --> 02:12:36.900 align:start position:0%
you for the question so I I don't mean
 
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
to steal uh I don't mean to avoid your
 
02:12:40.850 --> 02:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
question but the Department of
 
02:12:42.350 --> 02:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services did come with a
 
02:12:45.410 --> 02:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
little printout demonstrating how funds
 
02:12:47.390 --> 02:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
are allocated and I just respectfully
 
02:12:48.830 --> 02:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
defer to them because it's their handout
 
02:12:50.390 --> 02:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
so I think they can better answer that
 
02:12:51.649 --> 02:12:51.659 align:start position:0%
question but
 
02:12:52.970 --> 02:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
um it's my understanding that there is a
 
02:12:54.589 --> 02:12:54.599 align:start position:0%
small portion of funds right now that
 
02:12:56.510 --> 02:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
currently go into New Hampshire saves
 
02:12:58.370 --> 02:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
programs from these funds
 
02:13:00.890 --> 02:13:00.900 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Thomas has
 
02:13:03.410 --> 02:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
a question Doug Thomas thank you Mr
 
02:13:04.669 --> 02:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
02:13:06.770 --> 02:13:06.780 align:start position:0%
could you clarify please because it's
 
02:13:07.970 --> 02:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
been mentioned several times about
 
02:13:11.270 --> 02:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
everybody uh benefits from uh in this
 
02:13:14.750 --> 02:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:18.229 --> 02:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
are there qualifications for people to
 
02:13:21.050 --> 02:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
get funds from that fund do they have to
 
02:13:23.209 --> 02:13:23.219 align:start position:0%
meet certain qualifications there can be
 
02:13:24.890 --> 02:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
depending on the program so I'm not I'm
 
02:13:26.629 --> 02:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
not you know going to go through every
 
02:13:28.129 --> 02:13:28.139 align:start position:0%
single program here for New Hampshire
 
02:13:30.010 --> 02:13:30.020 align:start position:0%
saves but there are ones that do Target
 
02:13:32.149 --> 02:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
low-income households that might give
 
02:13:33.830 --> 02:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
them more of a benefit than you would
 
02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:34.850 align:start position:0%
them more of a benefit than you would
say

02:13:34.850 --> 02:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:13:36.830 --> 02:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
no disrespect to anybody living in Rye
 
02:13:38.870 --> 02:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
but somebody who lives in Rye
 
02:13:40.370 --> 02:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:13:42.649 --> 02:13:42.659 align:start position:0%
um you know there are certain programs
 
02:13:44.330 --> 02:13:44.340 align:start position:0%
like that that might give them a little
 
02:13:46.970 --> 02:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
bit of an edge there's also additionally
 
02:13:48.770 --> 02:13:48.780 align:start position:0%
um other Assistance programs that the
 
02:13:50.569 --> 02:13:50.579 align:start position:0%
department presented uh when we were
 
02:13:52.370 --> 02:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
here you know the electric assistance
 
02:13:53.990 --> 02:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
program the weatherization assistance
 
02:13:57.350 --> 02:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
program which is currently uh wait
 
02:13:59.810 --> 02:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
listed but there are programs out there
 
02:14:01.550 --> 02:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
for people to Avail themselves up but
 
02:14:04.010 --> 02:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
just you know look to talk to utilities
 
02:14:05.629 --> 02:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
to learn about what those programs offer
 
02:14:07.629 --> 02:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
what you might qualify for
 
02:14:10.550 --> 02:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
02:14:11.750 --> 02:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for coming
 
02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:13.490 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for coming
back

02:14:13.490 --> 02:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
back
 
02:14:15.950 --> 02:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
um can you confirm that the annual
 
02:14:19.550 --> 02:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
impact on rates is
 
02:14:22.370 --> 02:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
um 28 a year so thank you for the
 
02:14:23.750 --> 02:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
question so
 
02:14:25.669 --> 02:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
and uh representative McWilliams just
 
02:14:26.990 --> 02:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
following up on the information you and
 
02:14:29.930 --> 02:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
I had exchanged um so the information
 
02:14:31.729 --> 02:14:31.739 align:start position:0%
that representative McWilliams had
 
02:14:34.729 --> 02:14:34.739 align:start position:0%
referenced is information in an Ever
 
02:14:37.010 --> 02:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
source file and currently before the puc
 
02:14:39.729 --> 02:14:39.739 align:start position:0%
on their standard cost recovery charge
 
02:14:42.830 --> 02:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
that data is based on historical uh
 
02:14:44.589 --> 02:14:44.599 align:start position:0%
Reggie rebate information
 
02:14:48.950 --> 02:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
if there was something more recent uh to
 
02:14:50.750 --> 02:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
use as a case example I refer you to the
 
02:14:53.209 --> 02:14:53.219 align:start position:0%
annual Reggie report that's put out
 
02:14:55.010 --> 02:14:55.020 align:start position:0%
um which I know Des will likely
 
02:14:56.450 --> 02:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
reference when they're up here but there
 
02:14:58.390 --> 02:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
is a section in there about
 
02:15:02.569 --> 02:15:02.579 align:start position:0%
Trends and electric rates and
 
02:15:05.709 --> 02:15:05.719 align:start position:0%
net rate impact was
 
02:15:08.450 --> 02:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
.00032 cents per kilowatt hour which
 
02:15:11.089 --> 02:15:11.099 align:start position:0%
translates into about 21 cents per month
 
02:15:13.189 --> 02:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
for a tip excuse me for a typical
 
02:15:15.350 --> 02:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
residential customer
 
02:15:16.910 --> 02:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
um so again
 
02:15:18.410 --> 02:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
based on the information representative
 
02:15:20.750 --> 02:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
McWilliams provide it can be vastly
 
02:15:21.950 --> 02:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
different depending on how future
 
02:15:24.649 --> 02:15:24.659 align:start position:0%
auctions go but I don't want to speak
 
02:15:26.270 --> 02:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
too much for eversource but that's at
 
02:15:27.649 --> 02:15:27.659 align:start position:0%
least my impression of their filing
 
02:15:32.089 --> 02:15:32.099 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up so this that's a big
 
02:15:34.310 --> 02:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
if I understand correctly there's a big
 
02:15:37.069 --> 02:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
difference between 21 cents a month and
 
02:15:40.250 --> 02:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
2.50 cents a month I would yes correct
 
02:15:43.010 --> 02:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
can you reconcile those two so I can
 
02:15:45.229 --> 02:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
only I can only kind of I can't predict
 
02:15:46.910 --> 02:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
what future Reggie auctions will look
 
02:15:48.890 --> 02:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
like I can only reference at least what
 
02:15:50.990 --> 02:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
was in the past Reggie report as to what
 
02:15:52.970 --> 02:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
was done in the most recent auction and
 
02:15:55.430 --> 02:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
what the impacts of that were obviously
 
02:15:57.229 --> 02:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
with the eversource data that was
 
02:15:59.330 --> 02:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
referenced that's still ongoing
 
02:16:01.069 --> 02:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
um and I don't want to speak too much on
 
02:16:03.229 --> 02:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
that just because I can't predict what
 
02:16:05.689 --> 02:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
Reggie uh proceeds will look like in the
 
02:16:05.699 --> 02:16:07.149 align:start position:0%
Reggie uh proceeds will look like in the
future

02:16:07.149 --> 02:16:07.159 align:start position:0%
future
 
02:16:09.410 --> 02:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
02:16:11.689 --> 02:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
02:16:14.149 --> 02:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
um this is um in reference to the last
 
02:16:17.209 --> 02:16:17.219 align:start position:0%
uh last full paragraph on the fiscal
 
02:16:19.490 --> 02:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
note where it says over the long term
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
increased investment in Energy
 
02:16:24.169 --> 02:16:24.179 align:start position:0%
Efficiency projects would save rate
 
02:16:25.669 --> 02:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
payers money
 
02:16:27.229 --> 02:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
so my question is how does the
 
02:16:29.149 --> 02:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
department of energy propose to get us
 
02:16:31.010 --> 02:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
rate payers those long-term Energy
 
02:16:34.669 --> 02:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
savings if we don't start now sure so as
 
02:16:36.530 --> 02:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
I'm thank you for the question as I
 
02:16:37.849 --> 02:16:37.859 align:start position:0%
mentioned New Hampshire is not devoid of
 
02:16:40.070 --> 02:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency programs now House
 
02:16:42.410 --> 02:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
Bill 549 was passed and signed into law
 
02:16:45.349 --> 02:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
last year that made changes to Energy
 
02:16:47.629 --> 02:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
Efficiency budgets and everything like
 
02:16:49.669 --> 02:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
that made increases to them so we're not
 
02:16:53.870 --> 02:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
devoid of that in terms of in it is it
 
02:16:55.490 --> 02:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
is true that over the long term there
 
02:16:57.889 --> 02:16:57.899 align:start position:0%
will be if there is increased investment
 
02:16:59.330 --> 02:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
you know it will save ratepayers money
 
02:17:01.669 --> 02:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
but again at a time where electric rates
 
02:17:03.349 --> 02:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
are at some of the highest they've ever
 
02:17:06.110 --> 02:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
been an additional 40 million dollars on
 
02:17:07.429 --> 02:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
ratepayers at this time would be
 
02:17:09.589 --> 02:17:09.599 align:start position:0%
something that the department just wants
 
02:17:11.389 --> 02:17:11.399 align:start position:0%
to express significant concern about
 
02:17:14.030 --> 02:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
because it would you know impact uh
 
02:17:15.349 --> 02:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
certainly low to moderate income
 
02:17:18.790 --> 02:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:20.810 --> 02:17:20.820 align:start position:0%
representative muns thought of another
 
02:17:20.820 --> 02:17:22.070 align:start position:0%
representative muns thought of another
question

02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:17:24.169 --> 02:17:24.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:17:24.179 --> 02:17:25.250 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

02:17:25.250 --> 02:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:26.990 --> 02:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think anybody disagrees that
 
02:17:29.450 --> 02:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
rate payers are are really being
 
02:17:31.429 --> 02:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
impacted right now by the by the rate
 
02:17:31.439 --> 02:17:32.750 align:start position:0%
impacted right now by the by the rate
increases

02:17:32.750 --> 02:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
increases
 
02:17:33.950 --> 02:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
um and it is an extraordinary
 
02:17:33.960 --> 02:17:35.690 align:start position:0%
um and it is an extraordinary
circumstance

02:17:35.690 --> 02:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
circumstance
 
02:17:38.270 --> 02:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is in the budgeting
 
02:17:41.089 --> 02:17:41.099 align:start position:0%
process that state agencies are now
 
02:17:43.129 --> 02:17:43.139 align:start position:0%
going through with the governor has the
 
02:17:44.990 --> 02:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
department of energy made a case to the
 
02:17:46.969 --> 02:17:46.979 align:start position:0%
governor to use part of the State
 
02:17:50.929 --> 02:17:50.939 align:start position:0%
Surplus to reduce short-term uh energy
 
02:17:54.589 --> 02:17:54.599 align:start position:0%
rates so that we can allow we can use
 
02:17:56.810 --> 02:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
this money to continue to invest in the
 
02:17:58.250 --> 02:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
future sure and thank you for the
 
02:18:00.110 --> 02:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
question you know I would just point
 
02:18:03.410 --> 02:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
back to the to House Bill 2023 which has
 
02:18:05.810 --> 02:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
passed in which was uh passed by the
 
02:18:07.610 --> 02:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
legislature during the veto session last
 
02:18:07.620 --> 02:18:08.929 align:start position:0%
legislature during the veto session last
year

02:18:08.929 --> 02:18:08.939 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
um so that is a current program right
 
02:18:12.709 --> 02:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
now to offer you know immediate bill
 
02:18:14.450 --> 02:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
assistance to those at the lower ends of
 
02:18:16.549 --> 02:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
the socioeconomic ladders and you know
 
02:18:17.870 --> 02:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
people certainly can reach out to their
 
02:18:19.429 --> 02:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
cap agencies to learn what they might
 
02:18:22.370 --> 02:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
qualify for and everything like that I
 
02:18:24.709 --> 02:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
not intimately involved in the
 
02:18:26.990 --> 02:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
Department's discussions with uh the
 
02:18:28.429 --> 02:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
budget but it's certainly something I
 
02:18:29.450 --> 02:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
could ask and follow up with the
 
02:18:31.370 --> 02:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
committee on but I can at least just
 
02:18:33.110 --> 02:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
point to House Bill 2023 as some
 
02:18:34.669 --> 02:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
legislative action that occurred in the
 
02:18:36.770 --> 02:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
near past
 
02:18:38.929 --> 02:18:38.939 align:start position:0%
okay my thanks to the department for
 
02:18:41.629 --> 02:18:41.639 align:start position:0%
your input on this legislation
 
02:18:43.370 --> 02:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
we have one other pink card it was
 
02:18:44.570 --> 02:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
submitted by the Department of
 
02:18:46.870 --> 02:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services Michael
 
02:18:49.429 --> 02:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald in particular
 
02:18:51.469 --> 02:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
he said he would make himself available
 
02:18:54.370 --> 02:18:54.380 align:start position:0%
if the committee had questions
 
02:18:57.410 --> 02:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
particularly about this handout that
 
02:19:00.469 --> 02:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
they that the department provided
 
02:19:03.589 --> 02:19:03.599 align:start position:0%
does the committee wish to ask questions
 
02:19:06.770 --> 02:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
of Mr Fitzgerald
 
02:19:09.230 --> 02:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
yes so Mr Fitzgerald if you could come
 
02:19:12.790 --> 02:19:12.800 align:start position:0%

being here
 
02:20:12.410 --> 02:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
um I recently saw a report on the
 
02:20:14.030 --> 02:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
regional Reggie program and how the
 
02:20:16.429 --> 02:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
different states are Distributing their
 
02:20:19.490 --> 02:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
funds and the thing that I made note of
 
02:20:21.590 --> 02:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
is the pie charts that showed how much
 
02:20:24.730 --> 02:20:24.740 align:start position:0%
money was going to rebates or other
 
02:20:27.770 --> 02:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
costs and how much was going into Energy
 
02:20:30.469 --> 02:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and the piece of the pie that
 
02:20:31.969 --> 02:20:31.979 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is providing for Energy
 
02:20:34.730 --> 02:20:34.740 align:start position:0%
Efficiency was kind of Converse to what
 
02:20:37.730 --> 02:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
the other states are supporting
 
02:20:39.230 --> 02:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
um in in most of the other states it was
 
02:20:43.070 --> 02:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
between like 79 and 85 I think so so my
 
02:20:46.370 --> 02:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
first question I I have two is um
 
02:20:50.389 --> 02:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
is uh has that been consistent the whole
 
02:20:52.250 --> 02:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
time can you give us some context around
 
02:20:55.490 --> 02:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
how much money we're we're investing and
 
02:20:55.500 --> 02:20:56.410 align:start position:0%
how much money we're we're investing and
or

02:20:56.410 --> 02:20:56.420 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:20:59.210 --> 02:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
losing by the way we're administering
 
02:21:00.590 --> 02:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
the program as opposed to the other
 
02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
competitive states in the region sure by
 
02:21:04.070 --> 02:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
way of context
 
02:21:07.090 --> 02:21:07.100 align:start position:0%
um Reggie program began in 1999
 
02:21:07.100 --> 02:21:09.429 align:start position:0%
um Reggie program began in 1999
and

02:21:09.429 --> 02:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:21:12.170 --> 02:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
our participation
 
02:21:16.969 --> 02:21:16.979 align:start position:0%
um and it was it was a joint initiative
 
02:21:20.330 --> 02:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
of 11 states and
 
02:21:23.150 --> 02:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
um the way the program was designed was
 
02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
that CO2 auction revenues would be
 
02:21:27.650 --> 02:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
distributed to States and each state
 
02:21:29.389 --> 02:21:29.399 align:start position:0%
would be able to make their own decision
 
02:21:33.910 --> 02:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
and and in accordance with their own
 
02:21:33.920 --> 02:21:35.770 align:start position:0%
and and in accordance with their own
priorities

02:21:35.770 --> 02:21:35.780 align:start position:0%
priorities
 
02:21:38.809 --> 02:21:38.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legislature and adopting
 
02:21:38.819 --> 02:21:40.690 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legislature and adopting
Reggie

02:21:40.690 --> 02:21:40.700 align:start position:0%
Reggie
 
02:21:43.070 --> 02:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
originally allocated a significant
 
02:21:46.190 --> 02:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
portion of the funds to Energy
 
02:21:48.590 --> 02:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs ultimately that was
 
02:21:52.670 --> 02:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
changed I believe in 2012 when there was
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
a compromise achieved in the legislature
 
02:21:56.809 --> 02:21:56.819 align:start position:0%
and I will say that Des position by the
 
02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
way is is that um
 
02:22:02.389 --> 02:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh you know we believe participation in
 
02:22:04.790 --> 02:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
Reggie in general is a positive benefit
 
02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire because the wholesale
 
02:22:08.469 --> 02:22:08.479 align:start position:0%
cost of
 
02:22:12.050 --> 02:22:12.060 align:start position:0%
uh the Reggie program allowance is is
 
02:22:14.809 --> 02:22:14.819 align:start position:0%
embedded in the cost of a wholesale
 
02:22:17.389 --> 02:22:17.399 align:start position:0%
electricity and our therefore if we
 
02:22:19.730 --> 02:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
participate and we receive our revenues
 
02:22:22.550 --> 02:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
back we're better off financially the
 
02:22:24.830 --> 02:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
debate is what to do with those revenues
 
02:22:26.770 --> 02:22:26.780 align:start position:0%
as was pointed out by the representative
 
02:22:28.849 --> 02:22:28.859 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:22:31.190 --> 02:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
um uh the compromise that was achieved
 
02:22:36.170 --> 02:22:36.180 align:start position:0%
in 2012 was uh that the one dollar of
 
02:22:37.790 --> 02:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
each allowance price would be dedicated
 
02:22:40.250 --> 02:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
to Energy Efficiency at that time
 
02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
allowance prices were roughly uh two two
 
02:22:45.120 --> 02:22:46.270 align:start position:0%
allowance prices were roughly uh two two
dollars

02:22:46.270 --> 02:22:46.280 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:22:49.849 --> 02:22:49.859 align:start position:0%
plus or minus and
 
02:22:51.530 --> 02:22:51.540 align:start position:0%
um since that time the price of
 
02:22:55.190 --> 02:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
allowances has risen as it
 
02:22:56.929 --> 02:22:56.939 align:start position:0%
was always projected to the number of
 
02:22:59.990 --> 02:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
allowances decreased lowering CO2
 
02:23:02.270 --> 02:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
emissions over time but the price of
 
02:23:05.150 --> 02:23:05.160 align:start position:0%
each allowance has increased today Joe
 
02:23:07.610 --> 02:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
Revenue allowance prices roughly 12
 
02:23:11.990 --> 02:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
range from 13 to 14 13 to 14 so when
 
02:23:15.110 --> 02:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
that compromise was achieved in 1999 the
 
02:23:17.090 --> 02:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
one dollar represented approximately 50
 
02:23:19.309 --> 02:23:19.319 align:start position:0%
percent of the revenues
 
02:23:21.290 --> 02:23:21.300 align:start position:0%
um today it represents less than 10
 
02:23:23.710 --> 02:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
percent because the price of the
 
02:23:27.590 --> 02:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
allowances has increased again our
 
02:23:29.990 --> 02:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
position is that it's up to the
 
02:23:33.190 --> 02:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
legislature to determine what how those
 
02:23:35.510 --> 02:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
funds are allocated but that's been the
 
02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:36.770 align:start position:0%
funds are allocated but that's been the
traditional

02:23:36.770 --> 02:23:36.780 align:start position:0%
traditional
 
02:23:39.170 --> 02:23:39.180 align:start position:0%
um so that that amount that's gone into
 
02:23:41.270 --> 02:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency
 
02:23:43.130 --> 02:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
um traditionally as a percentage has
 
02:23:45.349 --> 02:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
declined as the price of allowances has
 
02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
increased thank you that's a very
 
02:23:49.610 --> 02:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
important piece of context and so the
 
02:23:50.809 --> 02:23:50.819 align:start position:0%
follow-up question was around the
 
02:23:52.610 --> 02:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
allowance prices
 
02:23:54.230 --> 02:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
um oh Mr chair I had said I had a
 
02:23:55.190 --> 02:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
two-part but
 
02:23:57.950 --> 02:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
all right follow up thank you
 
02:23:57.960 --> 02:23:58.670 align:start position:0%
all right follow up thank you
um

02:23:58.670 --> 02:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:01.309 --> 02:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
so I had read recently that the
 
02:24:03.889 --> 02:24:03.899 align:start position:0%
allowance prices are projected to
 
02:24:06.530 --> 02:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
continue to go up and I don't you know I
 
02:24:08.090 --> 02:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
don't follow the market so I don't know
 
02:24:11.030 --> 02:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
if that's true or not but um but you
 
02:24:12.650 --> 02:24:12.660 align:start position:0%
have made
 
02:24:15.830 --> 02:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
a fairly clear point that the percentage
 
02:24:18.650 --> 02:24:18.660 align:start position:0%
of what we're receiving as a state uh
 
02:24:21.349 --> 02:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
has has not stayed commiserate in terms
 
02:24:22.849 --> 02:24:22.859 align:start position:0%
of what we're investing out of that
 
02:24:26.030 --> 02:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
money so if it was a let's say 14 just
 
02:24:28.130 --> 02:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
for easy math right we would be putting
 
02:24:31.730 --> 02:24:31.740 align:start position:0%
seven dollars of the 14 into
 
02:24:33.110 --> 02:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
um and we're still at the one dollar
 
02:24:37.250 --> 02:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
rate so we're basically not keeping up
 
02:24:39.410 --> 02:24:39.420 align:start position:0%
what I don't know if I would use the
 
02:24:41.210 --> 02:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
term keeping up but we're basic
 
02:24:44.030 --> 02:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
basically we're many of the other states
 
02:24:46.730 --> 02:24:46.740 align:start position:0%
uh have chosen to invest a greater
 
02:24:50.510 --> 02:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
significant percentages into
 
02:24:52.790 --> 02:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
um into into Energy Efficiency can I
 
02:24:54.889 --> 02:24:54.899 align:start position:0%
just ask one more question uh it's still
 
02:24:57.110 --> 02:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
along the same line well we're
 
02:24:59.929 --> 02:24:59.939 align:start position:0%
restricting to two questions per member
 
02:25:01.550 --> 02:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
until all members have asked a question
 
02:25:04.250 --> 02:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
and we are running short of time here so
 
02:25:06.889 --> 02:25:06.899 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki is recognized for
 
02:25:07.849 --> 02:25:07.859 align:start position:0%
a question
 
02:25:09.290 --> 02:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:25:10.790 --> 02:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:25:14.690 --> 02:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
um I am interested in knowing how things
 
02:25:16.610 --> 02:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
we basically have several different
 
02:25:18.550 --> 02:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
states and several different
 
02:25:21.230 --> 02:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
methodologies and do you and it might
 
02:25:22.370 --> 02:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
have been a better question for Mr
 
02:25:25.190 --> 02:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
Roberts have any idea of whether the
 
02:25:27.170 --> 02:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
rate increase in in the other states
 
02:25:29.330 --> 02:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
have been similar to greater than lesser
 
02:25:32.150 --> 02:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
than those in New Hampshire recently
 
02:25:34.190 --> 02:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
certainly can't speak for all the Reggie
 
02:25:36.590 --> 02:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
States there's there's 11 states in the
 
02:25:38.870 --> 02:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
program but those states that are in the
 
02:25:41.630 --> 02:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
iso New England region I believe that
 
02:25:44.450 --> 02:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
the cost increases
 
02:25:46.670 --> 02:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
have been somewhat commensured it's been
 
02:25:48.349 --> 02:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
somewhat higher or lower but there's
 
02:25:50.090 --> 02:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
been significant cost increase rate
 
02:25:52.730 --> 02:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
increases in all the iso New England
 
02:25:56.469 --> 02:25:56.479 align:start position:0%
states I believe it's consistent
 
02:26:00.469 --> 02:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
bottom line the the cost of energy is
 
02:26:02.630 --> 02:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
primarily related to the cost of fuel
 
02:26:06.050 --> 02:26:06.060 align:start position:0%
and and in New England and probably a
 
02:26:08.210 --> 02:26:08.220 align:start position:0%
significant portion of the country that
 
02:26:10.190 --> 02:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
cost of fuel is natural gas and the cost
 
02:26:12.530 --> 02:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
of natural gas has risen dramatically so
 
02:26:12.540 --> 02:26:14.270 align:start position:0%
of natural gas has risen dramatically so
that's

02:26:14.270 --> 02:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:26:16.010 --> 02:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
um that's been the primary driver and I
 
02:26:17.690 --> 02:26:17.700 align:start position:0%
believe that's fairly consistent across
 
02:26:20.570 --> 02:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
the Reggie region
 
02:26:24.349 --> 02:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
representative Christian has a question
 
02:26:26.270 --> 02:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
02:26:26.280 --> 02:26:27.349 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
question

02:26:27.349 --> 02:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:26:29.510 --> 02:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
um we actually saw a couple of weeks ago
 
02:26:31.370 --> 02:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
in a presentation I forgot whether it
 
02:26:33.469 --> 02:26:33.479 align:start position:0%
was the iso or the group that spoke
 
02:26:33.479 --> 02:26:34.490 align:start position:0%
was the iso or the group that spoke
after

02:26:34.490 --> 02:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
after
 
02:26:36.230 --> 02:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
um but that showed that transmission
 
02:26:39.950 --> 02:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
costs are um an increasingly large part
 
02:26:42.950 --> 02:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
of what rate payers are paying
 
02:26:45.590 --> 02:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
um can you speak a little bit to the
 
02:26:48.070 --> 02:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
effects of Energy Efficiency on
 
02:26:50.929 --> 02:26:50.939 align:start position:0%
transmission costs and particularly how
 
02:26:53.030 --> 02:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
they contribute to reducing Peak costs
 
02:26:55.730 --> 02:26:55.740 align:start position:0%
Peak shaving that sort of thing sure
 
02:26:55.740 --> 02:26:56.330 align:start position:0%
Peak shaving that sort of thing sure
um

02:26:56.330 --> 02:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:59.929 --> 02:26:59.939 align:start position:0%
that's a key point for for the Energy
 
02:27:01.730 --> 02:27:01.740 align:start position:0%
Efficiency discussion
 
02:27:06.110 --> 02:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
um uh yes transmission costs uh have
 
02:27:08.030 --> 02:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
increased and ISO New England does
 
02:27:08.040 --> 02:27:09.530 align:start position:0%
increased and ISO New England does
project

02:27:09.530 --> 02:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
project
 
02:27:11.150 --> 02:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
um additional transmission costs
 
02:27:14.929 --> 02:27:14.939 align:start position:0%
necessary to ensure reliability over the
 
02:27:18.230 --> 02:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
next next several years ISO New England
 
02:27:20.030 --> 02:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
also does an Energy Efficiency report
 
02:27:22.250 --> 02:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
each year indicating the amount of
 
02:27:25.190 --> 02:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency and its impact on the
 
02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:26.770 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency and its impact on the
uh

02:27:26.770 --> 02:27:26.780 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:27:31.490 --> 02:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
overall demand and and Peak demand and I
 
02:27:33.429 --> 02:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
can send a link to the
 
02:27:36.770 --> 02:27:36.780 align:start position:0%
committee of that report but it does
 
02:27:38.230 --> 02:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
indicate that
 
02:27:41.570 --> 02:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
the iso New England projects significant
 
02:27:44.830 --> 02:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
reductions in
 
02:27:47.750 --> 02:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
the need for additional transmission as
 
02:27:49.190 --> 02:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
a result of investments in Energy
 
02:27:53.570 --> 02:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and those Investments do
 
02:27:57.590 --> 02:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
have a significant uh impact on all
 
02:28:00.110 --> 02:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
ratepayers not just those who take
 
02:28:02.270 --> 02:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
advantage of the efficiency programs
 
02:28:03.530 --> 02:28:03.540 align:start position:0%
those who take advantage of the
 
02:28:06.309 --> 02:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
efficiency programs get a direct benefit
 
02:28:09.050 --> 02:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
but all of those investments in Energy
 
02:28:11.870 --> 02:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and reducing the peak do have
 
02:28:14.870 --> 02:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
a a beneficial impact on reducing
 
02:28:17.090 --> 02:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
transmission the need for additional
 
02:28:17.100 --> 02:28:20.510 align:start position:0%
transmission the need for additional
transmission

02:28:20.510 --> 02:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:20.520 --> 02:28:22.030 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

02:28:22.030 --> 02:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:28:24.770 --> 02:28:24.780 align:start position:0%
thank you um somewhat unrelated but
 
02:28:26.150 --> 02:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
could you also talk a little bit about
 
02:28:27.349 --> 02:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
what is actually
 
02:28:30.050 --> 02:28:30.060 align:start position:0%
um in these individual programs that are
 
02:28:34.190 --> 02:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
funded by Reggie how individual projects
 
02:28:37.370 --> 02:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
well I didn't uh Fontaine and I did
 
02:28:39.830 --> 02:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
provide this this slide and I do want to
 
02:28:42.050 --> 02:28:42.060 align:start position:0%
correct one one Minor error on it but it
 
02:28:43.190 --> 02:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
shows on one side the current
 
02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:44.450 align:start position:0%
shows on one side the current
Investments

02:28:44.450 --> 02:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
Investments
 
02:28:47.750 --> 02:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
from Reggie and uh if uh just beginning
 
02:28:50.030 --> 02:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
up at the upper left
 
02:28:52.429 --> 02:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
um we should use the figure 43 million
 
02:28:54.590 --> 02:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
dollars that's the New Hampshire portion
 
02:28:57.290 --> 02:28:57.300 align:start position:0%
of of Reggie Investments that's data
 
02:28:58.849 --> 02:28:58.859 align:start position:0%
from last August
 
02:29:00.590 --> 02:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
um that was the amount of Revenue that
 
02:29:02.750 --> 02:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire received
 
02:29:04.490 --> 02:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
um that money goes into the Energy
 
02:29:06.969 --> 02:29:06.979 align:start position:0%
Efficiency fund moving to the right
 
02:29:09.950 --> 02:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
there's approximately a third of a
 
02:29:11.809 --> 02:29:11.819 align:start position:0%
million dollars in administrative costs
 
02:29:14.630 --> 02:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
between us doe salaries and so on for Mr
 
02:29:18.530 --> 02:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
Fontaine and others a doe who do all the
 
02:29:21.590 --> 02:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
accounting for this then uh based on the
 
02:29:24.290 --> 02:29:24.300 align:start position:0%
dollar threshold that I spoke about the
 
02:29:26.570 --> 02:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
one dollar of each allowance that
 
02:29:28.790 --> 02:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
reflects on the left hand side moving
 
02:29:31.910 --> 02:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
down the column uh 3.21 million dollars
 
02:29:33.950 --> 02:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
goes into the Energy Efficiency programs
 
02:29:35.990 --> 02:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
in the utilities and that's broken up
 
02:29:39.230 --> 02:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
into the three boxes below
 
02:29:41.870 --> 02:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
um the alternative the all fuels program
 
02:29:45.469 --> 02:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
the low income program and the municipal
 
02:29:47.330 --> 02:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
and governments program
 
02:29:50.710 --> 02:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
and then uh third of that 43 million
 
02:29:54.889 --> 02:29:54.899 align:start position:0%
39.4 million goes into uh the rebates
 
02:29:56.990 --> 02:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
that go back to residential and
 
02:29:59.030 --> 02:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
Commercial customers
 
02:30:00.889 --> 02:30:00.899 align:start position:0%
um those do in a responsive question
 
02:30:02.690 --> 02:30:02.700 align:start position:0%
that was previously asked those do go
 
02:30:04.190 --> 02:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
back in the form
 
02:30:06.770 --> 02:30:06.780 align:start position:0%
of a decrease in the rate it's built
 
02:30:08.750 --> 02:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
into the rate you don't see an you don't
 
02:30:10.870 --> 02:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
see a rebate you don't get a check you
 
02:30:13.610 --> 02:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
uh those rebates
 
02:30:15.830 --> 02:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
um are are put back into the to the
 
02:30:18.950 --> 02:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
kitty so to speak and those rebates go
 
02:30:23.510 --> 02:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh to reduce the rate uh of of them and
 
02:30:25.790 --> 02:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
then under this bill I just want to
 
02:30:27.770 --> 02:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
indicate we did make one minor mistake
 
02:30:28.910 --> 02:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
here that
 
02:30:33.349 --> 02:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
um the uh uh what's in this this bill
 
02:30:36.170 --> 02:30:36.180 align:start position:0%
would repeal what is in uh this this box
 
02:30:36.180 --> 02:30:37.150 align:start position:0%
would repeal what is in uh this this box
Joe

02:30:37.150 --> 02:30:37.160 align:start position:0%
Joe
 
02:30:39.650 --> 02:30:39.660 align:start position:0%
this whole right side the whole right
 
02:30:42.349 --> 02:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
side okay so all of that money would
 
02:30:42.359 --> 02:30:43.429 align:start position:0%
side okay so all of that money would
then

02:30:43.429 --> 02:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:30:46.450 --> 02:30:46.460 align:start position:0%
um uh nah
 
02:30:48.650 --> 02:30:48.660 align:start position:0%
this reveals the rebates right yeah
 
02:30:50.410 --> 02:30:50.420 align:start position:0%
right yeah yeah
 
02:30:53.570 --> 02:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
so the whole whole 39.44 million would
 
02:30:56.330 --> 02:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
go over to the left box
 
02:30:58.370 --> 02:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:31:00.530 --> 02:31:00.540 align:start position:0%
um so again there's there's a minor
 
02:31:02.510 --> 02:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
mistake on this on the second page we'll
 
02:31:04.790 --> 02:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
correct that and send a revised chart to
 
02:31:07.610 --> 02:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:07.620 --> 02:31:09.349 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:31:09.349 --> 02:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:31:11.570 --> 02:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
could you help me uh
 
02:31:13.910 --> 02:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
understand if I made an error here when
 
02:31:17.510 --> 02:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
I said that uh that Reggie money doesn't
 
02:31:19.250 --> 02:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
go to New Hampshire saves was that
 
02:31:21.590 --> 02:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
incorrect is Reggie money in fact go to
 
02:31:23.270 --> 02:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire says the Reggie money
 
02:31:25.610 --> 02:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
under current statute does go into the
 
02:31:27.889 --> 02:31:27.899 align:start position:0%
programs run by the utilities
 
02:31:30.530 --> 02:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
um but the language that you pointed out
 
02:31:32.510 --> 02:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
is is an error because the Energy
 
02:31:34.550 --> 02:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
Efficiency resource standard I mean it's
 
02:31:36.710 --> 02:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
just a that language is not defined I
 
02:31:38.570 --> 02:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
don't think but the Energy Efficiency
 
02:31:40.130 --> 02:31:40.140 align:start position:0%
resource standard as you correctly
 
02:31:43.550 --> 02:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
pointed out does not exist the uh the
 
02:31:45.849 --> 02:31:45.859 align:start position:0%
current statute does say
 
02:31:47.889 --> 02:31:47.899 align:start position:0%
the one dollar
 
02:31:51.410 --> 02:31:51.420 align:start position:0%
under the threshold goes in as a
 
02:31:53.090 --> 02:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
supplement it goes into the money that
 
02:31:55.610 --> 02:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
is that is currently allocated from the
 
02:31:55.620 --> 02:31:57.590 align:start position:0%
is that is currently allocated from the
SBC

02:31:57.590 --> 02:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
SBC
 
02:32:00.590 --> 02:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire saves is funded by both
 
02:32:03.830 --> 02:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
Reggie money and SBC monies correct
 
02:32:06.290 --> 02:32:06.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification yes
 
02:32:08.450 --> 02:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
uh representative Doug Thomas has a
 
02:32:08.460 --> 02:32:09.230 align:start position:0%
uh representative Doug Thomas has a
question

02:32:09.230 --> 02:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:32:10.730 --> 02:32:10.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:32:12.469 --> 02:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
my question I just want a clarification
 
02:32:15.650 --> 02:32:15.660 align:start position:0%
on your last statement there regarding
 
02:32:15.660 --> 02:32:16.490 align:start position:0%
on your last statement there regarding
um

02:32:16.490 --> 02:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:21.230 --> 02:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
money's going into the um uh rate I
 
02:32:24.290 --> 02:32:24.300 align:start position:0%
guess for for utilities so if this bill
 
02:32:25.870 --> 02:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
were passed
 
02:32:29.809 --> 02:32:29.819 align:start position:0%
are you saying that the um that that
 
02:32:33.889 --> 02:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
would cause a increase in the rates
 
02:32:35.510 --> 02:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
because that money would no longer be
 
02:32:37.670 --> 02:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
subtracted from that and there are
 
02:32:40.250 --> 02:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
residents would see that as another rate
 
02:32:43.790 --> 02:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
increase by our utilities as Mr robes
 
02:32:45.950 --> 02:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
pointed out that there would be a
 
02:32:47.809 --> 02:32:47.819 align:start position:0%
short-term I think
 
02:32:49.849 --> 02:32:49.859 align:start position:0%
uh there's some confusion over
 
02:32:52.309 --> 02:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
short-term versus long term because
 
02:32:54.770 --> 02:32:54.780 align:start position:0%
um we've been speaking about short-term
 
02:32:58.309 --> 02:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
costs since 1999 2000 and there's been
 
02:33:00.230 --> 02:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
significant Investments that have gone
 
02:33:01.910 --> 02:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
into Energy Efficiency and are now
 
02:33:05.330 --> 02:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
actually reducing rates so but
 
02:33:08.389 --> 02:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
yes if this this bill would take money
 
02:33:10.130 --> 02:33:10.140 align:start position:0%
that is currently being rebated to
 
02:33:10.140 --> 02:33:11.410 align:start position:0%
that is currently being rebated to
customers

02:33:11.410 --> 02:33:11.420 align:start position:0%
customers
 
02:33:13.969 --> 02:33:13.979 align:start position:0%
and would reallocate it into Energy
 
02:33:16.490 --> 02:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs that provide a
 
02:33:20.090 --> 02:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
benefit over over time increasing the
 
02:33:23.090 --> 02:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
benefit that's already been received
 
02:33:26.690 --> 02:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
02:33:29.030 --> 02:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman just following up
 
02:33:29.040 --> 02:33:30.830 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman just following up
on

02:33:30.830 --> 02:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:33:33.050 --> 02:33:33.060 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas's question looking
 
02:33:35.870 --> 02:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
for more clarification
 
02:33:38.510 --> 02:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
electric rates
 
02:33:42.290 --> 02:33:42.300 align:start position:0%
on every customer's bills are
 
02:33:44.389 --> 02:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
there's about seven different items
 
02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
correct so eversource Unitil Liberty
 
02:33:48.960 --> 02:33:50.330 align:start position:0%
correct so eversource Unitil Liberty
there

02:33:50.330 --> 02:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:33:54.050 --> 02:33:54.060 align:start position:0%
rates are transmission and distribution
 
02:33:54.060 --> 02:33:56.090 align:start position:0%
rates are transmission and distribution
charges

02:33:56.090 --> 02:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
charges
 
02:33:58.250 --> 02:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
and there's of course the systems
 
02:33:59.630 --> 02:33:59.640 align:start position:0%
benefits charge
 
02:34:05.270 --> 02:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:08.270 --> 02:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
small sense or cents and fractions of
 
02:34:11.389 --> 02:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
sense so
 
02:34:15.530 --> 02:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
under current practice where the 43
 
02:34:20.330 --> 02:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
million in total is being rebated to
 
02:34:22.670 --> 02:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
all customers
 
02:34:25.969 --> 02:34:25.979 align:start position:0%
is it fair to say that the reduction in
 
02:34:28.969 --> 02:34:28.979 align:start position:0%
rate is probably in the third decimal
 
02:34:28.979 --> 02:34:30.230 align:start position:0%
rate is probably in the third decimal
place

02:34:30.230 --> 02:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:34:34.490 --> 02:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
on customers bills sure
 
02:34:36.590 --> 02:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
in accordance with the report that we
 
02:34:38.510 --> 02:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
provided to the legislature last October
 
02:34:42.170 --> 02:34:42.180 align:start position:0%
and Based on data from last summer the
 
02:34:45.889 --> 02:34:45.899 align:start position:0%
uh the rate the input to the rate as a
 
02:34:47.530 --> 02:34:47.540 align:start position:0%
result of the Reggie
 
02:34:50.510 --> 02:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
revenues and that cost as I mentioned is
 
02:34:51.950 --> 02:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
embedded in the wholesale cost of
 
02:34:53.570 --> 02:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
electricity when it's purchased from the
 
02:34:53.580 --> 02:34:54.590 align:start position:0%
electricity when it's purchased from the
supplier

02:34:54.590 --> 02:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
supplier
 
02:34:59.330 --> 02:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
so that cost was approximately 21 cents
 
02:35:02.870 --> 02:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
on an average bill this bill would
 
02:35:07.250 --> 02:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
reallocate that 21 cents per month to
 
02:35:07.260 --> 02:35:09.910 align:start position:0%
reallocate that 21 cents per month to
um

02:35:09.910 --> 02:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:11.809 --> 02:35:11.819 align:start position:0%
investments in the Energy Efficiency
 
02:35:11.819 --> 02:35:13.550 align:start position:0%
investments in the Energy Efficiency
program

02:35:13.550 --> 02:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:35:13.560 --> 02:35:15.349 align:start position:0%
program
so

02:35:15.349 --> 02:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:18.170 --> 02:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
do you need a follow-up could I yes so
 
02:35:21.530 --> 02:35:21.540 align:start position:0%
to clarify the
 
02:35:23.929 --> 02:35:23.939 align:start position:0%
difference on someone's on the average
 
02:35:26.570 --> 02:35:26.580 align:start position:0%
bill which I believe you always use 600
 
02:35:28.730 --> 02:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours consumption of 600
 
02:35:30.650 --> 02:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours per year
 
02:35:34.429 --> 02:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
the change in their bill that they would
 
02:35:39.290 --> 02:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:45.349 --> 02:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
not given would be 21 cents per month
 
02:35:48.530 --> 02:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
on their bill in in Aggregate and that
 
02:35:51.290 --> 02:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
would ultimately again that money's yeah
 
02:35:53.510 --> 02:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
21 cents per month on their bill it
 
02:35:55.490 --> 02:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
would be 21 cents on the bill yes
 
02:36:01.910 --> 02:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:04.309 --> 02:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
02:36:06.349 --> 02:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:36:08.570 --> 02:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to want to follow up on a
 
02:36:11.750 --> 02:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
on a comment that you made uh just a few
 
02:36:14.389 --> 02:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
minutes ago when you talked about you I
 
02:36:16.849 --> 02:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
think you mentioned that
 
02:36:20.030 --> 02:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
um there has been that the Investments
 
02:36:22.070 --> 02:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
that were made
 
02:36:25.969 --> 02:36:25.979 align:start position:0%
uh from the money in Reggie have started
 
02:36:29.870 --> 02:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
to have a noticeable impact on rates
 
02:36:33.830 --> 02:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
can you give us any sense of what that
 
02:36:36.410 --> 02:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
is I mean in terms of
 
02:36:39.349 --> 02:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
um you know cents per month on someone's
 
02:36:39.359 --> 02:36:40.849 align:start position:0%
um you know cents per month on someone's
bill

02:36:40.849 --> 02:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:36:44.150 --> 02:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh I don't have that information with me
 
02:36:46.969 --> 02:36:46.979 align:start position:0%
at the moment but I can certainly
 
02:36:46.979 --> 02:36:48.110 align:start position:0%
at the moment but I can certainly
um

02:36:48.110 --> 02:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:51.110 --> 02:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
take a look at it I will refer you also
 
02:36:53.750 --> 02:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
to the Reggie program
 
02:36:56.809 --> 02:36:56.819 align:start position:0%
annual report which outlines the costs
 
02:36:58.090 --> 02:36:58.100 align:start position:0%
and benefits
 
02:37:02.389 --> 02:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
received from Reggie Investments for the
 
02:37:06.770 --> 02:37:06.780 align:start position:0%
region as a whole and the uh and and New
 
02:37:08.630 --> 02:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we can we can supply you
 
02:37:10.370 --> 02:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
with a link to that like I can't speak
 
02:37:12.250 --> 02:37:12.260 align:start position:0%
to the specific number at the moment
 
02:37:15.770 --> 02:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh okay let's move on
 
02:37:19.370 --> 02:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a question
 
02:37:21.950 --> 02:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I I just want
 
02:37:25.670 --> 02:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
to confirm your your statement that you
 
02:37:28.429 --> 02:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
take no or the Des takes no position on
 
02:37:31.969 --> 02:37:31.979 align:start position:0%
whether or not this uh bill should move
 
02:37:34.610 --> 02:37:34.620 align:start position:0%
forward uh it is the legislature's
 
02:37:37.969 --> 02:37:37.979 align:start position:0%
responsibility to decide where these
 
02:37:41.330 --> 02:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
monies go uh that is correct yes thank
 
02:37:44.090 --> 02:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:47.210 --> 02:37:47.220 align:start position:0%
uh who's next here representative Wendy
 
02:37:47.220 --> 02:37:47.929 align:start position:0%
uh who's next here representative Wendy
Thomas

02:37:47.929 --> 02:37:47.939 align:start position:0%
Thomas
 
02:37:49.790 --> 02:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:37:51.650 --> 02:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for being here um you
 
02:37:53.870 --> 02:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
testified earlier that Des manages the
 
02:37:55.910 --> 02:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
Reggie program and oversees the auctions
 
02:37:55.920 --> 02:37:57.230 align:start position:0%
Reggie program and oversees the auctions
yes

02:37:57.230 --> 02:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:38:00.050 --> 02:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
um so is it fair to say that um Des is
 
02:38:01.550 --> 02:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
very involved in the oversight and
 
02:38:04.130 --> 02:38:04.140 align:start position:0%
management of many aspects of energy
 
02:38:07.730 --> 02:38:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:09.469 --> 02:38:09.479 align:start position:0%
responsibility lies with the Department
 
02:38:11.870 --> 02:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
of Energy Des
 
02:38:15.290 --> 02:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
prior to the Department's Inception a
 
02:38:17.750 --> 02:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
few a few years ago
 
02:38:20.510 --> 02:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
did provide a significant amount of
 
02:38:23.690 --> 02:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
testimony on on legislative issues
 
02:38:27.590 --> 02:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
related to energy as there's as related
 
02:38:30.650 --> 02:38:30.660 align:start position:0%
to its impact on the environment and
 
02:38:34.790 --> 02:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
um uh and and so uh but again in general
 
02:38:36.590 --> 02:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
we defer to the Department of energy at
 
02:38:39.349 --> 02:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
this point in time for their input on
 
02:38:43.550 --> 02:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
um energy costs yes thank you um so can
 
02:38:45.950 --> 02:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
you just outline the responsibilities
 
02:38:49.910 --> 02:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
Des has for energy in New Hampshire sure
 
02:38:49.920 --> 02:38:50.510 align:start position:0%
Des has for energy in New Hampshire sure
um

02:38:50.510 --> 02:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:54.610 --> 02:38:54.620 align:start position:0%
Reggie is again a an
 
02:38:59.270 --> 02:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
alliance of 11 states the Reggie
 
02:39:02.030 --> 02:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
Inc board of directors is composed of
 
02:39:04.790 --> 02:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
one energy agency and one environmental
 
02:39:07.490 --> 02:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
agency from each state in New Hampshire
 
02:39:09.889 --> 02:39:09.899 align:start position:0%
that is commissioner Bob Scott of the
 
02:39:11.510 --> 02:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services for
 
02:39:16.429 --> 02:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
environment and uh commissioner Jared
 
02:39:20.570 --> 02:39:20.580 align:start position:0%
from the Department of from the
 
02:39:23.150 --> 02:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
Department of energy that board guides
 
02:39:26.510 --> 02:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
the overall Reggie program
 
02:39:29.809 --> 02:39:29.819 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire Des has responsibility
 
02:39:32.270 --> 02:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
under statute for our participation in
 
02:39:35.510 --> 02:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
the auctions and
 
02:39:37.910 --> 02:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
um the statute is very specific about
 
02:39:41.389 --> 02:39:41.399 align:start position:0%
our requirements and and so on and then
 
02:39:43.910 --> 02:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
when that Revenue comes in that money
 
02:39:45.230 --> 02:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
goes into the efficiency Energy
 
02:39:47.090 --> 02:39:47.100 align:start position:0%
Efficiency fund and the Energy
 
02:39:49.730 --> 02:39:49.740 align:start position:0%
Efficiency fund is
 
02:39:51.710 --> 02:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
um the purview of the Department of
 
02:39:54.469 --> 02:39:54.479 align:start position:0%
energy and again the statute directs how
 
02:39:56.570 --> 02:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
that how those funds should be used and
 
02:39:58.370 --> 02:39:58.380 align:start position:0%
this bill would affect that
 
02:40:00.650 --> 02:40:00.660 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh Mr Fitzgerald now
 
02:40:02.450 --> 02:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
to remind members that when you're
 
02:40:03.950 --> 02:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
asking questions you want to be asking
 
02:40:06.110 --> 02:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
questions about the bill in front of us
 
02:40:08.510 --> 02:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
not general questions
 
02:40:11.210 --> 02:40:11.220 align:start position:0%
representative reshni has a question
 
02:40:12.889 --> 02:40:12.899 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question
 
02:40:14.330 --> 02:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
02:40:17.270 --> 02:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
so this this will increase the money
 
02:40:20.210 --> 02:40:20.220 align:start position:0%
from 3 million to 43 million starting
 
02:40:23.630 --> 02:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2024.
 
02:40:25.730 --> 02:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
um how would that's a large increase
 
02:40:27.710 --> 02:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
would the department be able to spend
 
02:40:29.570 --> 02:40:29.580 align:start position:0%
that much money and what happens to the
 
02:40:33.590 --> 02:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:35.090 --> 02:40:35.100 align:start position:0%
um I think that question is better
 
02:40:36.950 --> 02:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
suited for the Department of energy but
 
02:40:39.349 --> 02:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
I would say that I certainly believe
 
02:40:42.590 --> 02:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
they would be prepared to in in my
 
02:40:44.750 --> 02:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
opinion they would be prepared to to
 
02:40:46.910 --> 02:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
invest that money is directed by
 
02:40:49.190 --> 02:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
investment into programs that already
 
02:40:52.429 --> 02:40:52.439 align:start position:0%
exist so it would just be uh an influx
 
02:40:55.910 --> 02:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
of of cash and um the programs are
 
02:40:57.530 --> 02:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
generally administered by the utilities
 
02:40:59.389 --> 02:40:59.399 align:start position:0%
they would need to gear up for
 
02:41:01.309 --> 02:41:01.319 align:start position:0%
additional investment but I don't I
 
02:41:03.410 --> 02:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
don't think the department would have a
 
02:41:05.570 --> 02:41:05.580 align:start position:0%
significant impact but I defer to Mr
 
02:41:08.950 --> 02:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:11.990 --> 02:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
so I would follow up on that by asking
 
02:41:15.050 --> 02:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
the question if a three-year try in a
 
02:41:17.929 --> 02:41:17.939 align:start position:0%
triennium Energy Efficiency plan was in
 
02:41:17.939 --> 02:41:19.790 align:start position:0%
triennium Energy Efficiency plan was in
effect

02:41:19.790 --> 02:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
effect
 
02:41:21.950 --> 02:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
which already had budgets for the three
 
02:41:24.590 --> 02:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
years of the program yes what a big
 
02:41:28.210 --> 02:41:28.220 align:start position:0%
infusion of cash like this uh
 
02:41:30.650 --> 02:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
necessitate a
 
02:41:34.370 --> 02:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
a redo a rebuild a revision of the
 
02:41:38.870 --> 02:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:41.210 --> 02:41:41.220 align:start position:0%
um without benefit of particular
 
02:41:43.969 --> 02:41:43.979 align:start position:0%
expertise I would say in general I would
 
02:41:46.610 --> 02:41:46.620 align:start position:0%
think so but I again I would defer to I
 
02:41:48.050 --> 02:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
think the registry money is an addition
 
02:41:50.809 --> 02:41:50.819 align:start position:0%
to that yeah I mean the reg the Reggie
 
02:41:53.570 --> 02:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
money is is goes into the same pot of
 
02:41:57.170 --> 02:41:57.180 align:start position:0%
money that the SBC goes to so
 
02:41:59.210 --> 02:41:59.220 align:start position:0%
um it would be a significant increase
 
02:42:01.130 --> 02:42:01.140 align:start position:0%
there would be a significant additional
 
02:42:03.530 --> 02:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
amount of money available in that pot to
 
02:42:06.410 --> 02:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
be distributed to the utilities and you
 
02:42:08.870 --> 02:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
know that would go then into Energy
 
02:42:13.429 --> 02:42:13.439 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs contractors that do
 
02:42:16.370 --> 02:42:16.380 align:start position:0%
Audits and Energy Efficiency uh uh
 
02:42:18.770 --> 02:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
installations and so on but I I don't
 
02:42:18.780 --> 02:42:19.610 align:start position:0%
installations and so on but I I don't
think

02:42:19.610 --> 02:42:19.620 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:42:22.190 --> 02:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
the amount of money would have a
 
02:42:24.110 --> 02:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
significant impact on
 
02:42:26.570 --> 02:42:26.580 align:start position:0%
how the state responds that the
 
02:42:28.429 --> 02:42:28.439 align:start position:0%
utilities would need to gear up and the
 
02:42:31.969 --> 02:42:31.979 align:start position:0%
contractors right thank you
 
02:42:34.730 --> 02:42:34.740 align:start position:0%
okay I don't see any further hands up so
 
02:42:36.770 --> 02:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
I thank you to gentlemen for being here
 
02:42:39.710 --> 02:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
thank you and I would like to close the
 
02:42:43.490 --> 02:42:43.500 align:start position:0%

back to the Tuesday January 24th session
 
04:01:30.349 --> 04:01:30.359 align:start position:0%
of the science technology and energy
 
04:01:33.050 --> 04:01:33.060 align:start position:0%
committee we will be hearing
 
04:01:35.450 --> 04:01:35.460 align:start position:0%
and holding two public hearings this
 
04:01:35.460 --> 04:01:36.469 align:start position:0%
and holding two public hearings this
afternoon

04:01:36.469 --> 04:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
afternoon

the First on House Bill
 
04:01:42.650 --> 04:01:42.660 align:start position:0%
576 establishing an energy conservation
 
04:01:42.660 --> 04:01:43.849 align:start position:0%
576 establishing an energy conservation
program

04:01:43.849 --> 04:01:43.859 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:01:46.929 --> 04:01:46.939 align:start position:0%
and an energy conservation project fund
 
04:01:50.269 --> 04:01:50.279 align:start position:0%
and establishing the state Pace Reserve
 
04:01:50.279 --> 04:01:52.010 align:start position:0%
and establishing the state Pace Reserve
fund

04:01:52.010 --> 04:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
fund
 
04:01:53.870 --> 04:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
after that public hearing we'll hold
 
04:01:56.590 --> 04:01:56.600 align:start position:0%
another public hearing on House Bill 92
 
04:01:58.910 --> 04:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
requiring the adoption of innovative
 
04:02:01.490 --> 04:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
vehicle emission standards pursuant to
 
04:02:06.710 --> 04:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
section 177 of the federal Clean Air Act
 
04:02:10.490 --> 04:02:10.500 align:start position:0%
we were originally scheduled to hear or
 
04:02:12.530 --> 04:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
to have an executive session on four
 
04:02:15.530 --> 04:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
bills at four o'clock this afternoon
 
04:02:22.729 --> 04:02:22.739 align:start position:0%
those bills were HB 633 HB 211 HB 234
 
04:02:26.750 --> 04:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
and HB 246.
 
04:02:28.790 --> 04:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
the executive session on those four
 
04:02:33.950 --> 04:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
bills will be canceled and rescheduled
 
04:02:37.309 --> 04:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
so watch your calendar on Thursday of
 
04:02:38.630 --> 04:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
this week
 
04:02:41.510 --> 04:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
for information about the rescheduled
 
04:02:45.530 --> 04:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
executive sessions on those four bills
 
04:02:47.510 --> 04:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
why are we doing that because we haven't
 
04:02:50.030 --> 04:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
heard those four bills yet we were going
 
04:02:52.370 --> 04:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
to hear them yesterday but that didn't
 
04:02:54.229 --> 04:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
happen so
 
04:02:56.269 --> 04:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
we will be hearing them in the future
 
04:02:59.269 --> 04:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
and then scheduling exec sessions after
 
04:03:01.969 --> 04:03:01.979 align:start position:0%
hearing those bills
 
04:03:04.969 --> 04:03:04.979 align:start position:0%
so with that I would like to now open
 
04:03:09.229 --> 04:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on House Bill 576
 
04:03:11.510 --> 04:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
establishing an energy conservation
 
04:03:13.670 --> 04:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
program and an energy conservation
 
04:03:16.670 --> 04:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
project fund and establishing the state
 
04:03:19.550 --> 04:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
Pace Reserve fund
 
04:03:22.910 --> 04:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
and before I introduce the bill sponsor
 
04:03:26.929 --> 04:03:26.939 align:start position:0%
I want to refresh everyone's memory that
 
04:03:29.330 --> 04:03:29.340 align:start position:0%
the committee cannot accept
 
04:03:32.929 --> 04:03:32.939 align:start position:0%
an amendment to a bill until
 
04:03:35.210 --> 04:03:35.220 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
04:03:37.849 --> 04:03:37.859 align:start position:0%
therefore if you're introducing a bill
 
04:03:39.710 --> 04:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
and you already have an amendment to the
 
04:03:41.750 --> 04:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
bill you can talk about it in general
 
04:03:44.389 --> 04:03:44.399 align:start position:0%
terms but you can't refer to the
 
04:03:46.670 --> 04:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
amendment specifically
 
04:03:48.769 --> 04:03:48.779 align:start position:0%
so with that I'd like to turn the floor
 
04:03:53.269 --> 04:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
over to representative mangaputi welcome
 
04:03:56.150 --> 04:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you committee
 
04:04:01.090 --> 04:04:01.100 align:start position:0%
members for presenting the bill HB
 
04:04:06.410 --> 04:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
576 I will try to give an
 
04:04:10.010 --> 04:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
um my PhD thesis presentation of PACE
 
04:04:10.020 --> 04:04:11.650 align:start position:0%
um my PhD thesis presentation of PACE
program

04:04:11.650 --> 04:04:11.660 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:04:14.330 --> 04:04:14.340 align:start position:0%
because that's how much work I had to
 
04:04:18.130 --> 04:04:18.140 align:start position:0%
put in to kind of make it
 
04:04:20.769 --> 04:04:20.779 align:start position:0%
understandable in our
 
04:04:25.250 --> 04:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
state what we have right now configured
 
04:04:25.260 --> 04:04:26.570 align:start position:0%
state what we have right now configured
so

04:04:26.570 --> 04:04:26.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:04:26.580 --> 04:04:27.410 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:04:27.410 --> 04:04:27.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:30.710 --> 04:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
HB 576
 
04:04:33.490 --> 04:04:33.500 align:start position:0%
if you re recall
 
04:04:38.630 --> 04:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
a similar bill I had brought in uh
 
04:04:42.469 --> 04:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
two two terms ago but let me explain a
 
04:04:45.110 --> 04:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
little bit of what PACE program is why
 
04:04:47.110 --> 04:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
the this bill is
 
04:04:50.570 --> 04:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
necessary especially given our situation
 
04:04:54.830 --> 04:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
in the state where we need housing we
 
04:04:58.929 --> 04:04:58.939 align:start position:0%
need energy cost to go down and
 
04:05:01.250 --> 04:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and federal funding
 
04:05:02.590 --> 04:05:02.600 align:start position:0%
that's available
 
04:05:06.170 --> 04:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
for all these purposes we need an
 
04:05:09.830 --> 04:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation at the state level
 
04:05:14.689 --> 04:05:14.699 align:start position:0%
so the local communities can adopt this
 
04:05:19.330 --> 04:05:19.340 align:start position:0%
thank you so Pace programs are typically
 
04:05:23.570 --> 04:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
enabled through State legislation and
 
04:05:27.650 --> 04:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
authorized at the local government level
 
04:05:30.229 --> 04:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
commercial pace which this bill
 
04:05:33.469 --> 04:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
addresses property assessed clean energy
 
04:05:37.309 --> 04:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
is a financing mechanism to allow
 
04:05:40.189 --> 04:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
commercial property owners to finance
 
04:05:43.429 --> 04:05:43.439 align:start position:0%
energy Improvement for existing building
 
04:05:45.729 --> 04:05:45.739 align:start position:0%
over a long term
 
04:05:49.010 --> 04:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
it also helps
 
04:05:49.020 --> 04:05:50.389 align:start position:0%
it also helps
uh

04:05:50.389 --> 04:05:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:05:54.110 --> 04:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
this the rate the pace
 
04:05:58.189 --> 04:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
um investment of financing if it is done
 
04:06:01.790 --> 04:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
through Pace the rates are different
 
04:06:05.570 --> 04:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
lower and because they are attached to
 
04:06:09.229 --> 04:06:09.239 align:start position:0%
the property itself which means there is
 
04:06:12.769 --> 04:06:12.779 align:start position:0%
a less risk of default so it is
 
04:06:12.779 --> 04:06:14.290 align:start position:0%
a less risk of default so it is
uh

04:06:14.290 --> 04:06:14.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:06:18.349 --> 04:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
property assessed clean energy
 
04:06:22.010 --> 04:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
in typical PACE program allows of
 
04:06:24.769 --> 04:06:24.779 align:start position:0%
commercial industrial and multi-family
 
04:06:28.729 --> 04:06:28.739 align:start position:0%
buildings over five units not under five
 
04:06:32.769 --> 04:06:32.779 align:start position:0%
units over five units to make energy
 
04:06:36.050 --> 04:06:36.060 align:start position:0%
improvement over a long term up to 20
 
04:06:36.060 --> 04:06:37.189 align:start position:0%
improvement over a long term up to 20
years

04:06:37.189 --> 04:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:06:40.910 --> 04:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
the loan is repaid via a municipal
 
04:06:44.150 --> 04:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
betterment assessment on the property
 
04:06:46.670 --> 04:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
and attached to the property so the
 
04:06:49.309 --> 04:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
benefits and payments flow to the
 
04:06:52.670 --> 04:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
subsequent purchaser so it stays with
 
04:06:56.410 --> 04:06:56.420 align:start position:0%
the purchaser under Pace financing
 
04:07:00.490 --> 04:07:00.500 align:start position:0%
eligible energy improvements include
 
04:07:04.070 --> 04:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
energy consumption reduction
 
04:07:07.450 --> 04:07:07.460 align:start position:0%
which is conservation and efficiency
 
04:07:11.110 --> 04:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
renewable energy gas line extensions
 
04:07:15.530 --> 04:07:15.540 align:start position:0%
sewer and water line uh changes so
 
04:07:15.540 --> 04:07:16.929 align:start position:0%
sewer and water line uh changes so
basically

04:07:16.929 --> 04:07:16.939 align:start position:0%
basically
 
04:07:20.269 --> 04:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
infrastructure modification
 
04:07:23.689 --> 04:07:23.699 align:start position:0%
more than 37 States in Washington DC
 
04:07:26.689 --> 04:07:26.699 align:start position:0%
have adopted sea Pace enabling
 
04:07:29.450 --> 04:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
legislation because of the opportunities
 
04:07:32.570 --> 04:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
for investment in local businesses
 
04:07:38.090 --> 04:07:38.100 align:start position:0%
energy and cost saving and job creation
 
04:07:41.210 --> 04:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
we all know that energy cost has gone up
 
04:07:45.410 --> 04:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
tremendously and homeowners to business
 
04:07:47.469 --> 04:07:47.479 align:start position:0%
owners to
 
04:07:50.750 --> 04:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
big companies are wrestling with that
 
04:07:54.710 --> 04:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
and trying to make sense of how they can
 
04:07:56.929 --> 04:07:56.939 align:start position:0%
um contain or
 
04:08:02.570 --> 04:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
invest in improvements okay and simply a
 
04:08:07.370 --> 04:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
put c-pace uses borrowed Capital to pay
 
04:08:10.670 --> 04:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
for The Upfront costs associated with
 
04:08:13.670 --> 04:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and renewable energy
 
04:08:16.689 --> 04:08:16.699 align:start position:0%
improvements unlike other project
 
04:08:20.090 --> 04:08:20.100 align:start position:0%
financing The Borrowed capital is repaid
 
04:08:23.750 --> 04:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
over a time over time via voluntary tax
 
04:08:23.760 --> 04:08:25.309 align:start position:0%
over a time over time via voluntary tax
assessment

04:08:25.309 --> 04:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
04:08:29.389 --> 04:08:29.399 align:start position:0%
so and then you have a handout
 
04:08:33.950 --> 04:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
um I do have the you know an amendment
 
04:08:38.269 --> 04:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
that I try to bring in but you have the
 
04:08:41.570 --> 04:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
copy of it and uh the other one I want
 
04:08:43.849 --> 04:08:43.859 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
04:08:46.189 --> 04:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
look at I want you to look at is
 
04:08:49.309 --> 04:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
residential property assessed clean
 
04:08:49.319 --> 04:08:50.349 align:start position:0%
residential property assessed clean
energy

04:08:50.349 --> 04:08:50.359 align:start position:0%
energy
 
04:08:54.429 --> 04:08:54.439 align:start position:0%
this is in existence
 
04:08:57.590 --> 04:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
in 33 States
 
04:08:59.929 --> 04:08:59.939 align:start position:0%
and if you see
 
04:09:04.670 --> 04:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is in early stages
 
04:09:06.349 --> 04:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
on the map
 
04:09:10.670 --> 04:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
this is because in 2015 there were
 
04:09:14.929 --> 04:09:14.939 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a PACE program that existed
 
04:09:18.469 --> 04:09:18.479 align:start position:0%
that was privately instituted and
 
04:09:21.910 --> 04:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
implemented through johnsonwood
 
04:09:25.309 --> 04:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
foundation and there was a person
 
04:09:28.570 --> 04:09:28.580 align:start position:0%
that was uh
 
04:09:31.969 --> 04:09:31.979 align:start position:0%
employed and and her name first name was
 
04:09:33.950 --> 04:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
Lauren I don't remember the last name
 
04:09:37.309 --> 04:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
now and there are two communities that
 
04:09:40.929 --> 04:09:40.939 align:start position:0%
adopted that somewhat of a PACE program
 
04:09:44.990 --> 04:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh because state had enabled that was
 
04:09:48.530 --> 04:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
Nashua and Dover to communities that
 
04:09:51.290 --> 04:09:51.300 align:start position:0%
adopted that and the person was
 
04:09:53.990 --> 04:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for the fund and execution
 
04:09:57.950 --> 04:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
and all that when she left the state
 
04:09:59.809 --> 04:09:59.819 align:start position:0%
it went with her
 
04:10:04.070 --> 04:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
so last time I tried to recreate that
 
04:10:07.250 --> 04:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
and bring that back and there was a lot
 
04:10:11.210 --> 04:10:11.220 align:start position:0%
of hurdles and I this time I've tried to
 
04:10:15.349 --> 04:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
make it more an enabling so again I want
 
04:10:18.769 --> 04:10:18.779 align:start position:0%
to emphasize that unless
 
04:10:23.050 --> 04:10:23.060 align:start position:0%
State puts an enabling legislation
 
04:10:28.010 --> 04:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
to use the state enabled program funding
 
04:10:31.130 --> 04:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
that's Federal Department of energy is
 
04:10:34.370 --> 04:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
funneling money for you know channeling
 
04:10:37.969 --> 04:10:37.979 align:start position:0%
money uh to the states
 
04:10:40.370 --> 04:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
unless we have a state enable
 
04:10:43.849 --> 04:10:43.859 align:start position:0%
legislation we no community in New
 
04:10:46.250 --> 04:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can access it
 
04:10:51.410 --> 04:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
so this is what um I am trying to show
 
04:10:54.410 --> 04:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
and there's also the residential
 
04:11:00.650 --> 04:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
property is not my bill that is our pace
 
04:11:03.309 --> 04:11:03.319 align:start position:0%
C basis commercial
 
04:11:06.290 --> 04:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
uh property assessed clean energy
 
04:11:09.950 --> 04:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
program cbase is what my bill addresses
 
04:11:12.830 --> 04:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
and that's why it's five
 
04:11:12.840 --> 04:11:14.030 align:start position:0%
and that's why it's five
um

04:11:14.030 --> 04:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:18.950 --> 04:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh units or more and Senator Waters is a
 
04:11:21.110 --> 04:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor and I talked to him
 
04:11:23.510 --> 04:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
personally he would have loved to come
 
04:11:26.809 --> 04:11:26.819 align:start position:0%
here and testify but he has no heat or
 
04:11:29.809 --> 04:11:29.819 align:start position:0%
electricity at his home so he said I
 
04:11:31.910 --> 04:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
cannot make it to the state and I can't
 
04:11:34.189 --> 04:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
even log in because there's no
 
04:11:37.370 --> 04:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
electricity so he apologizes for that
 
04:11:40.670 --> 04:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
but he's in support we need this and
 
04:11:43.849 --> 04:11:43.859 align:start position:0%
especially with taking in totality of
 
04:11:48.710 --> 04:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
the housing and new constructions if the
 
04:11:51.410 --> 04:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
new constructions for housing
 
04:11:55.729 --> 04:11:55.739 align:start position:0%
has Energy Efficiency conservation and
 
04:11:58.570 --> 04:11:58.580 align:start position:0%
renewable more than 40 percent
 
04:12:03.050 --> 04:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
Pace investment will come in so the pace
 
04:12:05.750 --> 04:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
investment or Pace will make it
 
04:12:10.910 --> 04:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
affordable for all income residents if
 
04:12:14.090 --> 04:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
it is through pace for Energy Efficiency
 
04:12:18.410 --> 04:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
so that's in a nutshell uh and I can
 
04:12:23.510 --> 04:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:26.150 --> 04:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for introducing
 
04:12:27.410 --> 04:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:12:27.420 --> 04:12:29.870 align:start position:0%
this bill
and

04:12:29.870 --> 04:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:12:32.689 --> 04:12:32.699 align:start position:0%
I just need you to
 
04:12:36.889 --> 04:12:36.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:40.070 --> 04:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
we heard a very similar Bill introduced
 
04:12:42.229 --> 04:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
by yourself last year
 
04:12:42.239 --> 04:12:44.090 align:start position:0%
by yourself last year
and

04:12:44.090 --> 04:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:12:45.889 --> 04:12:45.899 align:start position:0%
there was some question about whether
 
04:12:48.110 --> 04:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
you might personally profit from the
 
04:12:50.510 --> 04:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
passage of such a bill because of some
 
04:12:53.510 --> 04:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
real estate Investments or or
 
04:12:57.349 --> 04:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
companies that you had association with
 
04:13:00.050 --> 04:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
can you assure us that that's not the
 
04:13:02.570 --> 04:13:02.580 align:start position:0%
case uh in the in this particular bill
 
04:13:06.170 --> 04:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
this year I have already disclosed my
 
04:13:08.750 --> 04:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I have a consultancy called Shanti
 
04:13:11.510 --> 04:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
energy consultancy what the consultancy
 
04:13:14.510 --> 04:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
does is brings these people to our
 
04:13:18.950 --> 04:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
community and it's not we I'm not the
 
04:13:22.130 --> 04:13:22.140 align:start position:0%
investing person our company is not the
 
04:13:25.490 --> 04:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
investor I'm not the thing so I have
 
04:13:28.490 --> 04:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
dealt with the I've already talked to
 
04:13:32.330 --> 04:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
Rich Lambert and it uh disclose that and
 
04:13:35.809 --> 04:13:35.819 align:start position:0%
I've also talked to the clerk and you
 
04:13:38.330 --> 04:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
know I have if there is a bill very
 
04:13:40.670 --> 04:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
specifically that
 
04:13:43.610 --> 04:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
you know this is an enabling Bell so it
 
04:13:46.510 --> 04:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
is not a bill that would
 
04:13:50.630 --> 04:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
directly respond to any particular uh
 
04:13:54.710 --> 04:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
project that's on the dock so that is
 
04:13:57.349 --> 04:13:57.359 align:start position:0%
and I have it's there's full disclosure
 
04:14:01.250 --> 04:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
full transparency and this I if I could
 
04:14:04.189 --> 04:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
just further that saying if I was a
 
04:14:07.189 --> 04:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
doctor and there was medical bills or
 
04:14:10.250 --> 04:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
DHHS bills which would help with the
 
04:14:13.309 --> 04:14:13.319 align:start position:0%
medical field it's the similar situation
 
04:14:18.229 --> 04:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
so that doctor legislator will not
 
04:14:21.469 --> 04:14:21.479 align:start position:0%
you know it's not personal gain
 
04:14:24.650 --> 04:14:24.660 align:start position:0%
good I got it and thank you for clearing
 
04:14:26.990 --> 04:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
that with uh Rich Lambert and with the
 
04:14:29.929 --> 04:14:29.939 align:start position:0%
house clerk really appreciate that
 
04:14:33.410 --> 04:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
so my next question is about
 
04:14:36.769 --> 04:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
putting a a lien on system benefits
 
04:14:40.370 --> 04:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
charge funds to further secure energy
 
04:14:42.950 --> 04:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
project bonds
 
04:14:46.490 --> 04:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
this is mentioned in the definition of
 
04:14:50.349 --> 04:14:50.359 align:start position:0%
financing order on page
 
04:14:50.359 --> 04:14:52.070 align:start position:0%
financing order on page
uh

04:14:52.070 --> 04:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:14:54.650 --> 04:14:54.660 align:start position:0%
two I guess line
 
04:14:57.110 --> 04:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
24 and then it's talked about
 
04:15:00.769 --> 04:15:00.779 align:start position:0%
extensively on page well now this says
 
04:15:02.330 --> 04:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
page two
 
04:15:04.429 --> 04:15:04.439 align:start position:0%
but I guess the first reference was page
 
04:15:07.370 --> 04:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
one second reference is page two line
 
04:15:07.380 --> 04:15:10.490 align:start position:0%
one second reference is page two line
29.

04:15:10.490 --> 04:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:12.469 --> 04:15:12.479 align:start position:0%
I'm having understanding uh problem
 
04:15:13.969 --> 04:15:13.979 align:start position:0%
understanding how this would work
 
04:15:18.950 --> 04:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
because the way SBC funds are used by
 
04:15:21.170 --> 04:15:21.180 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire saves program
 
04:15:24.410 --> 04:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
they create triennium Energy Efficiency
 
04:15:28.010 --> 04:15:28.020 align:start position:0%
plans and each year of the three years
 
04:15:31.910 --> 04:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:34.070 --> 04:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
if some of those system benefits charge
 
04:15:37.090 --> 04:15:37.100 align:start position:0%
funds were
 
04:15:40.910 --> 04:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
used as a lien on some other
 
04:15:45.229 --> 04:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:48.650 --> 04:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
could that and would that disrupt
 
04:15:52.309 --> 04:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
potentially the triennium Energy
 
04:15:55.490 --> 04:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
Efficiency budgets and how would the
 
04:15:58.490 --> 04:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
utilities deal with that problem
 
04:16:03.050 --> 04:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh Mr chair
 
04:16:03.060 --> 04:16:04.030 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh Mr chair
um

04:16:04.030 --> 04:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:08.210 --> 04:16:08.220 align:start position:0%
my amendment that I have put forth
 
04:16:10.429 --> 04:16:10.439 align:start position:0%
addresses some of the thing the biggest
 
04:16:13.610 --> 04:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
issue you brought up is very relevant
 
04:16:16.849 --> 04:16:16.859 align:start position:0%
because because of our stack tax
 
04:16:19.790 --> 04:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
structure in New Hampshire it's very
 
04:16:23.990 --> 04:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
difficult to establish uh
 
04:16:27.950 --> 04:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
um lean for private Equity or private
 
04:16:34.130 --> 04:16:34.140 align:start position:0%
investor if they're investing in Pace so
 
04:16:37.130 --> 04:16:37.140 align:start position:0%
the way I I'll give you an example I I
 
04:16:40.429 --> 04:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
hope it'll uh what I've tried to do is
 
04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
instead of establishing a prime in a
 
04:16:46.309 --> 04:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
separate fund and lean based on that
 
04:16:50.750 --> 04:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
fund this is what happened in 2015.
 
04:16:53.750 --> 04:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
there was a fund and uh Department of
 
04:16:56.030 --> 04:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue said you know and last time when
 
04:16:58.729 --> 04:16:58.739 align:start position:0%
I did Department of Revenue brought that
 
04:17:00.969 --> 04:17:00.979 align:start position:0%
up and uh
 
04:17:03.590 --> 04:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire municipals Association
 
04:17:07.849 --> 04:17:07.859 align:start position:0%
brought it up in terms of uh uh what the
 
04:17:07.859 --> 04:17:08.590 align:start position:0%
brought it up in terms of uh uh what the
local

04:17:08.590 --> 04:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
local
 
04:17:10.969 --> 04:17:10.979 align:start position:0%
municipalities will be holding the ball
 
04:17:13.670 --> 04:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
and the banker Association also brought
 
04:17:15.969 --> 04:17:15.979 align:start position:0%
up that you know but they didn't want
 
04:17:19.610 --> 04:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
another lien based on their mortgage and
 
04:17:22.330 --> 04:17:22.340 align:start position:0%
stuff so
 
04:17:24.889 --> 04:17:24.899 align:start position:0%
the reason we need an enabling
 
04:17:28.670 --> 04:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
legislation that will be addressed if
 
04:17:31.070 --> 04:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
you look at uh
 
04:17:33.290 --> 04:17:33.300 align:start position:0%
my um
 
04:17:36.410 --> 04:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
Amendment what the amendment what I
 
04:17:41.510 --> 04:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
tried to do was instead of trying to
 
04:17:47.229 --> 04:17:47.239 align:start position:0%
adjust RSA 53 because if you mention RSA
 
04:17:51.769 --> 04:17:51.779 align:start position:0%
53e or a the subsection it has a
 
04:17:55.010 --> 04:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
correlation with other or say you know
 
04:17:59.389 --> 04:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
there's interaction so in this what I've
 
04:18:05.090 --> 04:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
tried to do is create a RSA 53f that
 
04:18:06.969 --> 04:18:06.979 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist
 
04:18:11.990 --> 04:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
so that way we are starting clean with
 
04:18:15.550 --> 04:18:15.560 align:start position:0%
so that how it affects the
 
04:18:21.110 --> 04:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
72e can be you know changed so clean
 
04:18:23.450 --> 04:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
energy and
 
04:18:23.460 --> 04:18:24.250 align:start position:0%
energy and
um

04:18:24.250 --> 04:18:24.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:26.950 --> 04:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
clean energy New Hampshire
 
04:18:30.110 --> 04:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
understands where we are and it's a
 
04:18:32.750 --> 04:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
challenge in New Hampshire to be able to
 
04:18:36.010 --> 04:18:36.020 align:start position:0%
bring this program because of our tax
 
04:18:40.429 --> 04:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
structure so what um I will give you an
 
04:18:43.490 --> 04:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
example this is more like the lean or
 
04:18:47.090 --> 04:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
the easement situation where in Nashua
 
04:18:50.090 --> 04:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
there was a property which was Catholic
 
04:18:53.809 --> 04:18:53.819 align:start position:0%
Charities had or Camp uh the camp do set
 
04:18:56.389 --> 04:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
where they had leased part of the
 
04:19:01.250 --> 04:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
property for self cell phone tower and
 
04:19:03.050 --> 04:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
it's leased for a hundred years there's
 
04:19:06.229 --> 04:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
an easement and recently a private
 
04:19:08.510 --> 04:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
developer bought the property but he
 
04:19:10.490 --> 04:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
brought the bought the property knowing
 
04:19:13.969 --> 04:19:13.979 align:start position:0%
that that stays that easement stays
 
04:19:16.330 --> 04:19:16.340 align:start position:0%
because it attached to the property
 
04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
similarly I want to make sure that this
 
04:19:22.790 --> 04:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
pace stays with the property
 
04:19:27.349 --> 04:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
so the lean if if a default happens then
 
04:19:30.410 --> 04:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
the default is with the property so that
 
04:19:33.469 --> 04:19:33.479 align:start position:0%
whoever buys the property has this
 
04:19:36.410 --> 04:19:36.420 align:start position:0%
Improvement which is already invested to
 
04:19:37.790 --> 04:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
continue with that
 
04:19:40.969 --> 04:19:40.979 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question or I'm
 
04:19:43.550 --> 04:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
trying to answer as best as I can
 
04:19:47.469 --> 04:19:47.479 align:start position:0%
because it's such a huge uh
 
04:19:51.290 --> 04:19:51.300 align:start position:0%
overarching topic that's why I said I'm
 
04:19:54.590 --> 04:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
doing a PhD a bridge version of my
 
04:19:56.809 --> 04:19:56.819 align:start position:0%
thesis presentation
 
04:19:59.510 --> 04:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
yes I thank you for attempting to answer
 
04:20:02.330 --> 04:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
the question and while
 
04:20:04.610 --> 04:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
you may have been only partially
 
04:20:06.410 --> 04:20:06.420 align:start position:0%
successful there are other people in the
 
04:20:09.410 --> 04:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
room who might be able to help us out
 
04:20:11.990 --> 04:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
with some understanding representative
 
04:20:14.510 --> 04:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
Bernardi has a question
 
04:20:17.210 --> 04:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so as I understand
 
04:20:21.170 --> 04:20:21.180 align:start position:0%
that these loans are to be uh
 
04:20:25.309 --> 04:20:25.319 align:start position:0%
issued by the state the treasurer
 
04:20:28.610 --> 04:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
that's what your your bill says uh
 
04:20:31.729 --> 04:20:31.739 align:start position:0%
section 413 loans and finance agreements
 
04:20:35.210 --> 04:20:35.220 align:start position:0%
the state treasurer shall make loans to
 
04:20:37.250 --> 04:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
or enter into financing agreements
 
04:20:40.250 --> 04:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
directly blah blah blah blah blah why
 
04:20:42.290 --> 04:20:42.300 align:start position:0%
can't Banks do this why do we need to
 
04:20:44.570 --> 04:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
have the state treasury that will change
 
04:20:47.510 --> 04:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
with my Amendment so that is doesn't
 
04:20:50.210 --> 04:20:50.220 align:start position:0%
exist in I try to that's why I'm trying
 
04:20:52.969 --> 04:20:52.979 align:start position:0%
to make this more and enabling at the
 
04:20:56.929 --> 04:20:56.939 align:start position:0%
state level than uh you know and you're
 
04:21:00.769 --> 04:21:00.779 align:start position:0%
absolutely right if it is a mortgage or
 
04:21:03.590 --> 04:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
Bank the interest rate is much higher
 
04:21:08.150 --> 04:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
and so if it is Pace investment it's a
 
04:21:12.469 --> 04:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
private Equity private investor and it
 
04:21:15.590 --> 04:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
is not uh they need some kind of an
 
04:21:19.130 --> 04:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
assurance so that uh it's not
 
04:21:21.590 --> 04:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
um backed by the federal
 
04:21:25.610 --> 04:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
um credit FDIC right or
 
04:21:29.150 --> 04:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying it right so uh the
 
04:21:33.830 --> 04:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
Federal Credit uh bank backed up so if
 
04:21:35.809 --> 04:21:35.819 align:start position:0%
the private investors are putting
 
04:21:37.370 --> 04:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars
 
04:21:40.550 --> 04:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
and they don't have a way to reclaim it
 
04:21:43.429 --> 04:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
what is the recourse
 
04:21:46.969 --> 04:21:46.979 align:start position:0%
and so the state is not that I do
 
04:21:49.070 --> 04:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
understand that was the last time that's
 
04:21:52.309 --> 04:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
how I started and because I didn't have
 
04:21:55.670 --> 04:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
enough time to meet with everybody and
 
04:21:58.610 --> 04:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
come up with a different bill I needed
 
04:22:01.610 --> 04:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
to put the one that was last year last
 
04:22:01.620 --> 04:22:02.990 align:start position:0%
to put the one that was last year last
term

04:22:02.990 --> 04:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
term
 
04:22:03.000 --> 04:22:04.370 align:start position:0%
term
follow-up

04:22:04.370 --> 04:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:22:09.110 --> 04:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
yes uh so if these projects their
 
04:22:11.469 --> 04:22:11.479 align:start position:0%
conservation Energy Efficiency
 
04:22:14.389 --> 04:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
Renewables if they are economically
 
04:22:17.510 --> 04:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
viable why are the interest rates going
 
04:22:18.889 --> 04:22:18.899 align:start position:0%
to be so high that they're cost
 
04:22:21.050 --> 04:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
prohibitive I don't understand that no
 
04:22:24.170 --> 04:22:24.180 align:start position:0%
because the cut the mortgage interest or
 
04:22:28.130 --> 04:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
bank loan interest is based on the prime
 
04:22:31.429 --> 04:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
right so when it was lower
 
04:22:34.370 --> 04:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
we still you know uh
 
04:22:36.769 --> 04:22:36.779 align:start position:0%
when the prime rate is lower the
 
04:22:40.450 --> 04:22:40.460 align:start position:0%
interest rate is lower but this is
 
04:22:45.110 --> 04:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
Improvement uh funding which is not bank
 
04:22:47.710 --> 04:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
loan or mortgage loan
 
04:22:51.170 --> 04:22:51.180 align:start position:0%
who does the loan that it is the private
 
04:22:55.070 --> 04:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
equity and the pace loan which is the
 
04:22:57.469 --> 04:22:57.479 align:start position:0%
financing it's a different that's why I
 
04:22:59.809 --> 04:22:59.819 align:start position:0%
said let me
 
04:23:04.429 --> 04:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:07.070 --> 04:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
oh my
 
04:23:09.229 --> 04:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
trying to get my
 
04:23:12.650 --> 04:23:12.660 align:start position:0%
okay maybe this will help a little bit
 
04:23:17.030 --> 04:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
let me see if I can articulate it
 
04:23:21.590 --> 04:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
pace is a state policy enabled financing
 
04:23:24.530 --> 04:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
mechanism that allows building owners
 
04:23:27.830 --> 04:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
and developer to access the capital they
 
04:23:31.490 --> 04:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
need to make energy related deferred
 
04:23:34.010 --> 04:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
maintenance upgrades in their existing
 
04:23:36.710 --> 04:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
buildings so support new construction
 
04:23:39.349 --> 04:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
costs and make renewable energy
 
04:23:42.410 --> 04:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
accessible and cost effective
 
04:23:42.420 --> 04:23:44.330 align:start position:0%
accessible and cost effective
and

04:23:44.330 --> 04:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:23:47.389 --> 04:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
this is also it's a public-private
 
04:23:50.689 --> 04:23:50.699 align:start position:0%
partnership enabled by state law and
 
04:23:53.269 --> 04:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
financed with private Capital that
 
04:23:57.410 --> 04:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
finances sustainability Improvement to
 
04:23:57.420 --> 04:23:58.910 align:start position:0%
finances sustainability Improvement to
um

04:23:58.910 --> 04:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:01.189 --> 04:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
such as Energy Efficiency water
 
04:24:04.070 --> 04:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
conservation seismic resiliency and why
 
04:24:08.689 --> 04:24:08.699 align:start position:0%
for Wi-Fi are hardening so this is a
 
04:24:08.699 --> 04:24:09.769 align:start position:0%
for Wi-Fi are hardening so this is a
different

04:24:09.769 --> 04:24:09.779 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:24:13.670 --> 04:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
tool of financing tool so to be clear
 
04:24:16.910 --> 04:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
yeah follow-up follow-up thank you it's
 
04:24:19.070 --> 04:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
not the state it's not the banks it's
 
04:24:21.830 --> 04:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
another newly created private entity
 
04:24:24.229 --> 04:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
that's going to do this financing
 
04:24:29.050 --> 04:24:29.060 align:start position:0%
it may not be created entity but a newly
 
04:24:32.809 --> 04:24:32.819 align:start position:0%
enabled access another tool for
 
04:24:39.950 --> 04:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:41.870 --> 04:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
04:24:43.790 --> 04:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:24:45.410 --> 04:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
representative mangaputi for your
 
04:24:46.969 --> 04:24:46.979 align:start position:0%
presentation today
 
04:24:48.889 --> 04:24:48.899 align:start position:0%
okay I've heard a few different things
 
04:24:51.590 --> 04:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
around the funding sources I I thought I
 
04:24:53.210 --> 04:24:53.220 align:start position:0%
heard you say at the beginning of the
 
04:24:55.010 --> 04:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
presentation that you were going to try
 
04:24:56.990 --> 04:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
and leverage some of the federal funding
 
04:24:58.250 --> 04:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
that's available
 
04:25:00.769 --> 04:25:00.779 align:start position:0%
and then when I look at the fiscal note
 
04:25:02.929 --> 04:25:02.939 align:start position:0%
on the bill that we're looking at today
 
04:25:04.910 --> 04:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
it says that the funding source they
 
04:25:08.689 --> 04:25:08.699 align:start position:0%
checked general fund and energy funding
 
04:25:11.750 --> 04:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
to create conservation project fund and
 
04:25:14.389 --> 04:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
Pace Reserve fund so it sounds like
 
04:25:16.550 --> 04:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
originally I don't know if I haven't
 
04:25:18.469 --> 04:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
reviewed the amendment that there would
 
04:25:22.370 --> 04:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
be two funds that would be created but
 
04:25:24.710 --> 04:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
it appears that there's State funding
 
04:25:26.389 --> 04:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
here so
 
04:25:28.250 --> 04:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
um can you speak to that a little bit
 
04:25:32.450 --> 04:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll try thanks state fund yes if
 
04:25:35.510 --> 04:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
it was Reggie funds for conservation or
 
04:25:38.689 --> 04:25:38.699 align:start position:0%
you know if that doesn't exist it
 
04:25:41.809 --> 04:25:41.819 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist so what we have right now
 
04:25:44.269 --> 04:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
is the federal funding millions of
 
04:25:47.210 --> 04:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
dollars coming to different states for
 
04:25:50.929 --> 04:25:50.939 align:start position:0%
example I'll give you uh One Fund EV
 
04:25:50.939 --> 04:25:52.330 align:start position:0%
example I'll give you uh One Fund EV
charging

04:25:52.330 --> 04:25:52.340 align:start position:0%
charging
 
04:25:56.149 --> 04:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
fund 17 million dollars as a federal
 
04:25:59.330 --> 04:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
funding how do we access that
 
04:26:02.170 --> 04:26:02.180 align:start position:0%
that's the infrastructure
 
04:26:05.929 --> 04:26:05.939 align:start position:0%
right so similarly
 
04:26:09.229 --> 04:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
um you know if there's a way to access
 
04:26:09.239 --> 04:26:11.030 align:start position:0%
um you know if there's a way to access
this

04:26:11.030 --> 04:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:26:14.929 --> 04:26:14.939 align:start position:0%
the pace financers investors and capital
 
04:26:18.649 --> 04:26:18.659 align:start position:0%
investors need to see some kind of
 
04:26:21.050 --> 04:26:21.060 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation at the state level
 
04:26:23.530 --> 04:26:23.540 align:start position:0%
to say we welcome you
 
04:26:27.410 --> 04:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
and so unless there's a mention of this
 
04:26:30.110 --> 04:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
kind of enabling legislation no
 
04:26:34.429 --> 04:26:34.439 align:start position:0%
investors are coming so yes in the this
 
04:26:37.969 --> 04:26:37.979 align:start position:0%
was the old bill that in a previous bill
 
04:26:41.630 --> 04:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
so if you look at I have tried to narrow
 
04:26:44.630 --> 04:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
it down to just make it an enabling from
 
04:26:49.090 --> 04:26:49.100 align:start position:0%
the state level and uh local community
 
04:26:52.849 --> 04:26:52.859 align:start position:0%
municipalities can adjust it in
 
04:26:55.670 --> 04:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
fit you know create a program for
 
04:26:59.149 --> 04:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
example Roanoke Virginia has Virginia
 
04:27:02.269 --> 04:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
state of Virginia has solarized renew
 
04:27:05.170 --> 04:27:05.180 align:start position:0%
sustainable renewable energy program
 
04:27:10.670 --> 04:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
legislation and Roanoke uh Virginia the
 
04:27:15.469 --> 04:27:15.479 align:start position:0%
city implemented their own RS Charter to
 
04:27:18.290 --> 04:27:18.300 align:start position:0%
say how the homeowners low-income middle
 
04:27:21.050 --> 04:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
income High income whoever wanted to
 
04:27:25.670 --> 04:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
upgrade can Avail if the state funding
 
04:27:28.389 --> 04:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
is not available at least they can Avail
 
04:27:31.490 --> 04:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
the federal funding that's available
 
04:27:35.090 --> 04:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
so it becomes a conduit to help thank
 
04:27:37.309 --> 04:27:37.319 align:start position:0%
you yeah that's clear thank you
 
04:27:39.830 --> 04:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
you need a follow-up
 
04:27:42.469 --> 04:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
04:27:44.030 --> 04:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:27:45.290 --> 04:27:45.300 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
04:27:47.149 --> 04:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
um so I I want to make sure I I
 
04:27:48.830 --> 04:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
understand this correctly this is an
 
04:27:51.889 --> 04:27:51.899 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation it would not create
 
04:27:51.899 --> 04:27:53.570 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation it would not create
a

04:27:53.570 --> 04:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:27:56.090 --> 04:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
Statewide fund
 
04:27:58.189 --> 04:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
um I I come from Hampton so what this
 
04:28:00.469 --> 04:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
would allow Hampton to do if Hampton's
 
04:28:03.290 --> 04:28:03.300 align:start position:0%
felt they wanted to is they could create
 
04:28:06.469 --> 04:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
Hampton could create its own fund for
 
04:28:09.590 --> 04:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
projects in Hampton that fund would be
 
04:28:13.250 --> 04:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
funded by any investors or potentially
 
04:28:15.290 --> 04:28:15.300 align:start position:0%
Federal money that might be available
 
04:28:18.290 --> 04:28:18.300 align:start position:0%
and then loans from that fund would be
 
04:28:21.229 --> 04:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
made to projects in the town
 
04:28:23.330 --> 04:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
and then it would be and then the the
 
04:28:26.269 --> 04:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
loan would be repaid using a property
 
04:28:27.649 --> 04:28:27.659 align:start position:0%
tax assessment
 
04:28:31.849 --> 04:28:31.859 align:start position:0%
yes so let me uh fix some of the and
 
04:28:34.550 --> 04:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
you're on the right path okay so as I
 
04:28:36.889 --> 04:28:36.899 align:start position:0%
understand or I'm trying to explain to
 
04:28:40.670 --> 04:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
you what I understand is if Hampton if
 
04:28:42.769 --> 04:28:42.779 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire has this enabling
 
04:28:44.990 --> 04:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
legislation they can have a PACE program
 
04:28:49.490 --> 04:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
that suits their prop uh community so if
 
04:28:53.469 --> 04:28:53.479 align:start position:0%
Hampton uh comes up with a
 
04:28:58.490 --> 04:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
program-based program the residents off
 
04:29:02.149 --> 04:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh you know they can borrow against this
 
04:29:07.910 --> 04:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh Pace financing and distribute their
 
04:29:07.920 --> 04:29:08.710 align:start position:0%
uh Pace financing and distribute their
um

04:29:08.710 --> 04:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:13.010 --> 04:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
loan across 20 over 20 years so it makes
 
04:29:16.070 --> 04:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
it cost it's not cost for uh
 
04:29:19.149 --> 04:29:19.159 align:start position:0%
um and especially with that 30 percent
 
04:29:21.649 --> 04:29:21.659 align:start position:0%
uh tax credit from the federal
 
04:29:25.130 --> 04:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
government for clean energy now they can
 
04:29:28.969 --> 04:29:28.979 align:start position:0%
capture that with currently and use it
 
04:29:33.290 --> 04:29:33.300 align:start position:0%
and so if for example if I put uh you
 
04:29:36.769 --> 04:29:36.779 align:start position:0%
know I have a five uh complex or I have
 
04:29:38.570 --> 04:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
a business that I want to put 100
 
04:29:41.149 --> 04:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
kilowatt solar and do the Energy
 
04:29:44.870 --> 04:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and all that and I borrow it
 
04:29:48.469 --> 04:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
and I sell my property it's on the
 
04:29:50.809 --> 04:29:50.819 align:start position:0%
property I'm not taking with it right
 
04:29:53.389 --> 04:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
now as it exists you know the buyer
 
04:29:56.990 --> 04:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
might say take off the solar panels
 
04:30:00.889 --> 04:30:00.899 align:start position:0%
so you know it's not a portable it's
 
04:30:04.670 --> 04:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
fitted with the property so that's does
 
04:30:07.070 --> 04:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
that explain to you yeah quick quick
 
04:30:07.080 --> 04:30:09.229 align:start position:0%
that explain to you yeah quick quick
follow-up

04:30:09.229 --> 04:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:30:11.570 --> 04:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you very much
 
04:30:15.649 --> 04:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
um so the the the special
 
04:30:18.649 --> 04:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
the the the voluntary property tax
 
04:30:18.659 --> 04:30:20.689 align:start position:0%
the the the voluntary property tax
assessment

04:30:20.689 --> 04:30:20.699 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
04:30:25.550 --> 04:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
um is that a additional assessment on
 
04:30:27.110 --> 04:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
that property
 
04:30:30.410 --> 04:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
or is that some portion of the current
 
04:30:32.809 --> 04:30:32.819 align:start position:0%
property tax that's allocated towards
 
04:30:35.090 --> 04:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
repaying the loan it depends on the
 
04:30:37.250 --> 04:30:37.260 align:start position:0%
community right so if I make an
 
04:30:40.130 --> 04:30:40.140 align:start position:0%
improvement or addition in my home I
 
04:30:42.410 --> 04:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
have to go to the building permit and so
 
04:30:45.469 --> 04:30:45.479 align:start position:0%
the you know value of my property might
 
04:30:47.689 --> 04:30:47.699 align:start position:0%
go up because of the enhanced
 
04:30:47.699 --> 04:30:49.849 align:start position:0%
go up because of the enhanced
Improvement

04:30:49.849 --> 04:30:49.859 align:start position:0%
Improvement
 
04:30:52.610 --> 04:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
and especially in the pace what it is
 
04:30:54.950 --> 04:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
enhanced Improvement
 
04:30:58.729 --> 04:30:58.739 align:start position:0%
in the tax burden or the tax if it goes
 
04:31:03.229 --> 04:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
up the benefit of doing this renovation
 
04:31:05.210 --> 04:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
should be less
 
04:31:08.090 --> 04:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
uh I mean the tax should not go up
 
04:31:10.189 --> 04:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
beyond the benefit
 
04:31:12.530 --> 04:31:12.540 align:start position:0%
so for example if I have a apartment
 
04:31:15.530 --> 04:31:15.540 align:start position:0%
complex of 10 units if I do the
 
04:31:18.530 --> 04:31:18.540 align:start position:0%
renovation I do the conservation I can
 
04:31:23.149 --> 04:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
pass on the uh as a landlord I can pass
 
04:31:27.530 --> 04:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
on the cost to the tenants but not so
 
04:31:29.450 --> 04:31:29.460 align:start position:0%
much that the tenants cannot afford it
 
04:31:31.729 --> 04:31:31.739 align:start position:0%
as it is because of their energy costs
 
04:31:34.870 --> 04:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
are higher now they're uh you know
 
04:31:37.010 --> 04:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
additional utility thing that they're
 
04:31:40.250 --> 04:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
paying so that cost could be rolled into
 
04:31:40.260 --> 04:31:41.450 align:start position:0%
paying so that cost could be rolled into
the

04:31:41.450 --> 04:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:31:44.269 --> 04:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
um rent so that they're not paying
 
04:31:47.510 --> 04:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
additional rent so that balance is very
 
04:31:50.030 --> 04:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
critical that is what unique about the
 
04:31:52.429 --> 04:31:52.439 align:start position:0%
pace legislation
 
04:31:55.370 --> 04:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
04:31:57.530 --> 04:31:57.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman a quick question
 
04:31:59.510 --> 04:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
for you on a
 
04:32:01.729 --> 04:32:01.739 align:start position:0%
this goes back to the uh what you talked
 
04:32:03.530 --> 04:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
earlier we talked about um it's page six
 
04:32:05.990 --> 04:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
section two about the treasurer I may
 
04:32:07.910 --> 04:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
invest money in the fund is provided by
 
04:32:10.370 --> 04:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
law and we were talking about Investors
 
04:32:12.830 --> 04:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
earlier and of course and I agree they
 
04:32:14.630 --> 04:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
need assurances of whether money is
 
04:32:17.510 --> 04:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
going to what their investment is
 
04:32:20.510 --> 04:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
um what help me understand what is the
 
04:32:22.670 --> 04:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
return on investment for those investors
 
04:32:24.769 --> 04:32:24.779 align:start position:0%
where would that money who does that
 
04:32:27.769 --> 04:32:27.779 align:start position:0%
money go to and then also or where does
 
04:32:29.870 --> 04:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
it go to the return on investment of
 
04:32:32.510 --> 04:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
that and also it means we're talking
 
04:32:34.610 --> 04:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
about towns here wouldn't each Town need
 
04:32:36.349 --> 04:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
a separate worn article to be able to
 
04:32:38.950 --> 04:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
pass anything like this in their town
 
04:32:42.050 --> 04:32:42.060 align:start position:0%
it thank you for your question and
 
04:32:44.929 --> 04:32:44.939 align:start position:0%
definitely the idea is to give local
 
04:32:47.630 --> 04:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
control not government you know the
 
04:32:50.269 --> 04:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
state saying what to do so what's good
 
04:32:52.729 --> 04:32:52.739 align:start position:0%
for Nashua may not be good for Hollis
 
04:32:57.950 --> 04:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
and so uh what is uh you know and in
 
04:33:01.189 --> 04:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
terms of investors what the investor the
 
04:33:04.730 --> 04:33:04.740 align:start position:0%
pace investors are asking for is some
 
04:33:07.429 --> 04:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
kind of a legislation to show this is a
 
04:33:10.849 --> 04:33:10.859 align:start position:0%
welcome right now we have zero Pace
 
04:33:14.869 --> 04:33:14.879 align:start position:0%
investors in New Hampshire and uh and
 
04:33:17.230 --> 04:33:17.240 align:start position:0%
especially with the energy conservation
 
04:33:21.109 --> 04:33:21.119 align:start position:0%
efficiency renewable and to reduce the
 
04:33:24.529 --> 04:33:24.539 align:start position:0%
energy costs we need these investors to
 
04:33:27.709 --> 04:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
come in is and while we are building new
 
04:33:31.189 --> 04:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
buildings new housing that we need 20
 
04:33:35.209 --> 04:33:35.219 align:start position:0%
000 plus this kind of Glo goes hand in
 
04:33:37.849 --> 04:33:37.859 align:start position:0%
hand with trying to look at a total
 
04:33:39.529 --> 04:33:39.539 align:start position:0%
thing rather than just put putting up
 
04:33:42.051 --> 04:33:42.061 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand units can we make it
 
04:33:45.650 --> 04:33:45.660 align:start position:0%
efficient conservation and use these
 
04:33:48.230 --> 04:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
because they can the builders the
 
04:33:51.230 --> 04:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
investors can provide that additional
 
04:33:53.209 --> 04:33:53.219 align:start position:0%
thing to make it
 
04:33:57.830 --> 04:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
viable cost-effective in for all
 
04:34:01.310 --> 04:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
not just who could afford but low to
 
04:34:01.320 --> 04:34:03.170 align:start position:0%
not just who could afford but low to
high

04:34:03.170 --> 04:34:03.180 align:start position:0%
high
 
04:34:06.590 --> 04:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
okay follow up just a quick question on
 
04:34:06.600 --> 04:34:07.310 align:start position:0%
okay follow up just a quick question on
that

04:34:07.310 --> 04:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:34:09.289 --> 04:34:09.299 align:start position:0%
because I didn't understand I understood
 
04:34:10.849 --> 04:34:10.859 align:start position:0%
what you're saying about the the
 
04:34:12.769 --> 04:34:12.779 align:start position:0%
investor what is their return on
 
04:34:14.209 --> 04:34:14.219 align:start position:0%
investment what do they get for
 
04:34:17.449 --> 04:34:17.459 align:start position:0%
investing a couple of things one is you
 
04:34:19.429 --> 04:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
know people that are Net Zero green
 
04:34:21.349 --> 04:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
developers who want to do the right
 
04:34:26.269 --> 04:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
thing and build energy sustainable and
 
04:34:29.990 --> 04:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
reduce the carbon Footprints and let me
 
04:34:33.650 --> 04:34:33.660 align:start position:0%
see where is that I had like one
 
04:34:33.660 --> 04:34:36.051 align:start position:0%
see where is that I had like one
specific

04:34:36.051 --> 04:34:36.061 align:start position:0%

04:34:36.061 --> 04:34:39.051 align:start position:0%
specific
line

04:34:39.051 --> 04:34:39.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:39.061 --> 04:34:40.849 align:start position:0%
 
okay

sorry about it
 
04:34:50.449 --> 04:34:50.459 align:start position:0%
it is reducing the carbon footprint up
 
04:34:53.029 --> 04:34:53.039 align:start position:0%
about one kilogram
 
04:34:53.039 --> 04:34:54.830 align:start position:0%
about one kilogram
per

04:34:54.830 --> 04:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
per
 
04:34:57.949 --> 04:34:57.959 align:start position:0%
if we go with this effective one so
 
04:35:03.109 --> 04:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
sorry I apologize I have like hundreds
 
04:35:06.410 --> 04:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
of papers so I
 
04:35:09.769 --> 04:35:09.779 align:start position:0%
find it but I will answer that I'm going
 
04:35:13.490 --> 04:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
to suggest we get the gist of that and
 
04:35:15.230 --> 04:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
our questions have started to stray into
 
04:35:17.289 --> 04:35:17.299 align:start position:0%
the territory of the finance committee
 
04:35:19.670 --> 04:35:19.680 align:start position:0%

some of whom will all will be looking at
 
04:35:27.949 --> 04:35:27.959 align:start position:0%
this bill after us so I'm going to
 
04:35:29.869 --> 04:35:29.879 align:start position:0%
suggest that we
 
04:35:32.209 --> 04:35:32.219 align:start position:0%
move on since we only have 24 minutes
 
04:35:34.070 --> 04:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
left in this public hearing
 
04:35:37.189 --> 04:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative man japoodi

Pace programs over two billion dollars
 
04:38:14.990 --> 04:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
in cpace financing has been provided to
 
04:38:18.051 --> 04:38:18.061 align:start position:0%
over 2 400 commercial buildings the
 
04:38:20.269 --> 04:38:20.279 align:start position:0%
majority of completed projects fell in
 
04:38:25.490 --> 04:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
the 75 000 to 750 000 size range though
 
04:38:28.849 --> 04:38:28.859 align:start position:0%
there are smaller smaller projects and a
 
04:38:30.529 --> 04:38:30.539 align:start position:0%
couple of large so that's just the the
 
04:38:33.830 --> 04:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
middle range currently there are 149
 
04:38:37.070 --> 04:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
Pace programs serving sixty thousand
 
04:38:39.709 --> 04:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
participants a couple of the advantages
 
04:38:41.689 --> 04:38:41.699 align:start position:0%
to the cpay structure are they they
 
04:38:44.209 --> 04:38:44.219 align:start position:0%
provide strong security for investors
 
04:38:47.269 --> 04:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
because the financing is repaid on the
 
04:38:50.029 --> 04:38:50.039 align:start position:0%
property tax bill this allows lenders
 
04:38:51.830 --> 04:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
the ability to offer better interest
 
04:38:54.890 --> 04:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
rate rates and longer repayment terms
 
04:38:56.709 --> 04:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
than are otherwise available
 
04:38:59.631 --> 04:38:59.641 align:start position:0%
additionally assessments are linked to
 
04:39:02.269 --> 04:39:02.279 align:start position:0%
the property and automatically transfer
 
04:39:05.150 --> 04:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
to a new owner upon the sale of the
 
04:39:07.670 --> 04:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
property this transfer has the added
 
04:39:10.570 --> 04:39:10.580 align:start position:0%
benefit of reducing the risk of default
 
04:39:13.910 --> 04:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
property owners that voluntarily choose
 
04:39:16.789 --> 04:39:16.799 align:start position:0%
to participate in a PACE program repay
 
04:39:18.830 --> 04:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
their Improvement costs over a set time
 
04:39:20.810 --> 04:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
period which is typically in the 10 to
 
04:39:23.029 --> 04:39:23.039 align:start position:0%
20 year range although property
 
04:39:25.250 --> 04:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
assessments which are
 
04:39:27.709 --> 04:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
uh secured by the property itself and
 
04:39:29.929 --> 04:39:29.939 align:start position:0%
paid in addition they are paid in
 
04:39:31.429 --> 04:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
addition to the owner's property tax
 
04:39:35.090 --> 04:39:35.100 align:start position:0%
bills as the senator from District 24 I
 
04:39:37.670 --> 04:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
represent the Seacoast that that has
 
04:39:40.310 --> 04:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
been experiencing increased flooding
 
04:39:43.190 --> 04:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
from what were once considered historic
 
04:39:45.590 --> 04:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
weather events but now it seems that
 
04:39:48.890 --> 04:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
history repeats itself with frequency
 
04:39:51.708 --> 04:39:51.718 align:start position:0%
one of the ways that house bill 576
 
04:39:54.590 --> 04:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
could be used on the Seacoast would be
 
04:39:57.410 --> 04:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
in identifying and mitigating short and
 
04:39:59.690 --> 04:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
long-term physical climate risks
 
04:40:02.690 --> 04:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
associated with the street extreme
 
04:40:05.690 --> 04:40:05.700 align:start position:0%
weather events consistently and cost
 
04:40:09.230 --> 04:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
effectively at sites across a portfolio
 
04:40:11.510 --> 04:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
across the Seacoast private Equity
 
04:40:14.090 --> 04:40:14.100 align:start position:0%
Capital could Propel the project of
 
04:40:17.090 --> 04:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
creating a centralized checklist to
 
04:40:20.050 --> 04:40:20.060 align:start position:0%
identify strategies and improvements
 
04:40:23.810 --> 04:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
when an extreme weather event occurs and
 
04:40:26.270 --> 04:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
they occur frequently now and further
 
04:40:28.910 --> 04:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
proper properly utilizing that checklist
 
04:40:31.130 --> 04:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
to par and partnering with qualified
 
04:40:34.070 --> 04:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
Consultants to result in a consistent
 
04:40:36.830 --> 04:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
cost-effective process which would help
 
04:40:39.230 --> 04:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
protect the occupants and assets from
 
04:40:42.770 --> 04:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
short to long-term climate risks I urge
 
04:40:44.868 --> 04:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
the committee to recommend House Bill
 
04:40:48.590 --> 04:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
576 ought to pass
 
04:40:49.850 --> 04:40:49.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:40:53.390 --> 04:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Wendy
 
04:40:56.330 --> 04:40:56.340 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question thank you Mr chair
 
04:40:59.090 --> 04:40:59.100 align:start position:0%
um there was a mention of low interest
 
04:41:01.550 --> 04:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
rate loans that are available through
 
04:41:03.530 --> 04:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
this program what's to keep the interest
 
04:41:09.050 --> 04:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:11.390 --> 04:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
that is an excellent question I cannot
 
04:41:13.670 --> 04:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
answer right now fair enough I will have
 
04:41:16.190 --> 04:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
to get back to you on that thank you
 
04:41:18.410 --> 04:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to permit questions but
 
04:41:21.590 --> 04:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
they have to be about the energy related
 
04:41:24.410 --> 04:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
aspects of this program not about the
 
04:41:29.628 --> 04:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
financing the property tax issues let's
 
04:41:31.788 --> 04:41:31.798 align:start position:0%
stick strictly to the energy portion
 
04:41:33.830 --> 04:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
04:41:37.490 --> 04:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
um chairman Vos I actually am presenting
 
04:41:40.550 --> 04:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
in another another bill so I am going to
 
04:41:43.490 --> 04:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
defer the questions about this project
 
04:41:47.690 --> 04:41:47.700 align:start position:0%
to representative mangaputi who is um or
 
04:41:50.208 --> 04:41:50.218 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams who are ready
 
04:41:52.850 --> 04:41:52.860 align:start position:0%
great thank you so much and I appreciate
 
04:41:54.530 --> 04:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
your time today we thank you for being
 
04:41:56.990 --> 04:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
here Senator we really appreciate it
 
04:42:00.110 --> 04:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
so representative McWilliams can you
 
04:42:02.628 --> 04:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
come up and present your testimony on
 
04:42:04.610 --> 04:42:04.620 align:start position:0%
this bill and because we only have 17
 
04:42:07.788 --> 04:42:07.798 align:start position:0%
minutes left if you could keep it to say
 
04:42:09.830 --> 04:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
four minutes would that be fair
 
04:42:12.590 --> 04:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely chair Vos no thank you
 
04:42:12.600 --> 04:42:13.730 align:start position:0%
absolutely chair Vos no thank you
um

04:42:13.730 --> 04:42:13.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:15.410 --> 04:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
hello fellow committee members for the
 
04:42:17.330 --> 04:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
record my name is Rebecca McWilliams I
 
04:42:19.550 --> 04:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
am the representative for South Concord
 
04:42:19.560 --> 04:42:20.208 align:start position:0%
am the representative for South Concord
um

04:42:20.208 --> 04:42:20.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:21.890 --> 04:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to speak to you because
 
04:42:22.970 --> 04:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
you've already heard all kinds of
 
04:42:24.350 --> 04:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
interesting things about this bill I'm
 
04:42:25.550 --> 04:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
going to speak to you on behalf of my
 
04:42:28.490 --> 04:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
constituents we have a portfolio of
 
04:42:31.330 --> 04:42:31.340 align:start position:0%
existing buildings in Concord and
 
04:42:33.350 --> 04:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
developers who absolutely would be
 
04:42:34.990 --> 04:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
interested in this product
 
04:42:37.850 --> 04:42:37.860 align:start position:0%
specifically we have a need in Concord
 
04:42:40.070 --> 04:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
to extend existing natural gas pipelines
 
04:42:42.110 --> 04:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
and also to do water and sewer
 
04:42:44.390 --> 04:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
extensions about 50 percent of the city
 
04:42:46.128 --> 04:42:46.138 align:start position:0%
in terms of land mass does not have
 
04:42:49.250 --> 04:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
water sewer or natural gas and so these
 
04:42:50.868 --> 04:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
are energy and infrastructure
 
04:42:53.448 --> 04:42:53.458 align:start position:0%
Investments that would benefit conquered
 
04:42:55.490 --> 04:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
tremendously right now we already have a
 
04:42:57.530 --> 04:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
major pinch with our housing market and
 
04:42:59.390 --> 04:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
it would be incredibly helpful to be
 
04:43:01.250 --> 04:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
able to extend these things under Pace
 
04:43:03.288 --> 04:43:03.298 align:start position:0%
financing to answer the question that
 
04:43:05.208 --> 04:43:05.218 align:start position:0%
was asked previously the low interest
 
04:43:07.970 --> 04:43:07.980 align:start position:0%
rate loans are actually at a fixed
 
04:43:09.890 --> 04:43:09.900 align:start position:0%
interest rate for the life of the loan
 
04:43:11.990 --> 04:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
so that's how it stays lows it's not a
 
04:43:13.390 --> 04:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
variable interest rate
 
04:43:16.788 --> 04:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
in terms of energy related aspects I'm
 
04:43:18.948 --> 04:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we've already talked about all
 
04:43:20.690 --> 04:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
kinds of great things like solar and
 
04:43:22.128 --> 04:43:22.138 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency projects that you can
 
04:43:24.410 --> 04:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
do on an existing building Concord needs
 
04:43:26.510 --> 04:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
those we need them now and so my
 
04:43:27.770 --> 04:43:27.780 align:start position:0%
constituents would absolutely benefit
 
04:43:29.448 --> 04:43:29.458 align:start position:0%
from this product to be able to access
 
04:43:31.550 --> 04:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
the funding to do that so that's my
 
04:43:34.670 --> 04:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
testimony happy to answer questions
 
04:43:37.010 --> 04:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
great thank you for less than four
 
04:43:38.810 --> 04:43:38.820 align:start position:0%
minutes we appreciate that
 
04:43:41.090 --> 04:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has an energy
 
04:43:44.090 --> 04:43:44.100 align:start position:0%
related question well yes
 
04:43:47.330 --> 04:43:47.340 align:start position:0%
um it is because
 
04:43:50.050 --> 04:43:50.060 align:start position:0%
and it thank you for your your testimony
 
04:43:53.990 --> 04:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative Williams McWilliams um
 
04:43:57.110 --> 04:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to ask is it is it correct
 
04:43:59.448 --> 04:43:59.458 align:start position:0%
for people to understand
 
04:44:03.110 --> 04:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
the value of this pace financing
 
04:44:03.120 --> 04:44:05.390 align:start position:0%
the value of this pace financing
mechanism

04:44:05.390 --> 04:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
04:44:10.128 --> 04:44:10.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:12.170 --> 04:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
current building owners and developers
 
04:44:15.948 --> 04:44:15.958 align:start position:0%
who want to make these investments in
 
04:44:17.448 --> 04:44:17.458 align:start position:0%
the energy
 
04:44:20.270 --> 04:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
efficiency in the energy consumption of
 
04:44:21.530 --> 04:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
their buildings
 
04:44:26.208 --> 04:44:26.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:29.690 --> 04:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
in the Real Estate Management world
 
04:44:32.208 --> 04:44:32.218 align:start position:0%
folks often don't know how long they're
 
04:44:34.310 --> 04:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
going to continue to own their building
 
04:44:35.570 --> 04:44:35.580 align:start position:0%
they might
 
04:44:37.490 --> 04:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
sell it in five years so they're
 
04:44:40.070 --> 04:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
reluctant to take a large loan that
 
04:44:43.190 --> 04:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
would say upgrade the efficiency or
 
04:44:45.350 --> 04:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
extend the gas pipeline and enable them
 
04:44:47.330 --> 04:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
to have more efficient Heating
 
04:44:48.890 --> 04:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
because then they're going to have a big
 
04:44:48.900 --> 04:44:50.690 align:start position:0%
because then they're going to have a big
loan

04:44:50.690 --> 04:44:50.700 align:start position:0%
loan
 
04:44:52.868 --> 04:44:52.878 align:start position:0%
attached to their company
 
04:44:56.090 --> 04:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
here yes I'm trying to get to the are we
 
04:44:58.310 --> 04:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
correct to understand that this is a
 
04:45:01.010 --> 04:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
a market mechanism to add to the
 
04:45:03.230 --> 04:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
portfolio of tools in the market to help
 
04:45:06.230 --> 04:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
those Property Owners access that
 
04:45:08.448 --> 04:45:08.458 align:start position:0%
financing and therefore decide to make
 
04:45:10.610 --> 04:45:10.620 align:start position:0%
those Investments thank you for the
 
04:45:12.770 --> 04:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
question representative Reynolds
 
04:45:14.750 --> 04:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
um in terms of real estate development
 
04:45:17.208 --> 04:45:17.218 align:start position:0%
and long-term planning around buildings
 
04:45:18.948 --> 04:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
both existing and new this is five plus
 
04:45:21.368 --> 04:45:21.378 align:start position:0%
units we're talking about with this bill
 
04:45:24.230 --> 04:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
there are there are quite a few existing
 
04:45:26.390 --> 04:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
ways to finance some conventional Bank
 
04:45:28.990 --> 04:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
financing private money your own dollars
 
04:45:31.850 --> 04:45:31.860 align:start position:0%
this is a really popular product in the
 
04:45:35.208 --> 04:45:35.218 align:start position:0%
28 22 states that do have this this is a
 
04:45:37.010 --> 04:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
really popular product for developers to
 
04:45:39.650 --> 04:45:39.660 align:start position:0%
use as an alternative and your question
 
04:45:42.110 --> 04:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
is correct yes it does run with the
 
04:45:44.390 --> 04:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
property so if a developer has a five
 
04:45:45.830 --> 04:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
unit and they decide that they're going
 
04:45:47.510 --> 04:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
to sell it in two or three years but
 
04:45:49.970 --> 04:45:49.980 align:start position:0%
they have a 20-year commitment through
 
04:45:53.030 --> 04:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
Pace that is sold with the property it's
 
04:45:54.890 --> 04:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
considered a lien on the property so
 
04:45:56.750 --> 04:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
whoever requires the property continues
 
04:45:58.310 --> 04:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
paying that bill until it is paid off
 
04:46:00.830 --> 04:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
04:46:02.868 --> 04:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
representative muns do you have an
 
04:46:04.788 --> 04:46:04.798 align:start position:0%
energy related question
 
04:46:07.850 --> 04:46:07.860 align:start position:0%
I hope I hope it's energy related
 
04:46:10.368 --> 04:46:10.378 align:start position:0%
um I was I was very intrigued by uh
 
04:46:12.230 --> 04:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
Senator all chiller's
 
04:46:14.208 --> 04:46:14.218 align:start position:0%
um testimony right at the end when she
 
04:46:16.670 --> 04:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
talked about some of the challenges of
 
04:46:18.170 --> 04:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
flooding that we have on the Seacoast
 
04:46:20.690 --> 04:46:20.700 align:start position:0%
and and I was down there this weekend
 
04:46:22.550 --> 04:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
and there was extensive flooding in the
 
04:46:25.670 --> 04:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
Hampton Harbor area so my question is
 
04:46:28.190 --> 04:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
um is the funding available through this
 
04:46:31.070 --> 04:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
program only for energy related projects
 
04:46:34.550 --> 04:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
or can it be used as as sen as Senator
 
04:46:37.490 --> 04:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
seem to imply can it be used for things
 
04:46:40.368 --> 04:46:40.378 align:start position:0%
like building a sea wall raising
 
04:46:41.770 --> 04:46:41.780 align:start position:0%
someone's home
 
04:46:44.628 --> 04:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
that type of thing or is it just energy
 
04:46:47.868 --> 04:46:47.878 align:start position:0%
that's the energy part
 
04:46:47.878 --> 04:46:48.948 align:start position:0%
that's the energy part
foreign

04:46:48.948 --> 04:46:48.958 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:46:51.110 --> 04:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
I'm really sorry that I don't have a
 
04:46:54.230 --> 04:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
direct answer to that
 
04:46:56.150 --> 04:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
04:46:58.610 --> 04:46:58.620 align:start position:0%
energy consumption reduction renewable
 
04:47:00.650 --> 04:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
energy and gas line extensions have been
 
04:47:03.170 --> 04:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
approved so it sounds like your question
 
04:47:04.970 --> 04:47:04.980 align:start position:0%
about increasing Building height to
 
04:47:06.890 --> 04:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
avoid flooding probably doesn't fall
 
04:47:09.288 --> 04:47:09.298 align:start position:0%
underneath this however I will tell you
 
04:47:11.208 --> 04:47:11.218 align:start position:0%
as an architect
 
04:47:12.948 --> 04:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
that when you're doing that project to
 
04:47:14.990 --> 04:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
raise the building you're already
 
04:47:17.030 --> 04:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
redoing the foundation which means
 
04:47:18.170 --> 04:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
you're probably going to end up doing
 
04:47:20.570 --> 04:47:20.580 align:start position:0%
some insulation work right so there's a
 
04:47:22.010 --> 04:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
piece of that project that you could
 
04:47:24.650 --> 04:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
percentage-wise apply for funding but it
 
04:47:29.270 --> 04:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:31.970 --> 04:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
uh representative Wendy Thomas has an
 
04:47:33.830 --> 04:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
energy question I do have an energy
 
04:47:36.410 --> 04:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
question thank you much Mr chair
 
04:47:38.930 --> 04:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me does the CPAP C PACE
 
04:47:40.730 --> 04:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
program replace current Energy
 
04:47:43.368 --> 04:47:43.378 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs is it an either or
 
04:47:47.030 --> 04:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
or an and can you use both cpace is a
 
04:47:49.128 --> 04:47:49.138 align:start position:0%
beautiful add-on it allows you to access
 
04:47:51.350 --> 04:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
funds and you could probably double dip
 
04:47:53.208 --> 04:47:53.218 align:start position:0%
if you get fancy which is cool that's
 
04:47:57.170 --> 04:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:59.270 --> 04:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
okay so you know further questions we
 
04:48:01.430 --> 04:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank representative McWilliams and we
 
04:48:04.610 --> 04:48:04.620 align:start position:0%
ask rep Mr Michael Licata representing
 
04:48:06.410 --> 04:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
eversource to
 
04:48:09.350 --> 04:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
give us his perspective on House Bill
 
04:48:09.360 --> 04:48:16.850 align:start position:0%
give us his perspective on House Bill
576.

04:48:16.850 --> 04:48:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:19.310 --> 04:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh for the record Michael
 
04:48:22.788 --> 04:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
Licata representing eversource energy uh
 
04:48:26.570 --> 04:48:26.580 align:start position:0%
I'll be brief and focused in my comments
 
04:48:26.580 --> 04:48:27.230 align:start position:0%
I'll be brief and focused in my comments
um

04:48:27.230 --> 04:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:29.628 --> 04:48:29.638 align:start position:0%
on behalf of eversource we certainly
 
04:48:32.448 --> 04:48:32.458 align:start position:0%
believe a well-designed PACE program can
 
04:48:36.530 --> 04:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
be a powerful tool to help uh finance
 
04:48:39.050 --> 04:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
and incent Energy Efficiency and
 
04:48:42.410 --> 04:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
conservation programs with regard to the
 
04:48:44.510 --> 04:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
legislation before you today and I I
 
04:48:46.368 --> 04:48:46.378 align:start position:0%
haven't been privy to any Amendment
 
04:48:46.378 --> 04:48:47.410 align:start position:0%
haven't been privy to any Amendment
language

04:48:47.410 --> 04:48:47.420 align:start position:0%
language
 
04:48:51.350 --> 04:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
our focus is uh concern about the
 
04:48:53.150 --> 04:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
references to the system's benefits
 
04:48:55.910 --> 04:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
charge that chairman Vos had asked a
 
04:49:01.070 --> 04:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
question about we too are unclear on on
 
04:49:03.470 --> 04:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
exactly what is intended by the
 
04:49:07.190 --> 04:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
legislation it appears that the bill
 
04:49:09.650 --> 04:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
would use the system's benefit charge as
 
04:49:12.190 --> 04:49:12.200 align:start position:0%
a financial backstop
 
04:49:14.830 --> 04:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
for these programs
 
04:49:18.230 --> 04:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
I think there's a couple of issues with
 
04:49:21.948 --> 04:49:21.958 align:start position:0%
that one the reference to the charge
 
04:49:25.250 --> 04:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
itself is the actual charge on customer
 
04:49:29.330 --> 04:49:29.340 align:start position:0%
bills and the bill contemplates a lien
 
04:49:32.448 --> 04:49:32.458 align:start position:0%
against the charge and I'm not quite
 
04:49:32.458 --> 04:49:33.368 align:start position:0%
against the charge and I'm not quite
sure

04:49:33.368 --> 04:49:33.378 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:49:37.250 --> 04:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
how that would work the uh by way of
 
04:49:39.470 --> 04:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
background the funding from the charge
 
04:49:43.490 --> 04:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
is collected by each utilities uh in the
 
04:49:43.500 --> 04:49:44.628 align:start position:0%
is collected by each utilities uh in the
state

04:49:44.628 --> 04:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:49:47.270 --> 04:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
held in an account on our each
 
04:49:49.730 --> 04:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
individual books and then it is used to
 
04:49:52.788 --> 04:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
fund the Energy Efficiency programs as
 
04:49:54.530 --> 04:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
approved by the Public Utilities
 
04:49:58.490 --> 04:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
Commission so even the concept of a lien
 
04:50:01.930 --> 04:50:01.940 align:start position:0%
against that fund on each utilities
 
04:50:05.330 --> 04:50:05.340 align:start position:0%
books is I I think
 
04:50:05.340 --> 04:50:06.110 align:start position:0%
books is I I think
um

04:50:06.110 --> 04:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:08.930 --> 04:50:08.940 align:start position:0%
just something we're not clear about how
 
04:50:11.150 --> 04:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
how that would work so you just sort of
 
04:50:13.368 --> 04:50:13.378 align:start position:0%
have technical challenges on the one
 
04:50:16.250 --> 04:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
hand and on the other uh there's the
 
04:50:19.550 --> 04:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
larger policy issue of of whether it's
 
04:50:23.390 --> 04:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate to utilize that funding as a
 
04:50:26.810 --> 04:50:26.820 align:start position:0%
uh as a financial backstop for these uh
 
04:50:28.788 --> 04:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
for these loans so
 
04:50:28.798 --> 04:50:29.690 align:start position:0%
for these loans so
um

04:50:29.690 --> 04:50:29.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:34.010 --> 04:50:34.020 align:start position:0%
certainly I'm not uh able to speak to
 
04:50:35.930 --> 04:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
the details of the rest of the build I'm
 
04:50:37.788 --> 04:50:37.798 align:start position:0%
sure there are others who can do that
 
04:50:39.770 --> 04:50:39.780 align:start position:0%
but we do
 
04:50:39.780 --> 04:50:40.368 align:start position:0%
but we do
um

04:50:40.368 --> 04:50:40.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:43.730 --> 04:50:43.740 align:start position:0%
have questions and concerns about the
 
04:50:45.410 --> 04:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
specific Provisions related to the
 
04:50:47.810 --> 04:50:47.820 align:start position:0%
systems benefits charge and and I would
 
04:50:47.820 --> 04:50:48.650 align:start position:0%
systems benefits charge and and I would
note

04:50:48.650 --> 04:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
note
 
04:50:50.810 --> 04:50:50.820 align:start position:0%
um you know the the state has received
 
04:50:52.670 --> 04:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
and will receive
 
04:50:54.650 --> 04:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
um significant sources of funding from
 
04:50:56.750 --> 04:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
the federal government under the uh
 
04:50:59.570 --> 04:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
inflation reduction act potentially one
 
04:51:02.208 --> 04:51:02.218 align:start position:0%
of those uh funding sources could be
 
04:51:05.810 --> 04:51:05.820 align:start position:0%
used for for a similar mechanism so uh
 
04:51:08.868 --> 04:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
I'll stop there and try to answer any
 
04:51:14.390 --> 04:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:16.910 --> 04:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none we thank you for your
 
04:51:19.490 --> 04:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
testimony and called the last person
 
04:51:21.770 --> 04:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
scheduled to testify on this bill and
 
04:51:23.990 --> 04:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
that is Griffin Robards from the
 
04:51:36.170 --> 04:51:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:37.910 --> 04:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you members of the committee uh
 
04:51:40.010 --> 04:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
for the record Griffin Roberts from the
 
04:51:42.110 --> 04:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of energy I
 
04:51:44.030 --> 04:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
think our testimony is going to closely
 
04:51:46.610 --> 04:51:46.620 align:start position:0%
mirror what uh eversources from Michael
 
04:51:49.430 --> 04:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
cotta's testimony would be the
 
04:51:50.930 --> 04:51:50.940 align:start position:0%
department acknowledges that there is an
 
04:51:52.670 --> 04:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
amendment being kicked around right now
 
04:51:55.070 --> 04:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
but our initial read of the bill as
 
04:51:57.708 --> 04:51:57.718 align:start position:0%
introduced was to oppose the bill on the
 
04:51:59.890 --> 04:51:59.900 align:start position:0%
similar grounds that eversource raised
 
04:52:02.750 --> 04:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
using the system benefits charge as a
 
04:52:05.330 --> 04:52:05.340 align:start position:0%
backstop for these energy bonds could
 
04:52:06.708 --> 04:52:06.718 align:start position:0%
potentially threaten the approved
 
04:52:09.470 --> 04:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
budgets for utilities Energy Efficiency
 
04:52:09.480 --> 04:52:11.208 align:start position:0%
budgets for utilities Energy Efficiency
programs

04:52:11.208 --> 04:52:11.218 align:start position:0%
programs
 
04:52:13.250 --> 04:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
um obviously as I'm sure this committee
 
04:52:16.788 --> 04:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
knows uh it has certainly been uh up and
 
04:52:18.708 --> 04:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
down in terms of the Energy Efficiency
 
04:52:20.930 --> 04:52:20.940 align:start position:0%
programs in terms in terms of funding
 
04:52:23.510 --> 04:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
levels the bill as introduced with that
 
04:52:25.670 --> 04:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
provision in there we feel would add a
 
04:52:28.250 --> 04:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
very complex and confusing layer on the
 
04:52:30.830 --> 04:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
management of the New Hampshire saves
 
04:52:30.840 --> 04:52:32.448 align:start position:0%
management of the New Hampshire saves
programs

04:52:32.448 --> 04:52:32.458 align:start position:0%
programs
 
04:52:34.070 --> 04:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
um again I fully acknowledge that
 
04:52:35.690 --> 04:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
there's an amendment based on the
 
04:52:37.190 --> 04:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
cursory glance of the amendment there is
 
04:52:39.110 --> 04:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
no reference to the system benefits
 
04:52:41.810 --> 04:52:41.820 align:start position:0%
charge in that Amendment but the
 
04:52:43.490 --> 04:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
department would like to review that
 
04:52:45.230 --> 04:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment just to be sure that there
 
04:52:47.150 --> 04:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
aren't any potential unintended
 
04:52:48.470 --> 04:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
consequences to Energy Efficiency
 
04:52:50.448 --> 04:52:50.458 align:start position:0%
programs and with that uh closed my
 
04:52:50.458 --> 04:52:51.708 align:start position:0%
programs and with that uh closed my
testimony

04:52:51.708 --> 04:52:51.718 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:52:56.090 --> 04:52:56.100 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for Mr robarge
 
04:52:58.788 --> 04:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
seeing none I thank you for thank you
 
04:53:02.330 --> 04:53:02.340 align:start position:0%
stopping by to register register your
 
04:53:05.208 --> 04:53:05.218 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill as introduced
 
04:53:07.850 --> 04:53:07.860 align:start position:0%
and I would ask representative closure
 
04:53:10.490 --> 04:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
to give us a sense of what the blue
 
04:53:26.208 --> 04:53:26.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:28.730 --> 04:53:28.740 align:start position:0%
for you new members the blue Sheed is
 
04:53:30.708 --> 04:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
the sheet
 
04:53:30.718 --> 04:53:32.030 align:start position:0%
the sheet
that

04:53:32.030 --> 04:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:53:34.250 --> 04:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
members of the public members of the
 
04:53:35.810 --> 04:53:35.820 align:start position:0%
legislature members of the
 
04:53:38.150 --> 04:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
administration can sign to register
 
04:53:39.650 --> 04:53:39.660 align:start position:0%
their support
 
04:53:44.690 --> 04:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
neutrality or opposition to a given bill
 
04:53:47.410 --> 04:53:47.420 align:start position:0%
can also register their support
 
04:53:51.470 --> 04:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
neutrality or opposition online and the
 
04:53:54.890 --> 04:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
blue sheet will reflect those
 
04:53:57.708 --> 04:53:57.718 align:start position:0%
opinions that have been received
 
04:53:57.718 --> 04:53:59.150 align:start position:0%
opinions that have been received
by

04:53:59.150 --> 04:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:54:01.970 --> 04:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
morning of the day of the Bill's hearing
 
04:54:04.628 --> 04:54:04.638 align:start position:0%
people can continue to make their online
 
04:54:07.730 --> 04:54:07.740 align:start position:0%
preferences known through midnight and
 
04:54:10.070 --> 04:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
we won't know the the full report until
 
04:54:11.810 --> 04:54:11.820 align:start position:0%
later but
 
04:54:14.030 --> 04:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
representative closure will give us a
 
04:54:16.368 --> 04:54:16.378 align:start position:0%
snapshot on where the bill stands right
 
04:54:16.378 --> 04:54:18.010 align:start position:0%
snapshot on where the bill stands right
now

04:54:18.010 --> 04:54:18.020 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:54:22.970 --> 04:54:22.980 align:start position:0%
thank you chair on the house bill 576
 
04:54:26.208 --> 04:54:26.218 align:start position:0%
there was two in favor
 
04:54:29.930 --> 04:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
there was one in favor as amended
 
04:54:32.208 --> 04:54:32.218 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:54:37.270 --> 04:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:41.090 --> 04:54:41.100 align:start position:0%
uh none on the blue sheet
 
04:54:44.150 --> 04:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
great and since we forgot to do this for
 
04:54:46.610 --> 04:54:46.620 align:start position:0%

04:55:02.930 --> 04:55:02.940 align:start position:0%
in favor Two Against
 
04:55:02.940 --> 04:55:05.690 align:start position:0%
in favor Two Against
and

04:55:05.690 --> 04:55:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:08.570 --> 04:55:08.580 align:start position:0%
they're all in person okay great thanks
 
04:55:11.448 --> 04:55:11.458 align:start position:0%
with that we'll close the public hearing
 
04:55:15.410 --> 04:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 576 and we'll take a four
 
04:55:17.868 --> 04:55:17.878 align:start position:0%
minute break and then we'll return to
 
04:58:04.788 --> 04:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:05.810 --> 05:02:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:07.670 --> 05:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
all right I'm going to open the public
 
05:02:10.730 --> 05:02:10.740 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 92 requiring the
 
05:02:13.610 --> 05:02:13.620 align:start position:0%
adoption of innovative vehicle emission
 
05:02:17.510 --> 05:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
standards pursuant to section 177.
 
05:02:20.810 --> 05:02:20.820 align:start position:0%
of the federal Clean Air Act
 
05:02:24.770 --> 05:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
and I would like to introduce the prime
 
05:02:27.770 --> 05:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this legislation
 
05:02:30.948 --> 05:02:30.958 align:start position:0%
Rebecca McWilliams to introduce the bill
 
05:02:35.890 --> 05:02:35.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:38.810 --> 05:02:38.820 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams thank you very
 
05:02:40.970 --> 05:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
much for the pink card and I'll remind
 
05:02:43.010 --> 05:02:43.020 align:start position:0%
everyone while she's getting ready that
 
05:02:45.708 --> 05:02:45.718 align:start position:0%
if you want to speak on this bill I need
 
05:02:48.410 --> 05:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
to have a pink card from you as soon as
 
05:02:48.420 --> 05:02:49.788 align:start position:0%
to have a pink card from you as soon as
possible

05:02:49.788 --> 05:02:49.798 align:start position:0%
possible
 
05:02:52.868 --> 05:02:52.878 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much and with that
 
05:02:55.128 --> 05:02:55.138 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams the floor is
 
05:02:57.288 --> 05:02:57.298 align:start position:0%
yours thank you so much chair Bose for
 
05:02:58.730 --> 05:02:58.740 align:start position:0%
the record representative Rebecca
 
05:03:00.470 --> 05:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
McWilliams from South Concord member of
 
05:03:01.788 --> 05:03:01.798 align:start position:0%
this committee pleasure to see you all
 
05:03:05.690 --> 05:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
again I'll go in three for three today
 
05:03:08.330 --> 05:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
um I am here to introduce House Bill 92
 
05:03:10.550 --> 05:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm hoping to speak as briefly as
 
05:03:12.288 --> 05:03:12.298 align:start position:0%
possible about House Bill 92 because
 
05:03:15.170 --> 05:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people here who have
 
05:03:17.090 --> 05:03:17.100 align:start position:0%
way more in-depth experience on the
 
05:03:19.368 --> 05:03:19.378 align:start position:0%
technicalities of this bill than me so
 
05:03:20.750 --> 05:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to put that up front and just
 
05:03:22.490 --> 05:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
say that the super technical questions
 
05:03:24.230 --> 05:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
you probably want to save for people
 
05:03:26.208 --> 05:03:26.218 align:start position:0%
after me I'm going to do my best to
 
05:03:28.010 --> 05:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
introduce this bill in sort of a whole
 
05:03:29.990 --> 05:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
cloth broad holistic perspective without
 
05:03:32.810 --> 05:03:32.820 align:start position:0%
going down the rabbit hole so let's keep
 
05:03:34.670 --> 05:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
it high level if we can
 
05:03:36.288 --> 05:03:36.298 align:start position:0%
all right so I'm going to go through the
 
05:03:38.170 --> 05:03:38.180 align:start position:0%
bill with you
 
05:03:41.390 --> 05:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
House Bill 92 the intention here is to
 
05:03:43.730 --> 05:03:43.740 align:start position:0%
implement the California low emission
 
05:03:46.250 --> 05:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
zero emissions vehicle program so I'm
 
05:03:48.948 --> 05:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
going to refer to those as levs and zevs
 
05:03:50.750 --> 05:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
low emissions vehicles and zero
 
05:03:52.310 --> 05:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
emissions vehicles
 
05:03:55.010 --> 05:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
this is pursuant to section 177 of the
 
05:03:57.530 --> 05:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
Clean Air Act which is a federal program
 
05:03:59.810 --> 05:03:59.820 align:start position:0%
and you may have already heard this
 
05:04:02.448 --> 05:04:02.458 align:start position:0%
allegory but New Hampshire is a donut
 
05:04:04.910 --> 05:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
hole compared to the rest of the
 
05:04:06.830 --> 05:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
Northeast when it comes to implementing
 
05:04:10.128 --> 05:04:10.138 align:start position:0%
section 177 of the Clean Air Act what
 
05:04:11.990 --> 05:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
that means is
 
05:04:12.000 --> 05:04:12.770 align:start position:0%
that means is
um

05:04:12.770 --> 05:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:16.730 --> 05:04:16.740 align:start position:0%
we are behind our neighbors we currently
 
05:04:19.910 --> 05:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
have automotive dealers here in New
 
05:04:19.920 --> 05:04:20.810 align:start position:0%
have automotive dealers here in New
Hampshire

05:04:20.810 --> 05:04:20.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:04:24.288 --> 05:04:24.298 align:start position:0%
who are not able to get zebs and levs
 
05:04:26.030 --> 05:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
from the manufacturers that they sell
 
05:04:28.550 --> 05:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
cars from because the manufacturers are
 
05:04:31.368 --> 05:04:31.378 align:start position:0%
prioritizing sending those vehicles to
 
05:04:33.590 --> 05:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
other states that have adopted section
 
05:04:37.850 --> 05:04:37.860 align:start position:0%
177 so we're lagging behind what does
 
05:04:39.770 --> 05:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
that mean we're going to have to catch
 
05:04:39.780 --> 05:04:40.730 align:start position:0%
that mean we're going to have to catch
up

05:04:40.730 --> 05:04:40.740 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:04:43.970 --> 05:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
so we had a really great presentation a
 
05:04:45.350 --> 05:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
little bit ago
 
05:04:48.830 --> 05:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
to this committee regarding air quality
 
05:04:51.890 --> 05:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
issues in New Hampshire and we are very
 
05:04:53.150 --> 05:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
fortunate to be in a position where
 
05:04:54.708 --> 05:04:54.718 align:start position:0%
right now we're not dealing with major
 
05:04:56.628 --> 05:04:56.638 align:start position:0%
air quality issues we've overcome a lot
 
05:04:58.850 --> 05:04:58.860 align:start position:0%
of them but I do want to recall one of
 
05:05:00.050 --> 05:05:00.060 align:start position:0%
the points that we saw in the
 
05:05:02.448 --> 05:05:02.458 align:start position:0%
presentation is that the number one
 
05:05:04.430 --> 05:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
largest contributor to air quality
 
05:05:06.890 --> 05:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
issues in New Hampshire is Automobiles
 
05:05:09.890 --> 05:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
and so this is a very real issue and
 
05:05:12.288 --> 05:05:12.298 align:start position:0%
everything that we do matters when we're
 
05:05:13.550 --> 05:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
reducing the emissions of the
 
05:05:16.010 --> 05:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
automobiles that we drive and contribute
 
05:05:18.170 --> 05:05:18.180 align:start position:0%
to the air that we breathe and the
 
05:05:20.150 --> 05:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
incidences of asthma and other human
 
05:05:23.390 --> 05:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
issues with air quality
 
05:05:23.400 --> 05:05:24.550 align:start position:0%
issues with air quality
um so

05:05:24.550 --> 05:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:05:26.390 --> 05:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
moving down a little bit on the
 
05:05:28.850 --> 05:05:28.860 align:start position:0%
introduction of the bill
 
05:05:28.860 --> 05:05:29.868 align:start position:0%
introduction of the bill
um

05:05:29.868 --> 05:05:29.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:35.208 --> 05:05:35.218 align:start position:0%
we are proposing with House Bill 92 to
 
05:05:38.030 --> 05:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
implement the exact standards that are
 
05:05:41.270 --> 05:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
referenced from the California bill this
 
05:05:42.650 --> 05:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
has a lot of background information
 
05:05:44.628 --> 05:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
about the years of vehicles the
 
05:05:47.150 --> 05:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
emissions of those vehicles and what
 
05:05:48.708 --> 05:05:48.718 align:start position:0%
that means moving forward for New
 
05:05:48.718 --> 05:05:49.990 align:start position:0%
that means moving forward for New
Hampshire

05:05:49.990 --> 05:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:05:52.030 --> 05:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
specifically the implementation
 
05:05:54.050 --> 05:05:54.060 align:start position:0%
implementation date of this bill is
 
05:05:57.530 --> 05:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2024 and it applies to
 
05:06:00.170 --> 05:06:00.180 align:start position:0%
vehicles with a model year of 2025 and
 
05:06:02.690 --> 05:06:02.700 align:start position:0%
later so we're picking a date to start
 
05:06:05.510 --> 05:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
from that date forward we're focusing on
 
05:06:07.490 --> 05:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
making sure that we can have zevs and
 
05:06:11.868 --> 05:06:11.878 align:start position:0%
Labs on dealer Lots in New Hampshire
 
05:06:11.878 --> 05:06:13.190 align:start position:0%
Labs on dealer Lots in New Hampshire
um

05:06:13.190 --> 05:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:16.128 --> 05:06:16.138 align:start position:0%
in addition there is a credit system
 
05:06:18.050 --> 05:06:18.060 align:start position:0%
that is set up just like every other
 
05:06:20.690 --> 05:06:20.700 align:start position:0%
state who's adopted this standard I'm
 
05:06:23.530 --> 05:06:23.540 align:start position:0%
looking at line 14 page 2 subsection B
 
05:06:26.628 --> 05:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
this is the credit system regarding how
 
05:06:28.070 --> 05:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
many vehicles are required per
 
05:06:31.070 --> 05:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturer to be sold on Automotive
 
05:06:32.390 --> 05:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
dealer Lots
 
05:06:34.730 --> 05:06:34.740 align:start position:0%
and you cannot trade them with other
 
05:06:36.948 --> 05:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
states or manufacturers you must meet
 
05:06:38.750 --> 05:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
those requirements for credits in order
 
05:06:42.470 --> 05:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
to keep stock on your lot to just to
 
05:06:45.170 --> 05:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
rebut any concerns that people may have
 
05:06:47.810 --> 05:06:47.820 align:start position:0%
heard from constituents this bill does
 
05:06:50.990 --> 05:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
not propose to remove combustion engines
 
05:06:53.030 --> 05:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
from the road in New Hampshire that's
 
05:06:55.128 --> 05:06:55.138 align:start position:0%
not what we're talking about to be super
 
05:06:58.690 --> 05:06:58.700 align:start position:0%
clear what this bill does is it allows
 
05:07:02.110 --> 05:07:02.120 align:start position:0%
and basically creates a standard for
 
05:07:04.368 --> 05:07:04.378 align:start position:0%
automotive dealers in New Hampshire to
 
05:07:06.470 --> 05:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
begin receiving zebs and Labs just like
 
05:07:08.330 --> 05:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
all the other states around us who are
 
05:07:11.208 --> 05:07:11.218 align:start position:0%
doing this and we're not
 
05:07:13.128 --> 05:07:13.138 align:start position:0%
um just skimming down a little further
 
05:07:16.190 --> 05:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
in the bill there is a civil penalty of
 
05:07:18.170 --> 05:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
three thousand thirty seven thousand
 
05:07:21.410 --> 05:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
five hundred dollars on a manufacturer
 
05:07:23.150 --> 05:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
um who tries to sell a vehicle that
 
05:07:25.070 --> 05:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
fails to meet the emission standards I
 
05:07:26.930 --> 05:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
know you all remember the Volkswagen
 
05:07:28.910 --> 05:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
settlement where we've seen
 
05:07:30.770 --> 05:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
manufacturers in the past attempt to
 
05:07:32.510 --> 05:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
Parlay something that's not really the
 
05:07:32.520 --> 05:07:33.590 align:start position:0%
Parlay something that's not really the
product

05:07:33.590 --> 05:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
product
 
05:07:35.868 --> 05:07:35.878 align:start position:0%
and then there's also a penalty not to
 
05:07:37.970 --> 05:07:37.980 align:start position:0%
exceed five thousand dollars per zero
 
05:07:40.190 --> 05:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
Mission vehicle credit on a manufacturer
 
05:07:42.230 --> 05:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
that produces and delivers for sale New
 
05:07:44.150 --> 05:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fewer zebs or Labs than
 
05:07:45.830 --> 05:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
required to meet their credit obligation
 
05:07:48.708 --> 05:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
as part of admitting taking this bill
 
05:07:48.718 --> 05:07:49.670 align:start position:0%
as part of admitting taking this bill
under

05:07:49.670 --> 05:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
under
 
05:07:51.770 --> 05:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
um our New Hampshire rsas
 
05:07:54.890 --> 05:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
so there is a carrot and a stick in the
 
05:07:56.628 --> 05:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
spill this is the stick this is the
 
05:07:58.850 --> 05:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
penalty and I want to note that of the
 
05:08:01.788 --> 05:08:01.798 align:start position:0%
other states who have adopted this none
 
05:08:03.530 --> 05:08:03.540 align:start position:0%
of the manufacturers have been fined
 
05:08:05.510 --> 05:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
with this stick it has not actually been
 
05:08:07.550 --> 05:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
applied it is simply there to create a
 
05:08:09.890 --> 05:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
threat to remind everyone that these are
 
05:08:11.270 --> 05:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
the rules and you need to play by the
 
05:08:11.280 --> 05:08:12.350 align:start position:0%
the rules and you need to play by the
rules

05:08:12.350 --> 05:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
rules
 
05:08:14.810 --> 05:08:14.820 align:start position:0%
moving a little further along in order
 
05:08:16.550 --> 05:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
to implement this we are going to need
 
05:08:18.530 --> 05:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
to add a new paid position for someone
 
05:08:20.990 --> 05:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
to administer this program at the
 
05:08:23.390 --> 05:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services and
 
05:08:25.610 --> 05:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
therefore there is a proposal to
 
05:08:28.010 --> 05:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
increase inspection sticker fees and
 
05:08:30.250 --> 05:08:30.260 align:start position:0%
division transfer
 
05:08:32.990 --> 05:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
dollars to make sure that that position
 
05:08:35.330 --> 05:08:35.340 align:start position:0%
is funded as part of implementing the
 
05:08:35.340 --> 05:08:36.170 align:start position:0%
is funded as part of implementing the
program

05:08:36.170 --> 05:08:36.180 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:08:38.270 --> 05:08:38.280 align:start position:0%
so the last page describes the position
 
05:08:42.110 --> 05:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
of overseeing this new
 
05:08:43.788 --> 05:08:43.798 align:start position:0%
California air emission standards
 
05:08:45.708 --> 05:08:45.718 align:start position:0%
section 177 bill
 
05:08:47.690 --> 05:08:47.700 align:start position:0%
so all of that is to say big picture
 
05:08:50.570 --> 05:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
we're behind we need to catch up one of
 
05:08:52.070 --> 05:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
the things that I emailed to the
 
05:08:53.990 --> 05:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm just going to speak to
 
05:08:57.170 --> 05:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
off of my screen here is where are we
 
05:08:59.810 --> 05:08:59.820 align:start position:0%
headed as a as a global industry where
 
05:09:01.490 --> 05:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
where are we going with Automotive
 
05:09:05.810 --> 05:09:05.820 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and we're in 2023 now so a
 
05:09:07.788 --> 05:09:07.798 align:start position:0%
lot of these commitments are for 2030
 
05:09:09.650 --> 05:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
and 2040 we're talking about either
 
05:09:12.288 --> 05:09:12.298 align:start position:0%
seven years from now or 17 years from
 
05:09:14.090 --> 05:09:14.100 align:start position:0%
now Automotive manufacturers have made
 
05:09:15.590 --> 05:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
commitments for where they're going to
 
05:09:18.708 --> 05:09:18.718 align:start position:0%
be on their vehicles so for example
 
05:09:22.090 --> 05:09:22.100 align:start position:0%
Volvo 100 of global sales
 
05:09:26.150 --> 05:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
is to have electric vehicles by 2030. so
 
05:09:27.708 --> 05:09:27.718 align:start position:0%
in seven years Volvo is going all
 
05:09:31.190 --> 05:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
electric General Motors also 20 30 100
 
05:09:33.470 --> 05:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
of global sales going Electric in seven
 
05:09:37.250 --> 05:09:37.260 align:start position:0%
years BMW Ford Subaru I'm sorry BMW and
 
05:09:40.430 --> 05:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
Ford are 50 by 2030 so 50 of all
 
05:09:43.070 --> 05:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
vehicles sold by 2030 will be electric
 
05:09:45.110 --> 05:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
vehicles and then we get a little bit
 
05:09:47.390 --> 05:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
lower down which Subaru's 40 Global
 
05:09:50.570 --> 05:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
sales 2030 Toyota 35 percent Global
 
05:09:52.570 --> 05:09:52.580 align:start position:0%
sales 2030.
 
05:09:55.010 --> 05:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
and then some of the other names you
 
05:09:56.390 --> 05:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
probably would expect to hear on the
 
05:09:58.430 --> 05:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
list Honda is going to do a hundred
 
05:10:00.590 --> 05:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
percent of global sales by 2040. so
 
05:10:02.510 --> 05:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
they've given themselves 17 years to
 
05:10:04.730 --> 05:10:04.740 align:start position:0%
ramp up to all electric and finally
 
05:10:08.030 --> 05:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
Volkswagen group once again 2040 100 of
 
05:10:09.830 --> 05:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
global sales so this kind of gives you a
 
05:10:11.208 --> 05:10:11.218 align:start position:0%
snapshot of where the market is and
 
05:10:13.030 --> 05:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
where it's headed
 
05:10:16.310 --> 05:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
and I do also want to mention uh I
 
05:10:18.110 --> 05:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
discussed the stick right the potential
 
05:10:20.628 --> 05:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
penalty for manufacturers there is also
 
05:10:23.270 --> 05:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
a carrot for folks in New Hampshire who
 
05:10:26.628 --> 05:10:26.638 align:start position:0%
would like to purchase a zevolev off of
 
05:10:29.570 --> 05:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire lot if and when New
 
05:10:31.128 --> 05:10:31.138 align:start position:0%
Hampshire decides to adopt this standard
 
05:10:34.610 --> 05:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
it comes along with a eight year eighty
 
05:10:37.368 --> 05:10:37.378 align:start position:0%
thousand mile warranty that protects any
 
05:10:41.030 --> 05:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
defects with the functioning electric
 
05:10:43.070 --> 05:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
components in the vehicle so that
 
05:10:45.170 --> 05:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be you know a problem with the
 
05:10:47.150 --> 05:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
bumper per se but it could be a problem
 
05:10:49.868 --> 05:10:49.878 align:start position:0%
with battery or performance range issues
 
05:10:52.730 --> 05:10:52.740 align:start position:0%
eight years eighty thousand miles so
 
05:10:54.650 --> 05:10:54.660 align:start position:0%
this gives another layer of something
 
05:10:57.410 --> 05:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
good for our people our constituents by
 
05:10:58.788 --> 05:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
adopting this bill
 
05:11:00.530 --> 05:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
so with that I will open it up to please
 
05:11:03.890 --> 05:11:03.900 align:start position:0%
broad questions only I'm happy to do my
 
05:11:08.330 --> 05:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:09.830 --> 05:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:11:11.690 --> 05:11:11.700 align:start position:0%
um representative McWilliams for
 
05:11:13.310 --> 05:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill I have a couple of
 
05:11:15.170 --> 05:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
quick questions just to
 
05:11:19.070 --> 05:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
help us with context is this the same
 
05:11:21.650 --> 05:11:21.660 align:start position:0%
bill that you introduced on this subject
 
05:11:24.230 --> 05:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
last year or are there substantive
 
05:11:26.868 --> 05:11:26.878 align:start position:0%
changes there are minor changes in
 
05:11:30.230 --> 05:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
regards to dates of implementation and
 
05:11:33.770 --> 05:11:33.780 align:start position:0%
the the vehicle ages so 20 25 Vehicles
 
05:11:37.368 --> 05:11:37.378 align:start position:0%
obviously is a change yes okay great
 
05:11:39.170 --> 05:11:39.180 align:start position:0%
thanks representative Thomas has a
 
05:11:41.150 --> 05:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
question Doug Thomas that is thank you
 
05:11:42.350 --> 05:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
05:11:43.850 --> 05:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
question I I think it's the question
 
05:11:45.770 --> 05:11:45.780 align:start position:0%
given your background you might be able
 
05:11:47.930 --> 05:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
to answer uh on this
 
05:11:47.940 --> 05:11:48.910 align:start position:0%
to answer uh on this
um

05:11:48.910 --> 05:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:51.590 --> 05:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
on my copy of the bill
 
05:11:51.600 --> 05:11:52.368 align:start position:0%
on my copy of the bill
um

05:11:52.368 --> 05:11:52.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:54.170 --> 05:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
between lines five and eight it talks
 
05:11:58.750 --> 05:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
about the uh that the uh the regulations
 
05:12:00.948 --> 05:12:00.958 align:start position:0%
May incorporate by reference to
 
05:12:02.330 --> 05:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
California motor vehicle emissions
 
05:12:03.770 --> 05:12:03.780 align:start position:0%
standards set forth and finally
 
05:12:06.288 --> 05:12:06.298 align:start position:0%
regulations blah blah blah but it says
 
05:12:08.990 --> 05:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh and uh
 
05:12:12.250 --> 05:12:12.260 align:start position:0%
and as may be amended from time to time
 
05:12:15.410 --> 05:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
if this bill was adopted uh does this
 
05:12:18.470 --> 05:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
mean that New Hampshire would be tied to
 
05:12:22.490 --> 05:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
the California the California law and
 
05:12:22.500 --> 05:12:23.930 align:start position:0%
the California the California law and
any

05:12:23.930 --> 05:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:12:26.208 --> 05:12:26.218 align:start position:0%
um change or amendment that the
 
05:12:30.050 --> 05:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
California law does that we would that
 
05:12:32.150 --> 05:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
we must follow along with any amendments
 
05:12:33.830 --> 05:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
that they make with that
 
05:12:35.270 --> 05:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
I see where you're going with that
 
05:12:37.788 --> 05:12:37.798 align:start position:0%
question representative Doug Thomas
 
05:12:40.310 --> 05:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
um as you can imagine this program has
 
05:12:41.690 --> 05:12:41.700 align:start position:0%
been around for a really long time
 
05:12:44.448 --> 05:12:44.458 align:start position:0%
California pioneered it over 10 years
 
05:12:47.150 --> 05:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
ago and so there have been updates to
 
05:12:48.770 --> 05:12:48.780 align:start position:0%
California law in order to address
 
05:12:51.770 --> 05:12:51.780 align:start position:0%
targeted percentage goals year over year
 
05:12:55.550 --> 05:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
and also update the the year of the
 
05:12:57.410 --> 05:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are being impacted
 
05:12:59.448 --> 05:12:59.458 align:start position:0%
so there have been changes and I
 
05:13:01.550 --> 05:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
anticipate there will be more changes in
 
05:13:03.770 --> 05:13:03.780 align:start position:0%
the future and so yes the fundamental
 
05:13:05.750 --> 05:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
answer to your question is we would have
 
05:13:07.788 --> 05:13:07.798 align:start position:0%
to be tying it to that statute under the
 
05:13:10.490 --> 05:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
language as written in this bill thank
 
05:13:10.500 --> 05:13:13.910 align:start position:0%
language as written in this bill thank
you

05:13:13.910 --> 05:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:15.708 --> 05:13:15.718 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
05:13:17.628 --> 05:13:17.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:13:19.970 --> 05:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams I'm looking on
 
05:13:23.350 --> 05:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
page two and it's section two line 25
 
05:13:26.448 --> 05:13:26.458 align:start position:0%
when it talks about the stick imposing a
 
05:13:28.190 --> 05:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
civil penalty not to exceed five
 
05:13:29.810 --> 05:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per zero emission
 
05:13:33.050 --> 05:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
vehicle credit and so it says credit on
 
05:13:34.788 --> 05:13:34.798 align:start position:0%
a manufacturer that produces and
 
05:13:37.448 --> 05:13:37.458 align:start position:0%
delivers for sale in New Hampshire fewer
 
05:13:41.270 --> 05:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
zevs uh and and I'm assuming it means
 
05:13:44.170 --> 05:13:44.180 align:start position:0%
leves even though it says zebs or zevs
 
05:13:46.788 --> 05:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
then required to meet at Zev credit
 
05:13:50.208 --> 05:13:50.218 align:start position:0%
obligation when it says fewer than is
 
05:13:52.490 --> 05:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
there an actual designated amount of
 
05:13:54.470 --> 05:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles that a manufacturer has to have
 
05:13:56.390 --> 05:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
on their lot in order to meet it I know
 
05:13:59.208 --> 05:13:59.218 align:start position:0%
you said that this isn't a penalty
 
05:14:01.368 --> 05:14:01.378 align:start position:0%
that's generally imposed but I'm just
 
05:14:03.948 --> 05:14:03.958 align:start position:0%
curious if there's an actual number
 
05:14:07.310 --> 05:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
okay let's get technical so credits
 
05:14:11.090 --> 05:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
means that a zero emissions vehicle gets
 
05:14:13.430 --> 05:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
let's just say to keep the math simple
 
05:14:14.930 --> 05:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
let's just say it's a three credit
 
05:14:17.390 --> 05:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle whereas a low emissions vehicle
 
05:14:19.788 --> 05:14:19.798 align:start position:0%
could be a one credit vehicle so there
 
05:14:21.830 --> 05:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
is a credit requirement for the
 
05:14:24.530 --> 05:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
manufacturer to deliver to that dealer
 
05:14:26.868 --> 05:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
but it could be met with multiple
 
05:14:29.628 --> 05:14:29.638 align:start position:0%
combinations of vehicles on the lot so
 
05:14:31.490 --> 05:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
it is a little bit more complicated than
 
05:14:33.470 --> 05:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
just saying you need to deliver X number
 
05:14:34.910 --> 05:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
of cars
 
05:14:37.610 --> 05:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:14:40.190 --> 05:14:40.200 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
05:14:41.930 --> 05:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:14:41.940 --> 05:14:42.590 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

05:14:42.590 --> 05:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:45.230 --> 05:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
looking at this question it was enticed
 
05:14:47.690 --> 05:14:47.700 align:start position:0%
by it because of the the adoption of the
 
05:14:50.628 --> 05:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
California low emissions or emissions so
 
05:14:52.610 --> 05:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
actually and originally I thought it
 
05:14:53.628 --> 05:14:53.638 align:start position:0%
well we just had to worry about until
 
05:14:56.390 --> 05:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
2035 when it went to 100 all electrical
 
05:14:59.030 --> 05:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
vehicles but then when I pulled up the
 
05:15:00.830 --> 05:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
California code regulation the Levin's
 
05:15:03.050 --> 05:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
up to have a copy of it I noticed here
 
05:15:05.270 --> 05:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
that on the percentages that it if I
 
05:15:07.730 --> 05:15:07.740 align:start position:0%
understand correctly that by the end of
 
05:15:09.410 --> 05:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
next year if it did go in the Implement
 
05:15:11.510 --> 05:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
we'd have to have 25 percent of all
 
05:15:13.850 --> 05:15:13.860 align:start position:0%
vehicles in the state would have to be
 
05:15:16.610 --> 05:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
um electric 35 the following year and
 
05:15:18.770 --> 05:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
goes up nine percent every year until
 
05:15:22.250 --> 05:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
2035 which is 100 so does that mean are
 
05:15:23.868 --> 05:15:23.878 align:start position:0%
we is it substantial to be able to reach
 
05:15:26.330 --> 05:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
25 electric vehicles the entire state by
 
05:15:27.890 --> 05:15:27.900 align:start position:0%
the end of next year
 
05:15:29.810 --> 05:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
so I want to be super clear that the
 
05:15:32.030 --> 05:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
things that this legislation addresses
 
05:15:36.590 --> 05:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
are the vehicles on dealer Lots not the
 
05:15:39.050 --> 05:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
actual makeup of the state
 
05:15:41.690 --> 05:15:41.700 align:start position:0%
Vehicles driven right I mean everybody
 
05:15:43.250 --> 05:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is going to be driving
 
05:15:45.650 --> 05:15:45.660 align:start position:0%
whatever year their car is currently
 
05:15:47.930 --> 05:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
until they go to a dealer and purchase a
 
05:15:50.628 --> 05:15:50.638 align:start position:0%
new vehicle so when we're talking about
 
05:15:52.730 --> 05:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
percentage commitments we're talking
 
05:15:54.590 --> 05:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
about percentage commitments for dealers
 
05:15:57.350 --> 05:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
to provide not necessarily forcing
 
05:15:59.110 --> 05:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
people to purchase
 
05:15:59.120 --> 05:16:00.830 align:start position:0%
people to purchase
follow-up

05:16:00.830 --> 05:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:16:03.830 --> 05:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up so the requirements if we
 
05:16:06.050 --> 05:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
adopt the California law here that
 
05:16:08.810 --> 05:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
states that the percentage of each of
 
05:16:10.610 --> 05:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
electrical vehicles within the state
 
05:16:13.190 --> 05:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
needs to meet these certain matters of
 
05:16:16.368 --> 05:16:16.378 align:start position:0%
25 percent and go up to 100 percent only
 
05:16:19.610 --> 05:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
sold in 2035. is that not what we'd be
 
05:16:21.948 --> 05:16:21.958 align:start position:0%
adopting as well
 
05:16:24.350 --> 05:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm sorry I don't have exactly the
 
05:16:25.910 --> 05:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
chapter and verse in front of me that
 
05:16:28.190 --> 05:16:28.200 align:start position:0%
you're quoting from but I'm happy to
 
05:16:30.350 --> 05:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
chat with you afterwards on this I think
 
05:16:32.208 --> 05:16:32.218 align:start position:0%
this is really Technical and we may have
 
05:16:33.830 --> 05:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
some folks who can speak better to it
 
05:16:37.930 --> 05:16:37.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:40.788 --> 05:16:40.798 align:start position:0%
representative Munds as a question
 
05:16:42.830 --> 05:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:16:45.170 --> 05:16:45.180 align:start position:0%
representative could you could you
 
05:16:45.180 --> 05:16:47.510 align:start position:0%
representative could you could you
reconcile

05:16:47.510 --> 05:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
reconcile
 
05:16:50.448 --> 05:16:50.458 align:start position:0%
um the references to the federal Clean
 
05:16:53.810 --> 05:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
Air Act in the bill with the question
 
05:16:55.610 --> 05:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
and the answer that you the question
 
05:16:57.410 --> 05:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
from representative Thomas and the
 
05:16:59.570 --> 05:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
answer that you gave isn't there a
 
05:17:00.708 --> 05:17:00.718 align:start position:0%
connection between the California
 
05:17:05.628 --> 05:17:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:07.490 --> 05:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
representative I'm not sure I understand
 
05:17:10.910 --> 05:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
your question I I had I I thought I had
 
05:17:13.190 --> 05:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
heard or read somewhere that the
 
05:17:14.510 --> 05:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
California standard has been
 
05:17:16.310 --> 05:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the federal Clean Air
 
05:17:16.320 --> 05:17:17.090 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the federal Clean Air
Act

05:17:17.090 --> 05:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
Act
 
05:17:20.208 --> 05:17:20.218 align:start position:0%
or is that not true that is true okay so
 
05:17:23.510 --> 05:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
so it's really not a California law it's
 
05:17:25.550 --> 05:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
a federal law correct
 
05:17:27.590 --> 05:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
so the way that this bill is written it
 
05:17:29.510 --> 05:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
still references California Section
 
05:17:29.520 --> 05:17:31.788 align:start position:0%
still references California Section
1961.2

05:17:31.788 --> 05:17:31.798 align:start position:0%
1961.2
 
05:17:34.430 --> 05:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
so we would need to revise the bill to
 
05:17:36.170 --> 05:17:36.180 align:start position:0%
address the federal standard that's
 
05:17:37.970 --> 05:17:37.980 align:start position:0%
matching that
 
05:17:37.980 --> 05:17:40.010 align:start position:0%
matching that
okay

05:17:40.010 --> 05:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:17:42.650 --> 05:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
representative barajny has a question
 
05:17:46.070 --> 05:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman on here there's 10
 
05:17:48.890 --> 05:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
states listed as having adopted the Lev
 
05:17:50.750 --> 05:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
Zev standard that all 10 of these states
 
05:17:52.970 --> 05:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
adopt uh pretty much the same language
 
05:17:55.788 --> 05:17:55.798 align:start position:0%
referring to the California code thank
 
05:17:55.798 --> 05:17:57.470 align:start position:0%
referring to the California code thank
you

05:17:57.470 --> 05:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:17:59.510 --> 05:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
um yes the answer is yes thank you for
 
05:18:00.590 --> 05:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
the question
 
05:18:03.170 --> 05:18:03.180 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki has a question uh
 
05:18:04.250 --> 05:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:18:04.260 --> 05:18:05.510 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
representative

05:18:05.510 --> 05:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:18:07.730 --> 05:18:07.740 align:start position:0%
um on the eight year warranty does that
 
05:18:09.050 --> 05:18:09.060 align:start position:0%
include the battery it's a two-part
 
05:18:09.060 --> 05:18:10.310 align:start position:0%
include the battery it's a two-part
question

05:18:10.310 --> 05:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:18:12.170 --> 05:18:12.180 align:start position:0%
would the would the warranty include the
 
05:18:12.180 --> 05:18:14.570 align:start position:0%
would the would the warranty include the
battery

05:18:14.570 --> 05:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:16.788 --> 05:18:16.798 align:start position:0%
I believe so but I will probably be
 
05:18:18.530 --> 05:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
corrected if I tell you the wrong thing
 
05:18:20.628 --> 05:18:20.638 align:start position:0%
by someone after me I believe that is
 
05:18:22.550 --> 05:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
true and the second part of it is then
 
05:18:24.230 --> 05:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
would the manufacturers not build the
 
05:18:26.208 --> 05:18:26.218 align:start position:0%
cost of a battery replacement into each
 
05:18:29.270 --> 05:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh electric vehicle sold and that would
 
05:18:30.948 --> 05:18:30.958 align:start position:0%
increase the prices by whatever amount
 
05:18:32.868 --> 05:18:32.878 align:start position:0%
that might be
 
05:18:32.878 --> 05:18:34.368 align:start position:0%
that might be
foreign

05:18:34.368 --> 05:18:34.378 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:18:36.770 --> 05:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
so I can't speak to how manufacturers
 
05:18:38.628 --> 05:18:38.638 align:start position:0%
set their pricing or how they determine
 
05:18:40.250 --> 05:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
what they do for a warranty program
 
05:18:41.990 --> 05:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I don't have enough
 
05:18:44.810 --> 05:18:44.820 align:start position:0%
information on how Ford creates their
 
05:18:46.850 --> 05:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
pricing or what their idea is for
 
05:18:48.350 --> 05:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
something under a warranty in a zeber
 
05:18:50.270 --> 05:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
love state but we may have someone here
 
05:18:55.250 --> 05:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:58.670 --> 05:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
05:19:00.410 --> 05:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:19:00.420 --> 05:19:01.368 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

05:19:01.368 --> 05:19:01.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:04.730 --> 05:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
you stated that a major goal of this
 
05:19:07.670 --> 05:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
bill would be to increase
 
05:19:11.628 --> 05:19:11.638 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire residents access to
 
05:19:13.550 --> 05:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles and low emission
 
05:19:17.270 --> 05:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
vehicles on dealers Lots our our New
 
05:19:21.610 --> 05:19:21.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dealers losing out currently
 
05:19:25.850 --> 05:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
when New Hampshire folks go shopping for
 
05:19:28.310 --> 05:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
a car and they can't find one on New
 
05:19:30.050 --> 05:19:30.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lots are they crossing the
 
05:19:32.690 --> 05:19:32.700 align:start position:0%
lines to Maine Vermont Massachusetts and
 
05:19:34.730 --> 05:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
buying their electric cars
 
05:19:34.740 --> 05:19:36.170 align:start position:0%
buying their electric cars
there

05:19:36.170 --> 05:19:36.180 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:19:37.970 --> 05:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
great question
 
05:19:39.770 --> 05:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
um there's
 
05:19:41.750 --> 05:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
there's the anecdotal data which you
 
05:19:43.670 --> 05:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
just described there are certainly
 
05:19:45.890 --> 05:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
people who simply go out of state
 
05:19:47.390 --> 05:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
because they want to test drive and
 
05:19:50.150 --> 05:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
drive something off of a lot and there
 
05:19:51.708 --> 05:19:51.718 align:start position:0%
are also very large dealers in New
 
05:19:53.930 --> 05:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who are able to still get zevs
 
05:19:55.430 --> 05:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
and loves because they may have a
 
05:19:56.990 --> 05:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
location somewhere out of state and
 
05:19:59.270 --> 05:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
bring one onto a New Hampshire lot
 
05:20:02.208 --> 05:20:02.218 align:start position:0%
so it's a rather nuanced situation
 
05:20:03.770 --> 05:20:03.780 align:start position:0%
because it depends on the size of the
 
05:20:05.708 --> 05:20:05.718 align:start position:0%
dealership and their access to Vehicles
 
05:20:08.750 --> 05:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
as well as inventory right it's all
 
05:20:11.510 --> 05:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
about inventory so if we have the
 
05:20:13.550 --> 05:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
hottest newest Ford Model that just
 
05:20:15.050 --> 05:20:15.060 align:start position:0%
comes out in January that everybody
 
05:20:17.030 --> 05:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
wants to buy it's going to be very
 
05:20:19.190 --> 05:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
difficult even for a dealer who is cross
 
05:20:21.288 --> 05:20:21.298 align:start position:0%
state lines to bring one into a New
 
05:20:22.970 --> 05:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lot because it may be so hot
 
05:20:24.350 --> 05:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and they need to meet the
 
05:20:26.150 --> 05:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
credit requirement elsewhere that
 
05:20:28.610 --> 05:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
they're trying to sell it to to keep
 
05:20:32.390 --> 05:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
that met so to answer your question I
 
05:20:35.330 --> 05:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
think we have seen that it is an issue
 
05:20:37.550 --> 05:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
with behavior of car buyers and
 
05:20:39.948 --> 05:20:39.958 align:start position:0%
certainly access to zevs and loves in
 
05:20:41.448 --> 05:20:41.458 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is limited because we
 
05:20:46.010 --> 05:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:49.550 --> 05:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
05:20:51.470 --> 05:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:20:53.208 --> 05:20:53.218 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
05:20:56.330 --> 05:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
actually two questions one is the table
 
05:20:58.610 --> 05:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
that you sent us about EV sales I just
 
05:21:00.128 --> 05:21:00.138 align:start position:0%
want to verify that these are about
 
05:21:02.810 --> 05:21:02.820 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle sales and not
 
05:21:05.690 --> 05:21:05.700 align:start position:0%
electrified vehicle sales I know for
 
05:21:07.550 --> 05:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
example Toyota has been advertising they
 
05:21:09.650 --> 05:21:09.660 align:start position:0%
have electrified vehicles but they don't
 
05:21:13.128 --> 05:21:13.138 align:start position:0%
currently sell a single EV
 
05:21:15.970 --> 05:21:15.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh once again
 
05:21:18.650 --> 05:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
I did attach the article to back up the
 
05:21:20.150 --> 05:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
data that I was reading out loud so you
 
05:21:21.650 --> 05:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
can actually go through and see exactly
 
05:21:23.590 --> 05:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
where Toyota falls on this
 
05:21:27.230 --> 05:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing is low emissions Lev
 
05:21:30.350 --> 05:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
would be the Toyota zero emissions would
 
05:21:32.330 --> 05:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
be something like Tesla
 
05:21:35.150 --> 05:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
okay and and if I may ask the second
 
05:21:37.730 --> 05:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah thank you
 
05:21:40.190 --> 05:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
um about the fee for inspection stickers
 
05:21:41.750 --> 05:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
I actually received an email from
 
05:21:43.850 --> 05:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
someone complaining about the increased
 
05:21:46.970 --> 05:21:46.980 align:start position:0%
fee for inspection stickers so uh as I
 
05:21:49.970 --> 05:21:49.980 align:start position:0%
understand it it's a change of 50 cents
 
05:21:52.490 --> 05:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
per sticker now are these are these
 
05:21:55.010 --> 05:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
stickers these are issued to the
 
05:21:55.020 --> 05:21:56.628 align:start position:0%
stickers these are issued to the
inspectors

05:21:56.628 --> 05:21:56.638 align:start position:0%
inspectors
 
05:21:59.270 --> 05:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
who then may or may not pass that cost
 
05:22:04.670 --> 05:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:07.070 --> 05:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure the answer to this
 
05:22:10.490 --> 05:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
question on how we handle the finances I
 
05:22:11.930 --> 05:22:11.940 align:start position:0%
can tell you as someone who gets my car
 
05:22:15.350 --> 05:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
inspected every year there is a there's
 
05:22:17.390 --> 05:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
a line item for the inspection sticker
 
05:22:19.250 --> 05:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
fee but then I get service charges and
 
05:22:21.948 --> 05:22:21.958 align:start position:0%
additional stuff on the bill so I don't
 
05:22:23.750 --> 05:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
entirely know how that's structured in
 
05:22:26.990 --> 05:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
terms of the 50 cents due does get I
 
05:22:28.250 --> 05:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
think it actually says in the bill
 
05:22:29.930 --> 05:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
exactly how it's structured for passing
 
05:22:33.708 --> 05:22:33.718 align:start position:0%
it on 50 Cents gets passed on for DS to
 
05:22:34.750 --> 05:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
hire someone
 
05:22:37.430 --> 05:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
but the actual cost of the sticker I
 
05:22:38.690 --> 05:22:38.700 align:start position:0%
just don't know enough about how we do
 
05:22:42.070 --> 05:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:45.410 --> 05:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a question
 
05:22:48.350 --> 05:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh so when you
 
05:22:50.030 --> 05:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
introduced the bill you said one of the
 
05:22:54.110 --> 05:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
key drivers was lowering emissions uh
 
05:22:56.090 --> 05:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
and so we wanted trans you want to
 
05:23:00.708 --> 05:23:00.718 align:start position:0%
transfer us over to uh levs and zero
 
05:23:04.010 --> 05:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
emission vehicles uh but that
 
05:23:06.350 --> 05:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
electricity is made by
 
05:23:06.360 --> 05:23:08.448 align:start position:0%
electricity is made by
uh

05:23:08.448 --> 05:23:08.458 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:23:11.570 --> 05:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
well in New Hampshire largely
 
05:23:11.580 --> 05:23:12.350 align:start position:0%
well in New Hampshire largely
um

05:23:12.350 --> 05:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:16.690 --> 05:23:16.700 align:start position:0%
uh natural gas so how have we really
 
05:23:19.368 --> 05:23:19.378 align:start position:0%
changed the net emission profile have
 
05:23:21.350 --> 05:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
you have you studied what's happening
 
05:23:21.360 --> 05:23:22.310 align:start position:0%
you have you studied what's happening
there

05:23:22.310 --> 05:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:23:24.170 --> 05:23:24.180 align:start position:0%
so I have some really exciting news for
 
05:23:26.650 --> 05:23:26.660 align:start position:0%
you representative Bernardi
 
05:23:30.770 --> 05:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
these zebs and Labs mostly the zephs
 
05:23:33.708 --> 05:23:33.718 align:start position:0%
have batteries and we are now just
 
05:23:35.510 --> 05:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
entering the ERA this is exciting right
 
05:23:37.550 --> 05:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
for the engineering science Geeks in the
 
05:23:39.350 --> 05:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
room we're now just entering into the
 
05:23:41.930 --> 05:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
era of being able to charge back to the
 
05:23:41.940 --> 05:23:42.770 align:start position:0%
era of being able to charge back to the
grid

05:23:42.770 --> 05:23:42.780 align:start position:0%
grid
 
05:23:45.830 --> 05:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
so when you have a let's just say it's a
 
05:23:48.470 --> 05:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
Zev parked in your garage
 
05:23:51.050 --> 05:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
and you hook it up you can actually be
 
05:23:53.628 --> 05:23:53.638 align:start position:0%
putting the battery back in the grid to
 
05:23:55.670 --> 05:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
reduce your electric bill
 
05:23:58.850 --> 05:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
and then when it's a lower rate time you
 
05:24:01.070 --> 05:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
can be drawing from the grid to recharge
 
05:24:02.628 --> 05:24:02.638 align:start position:0%
the battery so this is something that
 
05:24:04.490 --> 05:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
the co-op is pioneering it's super
 
05:24:07.010 --> 05:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
exciting and we're just at the cusp of
 
05:24:09.350 --> 05:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
it so when you talk about what our grid
 
05:24:11.690 --> 05:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
is made up of yes fundamentally we are
 
05:24:13.670 --> 05:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
both nuclear and natural gas in New
 
05:24:13.680 --> 05:24:14.510 align:start position:0%
both nuclear and natural gas in New
Hampshire

05:24:14.510 --> 05:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:24:17.150 --> 05:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
but moving forward as we increase our
 
05:24:19.070 --> 05:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
Renewables and as we look at
 
05:24:21.770 --> 05:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
alternatives for how we diversify our
 
05:24:23.868 --> 05:24:23.878 align:start position:0%
energy sources in New Hampshire we're
 
05:24:26.868 --> 05:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
able to keep it in New Hampshire in the
 
05:24:28.850 --> 05:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
battery in your vehicle
 
05:24:30.470 --> 05:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
and then put it back in the grid to help
 
05:24:32.030 --> 05:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
your neighbor out which is super
 
05:24:32.040 --> 05:24:35.570 align:start position:0%
your neighbor out which is super
exciting

05:24:35.570 --> 05:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:35.580 --> 05:24:37.190 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

05:24:37.190 --> 05:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:24:42.490 --> 05:24:42.500 align:start position:0%
so right now natural gas nuclear are the
 
05:24:45.770 --> 05:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
means of producing electricity so if we
 
05:24:48.830 --> 05:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
you have to charge that battery with
 
05:24:51.110 --> 05:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
electrical power so it's coming from
 
05:24:54.490 --> 05:24:54.500 align:start position:0%
either Seabrook station or natural gas
 
05:24:58.010 --> 05:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
facilities or bow when it's running or
 
05:25:00.650 --> 05:25:00.660 align:start position:0%
whatever with coal so you're powering
 
05:25:04.250 --> 05:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
that battery and that car with
 
05:25:07.010 --> 05:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels how is that changing the
 
05:25:09.410 --> 05:25:09.420 align:start position:0%
net emission standards or what's the net
 
05:25:09.420 --> 05:25:11.150 align:start position:0%
net emission standards or what's the net
Delta

05:25:11.150 --> 05:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
Delta
 
05:25:13.730 --> 05:25:13.740 align:start position:0%
so this is a long
 
05:25:15.470 --> 05:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
a long lead bill this is Forward
 
05:25:18.650 --> 05:25:18.660 align:start position:0%
Thinking we're talking about setting
 
05:25:20.930 --> 05:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
this up so seven years from now when
 
05:25:22.670 --> 05:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
we've achieved those goals that the
 
05:25:24.708 --> 05:25:24.718 align:start position:0%
manufacturers are listing or 17 years
 
05:25:26.208 --> 05:25:26.218 align:start position:0%
from now when the longer lead
 
05:25:29.208 --> 05:25:29.218 align:start position:0%
manufacturers have achieved their goals
 
05:25:31.730 --> 05:25:31.740 align:start position:0%
and I have a lot of Hope
 
05:25:33.770 --> 05:25:33.780 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire will be able to do
 
05:25:36.590 --> 05:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
this and will increase the Renewables in
 
05:25:37.670 --> 05:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
our grid
 
05:25:40.010 --> 05:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
then we're going to have more diversity
 
05:25:41.810 --> 05:25:41.820 align:start position:0%
and we're going to be able to use the
 
05:25:43.368 --> 05:25:43.378 align:start position:0%
batteries and we're going to be able to
 
05:25:46.010 --> 05:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
pull but you're right for today
 
05:25:48.110 --> 05:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
all of that is just long-term planning
 
05:25:50.270 --> 05:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
but we have to start somewhere so that's
 
05:25:52.730 --> 05:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
what this is it sets up a plan
 
05:25:56.570 --> 05:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:58.550 --> 05:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
I have some additional information about
 
05:26:01.310 --> 05:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
a question earlier
 
05:26:03.708 --> 05:26:03.718 align:start position:0%
California was given a waiver under the
 
05:26:05.930 --> 05:26:05.940 align:start position:0%
clear Clean Air Act the federal
 
05:26:11.990 --> 05:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:13.788 --> 05:26:13.798 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
05:26:15.350 --> 05:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
answer to a question I think
 
05:26:18.170 --> 05:26:18.180 align:start position:0%
Representatives Summers had
 
05:26:20.510 --> 05:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
are there any representative Reynolds
 
05:26:22.190 --> 05:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
05:26:23.868 --> 05:26:23.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:26:26.208 --> 05:26:26.218 align:start position:0%
um representative McWilliams is it isn't
 
05:26:29.090 --> 05:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
the correct answer to representative
 
05:26:31.730 --> 05:26:31.740 align:start position:0%
Bernardi's question that
 
05:26:36.288 --> 05:26:36.298 align:start position:0%
the fact that yes all electricity
 
05:26:38.690 --> 05:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
we're charging electric vehicles comes
 
05:26:41.510 --> 05:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
from the grid but as we were told by the
 
05:26:45.110 --> 05:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
utilities and the iso just last week
 
05:26:48.948 --> 05:26:48.958 align:start position:0%
less than half of the Grid electricity
 
05:26:51.830 --> 05:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
comes from natural gas and oil combined
 
05:26:56.868 --> 05:26:56.878 align:start position:0%
and 23 plus 16 plus 6 percent comes from
 
05:27:01.010 --> 05:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
nuclear and hydro and 10 Renewables and
 
05:27:04.070 --> 05:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
16 Imports which is mostly Quebec Hydro
 
05:27:07.190 --> 05:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
so isn't the grid much cleaner
 
05:27:08.990 --> 05:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
so we're comparing apples to oranges
 
05:27:10.910 --> 05:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Reynolds when
 
05:27:12.288 --> 05:27:12.298 align:start position:0%
we talk about New Hampshire's energy
 
05:27:14.628 --> 05:27:14.638 align:start position:0%
versus the big bucket that is ISO New
 
05:27:17.090 --> 05:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
England obviously we're part of iso New
 
05:27:18.948 --> 05:27:18.958 align:start position:0%
England so unless we act like Texas and
 
05:27:20.990 --> 05:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
create our own special grid we're going
 
05:27:23.270 --> 05:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
to have to and in a good way we're going
 
05:27:24.708 --> 05:27:24.718 align:start position:0%
to be sharing multiple different kinds
 
05:27:26.150 --> 05:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
of energy so thank you for the question
 
05:27:28.310 --> 05:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds and yes there
 
05:27:30.050 --> 05:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
are many other contributors to our mix
 
05:27:31.670 --> 05:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire because we're part of
 
05:27:34.970 --> 05:27:34.980 align:start position:0%
iso New England but two representative
 
05:27:37.250 --> 05:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
Bernardi's question I think we do need
 
05:27:38.570 --> 05:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
to look at diversifying our mix
 
05:27:40.430 --> 05:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
specifically in New Hampshire because we
 
05:27:43.070 --> 05:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
do want to have the ability to charge an
 
05:27:45.590 --> 05:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle off of local homegrown
 
05:27:47.510 --> 05:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
renewable energy right wherever it's
 
05:27:50.750 --> 05:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:53.448 --> 05:27:53.458 align:start position:0%
representative pleasure has a question
 
05:27:56.270 --> 05:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair uh thank you Michael
 
05:27:58.850 --> 05:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
Williams representative
 
05:27:58.860 --> 05:27:59.448 align:start position:0%
Williams representative
um

05:27:59.448 --> 05:27:59.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:03.170 --> 05:28:03.180 align:start position:0%
or questions if I read this right
 
05:28:03.180 --> 05:28:04.550 align:start position:0%
or questions if I read this right
um

05:28:04.550 --> 05:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:07.070 --> 05:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
the first one is there other any other
 
05:28:09.170 --> 05:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
companies New Hampshire that we
 
05:28:18.170 --> 05:28:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:21.410 --> 05:28:21.420 align:start position:0%
so we regulate things that need to be
 
05:28:22.970 --> 05:28:22.980 align:start position:0%
regulated this is the energy industry
 
05:28:24.350 --> 05:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
which is a monopoly that requires
 
05:28:26.868 --> 05:28:26.878 align:start position:0%
regulation and guard rails we also
 
05:28:29.868 --> 05:28:29.878 align:start position:0%
regulate pharmaceutical industry we have
 
05:28:31.250 --> 05:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
certain things that you can't sell right
 
05:28:32.868 --> 05:28:32.878 align:start position:0%
now I know there's a bill being heard
 
05:28:35.810 --> 05:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
tomorrow related to cannabis so we have
 
05:28:37.670 --> 05:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
regulations as the government because we
 
05:28:39.350 --> 05:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
decide to step in and set guardrails
 
05:28:42.050 --> 05:28:42.060 align:start position:0%
around specific items
 
05:28:47.868 --> 05:28:47.878 align:start position:0%
a follow-up to follow up thank you um
 
05:28:50.628 --> 05:28:50.638 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to add two together
 
05:28:53.090 --> 05:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
the question is is this going to
 
05:28:55.788 --> 05:28:55.798 align:start position:0%
increase the size of government and add
 
05:28:59.390 --> 05:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
more fees in a inflationary period thank
 
05:28:59.400 --> 05:29:02.810 align:start position:0%
more fees in a inflationary period thank
you

05:29:02.810 --> 05:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:04.550 --> 05:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
this is going to increase the size of
 
05:29:06.110 --> 05:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
government and add additional fees
 
05:29:07.490 --> 05:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
that's your question
 
05:29:07.500 --> 05:29:08.810 align:start position:0%
that's your question
correct

05:29:08.810 --> 05:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:29:12.708 --> 05:29:12.718 align:start position:0%
well the bill does add a position and 50
 
05:29:15.890 --> 05:29:15.900 align:start position:0%
cents so the simple answer is yes the
 
05:29:22.730 --> 05:29:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:25.250 --> 05:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
okay see no further questions for
 
05:29:27.350 --> 05:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams I'll next call
 
05:29:29.150 --> 05:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
on Mike Fitzgerald from New Hampshire
 
05:29:33.368 --> 05:29:33.378 align:start position:0%
Des who wants to um
 
05:29:35.810 --> 05:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
elaborate on a couple of the issues
 
05:29:43.250 --> 05:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:45.590 --> 05:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair Mike Fitzgerald
 
05:29:47.628 --> 05:29:47.638 align:start position:0%
assistant director of the air division
 
05:29:49.550 --> 05:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services our
 
05:29:52.788 --> 05:29:52.798 align:start position:0%
department takes no position on the bill
 
05:29:56.570 --> 05:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
um I do want to uh uh provide a little a
 
05:29:58.070 --> 05:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
little bit of context on a couple of
 
05:30:00.170 --> 05:30:00.180 align:start position:0%
issues that have been raised
 
05:30:03.788 --> 05:30:03.798 align:start position:0%
um first just for clarity the uh as uh
 
05:30:06.650 --> 05:30:06.660 align:start position:0%
cheerivos indicated the federal Clean
 
05:30:09.050 --> 05:30:09.060 align:start position:0%
Air Act does provide that California can
 
05:30:10.788 --> 05:30:10.798 align:start position:0%
establish its own vehicle emission
 
05:30:14.150 --> 05:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
standards and that in order to do so
 
05:30:16.128 --> 05:30:16.138 align:start position:0%
they must achieve a must receive a
 
05:30:19.190 --> 05:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
waiver from the EPA uh each time they do
 
05:30:21.310 --> 05:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
that that has been that has happened
 
05:30:23.990 --> 05:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
numerous times over the past 20 years
 
05:30:25.850 --> 05:30:25.860 align:start position:0%
California has established this low
 
05:30:28.128 --> 05:30:28.138 align:start position:0%
Mission vehicle program and it has been
 
05:30:30.890 --> 05:30:30.900 align:start position:0%
consistently provided a waiver what
 
05:30:33.350 --> 05:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
section 177 of the Clean Air Act does is
 
05:30:35.150 --> 05:30:35.160 align:start position:0%
it allows other states to adopt
 
05:30:38.208 --> 05:30:38.218 align:start position:0%
California's regulations but section 177
 
05:30:40.730 --> 05:30:40.740 align:start position:0%
is extremely clear that there are two
 
05:30:40.740 --> 05:30:41.750 align:start position:0%
is extremely clear that there are two
choices

05:30:41.750 --> 05:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
choices
 
05:30:43.670 --> 05:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
Federal standards or California
 
05:30:46.010 --> 05:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
standards no state may adopt any
 
05:30:49.190 --> 05:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
standard that is some hybrid where you
 
05:30:51.110 --> 05:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
pick and choose some part of California
 
05:30:53.690 --> 05:30:53.700 align:start position:0%
standards or whatever you adopt
 
05:30:55.970 --> 05:30:55.980 align:start position:0%
California standards as they are or you
 
05:30:58.910 --> 05:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
adopt or you just live with the federal
 
05:31:02.090 --> 05:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
standards you cannot the the general
 
05:31:04.430 --> 05:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
interpretation of that is you cannot
 
05:31:07.550 --> 05:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
write a bill or or adopt something in
 
05:31:09.170 --> 05:31:09.180 align:start position:0%
legislation that would have the effect
 
05:31:11.690 --> 05:31:11.700 align:start position:0%
of creating a third car a third vehicle
 
05:31:13.850 --> 05:31:13.860 align:start position:0%
there's either California vehicles or
 
05:31:16.190 --> 05:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
federally certified Vehicles currently
 
05:31:18.470 --> 05:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
California and the federal federal
 
05:31:21.890 --> 05:31:21.900 align:start position:0%
vehicle program are harmonized through
 
05:31:24.470 --> 05:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
the year 2025.
 
05:31:27.470 --> 05:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
um I believe in EPA intends probably to
 
05:31:29.868 --> 05:31:29.878 align:start position:0%
extend to extend that some period after
 
05:31:33.288 --> 05:31:33.298 align:start position:0%
2025 the federal standards California
 
05:31:35.868 --> 05:31:35.878 align:start position:0%
has indicated a that they they would
 
05:31:37.910 --> 05:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
deviate that was an agreement between
 
05:31:39.530 --> 05:31:39.540 align:start position:0%
California and the and the federal
 
05:31:41.810 --> 05:31:41.820 align:start position:0%
program several years ago that they
 
05:31:44.448 --> 05:31:44.458 align:start position:0%
would harmonize those standards and so
 
05:31:48.050 --> 05:31:48.060 align:start position:0%
through 2025 those would be um those
 
05:31:49.910 --> 05:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
standards would be the same after that
 
05:31:51.550 --> 05:31:51.560 align:start position:0%
it would depend on what California does
 
05:31:55.670 --> 05:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
this bill does indicate prospective
 
05:31:57.590 --> 05:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
adoption of California standards that
 
05:31:59.030 --> 05:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
would be consistent with the Clean Air
 
05:32:01.430 --> 05:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
Act requirement because if we were to
 
05:32:03.650 --> 05:32:03.660 align:start position:0%
adopt the California standards as of
 
05:32:06.230 --> 05:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
today and then they changed them next
 
05:32:06.240 --> 05:32:07.368 align:start position:0%
today and then they changed them next
year

05:32:07.368 --> 05:32:07.378 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:32:10.430 --> 05:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
then for that period that would create a
 
05:32:13.430 --> 05:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
third vehicle essentially and so we
 
05:32:15.470 --> 05:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
would be prohibited from doing that we
 
05:32:16.670 --> 05:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
would need we would need to be
 
05:32:19.610 --> 05:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
harmonized one way or another
 
05:32:21.770 --> 05:32:21.780 align:start position:0%
um uh the technical issue that I want to
 
05:32:23.868 --> 05:32:23.878 align:start position:0%
point out just very quickly is that um
 
05:32:28.368 --> 05:32:28.378 align:start position:0%
the uh section 177 and the Clean Air Act
 
05:32:31.190 --> 05:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
does require a four-year lead time
 
05:32:33.470 --> 05:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
um I I also want to apologize uh Becky
 
05:32:34.970 --> 05:32:34.980 align:start position:0%
ohler who many of you met last week
 
05:32:37.368 --> 05:32:37.378 align:start position:0%
she's our expert on this uh this
 
05:32:40.128 --> 05:32:40.138 align:start position:0%
situation she's also in in Dover without
 
05:32:42.230 --> 05:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
power today and that could not be here
 
05:32:44.868 --> 05:32:44.878 align:start position:0%
so I apologize up front I'm not the
 
05:32:46.730 --> 05:32:46.740 align:start position:0%
technical expert but
 
05:32:48.948 --> 05:32:48.958 align:start position:0%
um we certainly can get answers to to
 
05:32:51.110 --> 05:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
questions that I that I don't know of
 
05:32:53.390 --> 05:32:53.400 align:start position:0%
which there may be many but
 
05:32:56.570 --> 05:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
um the the dates in here are not
 
05:32:58.430 --> 05:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
implementable first of all it would be
 
05:33:01.368 --> 05:33:01.378 align:start position:0%
impossible for us to adopt rules in the
 
05:33:03.708 --> 05:33:03.718 align:start position:0%
time frame that's allotted here
 
05:33:07.490 --> 05:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
um General rulemaking from we would need
 
05:33:09.230 --> 05:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
to start commence rulemaking we couldn't
 
05:33:10.850 --> 05:33:10.860 align:start position:0%
commence that rulemaking until after
 
05:33:13.970 --> 05:33:13.980 align:start position:0%
this bill passed and and was signed into
 
05:33:15.590 --> 05:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
law by the governor until effective date
 
05:33:18.230 --> 05:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
of the bill and then it takes us
 
05:33:20.448 --> 05:33:20.458 align:start position:0%
approximate only one year to go through
 
05:33:23.708 --> 05:33:23.718 align:start position:0%
the rule adoption process so that they
 
05:33:28.430 --> 05:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
we could not meet and then I'm again I'm
 
05:33:30.230 --> 05:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
not certain on this issue there's some
 
05:33:31.550 --> 05:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
there's some question whether it's two
 
05:33:33.110 --> 05:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
years or four years and perhaps the auto
 
05:33:35.150 --> 05:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
dealers who are here may have a little
 
05:33:39.110 --> 05:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
bit more information but I uh the the
 
05:33:41.270 --> 05:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
Clean Air Act does specify the number of
 
05:33:44.150 --> 05:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
years of model year lead time that that
 
05:33:46.970 --> 05:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
it must be given before implementing
 
05:33:51.110 --> 05:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
these requirements so that would be an
 
05:33:52.610 --> 05:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
issue that we would need to take a look
 
05:33:55.310 --> 05:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
at and resolve
 
05:33:55.320 --> 05:33:57.170 align:start position:0%
at and resolve
so

05:33:57.170 --> 05:33:57.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:33:57.180 --> 05:33:58.010 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:33:58.010 --> 05:33:58.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:02.090 --> 05:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
the bill does uh have a fee the question
 
05:34:03.770 --> 05:34:03.780 align:start position:0%
was asked about the source of that fee
 
05:34:05.750 --> 05:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
that fee is currently three dollars and
 
05:34:08.150 --> 05:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
25 cents that's a fee that you pay when
 
05:34:09.650 --> 05:34:09.660 align:start position:0%
you have your vehicle inspected for the
 
05:34:12.770 --> 05:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
onboard diagnostics portion of your uh
 
05:34:16.010 --> 05:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
your inspection and uh that fee
 
05:34:18.170 --> 05:34:18.180 align:start position:0%
currently is three dollars and 25 cents
 
05:34:21.050 --> 05:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
we received 25 cents of that fee to work
 
05:34:23.208 --> 05:34:23.218 align:start position:0%
on programs to reduce emissions from
 
05:34:26.448 --> 05:34:26.458 align:start position:0%
Vehicles this bill would change that fee
 
05:34:29.510 --> 05:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
to 375 and allocate an additional 50
 
05:34:32.208 --> 05:34:32.218 align:start position:0%
cents to the department again to create
 
05:34:34.310 --> 05:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
a position to administer this there has
 
05:34:36.708 --> 05:34:36.718 align:start position:0%
to be someone to check to make sure the
 
05:34:38.510 --> 05:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle manufacturers they submit all
 
05:34:40.788 --> 05:34:40.798 align:start position:0%
their reports and and someone would need
 
05:34:42.170 --> 05:34:42.180 align:start position:0%
to audit those and go through them and
 
05:34:44.150 --> 05:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
determine whether whether the standards
 
05:34:46.190 --> 05:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
were being met and those standards are
 
05:34:49.070 --> 05:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
met by supplying certain Vehicles the
 
05:34:51.530 --> 05:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
issue with regards to supply of vehicles
 
05:34:53.270 --> 05:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
again that's one that the dealers can
 
05:34:55.010 --> 05:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
probably speak to better than I but I
 
05:34:56.810 --> 05:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
would just mention
 
05:34:58.750 --> 05:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
um there there is
 
05:35:01.670 --> 05:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
since the other states that have adopted
 
05:35:03.288 --> 05:35:03.298 align:start position:0%
California Lev
 
05:35:05.510 --> 05:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
the left does create certain
 
05:35:07.430 --> 05:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
requirements for certain amounts certain
 
05:35:10.368 --> 05:35:10.378 align:start position:0%
percentages of vehicles to be sold and
 
05:35:12.050 --> 05:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
so states that have adopted the
 
05:35:14.810 --> 05:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
California standards must meet those
 
05:35:17.990 --> 05:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
percentages as well and so therefore the
 
05:35:18.000 --> 05:35:19.190 align:start position:0%
percentages as well and so therefore the
dealers

05:35:19.190 --> 05:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
dealers
 
05:35:22.070 --> 05:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers May
 
05:35:25.070 --> 05:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
preferentially Supply certain vehicles
 
05:35:28.190 --> 05:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
to other states that have adopted these
 
05:35:31.190 --> 05:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
vehicles that that we have not so they
 
05:35:32.628 --> 05:35:32.638 align:start position:0%
may they may just say well there's only
 
05:35:34.788 --> 05:35:34.798 align:start position:0%
X supply of
 
05:35:34.798 --> 05:35:36.368 align:start position:0%
X supply of
model

05:35:36.368 --> 05:35:36.378 align:start position:0%
model
 
05:35:39.770 --> 05:35:39.780 align:start position:0%
b470 and we therefore are going to
 
05:35:41.690 --> 05:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
allocate allocate them to Connecticut
 
05:35:43.970 --> 05:35:43.980 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire doesn't have the
 
05:35:46.970 --> 05:35:46.980 align:start position:0%
requirement in place but as to whether
 
05:35:49.550 --> 05:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
that creates particular shortages or not
 
05:35:52.550 --> 05:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to one issue that
 
05:35:54.170 --> 05:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi brought up I
 
05:35:55.970 --> 05:35:55.980 align:start position:0%
would I would just simply address also
 
05:35:57.288 --> 05:35:57.298 align:start position:0%
that the
 
05:36:00.530 --> 05:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
uh electric vehicles are inherently more
 
05:36:02.810 --> 05:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
efficient and in their use of energy so
 
05:36:02.820 --> 05:36:04.208 align:start position:0%
efficient and in their use of energy so
therefore

05:36:04.208 --> 05:36:04.218 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
05:36:06.890 --> 05:36:06.900 align:start position:0%
whereas a fossil fuel powered vehicle is
 
05:36:08.690 --> 05:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
on the order of 20 to 30 percent
 
05:36:10.730 --> 05:36:10.740 align:start position:0%
efficient in converting that fossil fuel
 
05:36:13.850 --> 05:36:13.860 align:start position:0%
it's close it's very very significantly
 
05:36:16.430 --> 05:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
higher double maybe even triple in some
 
05:36:19.850 --> 05:36:19.860 align:start position:0%
cases in terms of the efficiency of the
 
05:36:21.470 --> 05:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
electricity that's used so even though
 
05:36:23.030 --> 05:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
the electricity may have come from the
 
05:36:25.730 --> 05:36:25.740 align:start position:0%
same Source less energy is required to
 
05:36:28.670 --> 05:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
convert that energy into the wheels
 
05:36:32.090 --> 05:36:32.100 align:start position:0%
turning on the ground so there is a a
 
05:36:35.690 --> 05:36:35.700 align:start position:0%
benefit even today to that
 
05:36:40.910 --> 05:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh to that situation uh I think
 
05:36:45.708 --> 05:36:45.718 align:start position:0%
um that pretty much concludes my uh
 
05:36:45.718 --> 05:36:47.090 align:start position:0%
um that pretty much concludes my uh
um

05:36:47.090 --> 05:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:49.550 --> 05:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
concerns and I'd be happy to try to
 
05:36:51.530 --> 05:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
address any questions again
 
05:36:54.110 --> 05:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
um we can produce mazola for
 
05:36:57.170 --> 05:36:57.180 align:start position:0%
um a work session or whatever or provide
 
05:36:59.170 --> 05:36:59.180 align:start position:0%
to other information
 
05:37:01.250 --> 05:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
following this hearing
 
05:37:03.770 --> 05:37:03.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Fitzgerald representative
 
05:37:05.930 --> 05:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
Doug Thomas has a question
 
05:37:07.670 --> 05:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:37:09.288 --> 05:37:09.298 align:start position:0%
my question this is just a clarification
 
05:37:12.530 --> 05:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
I I may have misheard what you said you
 
05:37:15.110 --> 05:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
said that the federal standards and the
 
05:37:16.550 --> 05:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
California standards are the same
 
05:37:16.560 --> 05:37:17.708 align:start position:0%
California standards are the same
currently

05:37:17.708 --> 05:37:17.718 align:start position:0%
currently
 
05:37:21.288 --> 05:37:21.298 align:start position:0%
did you mean to imply that New Hampshire
 
05:37:26.330 --> 05:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
is currently under those standards yes
 
05:37:28.430 --> 05:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
because the federal has standards
 
05:37:31.310 --> 05:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
Federal as a state either follows the
 
05:37:33.350 --> 05:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
federal standards or they may adopt the
 
05:37:35.750 --> 05:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
California standards those are the only
 
05:37:38.930 --> 05:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
two choices and so the federal standards
 
05:37:40.670 --> 05:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
are in effect in New Hampshire
 
05:37:42.410 --> 05:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
and they're both the same they're both
 
05:37:44.930 --> 05:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
the same through 2025.
 
05:37:48.530 --> 05:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
um okay that's fine gratification thank
 
05:37:51.050 --> 05:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Corman has a
 
05:37:53.570 --> 05:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman I'm
 
05:37:56.570 --> 05:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
wondering if you're able to compare the
 
05:37:59.810 --> 05:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
emissions uh the tailpipe emissions for
 
05:38:03.470 --> 05:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh a conventional vehicle an internal
 
05:38:05.810 --> 05:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
combustion vehicle let's say per gallon
 
05:38:08.150 --> 05:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
of fuel burn compared with at a power
 
05:38:10.670 --> 05:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
plant per gallon gallon of fuel burned
 
05:38:13.850 --> 05:38:13.860 align:start position:0%
uh how do they compare well again it
 
05:38:15.350 --> 05:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
depends on the power plant and as was
 
05:38:17.690 --> 05:38:17.700 align:start position:0%
mentioned the grid power that comes here
 
05:38:19.730 --> 05:38:19.740 align:start position:0%
when you plug into the
 
05:38:21.590 --> 05:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
electricity here you don't know whether
 
05:38:23.390 --> 05:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
that electron came from Connecticut or
 
05:38:25.788 --> 05:38:25.798 align:start position:0%
from Seabrook or wherever but
 
05:38:28.190 --> 05:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
um so grid electricity if you look at
 
05:38:29.868 --> 05:38:29.878 align:start position:0%
ISO New England they provide an average
 
05:38:32.690 --> 05:38:32.700 align:start position:0%
overall emissions factor for for their
 
05:38:34.970 --> 05:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
electricity by and large my
 
05:38:36.590 --> 05:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
understanding here is in in New England
 
05:38:39.650 --> 05:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
is that the uh a significant amount of
 
05:38:41.628 --> 05:38:41.638 align:start position:0%
our electricity is is from natural gas
 
05:38:43.850 --> 05:38:43.860 align:start position:0%
but as was pointed out by representative
 
05:38:46.730 --> 05:38:46.740 align:start position:0%
Reynolds there as uh certainly nuclear
 
05:38:48.890 --> 05:38:48.900 align:start position:0%
non-emitting and
 
05:38:51.948 --> 05:38:51.958 align:start position:0%
um and other Renewables but if you apply
 
05:38:54.288 --> 05:38:54.298 align:start position:0%
that grid average
 
05:38:55.730 --> 05:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
um that would be the average emissions
 
05:38:58.190 --> 05:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
from from the grid and power plants are
 
05:39:00.530 --> 05:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
generally significantly more efficient
 
05:39:03.650 --> 05:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles it's a motor vehicle is a
 
05:39:05.628 --> 05:39:05.638 align:start position:0%
small power plant but inherently it's
 
05:39:08.510 --> 05:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
somewhat less efficient so in general
 
05:39:11.390 --> 05:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles fossil fuel powered motor
 
05:39:13.490 --> 05:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
vehicles are less efficient and have
 
05:39:16.010 --> 05:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
greater emissions than electric vehicles
 
05:39:17.990 --> 05:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
even when you consider the electricity
 
05:39:20.090 --> 05:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
in which the vehicle was
 
05:39:22.310 --> 05:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
was supported but it's it's a complex
 
05:39:22.320 --> 05:39:23.208 align:start position:0%
was supported but it's it's a complex
answer

05:39:23.208 --> 05:39:23.218 align:start position:0%
answer
 
05:39:26.390 --> 05:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
um to what should be an easy question my
 
05:39:26.400 --> 05:39:28.610 align:start position:0%
um to what should be an easy question my
apologies

05:39:28.610 --> 05:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
apologies
 
05:39:30.650 --> 05:39:30.660 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
05:39:33.590 --> 05:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh to go off of uh
 
05:39:34.788 --> 05:39:34.798 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi's question
 
05:39:36.410 --> 05:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
earlier and we talked about the
 
05:39:38.470 --> 05:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
efficiency and where electric vehicles
 
05:39:41.050 --> 05:39:41.060 align:start position:0%
in the long run will be more efficient
 
05:39:44.690 --> 05:39:44.700 align:start position:0%
is it not true that it takes about 17
 
05:39:47.690 --> 05:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
metric tons of CO2 to be in the
 
05:39:50.030 --> 05:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
production of a each individual electric
 
05:39:52.730 --> 05:39:52.740 align:start position:0%
car when it comes to lithium and Cobalt
 
05:39:55.070 --> 05:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
I couldn't speak to that specifically I
 
05:39:58.730 --> 05:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I I would not question there
 
05:40:00.110 --> 05:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
there certainly are emissions there are
 
05:40:02.390 --> 05:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
missions associated with production of
 
05:40:05.570 --> 05:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
any any vehicle whether they're greater
 
05:40:07.910 --> 05:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
or lesser in the production of EVS I
 
05:40:09.110 --> 05:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
certainly can't
 
05:40:12.350 --> 05:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
uh speak to that directly
 
05:40:14.390 --> 05:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a question
 
05:40:17.750 --> 05:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and just to clarify
 
05:40:17.760 --> 05:40:18.530 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and just to clarify
um

05:40:18.530 --> 05:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:20.690 --> 05:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
so if we took all the vehicles on the
 
05:40:22.490 --> 05:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
road today and converted them to
 
05:40:25.730 --> 05:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles our net emission rates
 
05:40:27.830 --> 05:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
would go down today
 
05:40:31.610 --> 05:40:31.620 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you
 
05:40:33.650 --> 05:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki has a question
 
05:40:35.570 --> 05:40:35.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:40:38.330 --> 05:40:38.340 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm wondering about
 
05:40:40.788 --> 05:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
the person who isn't here is if people
 
05:40:42.708 --> 05:40:42.718 align:start position:0%
are not you know we've had three days of
 
05:40:45.230 --> 05:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
Storms and uh the people who drive
 
05:40:47.150 --> 05:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles may not be represented
 
05:40:48.948 --> 05:40:48.958 align:start position:0%
here because they can't charge them is
 
05:40:50.810 --> 05:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
05:40:50.820 --> 05:40:51.830 align:start position:0%
that correct
I

05:40:51.830 --> 05:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:40:53.570 --> 05:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
I can't say I would imagine there are
 
05:40:55.788 --> 05:40:55.798 align:start position:0%
some people who have have some
 
05:40:57.530 --> 05:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
difficulty I live here in Concord and
 
05:40:59.330 --> 05:40:59.340 align:start position:0%
had some difficulty getting here so uh
 
05:41:02.470 --> 05:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh I would not dispute your question
 
05:41:04.610 --> 05:41:04.620 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
05:41:07.490 --> 05:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
well I just want to say that I have an
 
05:41:09.350 --> 05:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
electric car and I drove here today no
 
05:41:09.360 --> 05:41:11.270 align:start position:0%
electric car and I drove here today no
problem

05:41:11.270 --> 05:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
problem
 
05:41:14.470 --> 05:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
can you drive home all right
 
05:41:17.570 --> 05:41:17.580 align:start position:0%
representative partial has a question
 
05:41:19.670 --> 05:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chair and thank you for
 
05:41:20.868 --> 05:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:41:23.810 --> 05:41:23.820 align:start position:0%
uh would you consider that the uh miles
 
05:41:25.730 --> 05:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
per gallon equivalent that some cars
 
05:41:28.010 --> 05:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
advertise to be a good rule of thumb as
 
05:41:30.110 --> 05:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
an example I'm hoping to take possession
 
05:41:32.510 --> 05:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
of a Nissan Leaf in the near future and
 
05:41:34.310 --> 05:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
they told me that it gets the equivalent
 
05:41:37.670 --> 05:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
of 115 miles per gallon sure so that
 
05:41:39.350 --> 05:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
tells me that is more better efficient
 
05:41:42.110 --> 05:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
in line with what you're saying yes yes
 
05:41:43.670 --> 05:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
um I again I'm not sure how that's
 
05:41:46.310 --> 05:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
calculated EPA and the manufacturers
 
05:41:48.530 --> 05:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
have a fairly complex algorithm for
 
05:41:52.190 --> 05:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
determining vehicle fuel efficiency but
 
05:41:55.970 --> 05:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
by and large electric vehicles because
 
05:41:58.490 --> 05:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
they use less fuel we'll use less energy
 
05:42:02.050 --> 05:42:02.060 align:start position:0%
to produce the same output generally
 
05:42:05.868 --> 05:42:05.878 align:start position:0%
have a higher mileage efficiencies and
 
05:42:07.430 --> 05:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
that that mile per gallon equivalent
 
05:42:09.650 --> 05:42:09.660 align:start position:0%
would be calculated based on the amount
 
05:42:11.868 --> 05:42:11.878 align:start position:0%
of BTUs in a gallon of gasoline versus
 
05:42:15.770 --> 05:42:15.780 align:start position:0%
the amount of BTUs in the grid average
 
05:42:17.628 --> 05:42:17.638 align:start position:0%
in follow-up
 
05:42:19.850 --> 05:42:19.860 align:start position:0%
follow-up but just remember we're not
 
05:42:22.970 --> 05:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
here to speculate on the value of a
 
05:42:25.670 --> 05:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
electric car versus a non-electric car
 
05:42:27.230 --> 05:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
we're here to talk about whether we
 
05:42:29.208 --> 05:42:29.218 align:start position:0%
should adopt California's emission
 
05:42:29.218 --> 05:42:30.770 align:start position:0%
should adopt California's emission
standards

05:42:30.770 --> 05:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
standards
 
05:42:32.510 --> 05:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
and I will defer them
 
05:42:35.090 --> 05:42:35.100 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:42:37.430 --> 05:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
05:42:39.470 --> 05:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none we thank you Mr Fitzgerald
 
05:42:41.930 --> 05:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
for elucidating several issues and I
 
05:42:43.850 --> 05:42:43.860 align:start position:0%
called to the stand now
 
05:42:47.510 --> 05:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Lawrence Arts of Nashua who is
 
05:42:52.090 --> 05:42:52.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:55.128 --> 05:42:55.138 align:start position:0%
dude my name is
 
05:42:58.070 --> 05:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
please turn on the microphone
 
05:42:59.330 --> 05:42:59.340 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:43:01.730 --> 05:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Lawrence Arts
 
05:43:04.490 --> 05:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
from Nashua
 
05:43:07.610 --> 05:43:07.620 align:start position:0%
I am heavily opposed
 
05:43:10.310 --> 05:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
to house bill 92.
 
05:43:12.470 --> 05:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
of this bill an act requiring the
 
05:43:13.850 --> 05:43:13.860 align:start position:0%
adoption of the Innovative vehicle
 
05:43:15.590 --> 05:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
emission standards
 
05:43:18.770 --> 05:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
this bill sets us dangerous precedent it
 
05:43:21.230 --> 05:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
essentially hands over legislative and
 
05:43:23.208 --> 05:43:23.218 align:start position:0%
Rule making Authority directly to
 
05:43:25.910 --> 05:43:25.920 align:start position:0%

carb
 
05:43:31.310 --> 05:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
and perhaps even
 
05:43:33.590 --> 05:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
to the California bureau of auto repair
 
05:43:35.750 --> 05:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
which is the Babar California bar and
 
05:43:37.310 --> 05:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
gives them broad authority to set
 
05:43:39.708 --> 05:43:39.718 align:start position:0%
California style air quality policy for
 
05:43:41.208 --> 05:43:41.218 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire
 
05:43:43.190 --> 05:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
by a few
 
05:43:45.590 --> 05:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
if any of these members without ties or
 
05:43:47.448 --> 05:43:47.458 align:start position:0%
knowledge of New Hampshire it's people
 
05:43:50.330 --> 05:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
or its culture this bill hamstrings New
 
05:43:51.948 --> 05:43:51.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to automatically Implement
 
05:43:56.690 --> 05:43:56.700 align:start position:0%

05:43:59.030 --> 05:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is not California
 
05:44:01.490 --> 05:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
our climate does not lend itself well to
 
05:44:04.368 --> 05:44:04.378 align:start position:0%
outright internal combustion
 
05:44:06.530 --> 05:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
vehicle bands which this bill will
 
05:44:08.570 --> 05:44:08.580 align:start position:0%
ultimately Target it may work in
 
05:44:10.490 --> 05:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
Southern California with this year-round
 
05:44:13.250 --> 05:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
warm weather no snow and perfect roads
 
05:44:14.868 --> 05:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
but not here
 
05:44:16.368 --> 05:44:16.378 align:start position:0%
we have our own issues with Motor
 
05:44:18.650 --> 05:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
Vehicles unheard of in California like
 
05:44:23.150 --> 05:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
cold Winters salted roads and rust
 
05:44:24.770 --> 05:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
this bill will impact New Hampshire
 
05:44:27.470 --> 05:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
residents in a negative way suppose a
 
05:44:29.208 --> 05:44:29.218 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire resident travels to the
 
05:44:31.610 --> 05:44:31.620 align:start position:0%
Carolinas Georgia Florida
 
05:44:33.288 --> 05:44:33.298 align:start position:0%
and they get into an accident and then
 
05:44:36.110 --> 05:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
they destroy their vehicle they will be
 
05:44:39.830 --> 05:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
prohibited from buying a new vehicle in
 
05:44:41.750 --> 05:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
those states to replace their destroyed
 
05:44:44.750 --> 05:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
one simply because it is brand new and
 
05:44:47.270 --> 05:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
only meets the federal emission
 
05:44:49.490 --> 05:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
standards and not California standards
 
05:44:52.850 --> 05:44:52.860 align:start position:0%
in addition they may also be denied the
 
05:44:55.850 --> 05:44:55.860 align:start position:0%
ability to inherit acquire in a divorce
 
05:45:00.170 --> 05:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
Southern lint lawsuit a gift Etc or even
 
05:45:01.970 --> 05:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
be able to buy the vehicle they find
 
05:45:03.530 --> 05:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
that they really like it and be able to
 
05:45:05.990 --> 05:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
register it in New Hampshire unless it's
 
05:45:08.390 --> 05:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
a California vehicle
 
05:45:10.610 --> 05:45:10.620 align:start position:0%
this may mean the only way to obtain an
 
05:45:12.288 --> 05:45:12.298 align:start position:0%
out-of-state vehicle they will have to
 
05:45:14.150 --> 05:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
settle for an older perhaps a more
 
05:45:16.910 --> 05:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
polluting vehicle as an alternative
 
05:45:19.490 --> 05:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
these emissions restrictions going back
 
05:45:22.030 --> 05:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
to the early 1980s a greatly
 
05:45:24.170 --> 05:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
disincentivized me from owning a new
 
05:45:26.930 --> 05:45:26.940 align:start position:0%
model vehicle the Nashua area tailpipe
 
05:45:29.448 --> 05:45:29.458 align:start position:0%
emissions law passed in 1985 was the
 
05:45:32.030 --> 05:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
deciding factor for me to keep and
 
05:45:34.610 --> 05:45:34.620 align:start position:0%
refurbish my 1972 Volkswagen Super
 
05:45:36.890 --> 05:45:36.900 align:start position:0%
Beetle a car with that predates
 
05:45:40.010 --> 05:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
catalytic converters and just made the
 
05:45:42.110 --> 05:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
age to be exempt from that upcoming law
 
05:45:45.650 --> 05:45:45.660 align:start position:0%
into which I started driving in 1980. I
 
05:45:48.048 --> 05:45:48.058 align:start position:0%
remember as if it was yesterday it was
 
05:45:51.230 --> 05:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
October of 1984. my Volkswagen was the
 
05:45:53.390 --> 05:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
need work as rust started to take hold
 
05:45:55.548 --> 05:45:55.558 align:start position:0%
of it and then I read about how the EPA
 
05:45:58.310 --> 05:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
was about to jam tailpipes emissions
 
05:46:00.350 --> 05:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
inspection testing programs down our
 
05:46:02.628 --> 05:46:02.638 align:start position:0%
throats only for those that live in the
 
05:46:05.030 --> 05:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
Nashville area with a threat by the EPA
 
05:46:07.310 --> 05:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
to withhold Federal Highway money
 
05:46:11.288 --> 05:46:11.298 align:start position:0%
all based on one day of air quality
 
05:46:13.970 --> 05:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
carbon monoxide violations at one
 
05:46:15.830 --> 05:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
intersection in downtown Nashua that
 
05:46:18.708 --> 05:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
occurred in March of 1978 which at the
 
05:46:20.750 --> 05:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
time only three model years worth of
 
05:46:22.250 --> 05:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
catalytic converter equipped Vehicles
 
05:46:24.288 --> 05:46:24.298 align:start position:0%
were in existence as they were
 
05:46:26.150 --> 05:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
introduced along with unleaded gasoline
 
05:46:28.788 --> 05:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
beginning in 1975.
 
05:46:30.650 --> 05:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
it was at that time I made the decision
 
05:46:32.150 --> 05:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
to spend a couple of grand and totally
 
05:46:34.010 --> 05:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
rebuild that Volkswagen so that I can
 
05:46:35.690 --> 05:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
keep it on the road and not have to deal
 
05:46:37.490 --> 05:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
with this then new emissions testing
 
05:46:40.430 --> 05:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
Fiasco which they started to stated was
 
05:46:43.670 --> 05:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
to begin in the fall October of 1987.
 
05:46:46.070 --> 05:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
back then they said the vehicle will
 
05:46:49.250 --> 05:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
either be 15 years old or heavier than 8
 
05:46:51.170 --> 05:46:51.180 align:start position:0%
000 pounds it would be exempt well the
 
05:46:53.868 --> 05:46:53.878 align:start position:0%
VW was to be 15 years old in 1987 and
 
05:46:55.430 --> 05:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
its registration was renewed before the
 
05:46:57.048 --> 05:46:57.058 align:start position:0%
Law's effective date
 
05:46:59.150 --> 05:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
so I started body and body and
 
05:47:00.830 --> 05:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
mechanical parts for it and I made that
 
05:47:04.548 --> 05:47:04.558 align:start position:0%
72 Volkswagen into a new car again to
 
05:47:06.350 --> 05:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
this very day I still own that vehicle
 
05:47:08.448 --> 05:47:08.458 align:start position:0%
and it is still operational
 
05:47:10.430 --> 05:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
and it is now approaching a quarter
 
05:47:12.530 --> 05:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
million miles on it as the odometer
 
05:47:14.090 --> 05:47:14.100 align:start position:0%
rolled back to zero twice in the
 
05:47:16.368 --> 05:47:16.378 align:start position:0%
following years
 
05:47:18.170 --> 05:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
that law along with the threat of
 
05:47:20.448 --> 05:47:20.458 align:start position:0%
enhancing the law in the 1990s after the
 
05:47:22.730 --> 05:47:22.740 align:start position:0%
Clean Air Act of 1990 was passed and the
 
05:47:24.530 --> 05:47:24.540 align:start position:0%
politicians were gearing up to force all
 
05:47:26.930 --> 05:47:26.940 align:start position:0%
the old cars off the road they strive to
 
05:47:28.850 --> 05:47:28.860 align:start position:0%
expand this centralized enhanced
 
05:47:31.670 --> 05:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
emissions test law to include the 1968
 
05:47:32.930 --> 05:47:32.940 align:start position:0%
model year
 
05:47:35.330 --> 05:47:35.340 align:start position:0%
which led me to focus exclusively on
 
05:47:37.128 --> 05:47:37.138 align:start position:0%
only buying and driving pre-emission
 
05:47:41.868 --> 05:47:41.878 align:start position:0%
control air vehicles meaning pre-1968 so
 
05:47:45.410 --> 05:47:45.420 align:start position:0%
I bought a 1966 Chevy 2 Nova and two
 
05:47:48.170 --> 05:47:48.180 align:start position:0%
more pre-1968 station wagons a 1963
 
05:47:50.990 --> 05:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
Chevy 2 Nova station wagon and a 1967
 
05:47:54.410 --> 05:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
Chevy 2 Nova that I got out of a uh got
 
05:47:55.788 --> 05:47:55.798 align:start position:0%
out of a junkyard down in Massachusetts
 
05:47:58.250 --> 05:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
back in 1992.
 
05:48:00.530 --> 05:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
and then I started hoarding Parts out of
 
05:48:02.390 --> 05:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
these for these vehicles out to allow
 
05:48:04.430 --> 05:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
their operation for many more decades as
 
05:48:05.930 --> 05:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
I cleaned out junkyards out of their
 
05:48:07.430 --> 05:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
Chevy two parts in New Hampshire and
 
05:48:07.440 --> 05:48:08.628 align:start position:0%
Chevy two parts in New Hampshire and
Massachusetts

05:48:08.628 --> 05:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
05:48:10.970 --> 05:48:10.980 align:start position:0%
fortunately massive public outcry and
 
05:48:12.350 --> 05:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
pressure from the
 
05:48:15.110 --> 05:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
Den pressure from then Governor Stephen
 
05:48:16.610 --> 05:48:16.620 align:start position:0%
Merrill and the outcome of the massive
 
05:48:19.190 --> 05:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
Democratic defeat in 1990 in the 1994
 
05:48:20.690 --> 05:48:20.700 align:start position:0%
midterm elections led to the New
 
05:48:22.310 --> 05:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature to abandon their
 
05:48:27.070 --> 05:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
efforts to go after the 1968 to pre-1975
 
05:48:30.410 --> 05:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
pre-catalytic era vehicle owners because
 
05:48:32.510 --> 05:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
the federal law somehow prohibited going
 
05:48:34.970 --> 05:48:34.980 align:start position:0%
after cars manufactured before 1968
 
05:48:36.948 --> 05:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
because they pre-existed clean air loss
 
05:48:39.288 --> 05:48:39.298 align:start position:0%
and a huge scale down of their owner is
 
05:48:40.788 --> 05:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
centralized emissions testing Empire
 
05:48:43.430 --> 05:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
plants which the state was to contract a
 
05:48:45.170 --> 05:48:45.180 align:start position:0%
company called Enviro test a huge
 
05:48:47.030 --> 05:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
emission testing Empire at the time to
 
05:48:50.030 --> 05:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
implement California style smog check
 
05:48:52.670 --> 05:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
in 1995.
 
05:48:54.948 --> 05:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
to this day the newest vehicle I own is
 
05:48:57.770 --> 05:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
a 1992 bottle a Chevy Silverado long bed
 
05:48:59.930 --> 05:48:59.940 align:start position:0%
that I acquired for my father with low
 
05:49:02.810 --> 05:49:02.820 align:start position:0%
miles an extremely solid Body and Frame
 
05:49:05.090 --> 05:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
I made a special level effort to heavily
 
05:49:06.770 --> 05:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
rust proof for the underside of the body
 
05:49:08.750 --> 05:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
panels with an annual application of a
 
05:49:10.910 --> 05:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
full gallon of fluid film rust proof and
 
05:49:13.128 --> 05:49:13.138 align:start position:0%
linole and oil to prolong its operating
 
05:49:13.138 --> 05:49:15.230 align:start position:0%
linole and oil to prolong its operating
life

05:49:15.230 --> 05:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
life
 
05:49:18.170 --> 05:49:18.180 align:start position:0%
to near indefinite time I have been
 
05:49:19.788 --> 05:49:19.798 align:start position:0%
spraying that truck for many many years
 
05:49:22.190 --> 05:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
now I do it in October each year because
 
05:49:24.230 --> 05:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
that vehicle is now 31 years of age it
 
05:49:26.570 --> 05:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
is absolutely solid with zero rust
 
05:49:28.910 --> 05:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
anywhere and I have absolutely no plans
 
05:49:30.350 --> 05:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
to replace that truck with anything
 
05:49:33.350 --> 05:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
newer since number one the truck is one
 
05:49:35.350 --> 05:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
of the last Model years to use the
 
05:49:37.850 --> 05:49:37.860 align:start position:0%
pre-obd2 and Ultra reliable throttle
 
05:49:40.070 --> 05:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
body fuel injection system because
 
05:49:43.970 --> 05:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
problems on the GM trucks plagued 1996
 
05:49:45.650 --> 05:49:45.660 align:start position:0%
in newer trucks with that with the
 
05:49:47.448 --> 05:49:47.458 align:start position:0%
spider injection that they were forced
 
05:49:50.930 --> 05:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
to implement can I ask you to kind of
 
05:49:54.350 --> 05:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
refocus on the California emissions
 
05:49:56.030 --> 05:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
rather than giving us a history of
 
05:50:00.650 --> 05:50:00.660 align:start position:0%
vehicle ownership sure sure sure
 
05:50:00.660 --> 05:50:01.368 align:start position:0%
vehicle ownership sure sure sure
um

05:50:01.368 --> 05:50:01.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:06.470 --> 05:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
yeah if if this state implements
 
05:50:09.890 --> 05:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
California emission requirements we are
 
05:50:11.448 --> 05:50:11.458 align:start position:0%
going to have to do everything that
 
05:50:14.208 --> 05:50:14.218 align:start position:0%
California does including implementing
 
05:50:17.510 --> 05:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
their very onerous California style smog
 
05:50:20.150 --> 05:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
check not only out in California do they
 
05:50:22.190 --> 05:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
check for OBD2
 
05:50:23.810 --> 05:50:23.820 align:start position:0%
but they also do a complete
 
05:50:26.990 --> 05:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
comprehensive thorough underhood visual
 
05:50:27.000 --> 05:50:29.150 align:start position:0%
comprehensive thorough underhood visual
inspection

05:50:29.150 --> 05:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
05:50:31.310 --> 05:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
on on these vehicles
 
05:50:34.190 --> 05:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
and they do a tailpipe test you got to
 
05:50:35.510 --> 05:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
put it they'll put the they'll strap the
 
05:50:37.310 --> 05:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
car down on a dynamometer they'll run
 
05:50:38.930 --> 05:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
the thing at highway speeds and they
 
05:50:40.970 --> 05:50:40.980 align:start position:0%
measure the amount of exhaust so
 
05:50:43.730 --> 05:50:43.740 align:start position:0%
a smog check out in California is like a
 
05:50:46.190 --> 05:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
couple of hundred dollars to do compared
 
05:50:49.128 --> 05:50:49.138 align:start position:0%
to uh just plugging in the OBD and
 
05:50:50.868 --> 05:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
that's what that's what what happened if
 
05:50:53.230 --> 05:50:53.240 align:start position:0%
we went full California
 
05:50:55.850 --> 05:50:55.860 align:start position:0%
also and this is what they did back in
 
05:50:58.670 --> 05:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
the 70s they were requiring uh Vehicles
 
05:51:02.628 --> 05:51:02.638 align:start position:0%
all going back to the 1955 model year to
 
05:51:05.628 --> 05:51:05.638 align:start position:0%
to retrofit them with these aftermarket
 
05:51:05.638 --> 05:51:06.948 align:start position:0%
to retrofit them with these aftermarket
uh

05:51:06.948 --> 05:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:51:10.190 --> 05:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh closed PCV systems and then they put
 
05:51:12.170 --> 05:51:12.180 align:start position:0%
in what was called the California car
 
05:51:15.890 --> 05:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
kit program car kit kit
 
05:51:20.690 --> 05:51:20.700 align:start position:0%
for a 1966 to 1970 1970 Vehicles which
 
05:51:23.510 --> 05:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
basically disabled the vehicle's vacuum
 
05:51:25.128 --> 05:51:25.138 align:start position:0%
advance and they required that you have
 
05:51:26.810 --> 05:51:26.820 align:start position:0%
to have the manual
 
05:51:29.868 --> 05:51:29.878 align:start position:0%
for that car kit retrofit in the glove
 
05:51:32.208 --> 05:51:32.218 align:start position:0%
box you had to have a label on the under
 
05:51:33.830 --> 05:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
hood of the car and you had to have a
 
05:51:35.510 --> 05:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
sticker on the dashboard that says do
 
05:51:37.430 --> 05:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
not drive that car greater than 60 miles
 
05:51:39.470 --> 05:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
an hour or engine damage will result
 
05:51:41.570 --> 05:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
this is what they implemented in the
 
05:51:43.970 --> 05:51:43.980 align:start position:0%
1970s they did some really crazy stuff
 
05:51:46.490 --> 05:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
for emissions and and I tell you
 
05:51:48.948 --> 05:51:48.958 align:start position:0%
California is very hostile to to older
 
05:51:51.048 --> 05:51:51.058 align:start position:0%
vehicle owners I always talk the story
 
05:51:53.030 --> 05:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
about a
 
05:51:54.708 --> 05:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
friend of mine know how to Rolls-Royce
 
05:51:57.948 --> 05:51:57.958 align:start position:0%
out there in California because of their
 
05:52:00.770 --> 05:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
uh standards they required him to
 
05:52:03.230 --> 05:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
to put these added emission stuff on it
 
05:52:05.208 --> 05:52:05.218 align:start position:0%
for that the car I don't know where it
 
05:52:06.590 --> 05:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
came from England or something like that
 
05:52:09.650 --> 05:52:09.660 align:start position:0%
the car passed emissions before all that
 
05:52:11.390 --> 05:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
stuff was put on it
 
05:52:13.368 --> 05:52:13.378 align:start position:0%
when they forced him to spend a thousand
 
05:52:15.770 --> 05:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
dollars to retrofit the car they they
 
05:52:18.170 --> 05:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
had him they had them put a vacuum line
 
05:52:20.208 --> 05:52:20.218 align:start position:0%
from the fuel tank into the carburetor
 
05:52:23.628 --> 05:52:23.638 align:start position:0%
and the car would just run horrible and
 
05:52:26.510 --> 05:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
then it the emissions was even worse and
 
05:52:28.190 --> 05:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
I and I hear that story over and over
 
05:52:30.830 --> 05:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
and over again from this uh friend of
 
05:52:33.230 --> 05:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
mine that uh that knows this guy the
 
05:52:36.110 --> 05:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
guy's passed away right today but uh
 
05:52:38.150 --> 05:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
this is a bad Bill and uh
 
05:52:41.390 --> 05:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
I urge in expedient to legislate on this
 
05:52:43.730 --> 05:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
legislation well thank you for your
 
05:52:45.590 --> 05:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
testimony do you have any idea what
 
05:52:47.208 --> 05:52:47.218 align:start position:0%
California does
 
05:52:50.090 --> 05:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
for all those old cars that you see in
 
05:52:52.128 --> 05:52:52.138 align:start position:0%
Hollywood movies uh how do they keep
 
05:52:54.890 --> 05:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
those on the road well they they further
 
05:52:56.810 --> 05:52:56.820 align:start position:0%
amended the law that now they go and
 
05:53:00.230 --> 05:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
smog check model year 1976 and newer
 
05:53:03.048 --> 05:53:03.058 align:start position:0%
cars they they ultimate they used to
 
05:53:05.750 --> 05:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
just keep it fixed at model year 1966
 
05:53:08.030 --> 05:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
and then they had their own special uh
 
05:53:10.670 --> 05:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
emission control devices 66 and 67 model
 
05:53:12.708 --> 05:53:12.718 align:start position:0%
cars had smog pumps on it where the 49
 
05:53:15.048 --> 05:53:15.058 align:start position:0%
states cars didn't have
 
05:53:15.058 --> 05:53:15.708 align:start position:0%
states cars didn't have
um

05:53:15.708 --> 05:53:15.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:17.810 --> 05:53:17.820 align:start position:0%
some of these cars are really tough to
 
05:53:19.548 --> 05:53:19.558 align:start position:0%
to get past emissions I remember the
 
05:53:21.770 --> 05:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
Volkswagen peoples they they used to the
 
05:53:23.390 --> 05:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
Volkswagen Club there used to keep it
 
05:53:25.788 --> 05:53:25.798 align:start position:0%
guys would have an engine and they would
 
05:53:27.530 --> 05:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
share it with the club members here put
 
05:53:29.030 --> 05:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
this in your Volkswagen because they
 
05:53:31.010 --> 05:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
were so easy to Interchange out on those
 
05:53:33.770 --> 05:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
to get your to get your car smogged
 
05:53:35.810 --> 05:53:35.820 align:start position:0%
and then go back to putting the uh
 
05:53:38.570 --> 05:53:38.580 align:start position:0%
Factory uh or your other engine into it
 
05:53:40.070 --> 05:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
because they're cooled engines they used
 
05:53:41.810 --> 05:53:41.820 align:start position:0%
to be a real problem to try to get
 
05:53:44.150 --> 05:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
through smog check representative Doug
 
05:53:46.670 --> 05:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question sure thank you Mr
 
05:53:49.368 --> 05:53:49.378 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
05:53:53.330 --> 05:53:53.340 align:start position:0%
um do you feel that if we adopt the
 
05:53:57.048 --> 05:53:57.058 align:start position:0%
California standards that it would
 
05:54:00.890 --> 05:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
severely limit your choice of
 
05:54:04.810 --> 05:54:04.820 align:start position:0%
what vehicle to purchase and or modify
 
05:54:07.910 --> 05:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
to meet your needs as a as a consumer
 
05:54:11.090 --> 05:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
yes it would because California plans to
 
05:54:13.610 --> 05:54:13.620 align:start position:0%
out ban outright
 
05:54:15.730 --> 05:54:15.740 align:start position:0%
internal combustion engines by the year
 
05:54:18.530 --> 05:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
2035 and so I would have no choice but
 
05:54:20.448 --> 05:54:20.458 align:start position:0%
to keep older internal combustion engine
 
05:54:22.548 --> 05:54:22.558 align:start position:0%
vehicles running because I like to be
 
05:54:24.530 --> 05:54:24.540 align:start position:0%
able to have a vehicle if I want to
 
05:54:25.910 --> 05:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
drive to Florida
 
05:54:27.410 --> 05:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
I want to be able to get down there in
 
05:54:28.788 --> 05:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
two days I don't have to take a weekend
 
05:54:31.490 --> 05:54:31.500 align:start position:0%
have to stop and charge 100 every 150
 
05:54:34.910 --> 05:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
200 miles and spend you know how many
 
05:54:37.670 --> 05:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
hours it takes to charge a vehicle so
 
05:54:40.070 --> 05:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
we'll follow up thank you with follow-up
 
05:54:44.090 --> 05:54:44.100 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so furthermore do you feel that
 
05:54:47.030 --> 05:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
if this is adopted then it would affect
 
05:54:51.708 --> 05:54:51.718 align:start position:0%
your lifestyle uh as a consumer uh in
 
05:54:54.650 --> 05:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
terms of how you want to live your life
 
05:54:56.390 --> 05:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of your choices and so forth
 
05:54:58.010 --> 05:54:58.020 align:start position:0%
well I would simply just keep my
 
05:54:59.868 --> 05:54:59.878 align:start position:0%
existing older vehicles running it'll be
 
05:55:01.730 --> 05:55:01.740 align:start position:0%
like you know I think that a lot and a
 
05:55:04.070 --> 05:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
lot of other folks you know I always
 
05:55:05.990 --> 05:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
talk about the cube in effect how where
 
05:55:08.690 --> 05:55:08.700 align:start position:0%
Cuban restricted uh Cuba restricted uh
 
05:55:10.670 --> 05:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
newer vehicles and they just kept their
 
05:55:12.230 --> 05:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
older ones running and running and
 
05:55:13.610 --> 05:55:13.620 align:start position:0%
running and I'm afraid that if they're
 
05:55:15.230 --> 05:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
going to make it so costly and so
 
05:55:17.030 --> 05:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
inconvenient with these newer vehicles
 
05:55:19.190 --> 05:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
with these restrictions that people are
 
05:55:20.448 --> 05:55:20.458 align:start position:0%
just going to keep all the cars running
 
05:55:22.730 --> 05:55:22.740 align:start position:0%
into perpetuity
 
05:55:24.770 --> 05:55:24.780 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki has a question
 
05:55:26.750 --> 05:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:55:29.390 --> 05:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
you you woke us up and that's what I'm
 
05:55:31.548 --> 05:55:31.558 align:start position:0%
trying to do get you guys going uh the
 
05:55:32.868 --> 05:55:32.878 align:start position:0%
question it may not be something that's
 
05:55:36.230 --> 05:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
within your knowledge base but does it
 
05:55:38.510 --> 05:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh I'm going to put it two questions
 
05:55:41.448 --> 05:55:41.458 align:start position:0%
does this legislature have the ability
 
05:55:44.090 --> 05:55:44.100 align:start position:0%
to bind a future legislature if we were
 
05:55:46.310 --> 05:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
for instance to pass this law if two
 
05:55:47.930 --> 05:55:47.940 align:start position:0%
years from now another legislature
 
05:55:51.350 --> 05:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
repealed it uh could we possibly do that
 
05:55:53.930 --> 05:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
and how can we possibly be bound by a
 
05:55:56.750 --> 05:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
California legislature
 
05:55:56.760 --> 05:55:57.530 align:start position:0%
California legislature
um

05:55:57.530 --> 05:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:59.330 --> 05:55:59.340 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether or not once you
 
05:56:01.010 --> 05:56:01.020 align:start position:0%
pass it you know how when you pass a law
 
05:56:02.930 --> 05:56:02.940 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to repeal it because
 
05:56:06.288 --> 05:56:06.298 align:start position:0%
it gets entrenched into it but uh I'm
 
05:56:08.150 --> 05:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
afraid that once you once you pass this
 
05:56:10.490 --> 05:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
law you're you're you're obligated to uh
 
05:56:13.070 --> 05:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
follow California law from here on out
 
05:56:16.730 --> 05:56:16.740 align:start position:0%
and uh whatever they pass has automatic
 
05:56:20.270 --> 05:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
effect here I mean that's
 
05:56:23.448 --> 05:56:23.458 align:start position:0%
like like on buying a vehicle from
 
05:56:25.490 --> 05:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
what I what I would say I used to always
 
05:56:27.708 --> 05:56:27.718 align:start position:0%
say when you're exporting a car from the
 
05:56:29.690 --> 05:56:29.700 align:start position:0%
United States of America and importing
 
05:56:32.208 --> 05:56:32.218 align:start position:0%
it into California they used to they
 
05:56:34.548 --> 05:56:34.558 align:start position:0%
back in those days they used to penalize
 
05:56:36.948 --> 05:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
these people by charging a 300 smog
 
05:56:40.190 --> 05:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
impact fee to and and the car had to
 
05:56:43.128 --> 05:56:43.138 align:start position:0%
have more than 7 500 miles on it or be
 
05:56:45.948 --> 05:56:45.958 align:start position:0%
more than two years old and it was a
 
05:56:48.590 --> 05:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
real nightmare to try to get a 49 state
 
05:56:52.448 --> 05:56:52.458 align:start position:0%
car registered in California and uh
 
05:56:55.128 --> 05:56:55.138 align:start position:0%
representative uh Nutter also has a
 
05:56:55.138 --> 05:56:56.330 align:start position:0%
representative uh Nutter also has a
question

05:56:56.330 --> 05:56:56.340 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:56:58.910 --> 05:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank you since you pre-answered my
 
05:57:00.410 --> 05:57:00.420 align:start position:0%
question on Rust
 
05:57:02.868 --> 05:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
on the old cars my first question for
 
05:57:05.390 --> 05:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
you is what do you call it when a
 
05:57:07.010 --> 05:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
government the government steps in and
 
05:57:08.750 --> 05:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
takes over a business and tells them how
 
05:57:10.910 --> 05:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
to run it and what they can sell like
 
05:57:12.530 --> 05:57:12.540 align:start position:0%
Cuba I don't know I think that's called
 
05:57:12.540 --> 05:57:14.510 align:start position:0%
Cuba I don't know I think that's called
communism

05:57:14.510 --> 05:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
communism
 
05:57:19.430 --> 05:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:21.470 --> 05:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
and my second question hang on before
 
05:57:22.970 --> 05:57:22.980 align:start position:0%
you ask your second question what is
 
05:57:28.070 --> 05:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:30.230 --> 05:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to be discussing the bill
 
05:57:32.690 --> 05:57:32.700 align:start position:0%
good point you have a question about the
 
05:57:35.570 --> 05:57:35.580 align:start position:0%
bill representative in related to the
 
05:57:35.580 --> 05:57:36.410 align:start position:0%
bill representative in related to the
bill

05:57:36.410 --> 05:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:57:38.150 --> 05:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
um I wanted do you know anything about
 
05:57:40.970 --> 05:57:40.980 align:start position:0%
the 17 States suing the EPA for letting
 
05:57:44.270 --> 05:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
California set vehicle standards
 
05:57:46.310 --> 05:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
um I vaguely know something about I
 
05:57:48.770 --> 05:57:48.780 align:start position:0%
haven't read deeply into it but I'm sure
 
05:57:50.150 --> 05:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
05:57:52.368 --> 05:57:52.378 align:start position:0%
states that are uh they're you know
 
05:57:54.110 --> 05:57:54.120 align:start position:0%
having clean air lawsuits and stuff like
 
05:57:58.430 --> 05:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
that I know when a few years ago
 
05:58:01.788 --> 05:58:01.798 align:start position:0%
when Trump was in office they um he
 
05:58:04.310 --> 05:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
tried to get the relaxed the auto
 
05:58:06.470 --> 05:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
emission standards relaxed and I think
 
05:58:10.548 --> 05:58:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:12.288 --> 05:58:12.298 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
05:58:14.330 --> 05:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:58:16.548 --> 05:58:16.558 align:start position:0%
taking my question you gave an example
 
05:58:19.610 --> 05:58:19.620 align:start position:0%
earlier about uh someone's driving down
 
05:58:21.708 --> 05:58:21.718 align:start position:0%
south and they have to replace their
 
05:58:23.930 --> 05:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
vehicle in North Carolina
 
05:58:27.048 --> 05:58:27.058 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering how would a New
 
05:58:32.110 --> 05:58:32.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law that limits the number of
 
05:58:36.110 --> 05:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
non-uh Zev LED vehicles
 
05:58:38.390 --> 05:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
affect what one would buy in North
 
05:58:41.150 --> 05:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
Carolina okay this is what happens in
 
05:58:43.850 --> 05:58:43.860 align:start position:0%
California you're not allowed to buy a
 
05:58:46.070 --> 05:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
federal a new a California resident is
 
05:58:48.170 --> 05:58:48.180 align:start position:0%
prohibited from buying a
 
05:58:51.770 --> 05:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
brand new federal vehicle
 
05:58:54.770 --> 05:58:54.780 align:start position:0%
it has to unless that vehicle has more
 
05:58:58.010 --> 05:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
than 7 500 miles on the odometer or is
 
05:59:00.948 --> 05:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
more than two years old so if a New
 
05:59:02.330 --> 05:59:02.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident
 
05:59:04.730 --> 05:59:04.740 align:start position:0%
has gone on a trip wrecks their vehicle
 
05:59:06.590 --> 05:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
and wants to buy a replacement
 
05:59:08.628 --> 05:59:08.638 align:start position:0%
that person because if it's a federal
 
05:59:10.430 --> 05:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
vehicle they'll they will be prohibited
 
05:59:11.868 --> 05:59:11.878 align:start position:0%
from registering it in New Hampshire
 
05:59:14.948 --> 05:59:14.958 align:start position:0%
because that's what the California
 
05:59:18.708 --> 05:59:18.718 align:start position:0%
law mandates and that was that's the
 
05:59:21.110 --> 05:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
same uh deal with Massachusetts here
 
05:59:25.368 --> 05:59:25.378 align:start position:0%
back I remember back um
 
05:59:29.208 --> 05:59:29.218 align:start position:0%
this is a going back 10 15 years now uh
 
05:59:31.250 --> 05:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
Guy where I work down in Massachusetts
 
05:59:34.250 --> 05:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
he wanted to buy a turbo diesel uh
 
05:59:37.070 --> 05:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
Jetta a brand new one but they passed
 
05:59:38.690 --> 05:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
the California standards and they were
 
05:59:41.570 --> 05:59:41.580 align:start position:0%
not legal to sell in Massachusetts and
 
05:59:43.010 --> 05:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
he couldn't buy one in New Hampshire
 
05:59:46.070 --> 05:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
unless it had more than 7 500 miles on
 
05:59:46.080 --> 05:59:46.850 align:start position:0%
unless it had more than 7 500 miles on
it

05:59:46.850 --> 05:59:46.860 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:59:48.590 --> 05:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
to register it for the first time in
 
05:59:51.048 --> 05:59:51.058 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so well without instead of
 
05:59:52.610 --> 05:59:52.620 align:start position:0%
going through all that red tape he ended
 
05:59:56.270 --> 05:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
up buying a 1988 Jetta and said the hell
 
05:59:58.190 --> 05:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
with it
 
06:00:00.230 --> 06:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a question
 
06:00:03.288 --> 06:00:03.298 align:start position:0%
that's taken my question Mr chair
 
06:00:05.030 --> 06:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
um I just want to say as a former owner
 
06:00:07.788 --> 06:00:07.798 align:start position:0%
of a bug owner I commend you for your
 
06:00:09.230 --> 06:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
for your uh
 
06:00:11.510 --> 06:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
Devotion to those older cars because I I
 
06:00:13.368 --> 06:00:13.378 align:start position:0%
also agree that it was fun to work on
 
06:00:15.230 --> 06:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
those cars you know and uh it's getting
 
06:00:16.850 --> 06:00:16.860 align:start position:0%
harder and harder to work on cars as
 
06:00:19.128 --> 06:00:19.138 align:start position:0%
things get more computerized more and
 
06:00:21.890 --> 06:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
more regulations but um as a as an older
 
06:00:23.990 --> 06:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
car owner you must work hard to get
 
06:00:26.448 --> 06:00:26.458 align:start position:0%
those cars past their their uh their
 
06:00:28.670 --> 06:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
inspections every year uh so my question
 
06:00:30.288 --> 06:00:30.298 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that would you be in
 
06:00:32.410 --> 06:00:32.420 align:start position:0%
favor of going back to those you know
 
06:00:34.970 --> 06:00:34.980 align:start position:0%
pre-smog regulation days when it was a
 
06:00:37.250 --> 06:00:37.260 align:start position:0%
lot easier to keep cars on the road or
 
06:00:38.690 --> 06:00:38.700 align:start position:0%
have you gotten used to those new
 
06:00:40.850 --> 06:00:40.860 align:start position:0%
standards and I would suggest maybe you
 
06:00:43.128 --> 06:00:43.138 align:start position:0%
could just do the same with the with the
 
06:00:45.110 --> 06:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
stricter air emission standards in the
 
06:00:46.910 --> 06:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
future or do you you know or do you
 
06:00:48.890 --> 06:00:48.900 align:start position:0%
favor going back to no standards
 
06:00:48.900 --> 06:00:49.850 align:start position:0%
favor going back to no standards
whatsoever

06:00:49.850 --> 06:00:49.860 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
06:00:52.250 --> 06:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
I'd say we go back to and make it a
 
06:00:55.788 --> 06:00:55.798 align:start position:0%
simple cheap affordable car like
 
06:00:58.610 --> 06:00:58.620 align:start position:0%
Volkswagen originally had but no the
 
06:01:01.250 --> 06:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
federal government has mandated OBD2 and
 
06:01:03.590 --> 06:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
all these complex things that they they
 
06:01:06.048 --> 06:01:06.058 align:start position:0%
basically legislated a simple car out of
 
06:01:07.548 --> 06:01:07.558 align:start position:0%
existence you can't you can't you can't
 
06:01:08.990 --> 06:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
get an affordable car anymore if you
 
06:01:11.390 --> 06:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
look at the price of cars as a result
 
06:01:13.010 --> 06:01:13.020 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:01:14.930 --> 06:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
it's becoming more and more Out Of Reach
 
06:01:17.510 --> 06:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
for the average person the cost for them
 
06:01:20.390 --> 06:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
and uh you know that's that that's a
 
06:01:22.490 --> 06:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
reason why the vehicle
 
06:01:25.730 --> 06:01:25.740 align:start position:0%
age the average age of cars are just
 
06:01:27.530 --> 06:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
increasing over time I mean what is it
 
06:01:30.048 --> 06:01:30.058 align:start position:0%
11 12 years now it used to be
 
06:01:32.810 --> 06:01:32.820 align:start position:0%
you know five six years old
 
06:01:35.150 --> 06:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
so you know and then and I see in the
 
06:01:37.190 --> 06:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
future as cars get more expensive
 
06:01:39.830 --> 06:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
that age Gap it's just you know the mean
 
06:01:41.990 --> 06:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
age of cars are just going to get older
 
06:01:43.190 --> 06:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
and older
 
06:01:47.628 --> 06:01:47.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:49.190 --> 06:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
okay saying no more questions we
 
06:01:51.230 --> 06:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony okay thank you
 
06:01:54.288 --> 06:01:54.298 align:start position:0%
you did uh stir us up we appreciate that
 
06:01:56.030 --> 06:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
hey you know I gotta wake you up you
 
06:01:58.910 --> 06:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
know okay next I'm at a call on Mr
 
06:02:01.250 --> 06:02:01.260 align:start position:0%
William Hall from Durham
 
06:02:04.070 --> 06:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
who is representing himself and who
 
06:02:08.150 --> 06:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:10.250 --> 06:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Voss
 
06:02:10.260 --> 06:02:11.510 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Voss
uh

06:02:11.510 --> 06:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:02:13.310 --> 06:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
I started to read this
 
06:02:16.730 --> 06:02:16.740 align:start position:0%
the other day and I came to uh how it
 
06:02:19.010 --> 06:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
was going to kill people and make people
 
06:02:19.020 --> 06:02:20.030 align:start position:0%
was going to kill people and make people
sick

06:02:20.030 --> 06:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
sick
 
06:02:23.090 --> 06:02:23.100 align:start position:0%
uh back before the emissions business
 
06:02:27.170 --> 06:02:27.180 align:start position:0%
started uh Pasadena it looked like the
 
06:02:28.970 --> 06:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
smog looked like fog coming through in
 
06:02:32.628 --> 06:02:32.638 align:start position:0%
the noon by noon time New Jersey was
 
06:02:33.650 --> 06:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
pretty bad
 
06:02:36.770 --> 06:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
the intersection of Mass Avenue and the
 
06:02:39.350 --> 06:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
Mass Pike in Boston
 
06:02:41.030 --> 06:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
didn't look bad
 
06:02:44.868 --> 06:02:44.878 align:start position:0%
but technically by the standards it was
 
06:02:48.288 --> 06:02:48.298 align:start position:0%
we've corrected all that with catalytic
 
06:02:52.430 --> 06:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
converters and other uh efforts to to
 
06:02:54.530 --> 06:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
make uh the to clean up the emissions
 
06:02:57.048 --> 06:02:57.058 align:start position:0%
since a country is going to be rapidly
 
06:02:59.868 --> 06:02:59.878 align:start position:0%
changing over to electric cars according
 
06:03:02.330 --> 06:03:02.340 align:start position:0%
to the electric car people uh this
 
06:03:04.970 --> 06:03:04.980 align:start position:0%
problem is going to go away you look you
 
06:03:06.830 --> 06:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
fly over to Hampshire it's carpeted in
 
06:03:06.840 --> 06:03:07.850 align:start position:0%
fly over to Hampshire it's carpeted in
green

06:03:07.850 --> 06:03:07.860 align:start position:0%
green
 
06:03:12.830 --> 06:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
you fly down south of one of 495 128 and
 
06:03:16.670 --> 06:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
it's carpeted with roads and cars and
 
06:03:19.368 --> 06:03:19.378 align:start position:0%
you can see the traffic lights as far as
 
06:03:21.708 --> 06:03:21.718 align:start position:0%
you can see that's not the case in New
 
06:03:23.570 --> 06:03:23.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at all
 
06:03:23.580 --> 06:03:24.708 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at all
um

06:03:24.708 --> 06:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:27.650 --> 06:03:27.660 align:start position:0%
the next thing I saw here was what it's
 
06:03:30.770 --> 06:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
going to do to the roads and bridges the
 
06:03:36.708 --> 06:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
um uh greenhouse gases no what bothers
 
06:03:40.190 --> 06:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
the roads and bridges is road salt and
 
06:03:43.430 --> 06:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand pound uh trucks that
 
06:03:45.708 --> 06:03:45.718 align:start position:0%
would be carrying uh eleven to thirteen
 
06:03:47.990 --> 06:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
thousand pound uh gallons of gasoline or
 
06:03:51.708 --> 06:03:51.718 align:start position:0%
heating oil uh that's what destroys uh
 
06:03:55.788 --> 06:03:55.798 align:start position:0%
roads and bridges uh I don't believe the
 
06:03:59.570 --> 06:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
uh emissions would have any effect on
 
06:04:01.910 --> 06:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
them whatsoever uh in the period of time
 
06:04:04.850 --> 06:04:04.860 align:start position:0%
between it wouldn't extend uh shorten
 
06:04:08.990 --> 06:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
the life between uh repaving one bit
 
06:04:09.000 --> 06:04:11.690 align:start position:0%
the life between uh repaving one bit
um

06:04:11.690 --> 06:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:16.430 --> 06:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
as far as electric cars go uh we better
 
06:04:19.430 --> 06:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
have a new attitude towards generation
 
06:04:21.650 --> 06:04:21.660 align:start position:0%
because this fall
 
06:04:25.070 --> 06:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
uh California was telling people not to
 
06:04:29.570 --> 06:04:29.580 align:start position:0%
not to charge their cars as you know
 
06:04:31.850 --> 06:04:31.860 align:start position:0%
Germany tried to go for renewable energy
 
06:04:35.030 --> 06:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
and it's now changed back to Coal until
 
06:04:37.190 --> 06:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
they can get that under control I don't
 
06:04:40.430 --> 06:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
want to see us making those mistakes and
 
06:04:44.628 --> 06:04:44.638 align:start position:0%
I don't want to see us subjected to the
 
06:04:47.090 --> 06:04:47.100 align:start position:0%
measures of California I don't think
 
06:04:47.100 --> 06:04:48.250 align:start position:0%
measures of California I don't think
it's

06:04:48.250 --> 06:04:48.260 align:start position:0%
it's
 
06:04:51.410 --> 06:04:51.420 align:start position:0%
worth the effort I think it's going to
 
06:04:54.170 --> 06:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
just be a mess for people this is a
 
06:04:57.048 --> 06:04:57.058 align:start position:0%
small state we don't compared to the
 
06:04:59.868 --> 06:04:59.878 align:start position:0%
amount of space we have we don't have a
 
06:05:01.250 --> 06:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
lot of cars you only got a little over a
 
06:05:03.530 --> 06:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
million cars
 
06:05:04.850 --> 06:05:04.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:05:06.890 --> 06:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony questions
 
06:05:11.750 --> 06:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:13.490 --> 06:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
seeing none I thank you for your
 
06:05:16.430 --> 06:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
testimony and next I call on Dan Bennett
 
06:05:18.650 --> 06:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire Auto
 
06:05:27.048 --> 06:05:27.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:29.868 --> 06:05:29.878 align:start position:0%
welcome Mr Bennett good afternoon Mr
 
06:05:31.610 --> 06:05:31.620 align:start position:0%
chairman members of committee Dan
 
06:05:32.690 --> 06:05:32.700 align:start position:0%
Bennett New Hampshire Auto Dealers
 
06:05:35.150 --> 06:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
Association my testimony will be
 
06:05:36.650 --> 06:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
relatively unchanged from some of the
 
06:05:37.910 --> 06:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
things you've heard from us on this
 
06:05:39.970 --> 06:05:39.980 align:start position:0%
particular issue in the past few years
 
06:05:41.930 --> 06:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
I will bounce around a little bit
 
06:05:44.090 --> 06:05:44.100 align:start position:0%
between testimony but also address some
 
06:05:45.410 --> 06:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
of the questions that I've heard from
 
06:05:48.110 --> 06:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
the committee as well so as we have in
 
06:05:51.650 --> 06:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
the past it's our opinion that that this
 
06:05:54.948 --> 06:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
bill is a topic worth study and we
 
06:05:56.208 --> 06:05:56.218 align:start position:0%
believe a study commission should be
 
06:05:58.788 --> 06:05:58.798 align:start position:0%
created to explore it may include
 
06:05:59.830 --> 06:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
06:06:02.628 --> 06:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
nescom the office of energy the auto
 
06:06:04.850 --> 06:06:04.860 align:start position:0%
dealers the manufacturers to all look at
 
06:06:07.310 --> 06:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
it I appreciate and I heard the sponsor
 
06:06:09.350 --> 06:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
mention a plan but this isn't a New
 
06:06:10.910 --> 06:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire plan this is a California plan
 
06:06:12.890 --> 06:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
so let's get together and create a New
 
06:06:16.010 --> 06:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire plan and and see what works so
 
06:06:18.048 --> 06:06:18.058 align:start position:0%
that's our opinion we hope as we have
 
06:06:19.850 --> 06:06:19.860 align:start position:0%
stated multiple times over the past few
 
06:06:19.860 --> 06:06:20.930 align:start position:0%
stated multiple times over the past few
years

06:06:20.930 --> 06:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
years
 
06:06:23.690 --> 06:06:23.700 align:start position:0%
um a bill last one a bill last session
 
06:06:26.868 --> 06:06:26.878 align:start position:0%
and two prior uh to study it
 
06:06:30.170 --> 06:06:30.180 align:start position:0%
um so to address some of the points New
 
06:06:32.030 --> 06:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dealers are all in on electric
 
06:06:34.070 --> 06:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
vehicles they're building out their
 
06:06:36.230 --> 06:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
facilities they're gearing up for it we
 
06:06:38.570 --> 06:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
have four dealers rural Ford dealers in
 
06:06:41.208 --> 06:06:41.218 align:start position:0%
the North Country spending 1.2 million
 
06:06:43.850 --> 06:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
dollars of their own money to build out
 
06:06:45.770 --> 06:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
a charging infrastructure
 
06:06:48.170 --> 06:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
okay other manufacturers are encouraging
 
06:06:51.230 --> 06:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
as well stellantis General Motors
 
06:06:51.240 --> 06:06:52.548 align:start position:0%
as well stellantis General Motors
so

06:06:52.548 --> 06:06:52.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:06:54.530 --> 06:06:54.540 align:start position:0%
um the the dealers are all all in on it
 
06:06:57.470 --> 06:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
but it's based on consumer demand
 
06:06:59.990 --> 06:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
and and they will sell it to people that
 
06:07:03.048 --> 06:07:03.058 align:start position:0%
want it uh it's not a state law or a
 
06:07:04.788 --> 06:07:04.798 align:start position:0%
mandate that that's going to drive that
 
06:07:07.788 --> 06:07:07.798 align:start position:0%
consumer demand it's it's the consumer
 
06:07:11.090 --> 06:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
demand and and our neighbors all do have
 
06:07:13.730 --> 06:07:13.740 align:start position:0%
um you know higher EV rates than us and
 
06:07:15.770 --> 06:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
they do have that particular mandate but
 
06:07:17.030 --> 06:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
I don't believe it's the Mandate that
 
06:07:18.770 --> 06:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
sells cars it's the other things they
 
06:07:21.530 --> 06:07:21.540 align:start position:0%
put in place every single state has a
 
06:07:23.390 --> 06:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
cash incentive on the hood of the
 
06:07:26.390 --> 06:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle to move it they have charging
 
06:07:28.548 --> 06:07:28.558 align:start position:0%
infrastructure built out a great much
 
06:07:29.868 --> 06:07:29.878 align:start position:0%
greater rate than New Hampshire does
 
06:07:32.150 --> 06:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
they have time of rate charging to
 
06:07:33.830 --> 06:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
encourage you to charge your vehicle
 
06:07:35.810 --> 06:07:35.820 align:start position:0%
overnight so you're not pulling from the
 
06:07:37.490 --> 06:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
grid when it's at high demand and high
 
06:07:39.470 --> 06:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
cost those are some of the things we
 
06:07:41.750 --> 06:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
suggest that the commission look at
 
06:07:43.930 --> 06:07:43.940 align:start position:0%
um incentives
 
06:07:46.670 --> 06:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
that's what moves the market a carrot
 
06:07:48.890 --> 06:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
not a stick we've seen it in the past
 
06:07:51.110 --> 06:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
everybody remember Cash for Clunkers
 
06:07:53.628 --> 06:07:53.638 align:start position:0%
no during the Obama Administration New
 
06:07:55.610 --> 06:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire had the highest take rate per
 
06:07:57.830 --> 06:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
capita in the nation in Cash for
 
06:07:59.990 --> 06:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
Clunkers and there was one hood on the
 
06:08:01.970 --> 06:08:01.980 align:start position:0%
people the hood of the car people raced
 
06:08:03.770 --> 06:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
for it and they traded over those
 
06:08:05.510 --> 06:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
Vehicles so that's really something to
 
06:08:07.970 --> 06:08:07.980 align:start position:0%
explore another issue that I'll mention
 
06:08:11.030 --> 06:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
about the the the Lev standard or the
 
06:08:12.230 --> 06:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
Zev standard
 
06:08:14.150 --> 06:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
um you know it's our opinion that the
 
06:08:15.890 --> 06:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
calculation's all wrong
 
06:08:18.708 --> 06:08:18.718 align:start position:0%
because the calculation is not done at
 
06:08:20.690 --> 06:08:20.700 align:start position:0%
the at the sale or when the vehicle is
 
06:08:22.490 --> 06:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
put in service the goal is emission
 
06:08:24.590 --> 06:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
reduction correct so that calculation
 
06:08:27.110 --> 06:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
should be done when it's on the road the
 
06:08:28.548 --> 06:08:28.558 align:start position:0%
calculation is done when it's delivered
 
06:08:30.110 --> 06:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
to the Dealer's lot
 
06:08:31.910 --> 06:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
so when the car comes in and it just
 
06:08:34.070 --> 06:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
sits there
 
06:08:36.350 --> 06:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't sell there's no emission
 
06:08:38.868 --> 06:08:38.878 align:start position:0%
reductions really being done right so
 
06:08:41.570 --> 06:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
the calculation it's in our opinion is a
 
06:08:44.510 --> 06:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
little skewed if the penalties do in
 
06:08:46.128 --> 06:08:46.138 align:start position:0%
fact come into place that then raises
 
06:08:48.288 --> 06:08:48.298 align:start position:0%
the cost of the vehicle which further
 
06:08:49.788 --> 06:08:49.798 align:start position:0%
makes it less likely to get put into
 
06:08:53.208 --> 06:08:53.218 align:start position:0%
place so let's look at ways to get the
 
06:08:55.070 --> 06:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
cars on the road
 
06:08:57.110 --> 06:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
so that's some of the things that we
 
06:08:58.128 --> 06:08:58.138 align:start position:0%
should look at
 
06:08:58.138 --> 06:08:59.868 align:start position:0%
should look at
um

06:08:59.868 --> 06:08:59.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:01.850 --> 06:09:01.860 align:start position:0%
that's when the true emission reductions
 
06:09:03.288 --> 06:09:03.298 align:start position:0%
would come into place
 
06:09:06.110 --> 06:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
um you know New Hampshire dealers will
 
06:09:08.810 --> 06:09:08.820 align:start position:0%
sell EVS to anyone that that wants them
 
06:09:10.730 --> 06:09:10.740 align:start position:0%
they'll meet that consumer demand I've
 
06:09:13.730 --> 06:09:13.740 align:start position:0%
spoken to BMW I've spoken to Ford the
 
06:09:15.708 --> 06:09:15.718 align:start position:0%
individual in charge of the the mock e
 
06:09:17.868 --> 06:09:17.878 align:start position:0%
the E program for Ford the state law
 
06:09:19.368 --> 06:09:19.378 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter to them they'll sell the
 
06:09:21.708 --> 06:09:21.718 align:start position:0%
cars where the consumer demand is
 
06:09:23.690 --> 06:09:23.700 align:start position:0%
the inventory shortage or those
 
06:09:26.750 --> 06:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
anecdotes that I've heard is is not
 
06:09:28.970 --> 06:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
about choosing a cal live State over
 
06:09:30.708 --> 06:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
another state it's that the
 
06:09:33.948 --> 06:09:33.958 align:start position:0%
manufacturers are not making enough cars
 
06:09:37.190 --> 06:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
there are no islands of mock e Mustangs
 
06:09:39.770 --> 06:09:39.780 align:start position:0%
in in Norwood Massachusetts
 
06:09:42.350 --> 06:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
the cars are built and made to order you
 
06:09:44.150 --> 06:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
go to the dealership site unseen and
 
06:09:45.590 --> 06:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
order that vehicle because the
 
06:09:48.170 --> 06:09:48.180 align:start position:0%
manufacturers are making so few
 
06:09:50.330 --> 06:09:50.340 align:start position:0%
you know Cadillac made 25 000 lyrics
 
06:09:52.548 --> 06:09:52.558 align:start position:0%
last year they sold out in somewhere
 
06:09:54.350 --> 06:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
between four and six hours
 
06:09:56.990 --> 06:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
because of they're making so few of them
 
06:09:59.510 --> 06:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
um you know Ford I give a lot of credit
 
06:10:01.310 --> 06:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
to Ford you know you can go to any Ford
 
06:10:03.048 --> 06:10:03.058 align:start position:0%
dealer right now and you can get in an
 
06:10:05.570 --> 06:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
electric lightning F-150 pickup truck
 
06:10:07.788 --> 06:10:07.798 align:start position:0%
because they require you to keep one in
 
06:10:10.070 --> 06:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
stock and it's called a mannequin model
 
06:10:13.070 --> 06:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
so you can put your you can sit in that
 
06:10:16.250 --> 06:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
seat and you can demo the vehicle and
 
06:10:17.930 --> 06:10:17.940 align:start position:0%
then you place an order and wait for it
 
06:10:18.830 --> 06:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
to come
 
06:10:20.510 --> 06:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
but it's the reason they've adjusted
 
06:10:22.010 --> 06:10:22.020 align:start position:0%
their production models four times
 
06:10:23.628 --> 06:10:23.638 align:start position:0%
already to increase those numbers
 
06:10:25.610 --> 06:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
because they've seen the demand so it's
 
06:10:28.070 --> 06:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
a manufacturing issue it's not a state
 
06:10:30.590 --> 06:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
law issue in our opinion and we've
 
06:10:32.990 --> 06:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
spoken to folks about it
 
06:10:33.000 --> 06:10:33.948 align:start position:0%
spoken to folks about it
um

06:10:33.948 --> 06:10:33.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:33.958 --> 06:10:35.448 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:10:35.448 --> 06:10:35.458 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:10:35.458 --> 06:10:36.110 align:start position:0%
so
um

06:10:36.110 --> 06:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:37.970 --> 06:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
you know and then just the other thing
 
06:10:40.010 --> 06:10:40.020 align:start position:0%
miss Mr Fitzgerald mentioned that the
 
06:10:41.868 --> 06:10:41.878 align:start position:0%
difficulty with the dates the carb
 
06:10:44.208 --> 06:10:44.218 align:start position:0%
standard does ban all ice engine sales
 
06:10:46.368 --> 06:10:46.378 align:start position:0%
in 2035.
 
06:10:48.048 --> 06:10:48.058 align:start position:0%
um backed that out based on the numbers
 
06:10:51.650 --> 06:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
that's in about nine years uh that we
 
06:10:53.570 --> 06:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
would be at that end of sale of internal
 
06:10:55.190 --> 06:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
combustion engine
 
06:10:56.990 --> 06:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't necessarily know if that's
 
06:10:59.090 --> 06:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
what all of the public wants
 
06:11:02.270 --> 06:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
um or some of it um and now I'll just
 
06:11:04.128 --> 06:11:04.138 align:start position:0%
kind of Bounce Around to some of the the
 
06:11:05.990 --> 06:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
stuff that I heard that the questions
 
06:11:09.948 --> 06:11:09.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:12.530 --> 06:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
penalties haven't been issued we heard
 
06:11:14.330 --> 06:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
and that's true but that's because the
 
06:11:16.250 --> 06:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
quota rates are are significantly low
 
06:11:18.110 --> 06:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
right now and there's also something in
 
06:11:19.910 --> 06:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
the marketplace where manufacturers who
 
06:11:22.310 --> 06:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
make EVS can sell the credits and that's
 
06:11:23.868 --> 06:11:23.878 align:start position:0%
exactly what they do
 
06:11:26.090 --> 06:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
Tesla sells all those credits to those
 
06:11:28.970 --> 06:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
gas guzzling manufacturing companies and
 
06:11:30.770 --> 06:11:30.780 align:start position:0%
so that's how they meet that quota so
 
06:11:32.150 --> 06:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of a game being
 
06:11:33.590 --> 06:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
played with with the purchase credits
 
06:11:35.090 --> 06:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
and things like that so that's why no
 
06:11:36.170 --> 06:11:36.180 align:start position:0%
penalties have been issued to
 
06:11:38.150 --> 06:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturers yet but as we get into
 
06:11:40.788 --> 06:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
that range where those percentages start
 
06:11:44.330 --> 06:11:44.340 align:start position:0%
to ramp up those penalties could I guess
 
06:11:46.670 --> 06:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
potentially come into play again the
 
06:11:48.770 --> 06:11:48.780 align:start position:0%
penalty structure is is something that
 
06:11:50.208 --> 06:11:50.218 align:start position:0%
we should look at
 
06:11:52.970 --> 06:11:52.980 align:start position:0%
um and that's why we're willing and we'd
 
06:11:54.770 --> 06:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
welcome and we've supported having the
 
06:11:56.990 --> 06:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
discussion further to come up with that
 
06:11:58.990 --> 06:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire model
 
06:12:01.730 --> 06:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
the bill raises the sticker price by 50
 
06:12:05.090 --> 06:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
Cents on an annual safety inspection
 
06:12:07.850 --> 06:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
um the the math on that came down to
 
06:12:09.708 --> 06:12:09.718 align:start position:0%
last year
 
06:12:09.718 --> 06:12:11.110 align:start position:0%
last year
um

06:12:11.110 --> 06:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:11.120 --> 06:12:12.910 align:start position:0%
um
1.5

06:12:12.910 --> 06:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
1.5
 
06:12:15.410 --> 06:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
million safety inspections times another
 
06:12:19.970 --> 06:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
50 cents that's 770 000 raised for one
 
06:12:21.410 --> 06:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
state employee
 
06:12:22.788 --> 06:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
and then where does the rest of the
 
06:12:24.170 --> 06:12:24.180 align:start position:0%
money go
 
06:12:26.030 --> 06:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
we would certainly say if this was the
 
06:12:28.250 --> 06:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
pro the bill the legislation that moved
 
06:12:29.990 --> 06:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
forward that excess funding should be
 
06:12:31.730 --> 06:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
used in a vehicle purchase incentive
 
06:12:33.530 --> 06:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
program because that's what's going to
 
06:12:34.850 --> 06:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
change the market that's what's going to
 
06:12:37.910 --> 06:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
move it and then one other point that I
 
06:12:39.948 --> 06:12:39.958 align:start position:0%
just do want to make there's some
 
06:12:42.288 --> 06:12:42.298 align:start position:0%
um for you or
 
06:12:45.048 --> 06:12:45.058 align:start position:0%
uh whomever the work group to look at is
 
06:12:46.730 --> 06:12:46.740 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
06:12:49.430 --> 06:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
there's an interesting section in in uh
 
06:12:51.948 --> 06:12:51.958 align:start position:0%
section 21A that says nothing in this
 
06:12:53.448 --> 06:12:53.458 align:start position:0%
section shall limit the commissioner's
 
06:12:55.128 --> 06:12:55.138 align:start position:0%
authority to regulate more vehicle
 
06:12:58.850 --> 06:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
emissions for any other class of vehicle
 
06:13:00.410 --> 06:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
so in my mind I start to think about
 
06:13:02.208 --> 06:13:02.218 align:start position:0%
snowmobile ATV construction farm
 
06:13:02.218 --> 06:13:03.650 align:start position:0%
snowmobile ATV construction farm
equipment

06:13:03.650 --> 06:13:03.660 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
06:13:05.030 --> 06:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
um heavy truck
 
06:13:07.730 --> 06:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
um that's a that's a pretty broad range
 
06:13:07.740 --> 06:13:08.570 align:start position:0%
um that's a that's a pretty broad range
there

06:13:08.570 --> 06:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:13:10.610 --> 06:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
um so I guess
 
06:13:10.620 --> 06:13:11.448 align:start position:0%
um so I guess
um

06:13:11.448 --> 06:13:11.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:13.910 --> 06:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
and see if there's any other questions
 
06:13:13.920 --> 06:13:15.350 align:start position:0%
and see if there's any other questions
um

06:13:15.350 --> 06:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:17.448 --> 06:13:17.458 align:start position:0%
again we've seen in our neighbors
 
06:13:19.010 --> 06:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
neighboring states that incentives
 
06:13:20.510 --> 06:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
really help the system
 
06:13:21.890 --> 06:13:21.900 align:start position:0%
um so without anything like that I think
 
06:13:23.990 --> 06:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
would be set up for failure if we did
 
06:13:25.548 --> 06:13:25.558 align:start position:0%
implement it so that's why our
 
06:13:28.490 --> 06:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
suggestion again is to get the get the
 
06:13:30.590 --> 06:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
like-minded folks together uh have a
 
06:13:32.448 --> 06:13:32.458 align:start position:0%
healthy discussion look at what could
 
06:13:34.490 --> 06:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
really grow EVS in the marketplace in
 
06:13:36.830 --> 06:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and get us to that end-all
 
06:13:39.288 --> 06:13:39.298 align:start position:0%
goal maybe the the California law isn't
 
06:13:41.150 --> 06:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
the way to do it but maybe there's some
 
06:13:44.208 --> 06:13:44.218 align:start position:0%
really other innovative ways that we can
 
06:13:46.910 --> 06:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
achieve that emission reduction and also
 
06:13:48.830 --> 06:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
get those EVS out on the street in
 
06:13:50.628 --> 06:13:50.638 align:start position:0%
driveways and garages
 
06:13:50.638 --> 06:13:51.288 align:start position:0%
driveways and garages
um

06:13:51.288 --> 06:13:51.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:53.390 --> 06:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
so with that being said
 
06:13:55.548 --> 06:13:55.558 align:start position:0%
um I'll attempt to take or answer any
 
06:13:57.470 --> 06:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
questions if I can
 
06:13:59.510 --> 06:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan would you turn off
 
06:14:00.770 --> 06:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
your mic please
 
06:14:02.570 --> 06:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question
 
06:14:05.090 --> 06:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
Doug Thomas that is thank you Mr chair
 
06:14:06.770 --> 06:14:06.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I've
 
06:14:08.570 --> 06:14:08.580 align:start position:0%
been waiting this time to ask this
 
06:14:12.530 --> 06:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
question to the dealership Association
 
06:14:12.540 --> 06:14:13.510 align:start position:0%
question to the dealership Association
um

06:14:13.510 --> 06:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:15.890 --> 06:14:15.900 align:start position:0%
if this
 
06:14:18.590 --> 06:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
bill was adopted or even one that you
 
06:14:21.410 --> 06:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
suggested under a study say
 
06:14:23.690 --> 06:14:23.700 align:start position:0%
would it
 
06:14:28.010 --> 06:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
as opposed to now would it limit the
 
06:14:31.430 --> 06:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
number of normal vehicles uh
 
06:14:33.770 --> 06:14:33.780 align:start position:0%
availability to someone who would want
 
06:14:36.128 --> 06:14:36.138 align:start position:0%
to buy them later on in other words
 
06:14:38.208 --> 06:14:38.218 align:start position:0%
would there be less of the normal
 
06:14:41.030 --> 06:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
Vehicles available for individuals to
 
06:14:45.650 --> 06:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
order as opposed to the new EVS
 
06:14:47.750 --> 06:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative I'll attempt
 
06:14:49.610 --> 06:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
to answer the question as best
 
06:14:52.128 --> 06:14:52.138 align:start position:0%
um and clear as I can that's really up
 
06:14:54.110 --> 06:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
to the manufacturer it's what they
 
06:14:55.548 --> 06:14:55.558 align:start position:0%
choose to develop in their product
 
06:14:57.948 --> 06:14:57.958 align:start position:0%
Pipeline and you heard of some of the
 
06:14:59.990 --> 06:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturers who are getting rid of
 
06:15:01.670 --> 06:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
internal combustion engines there are
 
06:15:04.670 --> 06:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
others that aren't so in that period
 
06:15:06.830 --> 06:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
over those years both vehicles could
 
06:15:09.048 --> 06:15:09.058 align:start position:0%
essentially be sold but it is true that
 
06:15:11.270 --> 06:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
in the the carb standard the Cal Zev
 
06:15:13.128 --> 06:15:13.138 align:start position:0%
standard that was adopted this past June
 
06:15:17.090 --> 06:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
it says after the end of 2035 no new
 
06:15:19.190 --> 06:15:19.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle sales that have an internal
 
06:15:21.170 --> 06:15:21.180 align:start position:0%
combustion engine will be sold in that
 
06:15:21.180 --> 06:15:22.610 align:start position:0%
combustion engine will be sold in that
state

06:15:22.610 --> 06:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:15:25.430 --> 06:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
so we will reach a point
 
06:15:29.750 --> 06:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh 12 short years from now where you if
 
06:15:32.150 --> 06:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
this law was adopted a consumer would
 
06:15:34.610 --> 06:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
not be able to buy a new gas engine
 
06:15:37.788 --> 06:15:37.798 align:start position:0%
vehicle thank you
 
06:15:40.670 --> 06:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
okay representative Nutter has a
 
06:15:40.680 --> 06:15:41.868 align:start position:0%
okay representative Nutter has a
question

06:15:41.868 --> 06:15:41.878 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:15:44.570 --> 06:15:44.580 align:start position:0%
thank you this is regarding charging
 
06:15:46.610 --> 06:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
stations since you mentioned those I
 
06:15:48.530 --> 06:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
like they have some in front of Whole
 
06:15:51.650 --> 06:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
Foods in Bedford who pays for the charge
 
06:15:53.570 --> 06:15:53.580 align:start position:0%
I mean I see cars go in and they plug in
 
06:15:55.850 --> 06:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
but but how does it work it's not like a
 
06:15:58.610 --> 06:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
gas station the vehicle owner pays for
 
06:16:00.410 --> 06:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
that charge there's a system of
 
06:16:02.448 --> 06:16:02.458 align:start position:0%
operating system some of them are tied
 
06:16:04.070 --> 06:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
to an app called chargepoint is one of
 
06:16:06.110 --> 06:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
them for example you use you have an
 
06:16:08.570 --> 06:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
account you know for Teslas like you see
 
06:16:10.250 --> 06:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
on the interstate those are same things
 
06:16:12.110 --> 06:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
paid for through an account that you
 
06:16:14.030 --> 06:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
either have through the manufacturer or
 
06:16:16.368 --> 06:16:16.378 align:start position:0%
a third-party charging app so Whole
 
06:16:18.830 --> 06:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
Foods isn't giving that energy away for
 
06:16:21.170 --> 06:16:21.180 align:start position:0%
free they've chosen to make that
 
06:16:23.330 --> 06:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
infrastructure investment and then the
 
06:16:25.250 --> 06:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
consumer in fact pays for the charges
 
06:16:27.850 --> 06:16:27.860 align:start position:0%
for their vehicle thank you
 
06:16:30.110 --> 06:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
representative Summers asked a question
 
06:16:32.570 --> 06:16:32.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
06:16:33.830 --> 06:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
um this actually has to deal with the
 
06:16:35.990 --> 06:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
same question about what dealerships and
 
06:16:38.448 --> 06:16:38.458 align:start position:0%
my question is is the majority of it's
 
06:16:40.610 --> 06:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
basically demand and risk right risk and
 
06:16:42.410 --> 06:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
demand um with most of the dealerships
 
06:16:43.850 --> 06:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire being classified
 
06:16:45.770 --> 06:16:45.780 align:start position:0%
according to California standards
 
06:16:48.170 --> 06:16:48.180 align:start position:0%
intermediate volume manufactured dealers
 
06:16:50.690 --> 06:16:50.700 align:start position:0%
so and phone under that
 
06:16:52.128 --> 06:16:52.138 align:start position:0%
do you find that when you talk to
 
06:16:53.390 --> 06:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
dealerships and you deal with
 
06:16:55.190 --> 06:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
dealerships that they're willing to take
 
06:16:57.530 --> 06:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
the risk of having by the end of next
 
06:16:59.030 --> 06:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
year I've been 25 percent of their
 
06:17:00.948 --> 06:17:00.958 align:start position:0%
inventory on the lot being electrical
 
06:17:02.868 --> 06:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
Vehicles whether it's gonna if the
 
06:17:04.670 --> 06:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
demand's there
 
06:17:06.890 --> 06:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
I think what dealers would say is they'd
 
06:17:08.570 --> 06:17:08.580 align:start position:0%
want to see the demand there it's a it
 
06:17:09.948 --> 06:17:09.958 align:start position:0%
is you're correct and that it is a big
 
06:17:12.288 --> 06:17:12.298 align:start position:0%
risk and they believe in the product and
 
06:17:14.208 --> 06:17:14.218 align:start position:0%
when you do vehicle ride and drives with
 
06:17:16.850 --> 06:17:16.860 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles the conquest rate is
 
06:17:18.170 --> 06:17:18.180 align:start position:0%
really high
 
06:17:20.030 --> 06:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
um it's it's a they're very they're
 
06:17:21.830 --> 06:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
great vehicles to drive
 
06:17:22.970 --> 06:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
um but if you look at our current
 
06:17:25.610 --> 06:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
registration rates that's a big jump to
 
06:17:27.830 --> 06:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
get from where we are to 25 percent
 
06:17:31.150 --> 06:17:31.160 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
06:17:33.948 --> 06:17:33.958 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
06:17:35.390 --> 06:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for coming in
 
06:17:39.170 --> 06:17:39.180 align:start position:0%
the um the bill says that New Hampshire
 
06:17:41.150 --> 06:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
consumers cannot benefit from the
 
06:17:43.970 --> 06:17:43.980 align:start position:0%
eight-year 80 000 mile extended warranty
 
06:17:45.830 --> 06:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
provisions of the California standards
 
06:17:47.868 --> 06:17:47.878 align:start position:0%
unless we adopt them can you talk about
 
06:17:50.628 --> 06:17:50.638 align:start position:0%
the warranty provisions
 
06:17:53.990 --> 06:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
yeah uh briefly California in adopting
 
06:17:57.830 --> 06:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
this law adds an additional uh warranty
 
06:18:00.170 --> 06:18:00.180 align:start position:0%
you know guarantee related to the
 
06:18:02.750 --> 06:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
electric drivetrain of the vehicle if
 
06:18:05.750 --> 06:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
you in fact adopt this law because they
 
06:18:08.470 --> 06:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
understand they've the law has
 
06:18:10.610 --> 06:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
prescribed a higher number of electric
 
06:18:13.250 --> 06:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
vehicle essentially quota in the state
 
06:18:13.260 --> 06:18:14.330 align:start position:0%
vehicle essentially quota in the state
so

06:18:14.330 --> 06:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:18:17.150 --> 06:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
um it benefits the consumer
 
06:18:20.570 --> 06:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
um and I guess uh if that work did come
 
06:18:23.030 --> 06:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
in it would help a service station as
 
06:18:23.040 --> 06:18:23.770 align:start position:0%
in it would help a service station as
well

06:18:23.770 --> 06:18:23.780 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:18:27.410 --> 06:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
however uh you know this isn't Brakes
 
06:18:29.150 --> 06:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
and Tires
 
06:18:31.670 --> 06:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
what breaks down on vehicles are brakes
 
06:18:35.150 --> 06:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
tires hoses body rust tail lights brake
 
06:18:37.310 --> 06:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
lights it's not the transmission the
 
06:18:38.868 --> 06:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
battery components that are in the
 
06:18:40.610 --> 06:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
engine you know when the Prius first
 
06:18:43.250 --> 06:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
came out people were were scared
 
06:18:45.830 --> 06:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do with this 7 000
 
06:18:47.890 --> 06:18:47.900 align:start position:0%
pound battery and it's not going to last
 
06:18:50.448 --> 06:18:50.458 align:start position:0%
the battery replacement rate on on
 
06:18:53.270 --> 06:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
Priuses that was projected is certainly
 
06:18:54.830 --> 06:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
not come true
 
06:18:57.708 --> 06:18:57.718 align:start position:0%
um you know and and manufacturers spend
 
06:19:00.368 --> 06:19:00.378 align:start position:0%
a lot of money on R D for their product
 
06:19:03.470 --> 06:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes they they reach you know an
 
06:19:05.930 --> 06:19:05.940 align:start position:0%
unfortunate scenarios like Chevy did
 
06:19:07.730 --> 06:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
with the bolt that had those battery
 
06:19:09.830 --> 06:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
fires and they had to pull them back
 
06:19:12.410 --> 06:19:12.420 align:start position:0%
but other times there's been Priuses and
 
06:19:13.970 --> 06:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
leafs that are on the road for 10 years
 
06:19:15.948 --> 06:19:15.958 align:start position:0%
running now Problem free
 
06:19:15.958 --> 06:19:17.628 align:start position:0%
running now Problem free
follow-up

06:19:17.628 --> 06:19:17.638 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:19:17.638 --> 06:19:19.310 align:start position:0%
follow-up
follow-up

06:19:19.310 --> 06:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:19:23.868 --> 06:19:23.878 align:start position:0%
um if a if a if a vehicle that has been
 
06:19:25.430 --> 06:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
um that's that's certified for
 
06:19:27.530 --> 06:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
California emissions
 
06:19:29.868 --> 06:19:29.878 align:start position:0%
well I guess it's a two-part question
 
06:19:32.390 --> 06:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
can vehicles that are certified for
 
06:19:34.368 --> 06:19:34.378 align:start position:0%
California emissions be sold in New
 
06:19:37.670 --> 06:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and if that's the case
 
06:19:39.350 --> 06:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
um is there a difference in the warranty
 
06:19:42.890 --> 06:19:42.900 align:start position:0%
provision the warranty coverage
 
06:19:44.750 --> 06:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question yeah
 
06:19:48.170 --> 06:19:48.180 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are that meet the the Zev
 
06:19:50.750 --> 06:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
rating are are available for sale in
 
06:19:52.670 --> 06:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
California and New Hampshire
 
06:19:55.128 --> 06:19:55.138 align:start position:0%
um uh now does that mean that they are
 
06:19:58.250 --> 06:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
no I mean no one buys the Toyota Mirai
 
06:19:59.868 --> 06:19:59.878 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire because it's a
 
06:20:01.730 --> 06:20:01.740 align:start position:0%
hydrogen-powered car
 
06:20:04.430 --> 06:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
there's nowhere to fuel the vehicle so
 
06:20:05.750 --> 06:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
um you know that's an example of where
 
06:20:07.368 --> 06:20:07.378 align:start position:0%
the vehicle would really not make its
 
06:20:07.378 --> 06:20:08.090 align:start position:0%
the vehicle would really not make its
way

06:20:08.090 --> 06:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
way
 
06:20:10.788 --> 06:20:10.798 align:start position:0%
make its way into the state but then
 
06:20:12.850 --> 06:20:12.860 align:start position:0%
with that vehicle
 
06:20:15.110 --> 06:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
when if and when something happened
 
06:20:17.448 --> 06:20:17.458 align:start position:0%
here's how it would work is and I think
 
06:20:19.190 --> 06:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
I hope this answers your question if and
 
06:20:20.628 --> 06:20:20.638 align:start position:0%
when there was a problem with the drive
 
06:20:22.368 --> 06:20:22.378 align:start position:0%
chain of the vehicle and the vehicle was
 
06:20:24.048 --> 06:20:24.058 align:start position:0%
purchased and registered here in New
 
06:20:25.970 --> 06:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you would only have the
 
06:20:28.128 --> 06:20:28.138 align:start position:0%
specific warranty if that same thing
 
06:20:29.570 --> 06:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
happened or that same problem happened
 
06:20:33.170 --> 06:20:33.180 align:start position:0%
and it was a Massachusetts customer the
 
06:20:34.990 --> 06:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts customer would have that
 
06:20:41.990 --> 06:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:43.850 --> 06:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
06:20:45.650 --> 06:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:20:47.270 --> 06:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:20:48.948 --> 06:20:48.958 align:start position:0%
um you said earlier in your testimony
 
06:20:50.208 --> 06:20:50.218 align:start position:0%
that you thought there might be
 
06:20:52.610 --> 06:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
confusion if we went ahead and adopted
 
06:20:56.628 --> 06:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
the California emissions standards but
 
06:20:58.368 --> 06:20:58.378 align:start position:0%
um the testimony that we heard earlier
 
06:21:01.190 --> 06:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
was that currently the only two
 
06:21:02.930 --> 06:21:02.940 align:start position:0%
standards that are available are either
 
06:21:04.970 --> 06:21:04.980 align:start position:0%
the California emission standards or the
 
06:21:07.310 --> 06:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
federal standards and my understanding
 
06:21:08.810 --> 06:21:08.820 align:start position:0%
is that all of the other states
 
06:21:10.548 --> 06:21:10.558 align:start position:0%
surrounding Us in New England have
 
06:21:12.410 --> 06:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
already adopted the California emission
 
06:21:15.548 --> 06:21:15.558 align:start position:0%
standards so can you talk about why you
 
06:21:17.750 --> 06:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
why you testified that it would be
 
06:21:19.070 --> 06:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
confusing because it seems like the
 
06:21:20.868 --> 06:21:20.878 align:start position:0%
other states are not they don't appear
 
06:21:23.750 --> 06:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
to be confused so
 
06:21:25.970 --> 06:21:25.980 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah uh thank you representative
 
06:21:28.730 --> 06:21:28.740 align:start position:0%
I'll do my my best to to answer your
 
06:21:30.530 --> 06:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
question however I don't remember a
 
06:21:31.850 --> 06:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
point in my testimony where I talked
 
06:21:33.590 --> 06:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
about confusion
 
06:21:35.570 --> 06:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
I'm confusion amongst the two standards
 
06:21:37.548 --> 06:21:37.558 align:start position:0%
there's only I mean I think when I spoke
 
06:21:39.530 --> 06:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
about there's two standards is it a cal
 
06:21:43.548 --> 06:21:43.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:46.970 --> 06:21:46.980 align:start position:0%
so may I respond to clarifying yes
 
06:21:48.948 --> 06:21:48.958 align:start position:0%
please yeah I think what I'm referring
 
06:21:51.770 --> 06:21:51.780 align:start position:0%
to is you had testified that you thought
 
06:21:54.410 --> 06:21:54.420 align:start position:0%
that if we went to this you characterize
 
06:21:56.270 --> 06:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
it as a mandate and you said you thought
 
06:21:58.750 --> 06:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
that it would it would make the
 
06:22:01.670 --> 06:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
dealerships position confusing I thought
 
06:22:04.850 --> 06:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:08.090 --> 06:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
uh I respectfully I don't remember
 
06:22:10.368 --> 06:22:10.378 align:start position:0%
stating that the dealerships would be
 
06:22:11.750 --> 06:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
cause confusion
 
06:22:11.760 --> 06:22:12.470 align:start position:0%
cause confusion
um

06:22:12.470 --> 06:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:14.810 --> 06:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
so I apologize I'm not sure I'm
 
06:22:14.820 --> 06:22:15.890 align:start position:0%
so I apologize I'm not sure I'm
following

06:22:15.890 --> 06:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
following
 
06:22:18.470 --> 06:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
and if you'd like to talk after I'm
 
06:22:20.510 --> 06:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
certainly open to that as well sure I
 
06:22:21.770 --> 06:22:21.780 align:start position:0%
think you were referring to the
 
06:22:23.330 --> 06:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
California standards when you said you
 
06:22:24.770 --> 06:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
thought that it would be it would create
 
06:22:26.628 --> 06:22:26.638 align:start position:0%
confusion here in the market in the auto
 
06:22:28.610 --> 06:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
market here
 
06:22:30.048 --> 06:22:30.058 align:start position:0%
um and I guess
 
06:22:32.090 --> 06:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
other dealers in other states have
 
06:22:33.708 --> 06:22:33.718 align:start position:0%
already had to adopt this and it hasn't
 
06:22:35.628 --> 06:22:35.638 align:start position:0%
really created Market confusion I don't
 
06:22:37.128 --> 06:22:37.138 align:start position:0%
believe so that's I guess what I wanted
 
06:22:38.390 --> 06:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
you to speak to remember uh
 
06:22:40.610 --> 06:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
representative we don't engage in
 
06:22:44.930 --> 06:22:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:48.110 --> 06:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
all right representative uh Reynolds has
 
06:22:49.910 --> 06:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
a question
 
06:22:52.730 --> 06:22:52.740 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chairman I guess I'd like to
 
06:22:55.010 --> 06:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
repeat the question that I asked you're
 
06:22:58.070 --> 06:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
probably the one best position to answer
 
06:23:01.788 --> 06:23:01.798 align:start position:0%
it since all the other states in New
 
06:23:05.288 --> 06:23:05.298 align:start position:0%
England have adopted California's
 
06:23:07.850 --> 06:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
standards and therefore
 
06:23:11.150 --> 06:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
presumably have plenty of
 
06:23:15.470 --> 06:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
Lev and Zev vehicles on their Lots
 
06:23:18.170 --> 06:23:18.180 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire our dealers may
 
06:23:19.730 --> 06:23:19.740 align:start position:0%
have that one
 
06:23:22.548 --> 06:23:22.558 align:start position:0%
as you've called it mannequin model our
 
06:23:25.070 --> 06:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire dealers losing out on
 
06:23:28.490 --> 06:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
sales right now to out-of-state dealers
 
06:23:30.830 --> 06:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
for these vehicles for which you've said
 
06:23:32.270 --> 06:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
they're pretty
 
06:23:35.330 --> 06:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
would you call it a high Conquest rate
 
06:23:37.548 --> 06:23:37.558 align:start position:0%
once people drive one they like it if
 
06:23:38.930 --> 06:23:38.940 align:start position:0%
they want to buy one are they going
 
06:23:41.030 --> 06:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
south or going north and buying one from
 
06:23:43.850 --> 06:23:43.860 align:start position:0%
an out of state dealer
 
06:23:47.628 --> 06:23:47.638 align:start position:0%
so do out-of-state sales happen yes they
 
06:23:49.970 --> 06:23:49.980 align:start position:0%
happen for all types of vehicles gas or
 
06:23:52.430 --> 06:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
no matter what the powertrain is and
 
06:23:54.970 --> 06:23:54.980 align:start position:0%
it's based on on vehicle
 
06:23:58.190 --> 06:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
availability and inventory and inventory
 
06:24:00.230 --> 06:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
over the past few years actually has
 
06:24:01.670 --> 06:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
been a struggle no matter what the
 
06:24:02.830 --> 06:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
vehicle is
 
06:24:04.930 --> 06:24:04.940 align:start position:0%
now are there
 
06:24:08.990 --> 06:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
islands of uh Toyota RAV primes in
 
06:24:12.890 --> 06:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
Lowell but none in Nashua uh it's been
 
06:24:15.110 --> 06:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
referred to but it's anecdotal and it's
 
06:24:17.208 --> 06:24:17.218 align:start position:0%
it's not in fact true I can guarantee
 
06:24:18.650 --> 06:24:18.660 align:start position:0%
there is a dealer in every corner of
 
06:24:20.570 --> 06:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
every community of the state if you walk
 
06:24:22.548 --> 06:24:22.558 align:start position:0%
into that dealer and tell them you want
 
06:24:25.850 --> 06:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
a particular vehicle they will work very
 
06:24:28.010 --> 06:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
very hard to ensure that they get you
 
06:24:29.810 --> 06:24:29.820 align:start position:0%
that vehicle they'll do a trade with
 
06:24:31.548 --> 06:24:31.558 align:start position:0%
another dealer I'm sorry I don't have
 
06:24:34.368 --> 06:24:34.378 align:start position:0%
the EV that you want but I've got a
 
06:24:36.890 --> 06:24:36.900 align:start position:0%
really nice Silverado that the guy next
 
06:24:39.048 --> 06:24:39.058 align:start position:0%
door does and so they'll swap they'll do
 
06:24:41.048 --> 06:24:41.058 align:start position:0%
a dealer trade and they'll do their best
 
06:24:44.030 --> 06:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
to sell you that vehicle but also keep
 
06:24:46.128 --> 06:24:46.138 align:start position:0%
you as a customer right that's the key
 
06:24:47.690 --> 06:24:47.700 align:start position:0%
to success is making the customer happy
 
06:24:49.970 --> 06:24:49.980 align:start position:0%
so they will work on your behalf for
 
06:24:52.750 --> 06:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:55.010 --> 06:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
06:24:57.830 --> 06:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much Mr chair
 
06:24:57.840 --> 06:24:58.730 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much Mr chair
um

06:24:58.730 --> 06:24:58.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:01.010 --> 06:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
you testified that dealers want to see
 
06:25:03.350 --> 06:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
the demand before the before creating
 
06:25:05.990 --> 06:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
the supply of electric cars that they
 
06:25:07.910 --> 06:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
felt uncomfortable not knowing what the
 
06:25:10.730 --> 06:25:10.740 align:start position:0%
demand was but wouldn't an adequate
 
06:25:12.650 --> 06:25:12.660 align:start position:0%
supply of electric cars create the
 
06:25:12.660 --> 06:25:14.690 align:start position:0%
supply of electric cars create the
demand

06:25:14.690 --> 06:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
demand
 
06:25:14.700 --> 06:25:18.110 align:start position:0%
demand
so

06:25:18.110 --> 06:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:19.850 --> 06:25:19.860 align:start position:0%
well no because just if you have a
 
06:25:21.350 --> 06:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
parking lot full of cars but if the
 
06:25:22.670 --> 06:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
customers aren't interested in that
 
06:25:24.288 --> 06:25:24.298 align:start position:0%
product then those that product will
 
06:25:27.048 --> 06:25:27.058 align:start position:0%
move the concern is the quota if the
 
06:25:28.788 --> 06:25:28.798 align:start position:0%
manufacturers built enough of the cars
 
06:25:30.590 --> 06:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
anybody who wanted one could get one
 
06:25:34.010 --> 06:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
regardless of what the state law is so
 
06:25:36.770 --> 06:25:36.780 align:start position:0%
if the consumer's demand is there
 
06:25:38.570 --> 06:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
because of the purchase price the
 
06:25:40.250 --> 06:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
affordability the ease of charging the
 
06:25:42.230 --> 06:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
ease of travel and the manufacturer
 
06:25:44.150 --> 06:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
builds enough of them then essentially
 
06:25:46.548 --> 06:25:46.558 align:start position:0%
the product should sell itself and the
 
06:25:48.110 --> 06:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
state shouldn't Force the product to be
 
06:25:50.090 --> 06:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
sold follow-up
 
06:25:52.250 --> 06:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
follow-up or delivered
 
06:25:55.430 --> 06:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:56.690 --> 06:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
are you seeing
 
06:25:59.270 --> 06:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
for electric cars going up
 
06:26:01.850 --> 06:26:01.860 align:start position:0%
yeah the demand is growing can it grow
 
06:26:04.850 --> 06:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
faster it certainly could through the
 
06:26:06.530 --> 06:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
ways that I mentioned that we've seen
 
06:26:08.090 --> 06:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
all of our neighboring states who have
 
06:26:10.250 --> 06:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
higher registrations do and it's not
 
06:26:11.868 --> 06:26:11.878 align:start position:0%
because of state law it's because of
 
06:26:14.390 --> 06:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
policies like mentioned about time of
 
06:26:17.150 --> 06:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
use charging in cash on the hood
 
06:26:19.430 --> 06:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
incentive purchase prices to lower the
 
06:26:22.430 --> 06:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
vehicle costs uh just the comfortability
 
06:26:24.590 --> 06:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
of seeing Chargers hanging on the wall
 
06:26:26.990 --> 06:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
at the rest stop and hooks it you know
 
06:26:28.430 --> 06:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
makes it seem like it's more of an
 
06:26:30.230 --> 06:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
availability so they're willing to take
 
06:26:32.270 --> 06:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
that leap remember this is a new
 
06:26:33.890 --> 06:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
emerging technology that some folks
 
06:26:36.170 --> 06:26:36.180 align:start position:0%
aren't used to so there has to be a
 
06:26:37.910 --> 06:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
comfortability factor to ease them into
 
06:26:40.670 --> 06:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
the market and with that that consumer
 
06:26:44.410 --> 06:26:44.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:46.548 --> 06:26:46.558 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
06:26:48.650 --> 06:26:48.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:26:51.530 --> 06:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
taking my question so as things stand
 
06:26:51.540 --> 06:26:53.150 align:start position:0%
taking my question so as things stand
currently

06:26:53.150 --> 06:26:53.160 align:start position:0%
currently
 
06:26:56.090 --> 06:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
if a dealer in New Hampshire and let's
 
06:26:57.470 --> 06:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
say it's a dealer that doesn't have
 
06:27:00.650 --> 06:27:00.660 align:start position:0%
locations outside of the state wanted a
 
06:27:03.230 --> 06:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
certain allocation of EVS would they be
 
06:27:05.810 --> 06:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
able to get the same allocation as a
 
06:27:08.390 --> 06:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
dealer in a state that follows the
 
06:27:10.850 --> 06:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
California law
 
06:27:14.208 --> 06:27:14.218 align:start position:0%
dealers have the same availability to
 
06:27:16.010 --> 06:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
order product
 
06:27:18.110 --> 06:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
but it depends on how much product
 
06:27:20.990 --> 06:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
exists now are there dealers that buy in
 
06:27:22.868 --> 06:27:22.878 align:start position:0%
larger volumes
 
06:27:25.670 --> 06:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
certainly you know dealers own their own
 
06:27:27.410 --> 06:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
inventory the manufacturer doesn't pay
 
06:27:28.670 --> 06:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
for that
 
06:27:30.650 --> 06:27:30.660 align:start position:0%
the dealers do that's their alone what's
 
06:27:32.810 --> 06:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
called a floor plan you you borrow money
 
06:27:36.170 --> 06:27:36.180 align:start position:0%
from a bank to afford your inventory so
 
06:27:38.628 --> 06:27:38.638 align:start position:0%
they're gonna put they're gonna take
 
06:27:40.430 --> 06:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
that loan and put into their inventory
 
06:27:41.810 --> 06:27:41.820 align:start position:0%
product that they know is going to move
 
06:27:43.250 --> 06:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
so that they'll be able to pay off that
 
06:27:43.260 --> 06:27:44.090 align:start position:0%
so that they'll be able to pay off that
loan

06:27:44.090 --> 06:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
loan
 
06:27:46.610 --> 06:27:46.620 align:start position:0%
you don't want a product to sit 60 you
 
06:27:49.070 --> 06:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
know 90 days you want to you want to
 
06:27:51.170 --> 06:27:51.180 align:start position:0%
move that so the dealer has the ability
 
06:27:53.030 --> 06:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
to order that from the manufacturer so
 
06:27:54.890 --> 06:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
whether they want to based on the
 
06:27:56.868 --> 06:27:56.878 align:start position:0%
consumer demand and whether the
 
06:27:59.030 --> 06:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturer is willing to be able to
 
06:28:02.030 --> 06:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:03.650 --> 06:28:03.660 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
06:28:06.410 --> 06:28:06.420 align:start position:0%
so I just want to be clear is your
 
06:28:09.048 --> 06:28:09.058 align:start position:0%
answer yes yes they have the ability to
 
06:28:10.910 --> 06:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
order product they certainly do and and
 
06:28:13.250 --> 06:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
and the product would be delivered If
 
06:28:15.230 --> 06:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
the product is available you can go down
 
06:28:16.730 --> 06:28:16.740 align:start position:0%
to the Ford dealer and put your name for
 
06:28:19.250 --> 06:28:19.260 align:start position:0%
a Maki right now
 
06:28:20.990 --> 06:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
you can go ahead and order that vehicle
 
06:28:22.850 --> 06:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
and you will get it it may be three six
 
06:28:24.350 --> 06:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
nine months
 
06:28:26.510 --> 06:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
but that's because they're not building
 
06:28:29.930 --> 06:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:33.170 --> 06:28:33.180 align:start position:0%
representative closure has a question
 
06:28:35.750 --> 06:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chair and thank you for
 
06:28:37.490 --> 06:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:28:40.730 --> 06:28:40.740 align:start position:0%
um not knowing the
 
06:28:42.650 --> 06:28:42.660 align:start position:0%
sales or the admissions like we're
 
06:28:44.810 --> 06:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
looking at here for the other Butters
 
06:28:49.430 --> 06:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
States would you know if this line in
 
06:28:51.110 --> 06:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:28:55.090 --> 06:28:55.100 align:start position:0%
92 is what the other states
 
06:28:59.990 --> 06:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
apply it's on the page two line three
 
06:29:01.730 --> 06:29:01.740 align:start position:0%
I'll read it for you such regulations
 
06:29:04.128 --> 06:29:04.138 align:start position:0%
shall be applicable to new motor
 
06:29:08.390 --> 06:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
vehicles sold in the state of
 
06:29:08.400 --> 06:29:10.310 align:start position:0%
vehicles sold in the state of
whatever

06:29:10.310 --> 06:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
06:29:16.368 --> 06:29:16.378 align:start position:0%
after January 1st 24th the question is
 
06:29:18.410 --> 06:29:18.420 align:start position:0%
it's being implied that other states
 
06:29:24.350 --> 06:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
have this our Butters so in 24 and after
 
06:29:29.208 --> 06:29:29.218 align:start position:0%
can they buy in a car vehicle in New
 
06:29:32.208 --> 06:29:32.218 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not compliant with their state
 
06:29:33.890 --> 06:29:33.900 align:start position:0%
and registered in the state the
 
06:29:36.350 --> 06:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
registration is the key question can
 
06:29:38.750 --> 06:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
they register yeah so thank thank you
 
06:29:38.760 --> 06:29:39.770 align:start position:0%
they register yeah so thank thank you
representative

06:29:39.770 --> 06:29:39.780 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:29:41.570 --> 06:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
um you know unfortunately I don't know
 
06:29:44.448 --> 06:29:44.458 align:start position:0%
what other states policies as far as
 
06:29:47.448 --> 06:29:47.458 align:start position:0%
limiting registration is uh I know in
 
06:29:50.810 --> 06:29:50.820 align:start position:0%
the past uh under a pre a different
 
06:29:53.330 --> 06:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
version of this law you know when
 
06:29:55.430 --> 06:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
Vermont uh when there weren't 50 state
 
06:29:57.170 --> 06:29:57.180 align:start position:0%
cars which was what there are right now
 
06:29:58.670 --> 06:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
there were vehicles that New Hampshire
 
06:30:00.288 --> 06:30:00.298 align:start position:0%
dealers could sell that other states
 
06:30:03.410 --> 06:30:03.420 align:start position:0%
could not a diesel Jeep Liberty is one
 
06:30:06.230 --> 06:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
example and you could not cross the
 
06:30:08.810 --> 06:30:08.820 align:start position:0%
river uh purchase the car then go back
 
06:30:11.090 --> 06:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
into Vermont to registrate to register
 
06:30:13.070 --> 06:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
it but I think that depends on
 
06:30:15.230 --> 06:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
individual states what I do know is
 
06:30:17.570 --> 06:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
correct is what was mentioned before is
 
06:30:19.310 --> 06:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
um you know you either adopt the
 
06:30:22.128 --> 06:30:22.138 align:start position:0%
California standard and you're all in or
 
06:30:24.230 --> 06:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
you adopt a federal standard there's no
 
06:30:26.810 --> 06:30:26.820 align:start position:0%
kind of state-specific provision where
 
06:30:28.430 --> 06:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
we'll say we'll take this chunk of it
 
06:30:30.410 --> 06:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
but we won't take the ice the internal
 
06:30:32.690 --> 06:30:32.700 align:start position:0%
combustion engine ban you can't chop it
 
06:30:35.090 --> 06:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
up you can only take it's all or nothing
 
06:30:35.100 --> 06:30:37.548 align:start position:0%
up you can only take it's all or nothing
really

06:30:37.548 --> 06:30:37.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:39.708 --> 06:30:39.718 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
 
06:30:41.750 --> 06:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
06:30:43.430 --> 06:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
06:30:44.990 --> 06:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going to ask the question
 
06:30:46.610 --> 06:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
about what happens when the incentives
 
06:30:48.590 --> 06:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
are taken away from EVS if the man will
 
06:30:50.390 --> 06:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
go down or not because that's not part
 
06:30:52.368 --> 06:30:52.378 align:start position:0%
of this bill what is part of the bill
 
06:30:55.128 --> 06:30:55.138 align:start position:0%
though my question is if this date were
 
06:30:58.128 --> 06:30:58.138 align:start position:0%
to adopt this bill
 
06:31:02.690 --> 06:31:02.700 align:start position:0%
uh by say in by by 2035 and including
 
06:31:05.208 --> 06:31:05.218 align:start position:0%
the states around here as well
 
06:31:09.170 --> 06:31:09.180 align:start position:0%
does that mean that individuals
 
06:31:12.590 --> 06:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't wouldn't no longer be able to
 
06:31:17.090 --> 06:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
purchase a new car vehicle that is not
 
06:31:20.150 --> 06:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
EV and therefore if they didn't want any
 
06:31:22.850 --> 06:31:22.860 align:start position:0%
V would they be forced to purchase a
 
06:31:25.010 --> 06:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
truck or some other vehicle that isn't
 
06:31:27.250 --> 06:31:27.260 align:start position:0%
covered by this bill
 
06:31:27.260 --> 06:31:28.910 align:start position:0%
covered by this bill
so

06:31:28.910 --> 06:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:31:30.948 --> 06:31:30.958 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll take it in two parts thanks
 
06:31:32.448 --> 06:31:32.458 align:start position:0%
for not asking the incentive program
 
06:31:32.458 --> 06:31:33.770 align:start position:0%
for not asking the incentive program
question

06:31:33.770 --> 06:31:33.780 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:31:35.208 --> 06:31:35.218 align:start position:0%
because then I don't have to use the
 
06:31:36.590 --> 06:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
example of Georgia who dropped their
 
06:31:38.208 --> 06:31:38.218 align:start position:0%
incentive program in EV registrations
 
06:31:40.128 --> 06:31:40.138 align:start position:0%
dropped off 80 percent
 
06:31:43.250 --> 06:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
what I will say is after 2035 the the
 
06:31:45.410 --> 06:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
bill will state because they're adopted
 
06:31:47.330 --> 06:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
the California standard that no internal
 
06:31:49.368 --> 06:31:49.378 align:start position:0%
combustion engine Vehicles will be sold
 
06:31:51.650 --> 06:31:51.660 align:start position:0%
no new internal combustion engine
 
06:31:53.690 --> 06:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
Vehicles will be sold so if someone
 
06:31:55.368 --> 06:31:55.378 align:start position:0%
didn't want that they would be forced
 
06:32:03.230 --> 06:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:07.250 --> 06:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no more uh questions I want
 
06:32:08.868 --> 06:32:08.878 align:start position:0%
to thank you for your
 
06:32:11.570 --> 06:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
testimony here this afternoon thank you
 
06:32:13.250 --> 06:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
very much we look forward to the
 
06:32:15.890 --> 06:32:15.900 align:start position:0%
discussion and we sincerely do hope
 
06:32:17.570 --> 06:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
um because we do believe in the EV and
 
06:32:19.970 --> 06:32:19.980 align:start position:0%
the product and that that this committee
 
06:32:21.770 --> 06:32:21.780 align:start position:0%
make the decision to form a study
 
06:32:23.628 --> 06:32:23.638 align:start position:0%
commission to see how we can further it
 
06:32:26.390 --> 06:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you
 
06:32:29.750 --> 06:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
and now we'll call on our last
 
06:32:29.760 --> 06:32:30.530 align:start position:0%
and now we'll call on our last
um

06:32:30.530 --> 06:32:30.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:32:38.090 --> 06:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:41.448 --> 06:32:41.458 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna try real ravage
 
06:32:44.170 --> 06:32:44.180 align:start position:0%
okay she represents the New Hampshire
 
06:32:46.850 --> 06:32:46.860 align:start position:0%
motorcyclists rights organization and
 
06:32:49.910 --> 06:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
she opposes this bill thank you so good
 
06:32:52.010 --> 06:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
job Tracy borvage
 
06:32:53.628 --> 06:32:53.638 align:start position:0%
I am the president of New Hampshire
 
06:32:55.970 --> 06:32:55.980 align:start position:0%
motorcycle rights organization
 
06:32:59.510 --> 06:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
we would like actually clarification in
 
06:33:01.430 --> 06:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire motorcyclists are
 
06:33:03.230 --> 06:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
considered a motor vehicle
 
06:33:06.230 --> 06:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
we went through this and we could not
 
06:33:08.990 --> 06:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
find in the California legislation
 
06:33:11.810 --> 06:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
where we are either included or excluded
 
06:33:15.590 --> 06:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
in their particular legislation so the
 
06:33:17.390 --> 06:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
first thing we would like to know is if
 
06:33:20.270 --> 06:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
we are included or excluded in the
 
06:33:22.250 --> 06:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
California legislation
 
06:33:24.410 --> 06:33:24.420 align:start position:0%
having said that
 
06:33:26.448 --> 06:33:26.458 align:start position:0%
if we are included
 
06:33:29.330 --> 06:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
we are definitely opposed
 
06:33:32.868 --> 06:33:32.878 align:start position:0%
for several reasons first being we are
 
06:33:34.910 --> 06:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
very involved in this state there are
 
06:33:37.490 --> 06:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
over 80 000 registered motorcycle riders
 
06:33:40.070 --> 06:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire which is pretty
 
06:33:41.990 --> 06:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
significant for a little state
 
06:33:44.990 --> 06:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
and I represent them all from Racers to
 
06:33:47.270 --> 06:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
dirt bike riders we have a lot of EV
 
06:33:49.670 --> 06:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
riders in our organization
 
06:33:51.650 --> 06:33:51.660 align:start position:0%
we like them all doesn't matter what you
 
06:33:53.810 --> 06:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
ride spiders doesn't matter we walk on
 
06:33:55.310 --> 06:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
the mall
 
06:33:57.288 --> 06:33:57.298 align:start position:0%
we believe in freedom of choice of what
 
06:33:59.448 --> 06:33:59.458 align:start position:0%
you ride we don't think that someone
 
06:34:01.430 --> 06:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
should tell you that you should have an
 
06:34:02.650 --> 06:34:02.660 align:start position:0%
electric motorcycle
 
06:34:05.030 --> 06:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
or an internal combustion engine
 
06:34:07.310 --> 06:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
motorcycle because we believe that
 
06:34:09.288 --> 06:34:09.298 align:start position:0%
everybody should ride their own ride and
 
06:34:11.628 --> 06:34:11.638 align:start position:0%
what they ride they should choose
 
06:34:14.208 --> 06:34:14.218 align:start position:0%
we also have worked very closely with
 
06:34:16.070 --> 06:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
the Automobile Dealers Association many
 
06:34:18.470 --> 06:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
times on lots of different things and we
 
06:34:20.570 --> 06:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
work with a lot of Manufacturers and we
 
06:34:22.190 --> 06:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
do not feel that they're going to be
 
06:34:23.868 --> 06:34:23.878 align:start position:0%
able to deliver
 
06:34:26.510 --> 06:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
enough of the what is required in the
 
06:34:28.128 --> 06:34:28.138 align:start position:0%
California legislation to be able to
 
06:34:31.250 --> 06:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
meet writers needs by 2035 or as they go
 
06:34:34.190 --> 06:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
down or go up every year if Riders
 
06:34:37.970 --> 06:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
choose to buy electric motorcycles
 
06:34:40.548 --> 06:34:40.558 align:start position:0%
we also think and I don't know if any of
 
06:34:42.650 --> 06:34:42.660 align:start position:0%
you are writers motorcycles do not have
 
06:34:45.110 --> 06:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
the range mileage range that other
 
06:34:46.490 --> 06:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
vehicles have
 
06:34:48.230 --> 06:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
and with what we're seeing for
 
06:34:49.910 --> 06:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure with the charging
 
06:34:52.250 --> 06:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
stations motorcycles are going to have a
 
06:34:53.868 --> 06:34:53.878 align:start position:0%
really really hard time
 
06:34:56.390 --> 06:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
going very far besides their maybe
 
06:34:58.788 --> 06:34:58.798 align:start position:0%
neighborhood or backyard and trying to
 
06:35:01.070 --> 06:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
charge our motorcycles they go about 130
 
06:35:01.080 --> 06:35:02.208 align:start position:0%
charge our motorcycles they go about 130
miles

06:35:02.208 --> 06:35:02.218 align:start position:0%
miles
 
06:35:03.770 --> 06:35:03.780 align:start position:0%
in one tank
 
06:35:06.048 --> 06:35:06.058 align:start position:0%
130 150.
 
06:35:08.448 --> 06:35:08.458 align:start position:0%
so with what's being put in place with
 
06:35:10.910 --> 06:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure with charging stations
 
06:35:14.270 --> 06:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh I can probably go to my local store
 
06:35:16.548 --> 06:35:16.558 align:start position:0%
or maybe down the road a couple places
 
06:35:19.010 --> 06:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
whatever but we're not going to be able
 
06:35:20.750 --> 06:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
to go like other vehicles with the
 
06:35:22.970 --> 06:35:22.980 align:start position:0%
charging stations and I don't think the
 
06:35:23.930 --> 06:35:23.940 align:start position:0%
government's going to want to put
 
06:35:25.670 --> 06:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
charging stations in place just for
 
06:35:25.680 --> 06:35:27.170 align:start position:0%
charging stations in place just for
motorcycles

06:35:27.170 --> 06:35:27.180 align:start position:0%
motorcycles
 
06:35:30.708 --> 06:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
and like I said with 80 000 registered
 
06:35:33.170 --> 06:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
motorcyclists in New Hampshire
 
06:35:34.970 --> 06:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
does New Hampshire want to put charging
 
06:35:37.490 --> 06:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
stations in for all of us because you
 
06:35:38.868 --> 06:35:38.878 align:start position:0%
can bet we're going to come back here
 
06:35:41.930 --> 06:35:41.940 align:start position:0%
and want charging stations for the 80
 
06:35:43.970 --> 06:35:43.980 align:start position:0%
000 of us that ride
 
06:35:46.010 --> 06:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
having said that thank you respectfully
 
06:35:48.230 --> 06:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to speak chairman Vos
 
06:35:50.448 --> 06:35:50.458 align:start position:0%
and members and I will be glad to take
 
06:35:52.190 --> 06:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
questions I'm not sure what I can answer
 
06:35:53.930 --> 06:35:53.940 align:start position:0%
for you but I'll be glad to take
 
06:35:53.940 --> 06:35:55.730 align:start position:0%
for you but I'll be glad to take
questions

06:35:55.730 --> 06:35:55.740 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:35:58.368 --> 06:35:58.378 align:start position:0%
well you could try to answer one for me
 
06:36:00.410 --> 06:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
if you like please and thank you thank
 
06:36:02.510 --> 06:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
you for being here today and speaking
 
06:36:04.128 --> 06:36:04.138 align:start position:0%
with us
 
06:36:06.410 --> 06:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
do you have any experience at all with
 
06:36:10.910 --> 06:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
electric motorcycles what is the size of
 
06:36:13.190 --> 06:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
a battery that would go into an electric
 
06:36:18.110 --> 06:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
motorcycle and what would its range be
 
06:36:20.510 --> 06:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
I've only been a one to see what it felt
 
06:36:23.330 --> 06:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
like I do not know the size of the
 
06:36:25.070 --> 06:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
battery I know that I know that that
 
06:36:25.080 --> 06:36:27.048 align:start position:0%
battery I know that I know that that
particular

06:36:27.048 --> 06:36:27.058 align:start position:0%
particular
 
06:36:29.208 --> 06:36:29.218 align:start position:0%
size of the motorcycle is bigger than
 
06:36:31.430 --> 06:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
like someone my size would want to ride
 
06:36:33.530 --> 06:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
I can't reach I can't touch the ground
 
06:36:35.628 --> 06:36:35.638 align:start position:0%
on the electric current the electric
 
06:36:38.270 --> 06:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
motorcycles so for me riding one would
 
06:36:40.970 --> 06:36:40.980 align:start position:0%
not be an option right now
 
06:36:42.770 --> 06:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:36:45.350 --> 06:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Summers
 
06:36:47.090 --> 06:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman is going to answer your
 
06:36:48.530 --> 06:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
question right now there's Harley
 
06:36:50.150 --> 06:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
Davidson only has one model of electric
 
06:36:52.850 --> 06:36:52.860 align:start position:0%
and it goes about 102 miles
 
06:36:52.860 --> 06:36:54.530 align:start position:0%
and it goes about 102 miles
range

06:36:54.530 --> 06:36:54.540 align:start position:0%
range
 
06:36:56.750 --> 06:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
oh thank you appreciate that
 
06:37:01.788 --> 06:37:01.798 align:start position:0%

06:38:21.048 --> 06:38:21.058 align:start position:0%
a blue sheet was three in favor
 
06:38:24.288 --> 06:38:24.298 align:start position:0%
one in favor amended
 
06:38:29.208 --> 06:38:29.218 align:start position:0%

06:38:30.470 --> 06:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
you chair
 
06:38:32.628 --> 06:38:32.638 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
06:38:34.910 --> 06:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
all right so I'm going to close the
 
06:38:38.810 --> 06:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 92.
 
06:38:41.868 --> 06:38:41.878 align:start position:0%
and that for the most part concludes our
 
06:38:44.208 --> 06:38:44.218 align:start position:0%
business for today
 
06:38:47.750 --> 06:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
I do want to alert anyone who is
 
06:38:50.690 --> 06:38:50.700 align:start position:0%
watching the live stream of this
 
06:38:52.010 --> 06:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
committee session
 
06:38:54.650 --> 06:38:54.660 align:start position:0%
that the executive session scheduled for
 
06:38:59.448 --> 06:38:59.458 align:start position:0%
4 P.M this afternoon has been canceled
 
06:39:02.150 --> 06:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
the reason for that cancellation we have
 
06:39:04.610 --> 06:39:04.620 align:start position:0%
not heard the bills that were scheduled
 
06:39:06.830 --> 06:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
for executive session they were supposed
 
06:39:09.048 --> 06:39:09.058 align:start position:0%
to have been heard yesterday but due to
 
06:39:10.010 --> 06:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
the weather
 
06:39:12.770 --> 06:39:12.780 align:start position:0%
this building was closed and
 
06:39:15.288 --> 06:39:15.298 align:start position:0%
that meeting was canceled so those bills
 
06:39:18.048 --> 06:39:18.058 align:start position:0%
were not heard they will be rescheduled
 
06:39:20.090 --> 06:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
in the calendar
 
06:39:22.430 --> 06:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
many of them if not all of them will be
 
06:39:24.048 --> 06:39:24.058 align:start position:0%
scheduled for next week
 
06:39:28.430 --> 06:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
or the Monday following because
 
06:39:30.770 --> 06:39:30.780 align:start position:0%
five of the bills that we will have
 
06:39:30.780 --> 06:39:32.030 align:start position:0%
five of the bills that we will have
heard

06:39:32.030 --> 06:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
heard
 
06:39:34.070 --> 06:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
by the end of next week will be early
 
06:39:37.010 --> 06:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
bills that need to be processed
 
06:39:39.288 --> 06:39:39.298 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible because they have
 
06:39:41.150 --> 06:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
to go to a second committee
 
06:39:43.670 --> 06:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
so we will be having uh
 
06:39:45.948 --> 06:39:45.958 align:start position:0%
executive sessions on those bills next
 
06:39:48.350 --> 06:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
week to remind the members we'll meet
 
06:39:53.448 --> 06:39:53.458 align:start position:0%
Monday Tuesday and Friday next week
 
06:39:55.368 --> 06:39:55.378 align:start position:0%
and of course there's a house session
 
06:39:57.410 --> 06:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
next Thursday so
 
06:39:59.868 --> 06:39:59.878 align:start position:0%
uh sadly we'll have to drag you all up
 
06:40:02.150 --> 06:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
here to Concord four times next week but
 
06:40:06.110 --> 06:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
we have to get our our business done so
 
06:40:08.150 --> 06:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
um we just
 
06:40:10.910 --> 06:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
do what the weather demands of us and uh
 
06:40:13.430 --> 06:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
meet more often next week Mr chairman
 
06:40:16.730 --> 06:40:16.740 align:start position:0%
question yes representative McGee do we
