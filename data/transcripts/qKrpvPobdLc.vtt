on Improvement and
 
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
assessment and we've been dealing with
 
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
the 306 rules here now for a good while
 
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
and so as the State Board of Education
 
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
and so what we have in front of us today
 
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
is we have a the final proposal on the
 
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
first portion of the 306s which was
 
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
presented to the state board and acted
 
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
upon was it last week yeah last week
 
00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 align:start position:0%
yeah so what I'd like to do is today
 
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
take a look at that uh we are tasked as
 
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
the uh oversight committee for
 
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
improvement and assessment to be looking
 
00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 align:start position:0%
at the academic
 
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
standards uh that are are are set for
 
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
our state and to look at it in terms of
 
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
um through the 306s here to look at
 
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
those portions which are really
 
00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
reflective of those academic standards I
 
00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 align:start position:0%
want to also bring to everybody's
 
00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 align:start position:0%
attention that we did pass a bill this
 
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
year which was one which looked at the
 
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks that was 1107
 
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
1107 and that requires the department
 
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
education to uh maintain the the the
 
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
Frameworks because we had taken
 
00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
Frameworks out of Law and we put them
 
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
back in and the Frameworks as they were
 
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 align:start position:0%
amended here will will reflect and do
 
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
reflect the academic standards which we
 
00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 align:start position:0%
have for education those academic
 
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 align:start position:0%
standards are to be part of the
 
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks and that was to
 
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
provide the school districts out in the
 
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
field the opportunity to really be able
 
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 align:start position:0%
to access and and find them where they
 
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
really belong in those Frameworks so
 
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
with that I'd like to open up this
 
00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 align:start position:0%
meeting right here and we'll we'll look
 
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
at the 306 is the first portion of that
 
00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
uh the August 14 version if there were
 
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 align:start position:0%
some amending language done to that at
 
00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
the State Board that you tweaked it and
 
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
places I don't have a copy of that so
 
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
maybe if folks from the education
 
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
department that are
 
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 align:start position:0%
here could let us know that yes um
 
00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
representative lab reached out to me for
 
00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
a copy and what I sent was the post that
 
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
included all the
 
00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
am okay so that's what we have right
 
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
here in front of us
 
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.469 align:start position:0%
here in front of us
then

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
okay so then with that I'd like to open
 
00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
the the the meeting up to discussing
 
00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:33.639 align:start position:0%
that proposal that was approved by the
 
00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 align:start position:0%
state board uh last week and so let's
 
00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 align:start position:0%
take a look and and the first part has
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
some uh information regarding the
 
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
information that the department received
 
00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
from the public and lists the citizens
 
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
who submitted public testimony there's
 
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
two or three three pages of it and and
 
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
then we will start with our discussion
 
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
here on page one
 
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
and as those on the study committee here
 
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
um on page one where we're primarily
 
00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280 align:start position:0%
definitions and as I recall in our last
 
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
June meeting we looked at definitions
 
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:17.560 align:start position:0%
and we as a committee indicated that
 
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
we'd like to see definitions that
 
00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:20.879 align:start position:0%
reflect statutory language rather than
 
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
having it and that I believe has all
 
00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
been tweaked and all changed within here
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
so let's let's walk through it right now
 
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
anything on page
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:36.919 align:start position:0%
concern so Mr chair just to be just to
 
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
be clear we're talking about um
 
00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:42.039 align:start position:0%
comments public comment correct no I I
 
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
was looking right at the the document
 
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
itself oh okay pass the public comment
 
00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah the on of the final proposal
 
00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:53.919 align:start position:0%
we're looking at page one not the front
 
00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:57.690 align:start position:0%

[Applause]

00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
as you may recall we had the discussion
 
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:10.280 align:start position:0%
about competencies the definition
 
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:13.720 align:start position:0%
competencies and now this this uh final
 
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:17.720 align:start position:0%
proposal or version references RSA 193 H
 
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
col 1 and and Roman 2 so that is the
 
00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:32.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
there any other you
 
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
know concerns that the committee may
 
00:08:38.949 --> 00:08:38.959 align:start position:0%
have referencing the academic standards
 
00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:40.599 align:start position:0%
as as they relate to these minimum
 
00:08:42.269 --> 00:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
standards of public school
 
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
approval on on that
 
00:08:48.509 --> 00:08:48.519 align:start position:0%
page okay and also the definition for
 
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:51.160 align:start position:0%
academic standards is that which is in
 
00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
hang on yeah thanks so so
 
00:09:09.069 --> 00:09:09.079 align:start position:0%
on on on page one where we've got
 
00:09:10.829 --> 00:09:10.839 align:start position:0%
achievement of competencies which is an
 
00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
area that I think we had some concern
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
back on June
 
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.590 align:start position:0%
back on June
27th

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
um it's now been added through a
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
collection of
 
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:32.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of the academic standards terms
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
of achievement of competencies in B on
 
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
the the the last the last um you know
 
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
the third to the last paragraph So the
 
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:47.240 align:start position:0%
definition you'd have to look at 193 H
 
00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:49.399 align:start position:0%
colon one which is the definition for
 
00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:51.320 align:start position:0%
competencies which is on the top page
 
00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
two yeah and achievement of competencies
 
00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
um collection I'm looking at this is how
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
the state board has
 
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
opted to Define achievement of
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
competencies um we're not defining
 
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
competencies they're saying how do we
 
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
get to that
 
00:10:12.509 --> 00:10:12.519 align:start position:0%
point through a collection of evidence I
 
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
would assume that's you know you know
 
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
could be very objective evidence it
 
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:21.560 align:start position:0%
could be subjective evidence
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
find evidence yeah yeah just collection
 
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
of evidence I mean because we talk about
 
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:33.560 align:start position:0%
other things in
 
00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:36.279 align:start position:0%
assessment are are they things that are
 
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
assessed well you know my when we've
 
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
talked about this in the past about our
 
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment from the field
 
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
teachers are saying there's lots of
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
different ways of identifying assessment
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
other than the Statewide assessment
 
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily and takes a lot of time out
 
00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:54.839 align:start position:0%
of teaching in in our classroom but we
 
00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
know there and it's formative there's
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
diagnostic you know you know
 
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh assessments well so so so an example
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
here what I'm what I'm you know suggest
 
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
I mean through a collection of evidence
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.470 align:start position:0%
 
assessments

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
assessments
 
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
teachers well it more fortive too as
 
00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:24.279 align:start position:0%
you're moving through I would say it's
 
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
it's a com combination of both and to
 
00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:31.399 align:start position:0%
I I don't know I don't formative guides
 
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
instruction summative is the assessment
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
isn't that I mean I'm not an expert in
 
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:45.160 align:start position:0%
but going see how students are
 
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
progressing what we might need to
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
present differently or or reinforce and
 
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
something assessment
 
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.949 align:start position:0%
 
refolio

00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:19.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:22.839 align:start position:0%
whats right thank you and and the reason
 
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:25.240 align:start position:0%
I'm picking on this um Mr chair is
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
because this this was not in the um the
 
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
uh the draft that we reviewed on June
 
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
27th so this is new um it it's new
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
language and I'm I'm not clear on what
 
00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:39.910 align:start position:0%
language and I'm I'm not clear on what
that

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
means is that the responsibility of this
 
00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:45.519 align:start position:0%
committee you know that that's why I
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
said at the beginning we're dealing with
 
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
academic standards yeah and is this an
 
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
academic standard or is this more in
 
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
line with how we determine whether the
 
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
academic standard is being and I think
 
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959 align:start position:0%
that's a I think that's a great question
 
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and and and
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
perhaps rather than going through you
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
know all you know all these rules and I
 
00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:15.519 align:start position:0%
and I think we do have a a time limit
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
today um that or time constraint today
 
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
that that identifying which rules bear
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
on academic standards would be would be
 
00:13:31.629 --> 00:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
good to understand and um and and I
 
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
I sent I circulated this around the
 
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:37.160 align:start position:0%
table which I think follows on something
 
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
that you had sent out at the last
 
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:43.720 align:start position:0%
meeting and so this um you know it it
 
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
you know uh defines the the um the
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the legislative
 
00:13:52.829 --> 00:13:52.839 align:start position:0%
oversight committee it defines the
 
00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:56.519 align:start position:0%
process for rule approval and then it
 
00:13:58.509 --> 00:13:58.519 align:start position:0%
also defines academic standards and
 
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
that's the the third thing on this page
 
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
means what a student should know and be
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
able to do in the course or at each
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
grade level and so achievement of
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
competencies means a student has
 
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
demonstrated competencies at a
 
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.160 align:start position:0%
proficient level through a collection of
 
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
evidence um does that is that an
 
00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
academic standard or is that a
 
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
non-academic standard uh I think is a is
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
a is a fair question to put out there
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
but uh but I think there would be a
 
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable argument to to make that
 
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
that that achievement of competencies
 
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
means a student has demonstrated
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
competencies at a proficient level
 
00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
through a collection of evidence so does
 
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
that mean what a student should know and
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
do in a course or at each grade
 
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
level Welling comp proficient level
 
00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:53.720 align:start position:0%
right and it's there's a lot of ways to
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
determine that as a teacher myself I
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
often times recognized
 
00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
that the the student
 
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
understood that basic uh competency by
 
00:15:09.069 --> 00:15:09.079 align:start position:0%
doing by actually going out and
 
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
functioning whether it's being applying
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
that skill sure whether it be in music
 
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
or or art or or in
 
00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:20.839 align:start position:0%
mathematics so you know it when I when
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
we try to nail this down through a
 
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
collection of evidence I I that I I I I
 
00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
interpret that as a
 
00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
wider window for
 
00:15:34.509 --> 00:15:34.519 align:start position:0%
determining how uh the achievement and
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
so would that you know if we put in a
 
00:15:38.749 --> 00:15:38.759 align:start position:0%
formative and summative that doesn't
 
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
even do what I did as a teacher because
 
00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:45.079 align:start position:0%
I was also looking at you know how they
 
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
applied those skills in their in their
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
career or in their you know
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
understanding of that specific compy
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
taught in the fourth
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
grade no no and listening to a parent
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
you know yeah kid you know really
 
00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:03.639 align:start position:0%
progressing okay so so listening to a
 
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
parent and saying that you know if a
 
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:07.720 align:start position:0%
parent says that the student is
 
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
competent in something I I don't know if
 
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
that's how how um assessment is defined
 
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
in here um I don't know if there's a
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
reason to to merge assessment through a
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
collection of evidence which is an
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
assessment area whether that has bearing
 
00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
on achievement of competencies because I
 
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
think there's a whole section in here
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
later on assessment look when you go
 
00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
into our statutes and you're looking at
 
00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:37.639 align:start position:0%
a Statewide assessment it says
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%
objective uh in there that means it's
 
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
talking about something such as a norm
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
reference test or something of that
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
nature um but achievement of
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
competencies in terms of a kid that's in
 
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
a Career Technical education center how
 
00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:54.839 align:start position:0%
do you how do you measure a child a
 
00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
student that's now able to change a tire
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
or put a brake pad on which is taught in
 
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
in in the CTE Center yeah so can we can
 
00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
we try find see you know even though I
 
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
that this is the the academic standards
 
00:17:18.029 --> 00:17:18.039 align:start position:0%
are what we identify in 193 e2a right
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
the those those broad learning areas and
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
then they're further defined within
 
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully in the future the curriculum
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
which are in the curriculum Frameworks
 
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
so I I'm I have no problem with the way
 
00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's worded right there as a
 
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
teacher I would love that because
 
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:37.640 align:start position:0%
through a collection of evidence it
 
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
gives me the latitude um and for every
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
competence we have and and if you go to
 
00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
CTE there's a lot of competencies in
 
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
every course and program are we going to
 
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
have some kind of objected test for
 
00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:52.799 align:start position:0%
everything so so I I that's not what I'm
 
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
saying and I think there there may be a
 
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
section in here that applies to CTE
 
00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:01.799 align:start position:0%
there's certainly a section on page um
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh starting on page 17 that applies to
 
00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.549 align:start position:0%
uh starting on page 17 that applies to
assessment

00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:10.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
and and I don't know if if adding that
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
new language on page two through a
 
00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:17.919 align:start position:0%
collection of evidence is something that
 
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
that bears on the assessment part of
 
00:18:24.669 --> 00:18:24.679 align:start position:0%
everything or I I I just don't know it
 
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:28.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't there in any of the early drafts
 
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:31.240 align:start position:0%
and so so so I'm not quite sure what U
 
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:33.640 align:start position:0%
what the I mean does the department can
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
the department comment on the rationale
 
00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:40.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:44.149 --> 00:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
in the department is here today um
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
is I think I think it probably
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
accomplishes what I've been trying to
 
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
say up here but is there somebody from
 
00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:53.919 align:start position:0%
the Department would like to speak to
 
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
yeah come on up please you can put three
 
00:18:58.149 --> 00:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
chairs up there if you have three of you
 
00:18:58.159 --> 00:19:00.190 align:start position:0%
chairs up there if you have three of you
or

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
are you just going to put your boss up
 
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the record Frank ad
 
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Education uh Julie Shay
 
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:14.200 align:start position:0%
administrative rules coordinator for the
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and so do you
 
00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:17.799 align:start position:0%
just want to explain where you believe
 
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
this language came from sure um after
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
the initial proposal was um submitted be
 
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
and before or during public comment and
 
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
before public comment we met with a
 
00:19:32.029 --> 00:19:32.039 align:start position:0%
group of stakeholders and who had
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
changes that they wanted to make to the
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
proposal so that group of stakeholders
 
00:19:36.669 --> 00:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
just to be clear so included the
 
00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
superintendent Association members of
 
00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:42.520 align:start position:0%
this the um task force and the uh Megan
 
00:19:47.549 --> 00:19:47.559 align:start position:0%
Tuttle from the Nea and um one of the um
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
one of the suggested language changes
 
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
that came through that was adding
 
00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:53.480 align:start position:0%
through a collection of evidence to the
 
00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
achievement of competencies in
 
00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
Competency Based learning that
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
collection of evidence is one of the key
 
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
factors in determining the achievement
 
00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
of competencies which can include so
 
00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:06.039 align:start position:0%
what well and actually so one of the
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
things in a lot of the definitions when
 
00:20:09.149 --> 00:20:09.159 align:start position:0%
we were working through those initial
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
drafts the definitions were more about
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
process than they were about what the
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
thing was like so initially the proposal
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
said achievement of competencies means a
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
student has demonstrated competencies as
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
a proficient level that is achievement
 
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
of competencies through a collection of
 
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
evidence which was requested by the Nea
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
and uh other and the nhsaa and other
 
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in that group is more
 
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
processed but we didn't think it harmed
 
00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
the the definition I think that's
 
00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:35.720 align:start position:0%
probably why it's
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
included okay thanks I think that's
 
00:20:39.549 --> 00:20:39.559 align:start position:0%
that's it's helpful to have these
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
explanations because this isn't
 
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
something that uh that um that we saw on
 
00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
on June 27th and in fact there wasn't
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
anybody here from the Department on June
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
27th to help help us sip through um
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
through that material so I I appreciate
 
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
that very much so then then my a
 
00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up question to that if I might
 
00:21:02.669 --> 00:21:02.679 align:start position:0%
would be does does
 
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
that or I guess would would would this
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
part of the rule be characterized as an
 
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:11.720 align:start position:0%
as an academic
 
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
standard I think that that would be
 
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
difficult to do I would say no okay and
 
00:21:18.909 --> 00:21:18.919 align:start position:0%
and why is that because it's not an
 
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
academic standard it is a definition of
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
achievement of
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
competencies okay and and the definition
 
00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
of an academic standard is in statute
 
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
and I it out earlier and that's what
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
you're referring to is that correct
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
that's correct if you go to uh 3062 a it
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
says academic standards means academic
 
00:21:39.149 --> 00:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
standards has to find in RSA 193 E2
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
a6b correct thank
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the committee
 
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
we could move I think that's helpful
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much you might as
 
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
well hang loose there if we have some
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
other okay let's get on the page two of
 
00:22:03.269 --> 00:22:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of this is similar to the
 
00:22:06.909 --> 00:22:06.919 align:start position:0%
discussion we just
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
had um curriculum is definitely
 
00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
something we talked about in the past
 
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
and that's of course defined in RSA 193
 
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.870 align:start position:0%
and that's of course defined in RSA 193
e2a

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
e2a
 
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:19.350 align:start position:0%
e2a
6C

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
um uh Mr chair what is the is the red
 
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
underline is that new since the February
 
00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:29.559 align:start position:0%
15th draft or is that new since
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh yes so the initial proposal um once
 
00:22:37.149 --> 00:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
that has been um submitted um all of
 
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
those changes are accepted and then we
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
kind of start with a new draft of you
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
know everything's accepted from the
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
initial proposal so everything that is
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
read here has been added since um we
 
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
received public comment and all that so
 
00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:53.799 align:start position:0%
this is all new this reflects public
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
comment and jail car feedback okay okay
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks so so um
 
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
so not everything in in U let me let me
 
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
say it another way some of the things
 
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
that that are not in red may still be
 
00:23:08.909 --> 00:23:08.919 align:start position:0%
changes from existing law I mean
 
00:23:08.919 --> 00:23:10.110 align:start position:0%
changes from existing law I mean
existing

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
existing
 
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
rules yes that could be um could have
 
00:23:15.149 --> 00:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
been a change in the first draft but
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
that's since been accepted and it is now
 
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
part of this proposal and it's not
 
00:23:21.549 --> 00:23:21.559 align:start position:0%
considered new text anymore but it could
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
be different from what's currently in
 
00:23:25.269 --> 00:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
the rules okay and when you talk about
 
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:27.640 align:start position:0%
accepted I'm I'm just I just want to
 
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
understand I'm just talking about track
 
00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:31.799 align:start position:0%
changes like are accepting track Chang
 
00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
no thank you very
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
much so yes represent cordelli thank you
 
00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
um thank you both for uh helping us out
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
here um my question was in relation to n
 
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
where Equity is changed to
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
Equitable um but then it uh the last
 
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
part of it the term also includes Equity
 
00:23:58.909 --> 00:23:58.919 align:start position:0%
so we're changing Equity to equitable
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
but also referring to equity so in terms
 
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:07.799 align:start position:0%
of this um what do we mean by Equity
 
00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so this definition applies to both
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
Equitable and equity and the reason for
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
the switch was in one of the places
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
where this terminology was used um some
 
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
garans uh between the state board and
 
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
the uh uh jail car attorneys believe
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
that Equitable was the correct
 
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
grammatical construct and not equity and
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
so they just asked us to reverse those
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
two definitions um but otherwise no
 
00:24:34.269 --> 00:24:34.279 align:start position:0%
changes were made in terms of um you
 
00:24:35.789 --> 00:24:35.799 align:start position:0%
know the content of the definitions
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
because previously it said equity and it
 
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
had that definition and it also means
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
Equitable and they just asked us to flip
 
00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
that around because of where the terms
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
were used so to follow up on that a
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
little bit uh so some of these changes
 
00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
when you mentioned Jael car have gone
 
00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
through let let's say attorney May or
 
00:24:54.269 --> 00:24:54.279 align:start position:0%
some of the others over there correct we
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
were working with Christina and mik so
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
these reflect all of the changes with
 
00:25:03.149 --> 00:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
you not seeing any other hands for page
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
two here let's move to on forward is you
 
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
know three and four I did not I was
 
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:13.240 align:start position:0%
using a yellow marker the other night
 
00:25:14.909 --> 00:25:14.919 align:start position:0%
and I have nothing yellow on those pages
 
00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
no Mr chair sorry yeah I'm I'm I still
 
00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:20.360 align:start position:0%
I'm on page two okay
 
00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
where on on um on the rule of
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
30601 applicability
 
00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:35.240 align:start position:0%
uh down at the uh 3061 C references Ed
 
00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:38.039 align:start position:0%
rules 30620 and
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
30621 and um and those I believe
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
are are those is that curriculum um so
 
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559 align:start position:0%
you might not have the right draft then
 
00:25:51.149 --> 00:25:51.159 align:start position:0%
because that did get changed at the
 
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
meeting and it should say 30621 and
 
00:25:59.789 --> 00:25:59.799 align:start position:0%
30622 which refers to the through eight
 
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
um minimum approval standards and then
 
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
the graduation
 
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
requirements okay so that's not so so
 
00:26:10.389 --> 00:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be 21 and 22 correct on
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
30621 which I think is on page 19 of the
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
handout kindergarten through grade 8
 
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
so I I guess my the same question I have
 
00:26:40.909 --> 00:26:40.919 align:start position:0%
before um is is 21 and 22 an academic
 
00:26:44.029 --> 00:26:44.039 align:start position:0%
standard and are are 21 and 22 academic
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
standards and by incorporation into
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
30601 does 30601 therefore become an
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
academic standard yeah so they would not
 
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
be considered academic standards so so
 
00:26:59.549 --> 00:26:59.559 align:start position:0%
306 21 and 22 are not academic standards
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
that's correct now all right and could
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
you explain the rationale for that oh
 
00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
because the definition of academic
 
00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
standards is RSA 193 E2 A- you know 6B
 
00:27:12.269 --> 00:27:12.279 align:start position:0%
which I can read the definition if you
 
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
don't have it yeah I've got it right
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
here means what a student should know
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
and be able to do in a course or at each
 
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
grade level right so so
 
00:27:23.549 --> 00:27:23.559 align:start position:0%
30621 kindergarten through grade eight
 
00:27:23.559 --> 00:27:25.669 align:start position:0%
30621 kindergarten through grade eight
School

00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
School
 
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
curriculum so I I'm I'm on that page
 
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:30.200 align:start position:0%
page two with your page 19 right at the
 
00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
base yeah uh the local school board
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
shall require that in each school there
 
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
is an elementary school curriculum and
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
the curriculum must be aligned with the
 
00:27:42.669 --> 00:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
academic standards which are reflected
 
00:27:44.269 --> 00:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
in the curriculum
 
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
Frameworks uh maybe it would have been
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
wiser you know not wiser but you know
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
helpful uh if we aligned to State
 
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
academic standards located in the
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks that outlines
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
District competencies and going you know
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
so making a reference that the
 
00:28:03.669 --> 00:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks and as I mentioned
 
00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
at the very start of this meeting that I
 
00:28:08.509 --> 00:28:08.519 align:start position:0%
I understand the academic standards to
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
be now located properly in the
 
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
Frameworks which are serve as a
 
00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
guideline for our schools yeah I mean so
 
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
you have the academic standards and the
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
framework is just the vessel in which
 
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
those are held
 
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'm still trying to understand
 
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
why why 21 and 22 are not academic
 
00:28:33.789 --> 00:28:33.799 align:start position:0%
standards and are not subject to the um
 
00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
um recommendations these are referencing
 
00:28:40.389 --> 00:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
course you know course courses basically
 
00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
um and academic standards means what a
 
00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
student should know and do and if you
 
00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
look at those academic standards it
 
00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
enumerates specifically what a student
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
should be able to know and do so um
 
00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
00:28:50.279 --> 00:28:52.950 align:start position:0%
that's the
difference

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
so you can have academic standards in
 
00:28:59.389 --> 00:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
one location and curriculum in another
 
00:29:00.669 --> 00:29:00.679 align:start position:0%
location in the
 
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
school and when we look at Improvement
 
00:29:05.149 --> 00:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
and assessment we're measuring whether
 
00:29:07.509 --> 00:29:07.519 align:start position:0%
that curriculum is aligned with the
 
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
academic standards we know in some
 
00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
places curriculum is not aligned with
 
00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:14.120 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
standards uh and so they are separate
 
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
that you have curriculum you have
 
00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
instruction you have assessment and the
 
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
and it's the driver of the whole machine
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
is your academic standard
 
00:29:31.509 --> 00:29:31.519 align:start position:0%
and so I I I kind of concur here the
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
elementary school curriculum
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
is it it's it's aligned with those
 
00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
standards but it's not it it it's not
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
where you go find those standards you
 
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
develop curriculum from your academic
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
standards or and and I think that's good
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
just to comment on that I mean exactly
 
00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
right like so the curriculum is not the
 
00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
academic standards the you have um
 
00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:58.039 align:start position:0%
academic standards and then the
 
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
curriculum is teaching content aligned
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
to those
 
00:30:04.509 --> 00:30:04.519 align:start position:0%
standards yeah you can have US History
 
00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
taught in one school and the curriculum
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
might may not be the same as it is in
 
00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
school district B right next door but
 
00:30:12.269 --> 00:30:12.279 align:start position:0%
the academic
 
00:30:15.029 --> 00:30:15.039 align:start position:0%
standards have to be reflected in both
 
00:30:16.509 --> 00:30:16.519 align:start position:0%
of those curricul so give me give me an
 
00:30:18.909 --> 00:30:18.919 align:start position:0%
example of what that would be Mr chair
 
00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:20.360 align:start position:0%
where the curriculum's different but the
 
00:30:23.669 --> 00:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
academic standards the same well we used
 
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
to have can I it's helpful I mean like a
 
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
simple example is like we've got our
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
Common Core math and Ela standards um so
 
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
those are our academic standards Common
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
Core Ela standards and Common Core
 
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
Mathematics standards but we have a
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
number of English language arts
 
00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:40.120 align:start position:0%
curriculum used throughout the state
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
we've got a number of math curricula
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
used throughout the state which really
 
00:30:46.509 --> 00:30:46.519 align:start position:0%
goes to the very heart of you know the
 
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:48.200 align:start position:0%
education system which I've shared with
 
00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
this committee before right so part of
 
00:30:55.149 --> 00:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
193e one Roman numeral 2 you know school
 
00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
districts then have the responsibility
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
and flexibility in developing diverse
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
educational approaches to instruction
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
and curriculum tailor to meet their
 
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
students needs right so we're telling
 
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
them um in statute uh that these are the
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
academic standards but they are to
 
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
implement curriculum that aligns to
 
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
those standards but they have a lot of
 
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
latitude and flexibility in implementing
 
00:31:16.509 --> 00:31:16.519 align:start position:0%
a standard that's going to meet the
 
00:31:18.029 --> 00:31:18.039 align:start position:0%
educational needs of their community and
 
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
their students well Mr commissioner I
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
mean this I think is exactly what I'm
 
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
saying that when we when you when you
 
00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:28.039 align:start position:0%
look at rule 30621
 
00:31:30.909 --> 00:31:30.919 align:start position:0%
starting on page 19 and let me take it
 
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
through Page 20 down towards the bottom
 
00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:35.519 align:start position:0%
of 20 the local school board shall
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
distribute instructional uh time to
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
allow each student to make progression
 
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
towards Proficiency in competency in the
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
following areas so we're in the section
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
of kindergarten through grade 8 school
 
00:31:48.629 --> 00:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
curriculum and we're talking about Arts
 
00:31:50.509 --> 00:31:50.519 align:start position:0%
education including music and visual
 
00:31:53.789 --> 00:31:53.799 align:start position:0%
arts is in there so why wouldn't that be
 
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
an academic standard if an academic
 
00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
standard is what a student should know
 
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
Arts education including music and
 
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
visual arts and be able to do in a
 
00:32:06.269 --> 00:32:06.279 align:start position:0%
course or at each grade level
 
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
kindergarten through grade 8 school
 
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
curriculum is the um is the section
 
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
title for that for rule 21 and I think
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
something similar for why isn't that an
 
00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:18.039 align:start position:0%
academic standard so with all due
 
00:32:19.789 --> 00:32:19.799 align:start position:0%
respect it's a bit of a silly um
 
00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:23.519 align:start position:0%
construct art is a Content area so if
 
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:27.320 align:start position:0%
for example we just said and the limit
 
00:32:30.149 --> 00:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
of any input to the local districts was
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
that students should learn have Arts
 
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
education program and we didn't provide
 
00:32:36.149 --> 00:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
any academic standards for that then
 
00:32:37.509 --> 00:32:37.519 align:start position:0%
that would mean that there would be we
 
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
have not weighed in on what kind of
 
00:32:41.389 --> 00:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
instruction we want the students to be
 
00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:44.200 align:start position:0%
able to uh understand with respect to
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
Arts education so this is a Content area
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
only it's not a
 
00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:53.320 align:start position:0%
standard so content areas um learning
 
00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:56.440 align:start position:0%
areas learning areas content areas so so
 
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
this goes back to 193 e2a that lists um
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
all the different content areas
 
00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
including a couple that were just or the
 
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
learning areas because that's the
 
00:33:06.909 --> 00:33:06.919 align:start position:0%
definition of Statute correct thank you
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
for correcting me so uh in in e2a and we
 
00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
recently added well we put personal
 
00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:16.120 align:start position:0%
financial personal finance literacy and
 
00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
we juggled around a little bit social
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
studies we added in yeah so is isn't
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
that isn't that precisely the area that
 
00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature is looking to protect
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
when it comes to these rules reflecting
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
on on um on making sure that uh that the
 
00:33:38.669 --> 00:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
rules for um for for our public schools
 
00:33:41.789 --> 00:33:41.799 align:start position:0%
are in fact consistent with the um the
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
these core areas outlined in3 e2a
 
00:33:48.629 --> 00:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
because the legislature doesn't get into
 
00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
you know here is all the curriculum
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
here's the the you know the subject on
 
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
you know Martin Luther King and here's
 
00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
how you're supposed to teach that and
 
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
Abraham Lincoln we're not getting into
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
that in um in law so the academic
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
standards in statute are sufficiently
 
00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
high to be to be you know laid out in
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
193 e2a and that that clearly is what
 
00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
the what the legislature is talking
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
about when it talks about academic
 
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
standards means what a stu student
 
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
should know and be able to do in a
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
course or at each grade level because
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
the the law doesn't specify uh curricul
 
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
um the law doesn't specify you know how
 
00:34:33.149 --> 00:34:33.159 align:start position:0%
to you know you know what the deter what
 
00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
the cutline is for um for proficiency
 
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
the law doesn't specify that but it's
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
clear that the law in in 193 C8 which
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
establishes this committee 193 e2a for
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
um uh CND d uh how this committee
 
00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
actually has a responsibility in the
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
development and recommendation of rules
 
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
prior to going to the board and and that
 
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
that responsibility is limited to the
 
00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.670 align:start position:0%
that responsibility is limited to the
academic

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
academic
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
standards that are um that that clearly
 
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
are are laid out 193 e2a um uh in
 
00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
statute and that anything that's going
 
00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
to be you know jiggling around how um uh
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
rules that touch on those that I think
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
it's clear Mr chair that that falls
 
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
within the purview of this committee to
 
00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
to review recommend um subject to our so
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
so with all due respect I you know I
 
00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:35.800 align:start position:0%
think if you look at 4 a um it says like
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
the minimum standard for public school
 
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
approval and the areas identified in
 
00:35:40.109 --> 00:35:40.119 align:start position:0%
paragraph one where are you now Mr
 
00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
commission I'm 193 e2a okay Roman numer
 
00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
4 a right and essentially this is where
 
00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
we Define in adequate education um and
 
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
you've defined the stat the legislature
 
00:35:52.109 --> 00:35:52.119 align:start position:0%
has defined the learning areas of which
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
these are the learning areas and we have
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
married the language in these rules to
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
the statute for the learning areas and
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
they're they're termed learning areas
 
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
these are not termed uh you know
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
academic standards they're in statute
 
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
they're called learning areas academic
 
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
standards does show up over ver on to as
 
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
you pointed out in C you know the State
 
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
Board should not amend any existing
 
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
academic standards those acade it's and
 
00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
just by virtue of the fact that the
 
00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
statute specifies it it's clear that
 
00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
this list is not the academic standards
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
academic standards are something else I
 
00:36:26.349 --> 00:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
have Arts academic standards in the
 
00:36:28.349 --> 00:36:28.359 align:start position:0%
framework as represent lad has pointed
 
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
out so so so let me
 
00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.470 align:start position:0%
out so so so let me
be

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:44.109 --> 00:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
30621 was gutted I I'm not proposing
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
this but let's just say it was
 
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
completely hollowed out that didn't
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
require Child Development learning in
 
00:36:52.109 --> 00:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
all domains physical sour cognitive
 
00:36:54.309 --> 00:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
language didn't require direct child
 
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
directed experience movement creative
 
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
expression remember we're talking about
 
00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:00.839 align:start position:0%
K8 through here didn't include Arts
 
00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
education music Visual Arts didn't
 
00:37:04.829 --> 00:37:04.839 align:start position:0%
include English language arts and
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
reading didn't include health and
 
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
wellness education or phys physical
 
00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
education or digital literacy or math
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
I'm literally going down all of the
 
00:37:17.069 --> 00:37:17.079 align:start position:0%
areas in in
 
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
30621 and I think there's a parallel in
 
00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:23.480 align:start position:0%
30622 physical education dig digital
 
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
literacy Math Science Social Studies
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
including Civics and Holocaust and
 
00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
genocide education that this could all
 
00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:32.200 align:start position:0%
be hollowed out by the by the state
 
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
board and that wouldn't be subject to
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
this oversight committee is that what
 
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
you're saying I'm not sure I understand
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
the hypothetical question no no it's
 
00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:42.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a very clear question if
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
modification to
 
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
30621 is not subject to to this
 
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
committee then what what you're saying
 
00:37:51.069 --> 00:37:51.079 align:start position:0%
is that the State Board could do
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
whatever it wants with
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
30621 I'm suggesting that that's not
 
00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.710 align:start position:0%
30621 I'm suggesting that that's not
correct

00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:37:59.910 --> 00:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
almost everything in 30621 is actually
 
00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
directly from statute so it's all yeah
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
I'm in so this what we did we had there
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
used to be in the previous rule proposal
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
there were items that were enumerated in
 
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
this list that were not included in
 
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
statute and the O that from previous
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
rule proposals and the OLS attorneys
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
asked us to remove those because they
 
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
were not enumerated in statute yeah and
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
and and I'm I'm I'm not taking a um a
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
position opposed to
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
30621 I'm just trying to understand why
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
30621 or why any changes to 30621 are
 
00:38:40.349 --> 00:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
not subject to this committee's
 
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
oversight okay let me just reference
 
00:38:46.589 --> 00:38:46.599 align:start position:0%
back to what we did last year and that
 
00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the bill which we had
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
which was 1107 which dealt with the
 
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:53.240 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks but that also
 
00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
amended the section of law which is RSA
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
186 col1
 
00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:00.079 align:start position:0%
and it got down in Roman five and then
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
we looked at ABC and on down curriculum
 
00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
is defined there and curriculum means
 
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
lessons and academic content taught in
 
00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
school or in a specific course or
 
00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
program then D was added that's the
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
curriculum framework and I can remember
 
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
us holding it up because we wanted to
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
get a real good definition for that it
 
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839 align:start position:0%
says curriculum framework means an
 
00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:26.440 align:start position:0%
organized plan of study that serves as a
 
00:39:28.349 --> 00:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
guide and reference to what New
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students should know and be
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
able to do in a learning area and
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
identifies the academic standards
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
aligned with each learning area pursuant
 
00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:43.480 align:start position:0%
to RSA 193 193 E2
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
A1A um so the the responsibility for
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
curriculum and curriculum developments
 
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
totally that of the local school
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
board and instruction as well
 
00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
but they are required to ensure that
 
00:40:03.069 --> 00:40:03.079 align:start position:0%
that curriculum that they're adopting
 
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
and approving in that school district is
 
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
align with the academic standards this
 
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
is primarily the reason why this was put
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
forward because we know that may not in
 
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
fact be happening everywhere and if
 
00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a Statewide
 
00:40:22.109 --> 00:40:22.119 align:start position:0%
assessment which is built around those
 
00:40:24.829 --> 00:40:24.839 align:start position:0%
academic standards then we want to make
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
sure that instruction curriculum and
 
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
assessment are all aligned so that we're
 
00:40:35.309 --> 00:40:35.319 align:start position:0%
assessing what should be taught and so
 
00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
uh you know I I think we're on the we're
 
00:40:40.349 --> 00:40:40.359 align:start position:0%
going in the right direction now uh
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
because I I'm I'm a total believer that
 
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
curriculum is a local responsibility
 
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
instruction is also how you teach
 
00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:48.839 align:start position:0%
something it's up to the teacher in the
 
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
classroom and the school district we're
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
in we're in the same page Mr chair what
 
00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
what with what you're just saying there
 
00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm just putting it out that
 
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
that that if if in the the rules that
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
implement the minimum standards for
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
public school approval
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
um if they point to um to things that
 
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
are academic standards such as such as
 
00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:19.720 align:start position:0%
um assessment um you know what a student
 
00:41:22.829 --> 00:41:22.839 align:start position:0%
should know at a grade level or content
 
00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:25.720 align:start position:0%
areas um uh through curriculum
 
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
Frameworks which clearly
 
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
Implement a a a curriculum sequence
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
consistent with academic standards if if
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
these rules rely or lean up against um
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
uh the frame the curriculum Frameworks
 
00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
then then then these rules therefore
 
00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:51.640 align:start position:0%
incorporate academic standard into them
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
and what I'm suggesting is that if
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
if the reliance on on those more
 
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
specific academic standards such as
 
00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
assessment such
 
00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
as um um a curriculum framework if those
 
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.109 align:start position:0%
as um um a curriculum framework if those
were

00:42:08.109 --> 00:42:08.119 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
removed then then then that would be a
 
00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
that would be an issue for this or those
 
00:42:16.109 --> 00:42:16.119 align:start position:0%
were changed then that would be an issue
 
00:42:16.119 --> 00:42:17.990 align:start position:0%
were changed then that would be an issue
um

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh a matter for this for this committee
 
00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
I believe we've even strengthened the
 
00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:27.160 align:start position:0%
process by taking it from rules and put
 
00:42:28.349 --> 00:42:28.359 align:start position:0%
putting it in
 
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
statute uh so now we're no longer going
 
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
to be you um putting all these things in
 
00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
their individual little groups and
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
there's it's a shared responsibility of
 
00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
the state but it's also so we don't Silo
 
00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
curriculum we don't Silo instruction we
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
don't Silo assessment they they're
 
00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
overlapping but there in order for us in
 
00:42:58.030 --> 00:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
and so that there is some direction that
 
00:43:00.309 --> 00:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
this state has the academic standards
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
have be made at the state
 
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
level um so so what what does this
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
committee have responsibility over well
 
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
we have responsibility to ensure that
 
00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
the the Department's not going to change
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
those learning areas without having
 
00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
approval from the general
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
court that that is so I think that's
 
00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
correct like you are defining what is in
 
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
adequate education so you're enumerating
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
that list and we've had to try we've
 
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
tried in these rules to have Fidelity to
 
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
that list and then I would point you to
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
the other statute that you referenced
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education should not
 
00:43:37.549 --> 00:43:37.559 align:start position:0%
amend any academic standard so if we
 
00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
decide to amend an academic standard um
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
you know uh shall not approve any new
 
00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
academic expence without prior review
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
and recommendations from this
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee so um if
 
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
we were to come and say to you we want
 
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:53.640 align:start position:0%
to modify the Arts academic standards um
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
we would come to you for review and
 
00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.549 align:start position:0%
we would come to you for review and
recommendation

00:43:57.549 --> 00:43:57.559 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
um you know we so we would seek we would
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
deliberately seek your input with
 
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
respect to that but that's not the same
 
00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
as referencing uh you know this
 
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
here I think we're conflating two things
 
00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
okay so so U so basically what I'm
 
00:44:17.309 --> 00:44:17.319 align:start position:0%
hearing you say is
 
00:44:17.319 --> 00:44:18.910 align:start position:0%
hearing you say is
if

00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:20.990 align:start position:0%
if
if

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
30621 was hollowed out I mean I'm not
 
00:44:26.349 --> 00:44:26.359 align:start position:0%
suggesting it I'm not suggesting that
 
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
that's been done
 
00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:34.839 align:start position:0%
30621 that that clearly reference things
 
00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
that are more specific in terms of their
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
academic nature um to it the curriculum
 
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
Frameworks and things like that um if uh
 
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
if this was changed wouldn't matter
 
00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be subject to the um the review
 
00:44:49.829 --> 00:44:49.839 align:start position:0%
and recommendation of this committee is
 
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
that correct again I'm not sure I
 
00:44:52.549 --> 00:44:52.559 align:start position:0%
understand the question if you want to
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
try and clarify that uh I so if if uh if
 
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
this if this committee were to
 
00:45:05.309 --> 00:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
eliminate not this committee if um if if
 
00:45:09.549 --> 00:45:09.559 align:start position:0%
if if a proposed rule was to um
 
00:45:09.559 --> 00:45:13.510 align:start position:0%
if if a proposed rule was to um
eliminate

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.549 --> 00:45:17.559 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at paragraph H in
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
30621 where it talks about social
 
00:45:22.109 --> 00:45:22.119 align:start position:0%
studies including Civics number one and
 
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
number two Holocaust and genocide
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
education if um if if you were putting
 
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
forth a draft rule that eliminated H
 
00:45:32.109 --> 00:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be subject to the review
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
of this committee is that
 
00:45:36.829 --> 00:45:36.839 align:start position:0%
right so again I just I I'm prefer not
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
to play hypothetical we think that this
 
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
rule proposal has Fidelity to the law
 
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
let me just go reference the statute
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
e2a part 4 Roman 4 C the State Board
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
shall not amend any existing academic
 
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
standards and shall not approve any new
 
00:46:04.589 --> 00:46:04.599 align:start position:0%
academic standards without the prior so
 
00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:06.680 align:start position:0%
amend or approve yeah so again I don't
 
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
think that that statute applies here
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
because we're not talking about academic
 
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
standards I think you would be back on
 
00:46:15.069 --> 00:46:15.079 align:start position:0%
statute Roman numeral 4A as opposed to
 
00:46:18.349 --> 00:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
where you were um you know and I'm
 
00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
reading uh you know the general cour
 
00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:24.510 align:start position:0%
reading uh you know the general cour
periodical

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:26.839 align:start position:0%
frequently uh changes made by the board
 
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
of of Education to the school approval
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
standards referring to the list in 193
 
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:37.240 align:start position:0%
E21 right so for example and so if we
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
change that list like say the State
 
00:46:41.309 --> 00:46:41.319 align:start position:0%
Board of Education came along it says
 
00:46:42.829 --> 00:46:42.839 align:start position:0%
they want to
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
include uh you know square dancing as a
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
part of an adequate education not and
 
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
not included as an arts program like the
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
the the State Board of Education I don't
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
believe has the ability to add items to
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
what is required for adequate education
 
00:46:59.950 --> 00:46:59.960 align:start position:0%
okay no I I appreciate that commissioner
 
00:47:02.549 --> 00:47:02.559 align:start position:0%
and um but but again going back and I
 
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate it's hard to answer
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
hypothetical questions but but if if if
 
00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:13.480 align:start position:0%
H was removed from 30621 so the part I
 
00:47:14.589 --> 00:47:14.599 align:start position:0%
just said social studies including
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
Civics and Holocaust and genocide
 
00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
education if that was removed from
 
00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
30621 how would the framework or the
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
academic standards then be Tethered to
 
00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
the the rules for minimum for the
 
00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
minimum rules for school approval how
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
are those even even incorporated into
 
00:47:35.069 --> 00:47:35.079 align:start position:0%
the rules for school approval How could
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
a school be approved if the academic
 
00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:41.079 align:start position:0%
standards are floating over here
 
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere without any tether to to um
 
00:47:47.549 --> 00:47:47.559 align:start position:0%
the rules that are in front of the
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
proposed rules that are in front of
 
00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
that's why you have social studies
 
00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the curriculum through
 
00:47:55.349 --> 00:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
grade 8 school curriculum there in Ed
 
00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
30621 social studies is now mentioned
 
00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
it's a learning area that you must
 
00:48:04.109 --> 00:48:04.119 align:start position:0%
include in your curriculum in this
 
00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
school I I get that but if it were if it
 
00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
outes something that's subject to this
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
committee's review and recommendation so
 
00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative L I think it's a it's a
 
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:17.240 align:start position:0%
it's a I don't think it's a legit it's a
 
00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:19.480 align:start position:0%
it's a logically flawed analogy in the
 
00:48:21.549 --> 00:48:21.559 align:start position:0%
sense that even if the State Board of
 
00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:24.200 align:start position:0%
Education removed that from here and I'm
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
not sure where we're going with this
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
conversation truthfully but if they were
 
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
to remove that that would not eliminate
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
the requirement for schools to be
 
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
teaching that it would eliminate that
 
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
from this rule but it remains social
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
studies remains in statute you know the
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
the academic standards you know remains
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
in statute um you know those
 
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
requirements haven't gone away simply
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
because something has come out of this
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
rule so I'm not sure what the I don't
 
00:48:51.549 --> 00:48:51.559 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure where we're going with this
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
conversation yeah yeah to to me it's all
 
00:48:56.349 --> 00:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
it's connected and so there's there's
 
00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
rules that we're looking at in here that
 
00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
I think relate to clearly to
 
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
non-academic areas and and you know you
 
00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:06.920 align:start position:0%
know temperature inside a building or
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
something like that I mean I don't know
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
um but there's there's other rules in
 
00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:14.680 align:start position:0%
here that clearly lean on on academic
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
minimum standards and by leaning on an
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
academic minimum AC an academic standard
 
00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:24.839 align:start position:0%
that's over here doesn't doesn't that
 
00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:27.160 align:start position:0%
also incorporate that academic standard
 
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
into the rule that's really what I'm
 
00:49:31.309 --> 00:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
getting at here and I'm not I'm not
 
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
suggesting that every rule here is
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
subject to the the review and
 
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation authority of this
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
committee but I believe that some of
 
00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:43.960 align:start position:0%
them are and and I believe that 20 and
 
00:49:47.789 --> 00:49:47.799 align:start position:0%
21 and 22 at least are and the reason
 
00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
we've jumped to 21 and 22 is because
 
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
they were referred to in
 
00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:55.839 align:start position:0%
30601 um or something like that yeah so
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
so I disagree I think we have Fidelity
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
to the statute in this rule proposal and
 
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
so um I understand thank you for
 
00:50:04.349 --> 00:50:04.359 align:start position:0%
explaining kind of the hypothetical that
 
00:50:05.789 --> 00:50:05.799 align:start position:0%
your model that you're constructing
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
there um you know but I think that this
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
approach that we have taken has Fidelity
 
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:50:12.839 --> 00:50:14.589 align:start position:0%
to the
statute

00:50:14.589 --> 00:50:14.599 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:24.040 align:start position:0%
chair just in in my thinking if um the
 
00:50:27.549 --> 00:50:27.559 align:start position:0%
state board was to eliminate h um
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
they're not eliminating it from statute
 
00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:33.640 align:start position:0%
it's in statute so um uh I don't think
 
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
it's uh going to eliminate social
 
00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
studies from our classrooms because it
 
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
it remains in
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
statute but you got to remember the
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
purpose behind what we have in front of
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
us are these the minimum standards for
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
public school approval if I'm coming
 
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
from the Department I'm going out and
 
00:50:52.109 --> 00:50:52.119 align:start position:0%
looking at District a here and they have
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
no social studies being taught in there
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
and they're not going to get our
 
00:50:59.670 --> 00:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
approval seeing that it's in these yeah
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
they're violating basic statute right
 
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
but they're also not complying with the
 
00:51:07.589 --> 00:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
rules for what your curriculum must
 
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
include right and and and I I agree with
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair um but
 
00:51:15.309 --> 00:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
but the
 
00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
only so what what you what you the way I
 
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
interpret what you what you say is that
 
00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
is that is that changes to this rule
 
00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
would be subject to our
 
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation see what if if it's if
 
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
it's if in fact we're here to approve
 
00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
today the minimum standards of public
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
school approval we're not we're here to
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
review these in terms of academic
 
00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
standards uh maybe in another
 
00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839 align:start position:0%
week when September one the new law goes
 
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
into effect where we're incorporating
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee has the
 
00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:53.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility for minimum standards
 
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
Public School approval it might be a a
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
different B game because because you're
 
00:51:58.990 --> 00:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
looking at everything within the minimum
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
standards for public school approval and
 
00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:02.559 align:start position:0%
can I just one other comment I want to
 
00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
make so representative I'm more and more
 
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
understanding kind of what you're
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
talking about here but if if I look at
 
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
so I assume you're on page 21 where
 
00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
you're saying take out social studies as
 
00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
an example yeah but understand that that
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
is qualified it it's embedded in one
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
right and it's embedded in C and so
 
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
we're not by this rule we're not telling
 
00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
them they have to teach social studies
 
00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
what we're telling them is a local
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
school board shall distribute
 
00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
instructional time to allow each student
 
00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
to make progression towards proficiency
 
00:52:33.069 --> 00:52:33.079 align:start position:0%
and competencies in the following areas
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
right so that's not we're not like
 
00:52:38.789 --> 00:52:38.799 align:start position:0%
eliminating that I mean to to
 
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
representative cordell's point is in
 
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
eliminating the requirement for social
 
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
studies that's in the law you know and
 
00:52:46.589 --> 00:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
then you know for Elementary grades 1
 
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
through eight where no middle school has
 
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
been established by vote of the local
 
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
school board these are those areas that
 
00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
we want them Distributing instructional
 
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
time so that students are able to make
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
progress in those areas so that's what
 
00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
that is saying right if I read the rule
 
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
that's what's being referenced there
 
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
so rep and cordelli yes isn't this more
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
um for social States more process
 
00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:17.720 align:start position:0%
related to the statute and that we're
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
saying there has to be instructional
 
00:53:23.789 --> 00:53:23.799 align:start position:0%
time for these content areas in Middle
 
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
School um which is reflective of Statute
 
00:53:31.069 --> 00:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
so it's the process of providing
 
00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
instructional time yeah it's operational
 
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
correct I mean so so that again that's
 
00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:37.640 align:start position:0%
what this is that's where social studies
 
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
is qualified there
 
00:53:42.069 --> 00:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
so okay so what what you're saying if
 
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
I'm if I'm understanding that that that
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
basically the list of of of the the core
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
areas the learning areas in 193 e2a uh
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
for minimum for U as as a as the
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
definition of an adequate education
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
those are what and I agree with this
 
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
these are what what every public school
 
00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
um has to offer this breath of thing
 
00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that every student has to
 
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
take World Language uh because we don't
 
00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
have graduation a State graduation
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
requirement World Language some high
 
00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
schools may have that but um but but a
 
00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:18.680 align:start position:0%
school a public school would have to
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
offer the breadth of that so so I I
 
00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
guess um I'm I'm now thinking that that
 
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
since since it's what a school needs to
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
offer as opposed to what a student um
 
00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:36.760 align:start position:0%
should learn then then are we are we
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
saying that that that there's no
 
00:54:43.109 --> 00:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
coupling of of academic standards to um
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
to minimum School approval because I I
 
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
think if you're if you're if the if the
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
adequate education is um is saying that
 
00:54:54.589 --> 00:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
that yes you must offer World Language
 
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
but but but it's not required
 
00:54:58.510 --> 00:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
that we're not actually saying that a
 
00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:01.960 align:start position:0%
student needs to or or should be able to
 
00:55:03.549 --> 00:55:03.559 align:start position:0%
means what a student should know and be
 
00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
able to do in a course or at each grade
 
00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:09.990 align:start position:0%
able to do in a course or at each grade
level

00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
um you know we're not saying that there
 
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
yes I think you're actually referencing
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
a separate set section of the rules
 
00:55:20.109 --> 00:55:20.119 align:start position:0%
under um Ed
 
00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:25.559 align:start position:0%
306 22 is it 22 um and it basically says
 
00:55:26.829 --> 00:55:26.839 align:start position:0%
uh you know School District shall
 
00:55:28.549 --> 00:55:28.559 align:start position:0%
develop competencies based on State
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
academic standards where applicable for
 
00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:32.559 align:start position:0%
all courses of study school districts
 
00:55:34.349 --> 00:55:34.359 align:start position:0%
may use State model competencies to
 
00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:36.440 align:start position:0%
develop minimal competencies so so I
 
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
think we're getting there but the
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
section that you're referencing I'm not
 
00:55:39.599 --> 00:55:40.670 align:start position:0%
section that you're referencing I'm not
sure

00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:55:45.069 --> 00:55:45.079 align:start position:0%
that is where is is applicable to the
 
00:55:48.029 --> 00:55:48.039 align:start position:0%
conversation that we're having
 
00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
so I think we all share the same goal
 
00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
we're trying to help these kids I
 
00:55:54.549 --> 00:55:54.559 align:start position:0%
appreciate that commissioner um M Mr
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
chair I um Christine Downing who who
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
chair Klein had had leaned on
 
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
substantially at the board meeting had
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
if Christine is it very very brief
 
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
because I want to just keep this between
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
that you know right here because we're
 
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
trying to get through this front half
 
00:56:18.589 --> 00:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
today uh Christine go ahead thank you
 
00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative live um totally will be
 
00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
quick um the only thing I would point
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
out in that language of K through 8
 
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
school curriculum that 21 lead in um is
 
00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:32.200 align:start position:0%
there is there could be confusion around
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
the phrase that outlines District
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
competencies for grades uh 1 through
 
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
eight because that phrase itself that
 
00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
describing phrase it's not clear I think
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
the rule is intending on saying there is
 
00:56:47.069 --> 00:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
an elementary school curriculum that
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
outlines District competencies because
 
00:56:50.829 --> 00:56:50.839 align:start position:0%
in my conversation with the commissioner
 
00:56:53.069 --> 00:56:53.079 align:start position:0%
it's always been the state establishment
 
00:56:54.789 --> 00:56:54.799 align:start position:0%
the State academic standard but we're
 
00:56:57.309 --> 00:56:57.319 align:start position:0%
leaving the development of competencies
 
00:56:59.870 --> 00:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
at the district level but the way it
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
reads one could interpret that it says
 
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
is an elementary school curriculum align
 
00:57:07.789 --> 00:57:07.799 align:start position:0%
to state standards that outline District
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
competencies it could someone could read
 
00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:12.839 align:start position:0%
this and say are the state standards
 
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
outlining the district competencies I I
 
00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:18.799 align:start position:0%
I I would caution you about that phras
 
00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
phrasing because it can open itself um
 
00:57:22.589 --> 00:57:22.599 align:start position:0%
and the other thing I would just point
 
00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:24.200 align:start position:0%
out in the high school
 
00:57:27.069 --> 00:57:27.079 align:start position:0%
conversation is um you do have a little
 
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
bit of a disconnect going what in terms
 
00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:31.640 align:start position:0%
of outlining what an adequate education
 
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
is made up in those learning areas
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
because you got two learning areas in
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
there um logic and rhetoric and personal
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
finance literacy that have no State
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
academic standards so when you have a
 
00:57:44.829 --> 00:57:44.839 align:start position:0%
leading phrase that says you know the
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
local board will you know basically
 
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:49.640 align:start position:0%
establish a curriculum that aligns to
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
State Standards what are you going to
 
00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
tell your high school folks because they
 
00:57:57.390 --> 00:57:57.400 align:start position:0%
don't have state standards in logic and
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
rhetoric and personal finance literacy
 
00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
so you know these are things to think
 
00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
about in the nuances of the
 
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
instumentation and I just want to end
 
00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559 align:start position:0%
with this one comment lots of
 
00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
conversation here about the word
 
00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
curriculum as a practicing curriculum
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
director I I keep it this simp simp
 
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum means these things it's
 
00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:20.680 align:start position:0%
everything put together yes State
 
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
academic standards are part of our
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
curriculum process but a curriculum at a
 
00:58:28.109 --> 00:58:28.119 align:start position:0%
local level does does four things one it
 
00:58:29.829 --> 00:58:29.839 align:start position:0%
tells us what do we want students to
 
00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:31.720 align:start position:0%
know and be able to do that our that's
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
our State academic standards how are we
 
00:58:36.069 --> 00:58:36.079 align:start position:0%
going to measure that student progress
 
00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:37.480 align:start position:0%
that goes back to that collection of
 
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
evidence conversation you had at the
 
00:58:41.549 --> 00:58:41.559 align:start position:0%
beginning third is what are we going to
 
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
do for Stu for all students are typical
 
00:58:45.069 --> 00:58:45.079 align:start position:0%
students so they have learning
 
00:58:47.349 --> 00:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
opportunities and Pathways that support
 
00:58:49.309 --> 00:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
those first two questions and then the
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
fourth question which is where we now
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
build in our intervention systems is
 
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
what do we do for those students who
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
aren't making that progress and how do
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
we interv a full curriculum written at a
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
local level which is why we have that
 
00:59:04.109 --> 00:59:04.119 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks now which is going
 
00:59:06.589 --> 00:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
to get at some more of that Beyond just
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
what the State academic standards do for
 
00:59:11.549 --> 00:59:11.559 align:start position:0%
us that's what a real curriculum
 
00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
implemented at a school level needes so
 
00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to share from a
 
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
practitioner's point of view um and just
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
some of the wording in here you know the
 
00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
friendly amendment I would offer to this
 
00:59:24.589 --> 00:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
leadin statement might be something like
 
00:59:26.910 --> 00:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
the local school board shell require
 
00:59:28.109 --> 00:59:28.119 align:start position:0%
that in each school there's an
 
00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
elementary school curriculum that
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
outlines District competencies for grade
 
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
1 through eight comma align to State
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
academic standards so it's very clear
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
where the competencies are coming from
 
00:59:42.190 --> 00:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
because that's always been a point of
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
confusion in the minimum School approval
 
00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:45.750 align:start position:0%
confusion in the minimum School approval
standards

00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:59:48.589 --> 00:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
is who's making the competencies is it
 
00:59:51.309 --> 00:59:51.319 align:start position:0%
the state or is it the local um that's
 
00:59:54.510 --> 00:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
all I would I would mention on
 
00:59:56.589 --> 00:59:56.599 align:start position:0%
that further disc
 
00:59:59.710 --> 00:59:59.720 align:start position:0%
discussion okay um I I'd like to keep
 
01:00:03.029 --> 01:00:03.039 align:start position:0%
moving along here a little bit I I I had
 
01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:05.240 align:start position:0%
a question though on page
 
01:00:10.029 --> 01:00:10.039 align:start position:0%
seven um and I might as well get on with
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
my question right
 
01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:17.839 align:start position:0%
here um it's on page seven item
 
01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
f for schools with grades k through
 
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
eight the offering of one or more World
 
01:00:27.069 --> 01:00:27.079 align:start position:0%
languages including
 
01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
are you now saying that we have to have
 
01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:37.829 --> 01:00:37.839 align:start position:0%
8 so I believe then there's another spot
 
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to wait for Julie to come
 
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
back up that it isn't a requirement but
 
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
we do know that some of our schools are
 
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
offering World languages in K8 and so
 
01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
we're providing to trying to provide
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
Guidance with respect to that offering
 
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
this the K World
 
01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
languages okay um yes so pre in the
 
01:00:59.309 --> 01:00:59.319 align:start position:0%
previous um in the previous or the
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
current rule I should say there was
 
01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
language that said if a school is going
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
to offer it through K through 8 they
 
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
have to have a policy that outlines what
 
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
that looks like I get that I get that um
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
and so if they're not offering it then
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
they also say that they're they're not
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
required to offer it through so you're
 
01:01:21.549 --> 01:01:21.559 align:start position:0%
not saying you need it okay and we don't
 
01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
have theth it's a choice exactly okay
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
um um on on page six I'm rolling back a
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
little bit because we jumped up to the
 
01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
other end there uh but on the bottom
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
page six has
 
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
30621 basic learning standards
 
01:01:51.269 --> 01:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
include is
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
that see we use the word standards a
 
01:01:58.510 --> 01:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
lot and is it confusing or is are we
 
01:02:00.829 --> 01:02:00.839 align:start position:0%
really trying to say basic teaching in
 
01:02:03.150 --> 01:02:03.160 align:start position:0%
practice and practices
 
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
include these following things like
 
01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.510 align:start position:0%
include these following things like
homework

01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
homework
 
01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
um promoting students from grade level
 
01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
to grade level you know the you know
 
01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
whether you're going to have AP courses
 
01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:17.480 align:start position:0%
or you know career related courses you
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
know all that is is part of the teaching
 
01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
and the implementation practices which
 
01:02:28.029 --> 01:02:28.039 align:start position:0%
we include with then conveying
 
01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
instruction uh and curriculum you can
 
01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
take that word practice back to the um
 
01:02:34.829 --> 01:02:34.839 align:start position:0%
you know the stateboard of Education
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
yeah because learning standards okay now
 
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
what kind of what is a learning standard
 
01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
is it all these things which are you
 
01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
know boy I wish we gave more homework in
 
01:02:47.549 --> 01:02:47.559 align:start position:0%
some of our schools we used to have
 
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
policies on that for every grade level
 
01:02:51.789 --> 01:02:51.799 align:start position:0%
so many more minutes are tacked on that
 
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what this is is the
 
01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
policy that the school board has to have
 
01:02:57.630 --> 01:02:57.640 align:start position:0%
the outline lines what their policy is
 
01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
on homework what their policy on is
 
01:03:01.109 --> 01:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
promoting because this is in the policy
 
01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:03.640 align:start position:0%
section right yeah yeah yeah get
 
01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:10.510 align:start position:0%
section right yeah yeah yeah get
it

01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:13.799 align:start position:0%
righty okay we're we're messing around
 
01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
here up in front of these first Pages as
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
long as we're there I'd like to go to my
 
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
favorite topic Career Technical
 
01:03:34.029 --> 01:03:34.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
30616 okay um item C right in the middle
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
of the page CT Cooperative agreement
 
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
shall require the sending and the
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
receiving school districts to coordinate
 
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
calendars and schedules to maximize
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
students access to CTE programming
 
01:03:53.789 --> 01:03:53.799 align:start position:0%
pursuing to 830 I think it'd be great if
 
01:03:57.150 --> 01:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
you also put in and RSA
 
01:04:02.029 --> 01:04:02.039 align:start position:0%
188e colon 1- a Roman 3 which
 
01:04:05.269 --> 01:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
specifically States what those Regional
 
01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
agreements have to have we put this in
 
01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
the law several uh 13042 is actually the
 
01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:13.240 align:start position:0%
rules that specifically talk about the
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
regional career agreements that went
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
through the process last year so it
 
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
details I know this may be duplicative
 
01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
but it does do any harm
 
01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
to say it again yeah
 
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
um and and and then going down jumping
 
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
down to
 
01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:30.799 align:start position:0%
D I'm getting into things like
 
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort but that's a
 
01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
different topic for today every public
 
01:04:36.029 --> 01:04:36.039 align:start position:0%
high school student shall have access to
 
01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:37.799 align:start position:0%
programs at the regional CTE Center
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
subject to attainment and of
 
01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
prerequisites and space availability
 
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
within the program in the CTE Center and
 
01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
the sending school budget restriction
 
01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
and the sending School District budget
 
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
restrictions we passed in
 
01:04:59.069 --> 01:04:59.079 align:start position:0%
HB one and two an additional $4 million
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
for tuition and
 
01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
transportation we did it in a separate
 
01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
Grant seeing that we didn't want to harm
 
01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
the maintenance of agreement that we had
 
01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
I can remember that discussion with the
 
01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
Senate but um I this is just Rick glad
 
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
speaking right now um I understand space
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
Avail availability that's an issue which
 
01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
we have to do with some of our Capital
 
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
monies prerequisites I understand that
 
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
um but the latter part within the
 
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
program in CT say and the sending school
 
01:05:31.559 --> 01:05:33.269 align:start position:0%
program in CT say and the sending school
budget

01:05:33.269 --> 01:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
restrictions this is one of the reasons
 
01:05:38.349 --> 01:05:38.359 align:start position:0%
why we only have 17% of our kids in CTS
 
01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
because the cost and scheduling in all
 
01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
those other
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
variables we want more kids there we
 
01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
want to double this number so is that
 
01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
last part of the sentence necessary in
 
01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
the sending school budget restrictions
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
if they're if we're restricting then
 
01:06:00.269 --> 01:06:00.279 align:start position:0%
it's up the legislator to do something
 
01:06:00.279 --> 01:06:01.150 align:start position:0%
it's up the legislator to do something
about

01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:01.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:06:03.789 --> 01:06:03.799 align:start position:0%
that right I mean I'm not I I do
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
understand the issue relative to um
 
01:06:07.549 --> 01:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
transportation budget restrictions that
 
01:06:09.789 --> 01:06:09.799 align:start position:0%
may or may not happen um with respect to
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
the $4 million we've had open grants for
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
um reimbursement of tuition for CTE um
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
only at the last time I checked was
 
01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:19.240 align:start position:0%
probably about a month or so ago about
 
01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
600,000 of that had been applied for um
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
so because the other has to be used
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
first before you can apply for
 
01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
well this was any time you had it was it
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
was retroactive if you had an upside
 
01:06:31.789 --> 01:06:31.799 align:start position:0%
down circumstance is the way that you
 
01:06:34.109 --> 01:06:34.119 align:start position:0%
could get reimbursed for that so um but
 
01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:36.200 align:start position:0%
there may be I I can't speak to whether
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
there may be other budget restrictions
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
that would affect um you know that so it
 
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do academic standards
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
it's just a flag that I've caught here
 
01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
that's a rick lad type thing seeing I've
 
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
always been very strong in CT and and
 
01:06:53.230 --> 01:06:53.240 align:start position:0%
the last part under G part one at the
 
01:06:55.829 --> 01:06:55.839 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page there it says the
 
01:06:57.549 --> 01:06:57.559 align:start position:0%
multi-level Career Technical education
 
01:07:01.069 --> 01:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
as defined in Ed 306 in sequential
 
01:07:03.549 --> 01:07:03.559 align:start position:0%
fashion based on curriculum specific
 
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
competencies endorsed by CTE and
 
01:07:08.269 --> 01:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
Business Leaders I'm a little confused
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
and I I I think I may have some
 
01:07:12.549 --> 01:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the way Frank about
 
01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
Business Leaders what what what are yeah
 
01:07:17.269 --> 01:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
so the way that the CTE program works is
 
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
for every one of our programs we have an
 
01:07:21.789 --> 01:07:21.799 align:start position:0%
industry advisory Council um and so we
 
01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:23.799 align:start position:0%
do have for each of our programs we
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
approve um specific specific program
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
competencies for each of the various
 
01:07:29.470 --> 01:07:29.480 align:start position:0%
things whether it's Automotive or
 
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
welding or business or whatever it might
 
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
be um and those are approved both by the
 
01:07:37.069 --> 01:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
either CTE centers as well as by the
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
industry advisory Council who provides
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
input and approves those competencies
 
01:07:44.910 --> 01:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
for each program so a lot of these
 
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
competencies we which we have in centers
 
01:07:49.710 --> 01:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
right now are based upon industry
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
standard correct they mostly they are
 
01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
driven by industry standards because
 
01:07:55.829 --> 01:07:55.839 align:start position:0%
each program is also required to have um
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
you know an IRC and Industry recognized
 
01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
credential and so we're trying to align
 
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
the programs to help the students
 
01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
achieve that you know independently
 
01:08:05.829 --> 01:08:05.839 align:start position:0%
recognize uh you know professional
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
credential when they come through the
 
01:08:08.109 --> 01:08:08.119 align:start position:0%
program so would it be wise to say
 
01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:09.640 align:start position:0%
instead of Business Leaders but and
 
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
aligned with industry standard or
 
01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
something language so we want to align
 
01:08:17.149 --> 01:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
with those
 
01:08:19.870 --> 01:08:19.880 align:start position:0%
standards Which business is yelling for
 
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
us to
 
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
attain and and teach in diesel mechanics
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
two does talk about National Industry
 
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
standards yeah I know it and then also
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
in E prerequisites shall be directly
 
01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
related to a student ability to
 
01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
successfully complete the CT program of
 
01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
core technical competencies vetted by
 
01:08:39.910 --> 01:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
business and industry and post-secondary
 
01:08:43.709 --> 01:08:43.719 align:start position:0%
institutions so um you know we so we're
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
weigh we're leaning heavily and we do
 
01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
rely heavily on our uh industry Partners
 
01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the programming that
 
01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
we're setting up um is what the industry
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
is looking for
 
01:08:58.430 --> 01:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
that's all I had on that page on 15 I
 
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
did have one other issue
 
01:09:04.709 --> 01:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
there uh four uh where it says imple
 
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
implements third-party assessments as
 
01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
recognized and designated by the
 
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
department um when we have like at the
 
01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
center up in Berlin when somebody comes
 
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
in that's uh a welder the the assessment
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
is based upon the National Standard um
 
01:09:26.430 --> 01:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
so are you approving that or as
 
01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:27.910 align:start position:0%
so are you approving that or as
recognized

01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
and designate or approved by the CTE
 
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
Center itself so this is um dealing
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
specifically with industry recognized
 
01:09:37.630 --> 01:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
credentials and we've got a rubric for
 
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
how those are evaluated um there have
 
01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
been instances where we have programs
 
01:09:44.910 --> 01:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
that don't have an industry recognized
 
01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:47.960 align:start position:0%
credential per se um and yet we still do
 
01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
believe that there is a demand for that
 
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
in the space and so when that happens
 
01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
what H we do is we basically put
 
01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
together our own industry recognized
 
01:10:00.189 --> 01:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
credential um by talking to Employers in
 
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
the area in the state and and vetting
 
01:10:05.229 --> 01:10:05.239 align:start position:0%
the program standards and competencies
 
01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
with them saying hey kids who come
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
through this program is this a program
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
that you would be you know want to hire
 
01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
a kid out of um and then what we
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
basically do is have those industries
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
that and those business specific
 
01:10:18.669 --> 01:10:18.679 align:start position:0%
businesses that have approved that to
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
put their logo on a certificate so that
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
that student when they graduate would
 
01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
earn that certificate and they would be
 
01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
able to take that we're trying to give
 
01:10:26.470 --> 01:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
them something portable they could take
 
01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
that to a job interview and say like hey
 
01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
I went graduated from a CTE Center and
 
01:10:33.550 --> 01:10:33.560 align:start position:0%
the five you know uh you know Machining
 
01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
shops in this area have all approved the
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
program that I went through and said
 
01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
that it's a it's a legitimate program
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
and that I've learned the core and the
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
important you know aspects of of
 
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
Machining so so the department is
 
01:10:46.510 --> 01:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
engaging in in recognizing that machine
 
01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
shop or correct so we'll work with them
 
01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:49.640 align:start position:0%
trying to create I don't have an
 
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
industry recognized credential we'll go
 
01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
create one to make sure because again it
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
could be something that's emerging you
 
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
know e bikes are coming out there's not
 
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
an industry industry around ebikes right
 
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of people who want
 
01:11:02.590 --> 01:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
technicians who are able to work on that
 
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
type of technology in the growing space
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
but until the industry catches up with
 
01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
it um we want to make sure that we can
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
continue to give students something
 
01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:13.590 align:start position:0%
continue to give students something
that's

01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:15.950 --> 01:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
portable does the committee have any any
 
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
other areas which we want to look at
 
01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about go ahead on
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
page 17 when you're talking about local
 
01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
assessment and
 
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
accountability and on on the botom
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page there you have a uh
 
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
one and you struck out two you talk
 
01:11:56.030 --> 01:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
about local standard
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
s um provides for ongoing assessment of
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
District competencies and graduation
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
required requirements through the use of
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
local assessments that are aligned with
 
01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
State okay State andw I didn't see State
 
01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
good I yes go ahead I could just ask
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
again about U Back to page 15 um at D on
 
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
the bottom uh talks about um
 
01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of information and it
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
references uh Ed uh
 
01:12:33.709 --> 01:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
1119 that would 1119 would refer to
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
statutory language in that regard I
 
01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
assume yes Ed 1119 is actually special
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
education so it refers to um
 
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
okay are there and looking at
 
01:12:58.510 --> 01:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
at this further here is there any other
 
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
areas that maybe a a Committee Member
 
01:13:04.990 --> 01:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
here wants to look at um has there on
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
page 30 has there been any
 
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
changes um or considerations given by
 
01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.070 align:start position:0%
changes um or considerations given by
the

01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:14.229 --> 01:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
department de I want to talk about
 
01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
mathematics just for a second um of
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
requiring we require now
 
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
three credits or three course you know
 
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
three years and one year embedded math
 
01:13:31.709 --> 01:13:31.719 align:start position:0%
would be embedded in something approved
 
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
by the local board have we thought about
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
when it comes to mathematics going from
 
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
three to four credits at
 
01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
all so I can say that there was
 
01:13:44.629 --> 01:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
substantive conversation about that and
 
01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:48.280 align:start position:0%
in fact if you look on the next page um
 
01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
which is the chart that was proposed by
 
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
initial in the initial proposal yeah um
 
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
they had increased at to 3.5 um and then
 
01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
added including algebraic Concepts and
 
01:14:00.510 --> 01:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
at least a half Credit in statistics and
 
01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
data analysis because the board
 
01:14:03.390 --> 01:14:03.400 align:start position:0%
perceived that that was an area of
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
deficiency um through the public input
 
01:14:09.550 --> 01:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
process uh that was reduced back down to
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
three um you know credits but there was
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
certainly a lot of conversation around
 
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not we needed to increase
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
that and and where that manifests itself
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
we see in the post-secondary world where
 
01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
students perhaps have completed their um
 
01:14:23.790 --> 01:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
you know their math credits by the time
 
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
they're Junior so they maybe are not
 
01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
taking any math credits as a senior
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
other than in an in an embedded type of
 
01:14:31.709 --> 01:14:31.719 align:start position:0%
a way and um as a result of that when
 
01:14:32.830 --> 01:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
they get to their postsecondary
 
01:14:34.149 --> 01:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
opportunities be that the community
 
01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
college system or other postsecondary uh
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're in need of remedial
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
types of uh courses because they of the
 
01:14:44.430 --> 01:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
the length of time between those math
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
experiences they don't like to call them
 
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
remedial cours anymore I know they in
 
01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
betting coquis on specific skill Co yeah
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
requisite um and when I was over at any
 
01:14:58.110 --> 01:14:58.120 align:start position:0%
HTI this last week and working with Math
 
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
teachers from out the state on the math
 
01:15:02.669 --> 01:15:02.679 align:start position:0%
learning communities program there was a
 
01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
lot of chatter about four four
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
credits in mathematics to you know try
 
01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
to you know move the bubble a little bit
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh when kids do go to
 
01:15:20.189 --> 01:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
postsecondary education they're they're
 
01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
equipped with some of the I mean
 
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
relative to these tables there's quite a
 
01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
bit of conversation yeah um at the State
 
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
Board level as well as lots of public
 
01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
input that was all considered as they
 
01:15:30.189 --> 01:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
went through the
 
01:15:30.199 --> 01:15:33.550 align:start position:0%
went through the
process

01:15:33.550 --> 01:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:37.629 --> 01:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
okay is there any other discussion we
 
01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
have all my comments I've
 
01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:46.070 align:start position:0%
have all my comments I've
addressed

01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
um representative Cornell anything
 
01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
else are you with me on the CTE stuff
 
01:15:57.629 --> 01:15:57.639 align:start position:0%
there Patty great thank you okay uh
 
01:15:57.639 --> 01:15:59.030 align:start position:0%
there Patty great thank you okay uh
represent

01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
luno uh sure on um on page
 
01:16:07.149 --> 01:16:07.159 align:start position:0%
22 going into
 
01:16:09.910 --> 01:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
30622 uh the rule uh with respect to
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
High School curriculum credits and
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
co-curricular programs uh where the um
 
01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
the the the word course has been
 
01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
um deleted um several times and in
 
01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:26.189 align:start position:0%
um deleted um several times and in
particular

01:16:26.189 --> 01:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:16:26.199 --> 01:16:27.030 align:start position:0%
particular
in

01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
B where we talk about um so on page 22
 
01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:33.830 align:start position:0%
B where we talk about um so on page 22
uh

01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
30622 school districts shall develop
 
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
District competencies as opposed to
 
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
course competencies based on State
 
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
academic standards where applicable uh
 
01:16:46.590 --> 01:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
for all courses of study school
 
01:16:48.669 --> 01:16:48.679 align:start position:0%
districts may use State model
 
01:16:51.510 --> 01:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
competencies to develop minimum District
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
competencies so where where the word
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
course has has been um been removed
 
01:17:00.430 --> 01:17:00.440 align:start position:0%
there uh does that
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
um and and you know and it it's clearly
 
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
used to modify the word competencies and
 
01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:09.800 align:start position:0%
we also have academic standards in that
 
01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
um relate to um to essentially amending
 
01:17:25.870 --> 01:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:27.229 --> 01:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
for example if you took the word
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
academic standards out of there would uh
 
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
would would that rule be would a change
 
01:17:36.510 --> 01:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
to that rule be um you know be in the in
 
01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
the perview of this committee to review
 
01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:45.390 align:start position:0%
the perview of this committee to review
and

01:17:45.390 --> 01:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
recommend just saying if you took the
 
01:17:51.550 --> 01:17:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:54.189 --> 01:17:54.199 align:start position:0%
out not sure I understand yeah yeah yeah
 
01:17:56.629 --> 01:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm just saying is is that rule
 
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
306 22b so this this what what I'm
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
really trying to get at commissioner is
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
is what this committee's responsibility
 
01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
is and if we're just here to provide
 
01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
some feedback and take it or leave it
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
these are our comments as as a
 
01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
legislative committee then great there's
 
01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
no Authority here but if this committee
 
01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:23.560 align:start position:0%
has authority to review and recommend
 
01:18:25.709 --> 01:18:25.719 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand where that
 
01:18:28.910 --> 01:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
Authority lies because so far I haven't
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
I I I I haven't heard that this
 
01:18:33.310 --> 01:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
committee has any authority to review
 
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
and recommend we're just here as
 
01:18:40.510 --> 01:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
legislators providing comment based on
 
01:18:42.030 --> 01:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
what we think should happen take it or
 
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
leave it um trying to understand if
 
01:18:46.629 --> 01:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
there's if there's any Authority that
 
01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
this committee has so in in 30622 b um
 
01:18:54.390 --> 01:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
because it references specifically the
 
01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
word academic standards does this
 
01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
committee have authority to review and
 
01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
recommend and I'm not saying we wouldn't
 
01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
recommend that change I'm not saying
 
01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
that but do we have an authority do we
 
01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
have a responsibility to review and
 
01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:09.590 align:start position:0%
have a responsibility to review and
recommend

01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
30622 B well so what I I would first
 
01:19:14.669 --> 01:19:14.679 align:start position:0%
start out and just say you know
 
01:19:16.270 --> 01:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
irrespective of whether or not you have
 
01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
authority to do this I think um that the
 
01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
department has been very and the State
 
01:19:22.030 --> 01:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
Board of Education has been very
 
01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
responsive we we've met with you
 
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
multiple times taking your input as
 
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
public input and as input into this
 
01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
process uh and you will see many of the
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations that were recommended by
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
this uh body we we took that seriously
 
01:19:39.550 --> 01:19:39.560 align:start position:0%
and we have Incorporated many of those
 
01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
changes um I I still the hypothetical
 
01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not sure so how would you
 
01:19:47.310 --> 01:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
read be I'm I'm just trying to get away
 
01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
from you know is is this committee a
 
01:19:52.110 --> 01:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
work group or is this committee have
 
01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
have review and recommendation Authority
 
01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:56.719 align:start position:0%
because I read the law it says we have
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
review and recommendation Authority and
 
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
that we've got responsibility in terms
 
01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
of process and sequence in rule approval
 
01:20:06.669 --> 01:20:06.679 align:start position:0%
and and if this is just a work session
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
Then I then I you know it doesn't say
 
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
work session in the law uh it says
 
01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
review and recommend and I'm just trying
 
01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
to understand if there's any
 
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility that this committee has
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
in the in the process in sequence of
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
rule approval yeah so I would uh
 
01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
reference you to again 193 E2 a uh sub
 
01:20:34.990 --> 01:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
you know for Sub C the State Board of
 
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
Education shall not amend any existing
 
01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
academic standard and shall not approve
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
any new academic standards without the
 
01:20:44.430 --> 01:20:44.440 align:start position:0%
prior review and recommendation of the
 
01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee so I
 
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
think that that very precisely talks
 
01:20:50.350 --> 01:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
about your role with respect to academic
 
01:20:52.629 --> 01:20:52.639 align:start position:0%
standards um and then I had previously
 
01:20:57.070 --> 01:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
referenced as well in 4 a where it says
 
01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh change changes to the enumerated list
 
01:21:01.950 --> 01:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
of the content areas for an adequate
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
education it says changes made by the
 
01:21:05.550 --> 01:21:05.560 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education to the school
 
01:21:07.709 --> 01:21:07.719 align:start position:0%
approval standards through rulemaking
 
01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
effective date of this section shall not
 
01:21:10.990 --> 01:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
be included within the standards until
 
01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
they constitute an opportunity for
 
01:21:14.110 --> 01:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
delivering inadequate Education Without
 
01:21:15.669 --> 01:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
prior adoption which would require the
 
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
entire general
 
01:21:19.149 --> 01:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
court so those are the two things that I
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
would point to I didn't is did I miss
 
01:21:22.590 --> 01:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
something you were referring to courses
 
01:21:23.950 --> 01:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
taking out of there and I didn't know if
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
that was to your question it was it was
 
01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
a change that that has been proposed by
 
01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
the department in a rule that um that
 
01:21:36.910 --> 01:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
clearly talks about academic standards
 
01:21:39.229 --> 01:21:39.239 align:start position:0%
so so you know so I just sort of picked
 
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
up on on on a rule that uses the word
 
01:21:46.149 --> 01:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
academic standards and a change an
 
01:21:48.990 --> 01:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
amendment an a you know it says shall
 
01:21:52.189 --> 01:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
not approve shall uh shall not amend or
 
01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
approve any new academic standards these
 
01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
would not be new academic standards so
 
01:21:58.910 --> 01:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
okay so even a rule that refers to
 
01:22:01.629 --> 01:22:01.639 align:start position:0%
academic standards isn't subject to this
 
01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
they would not they are not academic
 
01:22:06.189 --> 01:22:06.199 align:start position:0%
this is not an academic standard oh okay
 
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
and even a rule that that refers to an
 
01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
academic standard wouldn't would would
 
01:22:12.110 --> 01:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
therefore not be subject to this
 
01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
committee again I believe that we've
 
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
followed the appropriate process and are
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
have Fidelity to the statute in terms of
 
01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
the rul making process that we followed
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
here okay thank
 
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
you the s perspective you've gotten from
 
01:22:28.030 --> 01:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
the jail car attorneys we have worked
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
very closely with them in this
 
01:22:34.030 --> 01:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
process yes rep and Cordell uh yes I was
 
01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
just looking on page
 
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
33 um
 
01:22:44.110 --> 01:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
3625 um is this in relation to um RSA
 
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh this rule predates the statute of
 
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
innovation rule so there's always been a
 
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
process where if there was um something
 
01:23:08.229 --> 01:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
that they needed alternative approval
 
01:23:10.030 --> 01:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
for this would be the process for it
 
01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:12.430 align:start position:0%
for this would be the process for it
okay

01:23:12.430 --> 01:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:23:14.430 --> 01:23:14.440 align:start position:0%
um and I guess I'll just point out there
 
01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
is a separate rule that has been adopted
 
01:23:18.750 --> 01:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
by the legislature for the Innovation
 
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:30.270 --> 01:23:30.280 align:start position:0%
well with the introduction of the
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
legislation we put forth where the
 
01:23:35.070 --> 01:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
academic standards will be reflected in
 
01:23:39.229 --> 01:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
the Frameworks that's where they are and
 
01:23:41.550 --> 01:23:41.560 align:start position:0%
and you're referencing the areas of
 
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
learning Within These
 
01:23:47.229 --> 01:23:47.239 align:start position:0%
306s and we've also addressed the issue
 
01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
that we were concerned initially with
 
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
definitions and those have been all been
 
01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
corrected to reference the
 
01:23:59.870 --> 01:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
rsas um I guess I'm I'm at the point
 
01:24:03.629 --> 01:24:03.639 align:start position:0%
where on on this portion of 306 is I I
 
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
have nothing further to really offer you
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
at this time other than you
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
know it seems like you're
 
01:24:14.590 --> 01:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
you're we've got this thing in hand
 
01:24:16.669 --> 01:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
especially with the the the house bill
 
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
which we put forward now we also have on
 
01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:22.639 align:start position:0%
11:07 but we also have the other Bill
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
coming forward where you know change
 
01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
coming so it' be interesting to see how
 
01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
that pans out that's one that gives this
 
01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
study committee the authority to make
 
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation on on all the minimum
 
01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
standards um I kind of look forward to
 
01:24:40.030 --> 01:24:40.040 align:start position:0%
it you know I know I know you probably
 
01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
don't look forward us doing that but I
 
01:24:45.709 --> 01:24:45.719 align:start position:0%
I'm really been uh you know I see some
 
01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
districts where you have to have how
 
01:24:49.149 --> 01:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
many credits to get out of school 24 or
 
01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
so or 22 27 yeah yeah okay wow and and
 
01:24:58.030 --> 01:24:58.040 align:start position:0%
some that are offering 20 to get out and
 
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
those graduation competencies developed
 
01:25:02.669 --> 01:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
at the local level so those those areas
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
which I'd like to dig into sometime
 
01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:10.270 --> 01:25:10.280 align:start position:0%
here thank you yeah are there any other
 
01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
comments before we you know take the
 
01:25:19.109 --> 01:25:19.119 align:start position:0%
leash off I just wanted to get over to
 
01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
was you are 25 I think so so I'm over on
 
01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
state board oh yeah establish of State
 
01:25:40.109 --> 01:25:40.119 align:start position:0%
academic standards okay state board
 
01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
establishment of State academic
 
01:25:44.669 --> 01:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
standards so
 
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
um and I apologize Mr chair because I'm
 
01:25:50.830 --> 01:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
working from both the the old and the
 
01:25:53.390 --> 01:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
new the old and the new exactly so I'm
 
01:25:56.669 --> 01:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
looking at the side by side that uh that
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
Jennifer for uh
 
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
prepared uh based on the February draft
 
01:26:05.470 --> 01:26:05.480 align:start position:0%
and so I'm on page 43 of the side by
 
01:26:07.149 --> 01:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
side do you do you have the side by side
 
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
no I don't have the side by side with me
 
01:26:10.590 --> 01:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
today so want you to read what we we've
 
01:26:13.830 --> 01:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
got there so the the the side by side is
 
01:26:19.629 --> 01:26:19.639 align:start position:0%
is um is helpful uh because the side by
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
side shows how how 306 26 state board
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
establishment of State academic
 
01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
standards has
 
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
removed um references to Ed
 
01:26:36.990 --> 01:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
30631 relative to Art
 
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
education 37 relative to English
 
01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
language arts um 40 relative to health
 
01:26:45.629 --> 01:26:45.639 align:start position:0%
education 41 relative to physical
 
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
education 42 relative to digital
 
01:26:52.350 --> 01:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
literacy 43 relative to math 45 relative
 
01:26:55.590 --> 01:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
to science 46 relative to social studies
 
01:26:58.550 --> 01:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
program 49 relative to Holocaust and
 
01:26:58.560 --> 01:26:59.709 align:start position:0%
program 49 relative to Holocaust and
genocide

01:26:59.709 --> 01:26:59.719 align:start position:0%
genocide
 
01:27:05.229 --> 01:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
education um and that's at the um um uh
 
01:27:06.669 --> 01:27:06.679 align:start position:0%
for grades 1 through eight where no
 
01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
middle school has been established and
 
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
then it continues on in a very similar
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
vein um with those same uh references
 
01:27:18.510 --> 01:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
for middle school
 
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
and and so those references have been
 
01:27:23.109 --> 01:27:23.119 align:start position:0%
removed so these are the cross
 
01:27:28.270 --> 01:27:28.280 align:start position:0%
references that are clearly um pointing
 
01:27:33.109 --> 01:27:33.119 align:start position:0%
to academic standards so is do does this
 
01:27:34.990 --> 01:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
this goes right back to the same and
 
01:27:38.109 --> 01:27:38.119 align:start position:0%
sorry to the um you know Groundhog Day
 
01:27:41.629 --> 01:27:41.639 align:start position:0%
here but but is Ed
 
01:27:44.350 --> 01:27:44.360 align:start position:0%
30626 subject to the review and
 
01:27:47.310 --> 01:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation of this committee given
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
the given the content I think you're
 
01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
referring to an old number because the
 
01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
current 30626
 
01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't remove anything it's all new
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
language yeah see that's hard to it's
 
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know it's hard to tell because we
 
01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
don't have the the difference between uh
 
01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
between this and the current rules it's
 
01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
only this and the earlier draft right
 
01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
and and so
 
01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:22.590 --> 01:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
26 so 26
 
01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
is all right so so this is
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
now ed20
 
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
30620 I mean I'm I'm now looking at at
 
01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
the side by side used to be 30626 it's
 
01:28:35.199 --> 01:28:36.189 align:start position:0%
the side by side used to be 30626 it's
now

01:28:36.189 --> 01:28:36.199 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
30620 and so kindergarten um grade 8 U
 
01:28:47.709 --> 01:28:47.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:47.719 --> 01:28:49.590 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:53.790 --> 01:28:53.800 align:start position:0%
it's it if it's changed again I I I
 
01:28:59.709 --> 01:28:59.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
so yeah so we already talked about two
 
01:29:04.430 --> 01:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm not trying to I'm not trying to
 
01:29:08.030 --> 01:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh go there again but um but what I
 
01:29:10.149 --> 01:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
didn't see when we talked about it
 
01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
earlier when we talked about 21 earlier
 
01:29:15.669 --> 01:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
was um because I think I was referring
 
01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
to the today's handout and let me just
 
01:29:25.870 --> 01:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
today's handout
 
01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:31.390 align:start position:0%
today's handout
on

01:29:31.390 --> 01:29:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:34.910 align:start position:0%
 
on

01:29:34.910 --> 01:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:37.870 --> 01:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
3621 doesn't
 
01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
show that that that for element you know
 
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
01:29:48.270 --> 01:29:48.280 align:start position:0%
um Jesus is heart I'm sorry it's painful
 
01:29:52.350 --> 01:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:56.109 --> 01:29:56.119 align:start position:0%
um that the that the that the current
 
01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
21 or wherever it is um in current law I
 
01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
mean in current rules for Elementary
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
grades 1 through eight where no middle
 
01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:12.400 align:start position:0%
school has been established by vote of
 
01:30:15.669 --> 01:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
the local school board um the school B
 
01:30:19.390 --> 01:30:19.400 align:start position:0%
shall adopt for each School a local
 
01:30:21.790 --> 01:30:21.800 align:start position:0%
um time schedule will specifies
 
01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
distribution of instructional time among
 
01:30:24.990 --> 01:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
the following learning areas to be
 
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
taught in grades 1-8 at all learning
 
01:30:32.229 --> 01:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
levels in the school um Ed 30631 37404
 
01:30:33.790 --> 01:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
142 all the things that I just talked
 
01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
about so all of those cross references
 
01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
have been eliminated um Mr chair is this
 
01:30:41.229 --> 01:30:41.239 align:start position:0%
subject are our cross references
 
01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
specific rule cross references to
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
academic standards is this subject to um
 
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:48.830 align:start position:0%
academic standards is this subject to um
this

01:30:48.830 --> 01:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation and it's cross
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
referencing you say two academic
 
01:30:59.910 --> 01:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
standards that are where that are in
 
01:31:02.669 --> 01:31:02.679 align:start position:0%
rules 31
 
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
30631 through 49 there and it may not be
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so again I'm more point back to the
 
01:31:12.030 --> 01:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
statute as well the State Board should
 
01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
not amend an existing academic standard
 
01:31:16.229 --> 01:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
so this is not amending any existing if
 
01:31:18.669 --> 01:31:18.679 align:start position:0%
it refers if it if it's if if if
 
01:31:22.189 --> 01:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
essentially the rule is providing a
 
01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
tether to an academic stand standard and
 
01:31:28.350 --> 01:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
that tether is cut um then then that's
 
01:31:30.189 --> 01:31:30.199 align:start position:0%
not amending the academic standards it's
 
01:31:31.629 --> 01:31:31.639 align:start position:0%
just simply setting the academic
 
01:31:34.270 --> 01:31:34.280 align:start position:0%
standard free from implementation we
 
01:31:35.950 --> 01:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
have not amended any academic standard
 
01:31:37.790 --> 01:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
no I understand that but if you if you
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
set an academic standard free from
 
01:31:43.149 --> 01:31:43.159 align:start position:0%
implementation if the implementation is
 
01:31:45.149 --> 01:31:45.159 align:start position:0%
the local school board shall adopt for
 
01:31:47.229 --> 01:31:47.239 align:start position:0%
each School a local time schedule which
 
01:31:48.629 --> 01:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
specifies the distribution of
 
01:31:50.709 --> 01:31:50.719 align:start position:0%
instructional time among the following
 
01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
learning areas to be taught in grades 1
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
through eight at all learning levels in
 
01:31:57.149 --> 01:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
the school and it lists all of these
 
01:31:59.109 --> 01:31:59.119 align:start position:0%
academic standards and you're not
 
01:32:01.109 --> 01:32:01.119 align:start position:0%
changing the academic standards you're
 
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
just changing the fact you're just
 
01:32:05.790 --> 01:32:05.800 align:start position:0%
changing the implementation of those
 
01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:08.199 align:start position:0%
academic standards at the local level
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
that that's not actually modifying an
 
01:32:11.390 --> 01:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
academic standard is that what I'm
 
01:32:12.910 --> 01:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
hearing you say so what I'm telling you
 
01:32:14.830 --> 01:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
is that we've not modified any academic
 
01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
standards in this rule you're just
 
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
you're just untethering it from
 
01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
implementation so that they're just
 
01:32:21.790 --> 01:32:21.800 align:start position:0%
floating over here not we've not
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
modified any academic I understand so so
 
01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
did so would those academic standards
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
still apply um in the the rule that I'm
 
01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
talking about so 306 out 21 yeah so
 
01:32:34.629 --> 01:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
academic standards continue to apply and
 
01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
we've got academic standards that the
 
01:32:38.790 --> 01:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education has adopted and
 
01:32:40.149 --> 01:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
those are on our website how do they
 
01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
continue to apply um in
 
01:32:45.470 --> 01:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
30621 uh because you're required I mean
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
if I go back to the section in G where
 
01:32:50.189 --> 01:32:50.199 align:start position:0%
it talks about the requirement to have
 
01:32:51.629 --> 01:32:51.639 align:start position:0%
academic standards that align to the
 
01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
state standards that then models
 
01:32:55.870 --> 01:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
competencies so there's a number of
 
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
other places in this Rule Body where
 
01:32:59.229 --> 01:32:59.239 align:start position:0%
those are uh
 
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
interconnected no could you point out
 
01:33:06.510 --> 01:33:06.520 align:start position:0%
where standards 31 through 49 the
 
01:33:08.669 --> 01:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
30631 through 49 and there's some
 
01:33:10.629 --> 01:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
numbers missing in there could you talk
 
01:33:13.229 --> 01:33:13.239 align:start position:0%
about how could you show us in the
 
01:33:14.990 --> 01:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for school approval
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
the proposed minimum standards for
 
01:33:18.750 --> 01:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
school approval where those academic
 
01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
standards are being are being referenced
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
that a school a school that does not
 
01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
Implement those academic standards would
 
01:33:27.990 --> 01:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
fail to meet the requirement for minimum
 
01:33:30.629 --> 01:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
School approval isn't this why we just
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
did 11:07 though the academic standards
 
01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
are now located in the curriculum
 
01:33:39.390 --> 01:33:39.400 align:start position:0%
Frameworks and we yeah we mentioned
 
01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
curriculum here but your curriculum has
 
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
to be aligned with those academic
 
01:33:45.950 --> 01:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
standards I'm just I'm just trying to
 
01:33:48.229 --> 01:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
see where it where it where where it's
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
Tethered to the rules for
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
implementation I mean
 
01:33:57.870 --> 01:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
you do you see what I'm saying Mr chair
 
01:34:00.149 --> 01:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
this the implementation is done through
 
01:34:02.669 --> 01:34:02.679 align:start position:0%
your instruction and your adopted
 
01:34:06.149 --> 01:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
curriculum in the school right so but
 
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
your your academic standard though is
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
immersed into that
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
curriculum and and in practices through
 
01:34:16.149 --> 01:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
your instruction are there as well when
 
01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:17.560 align:start position:0%
you talk about homework or some of this
 
01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:22.360 align:start position:0%
other areas um so I guess I would ask
 
01:34:24.350 --> 01:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
are you really looking to see the
 
01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:26.189 align:start position:0%
are you really looking to see the
academic

01:34:26.189 --> 01:34:26.199 align:start position:0%
academic
 
01:34:28.350 --> 01:34:28.360 align:start position:0%
standards everything that's in those
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
Frameworks service guidelines and there
 
01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
and I've asked the question many times
 
01:34:34.189 --> 01:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
before where do I find the academic
 
01:34:37.149 --> 01:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
standards I've asked that for years here
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
asked it last year on my website on the
 
01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
and and it's I've been told the academic
 
01:34:46.270 --> 01:34:46.280 align:start position:0%
standards are located in the um
 
01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
basically curriculum Frameworks for each
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
of those learning areas all right so do
 
01:34:55.070 --> 01:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
we need to duplicate that in 306 if it's
 
01:34:57.310 --> 01:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
already referenced over there in the
 
01:35:00.030 --> 01:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
Frameworks so let so all right so let me
 
01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
put the question out there because these
 
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
this is beyond the first half so
 
01:35:08.709 --> 01:35:08.719 align:start position:0%
30631 relative to an Arts education is
 
01:35:10.669 --> 01:35:10.679 align:start position:0%
that an academic standard so what I
 
01:35:13.030 --> 01:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
would tell you is school districts and
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
ref refered your question we we looked
 
01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:16.360 align:start position:0%
at this section before it's in
 
01:35:19.629 --> 01:35:19.639 align:start position:0%
30622 uh school districts shall
 
01:35:22.830 --> 01:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
develop uh District competencies based
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
on uh State academic standards where
 
01:35:27.669 --> 01:35:27.679 align:start position:0%
applicable for all courses of study
 
01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
school districts may use State model
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
competencies uh to develop minimum
 
01:35:31.679 --> 01:35:33.270 align:start position:0%
competencies uh to develop minimum
District

01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
District
 
01:35:38.229 --> 01:35:38.239 align:start position:0%
competencies so so thank you um so
 
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
is what what what we're in right now is
 
01:35:44.350 --> 01:35:44.360 align:start position:0%
is I think we were back to
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
30621 which the the earlier draft had
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
eliminated and I didn't you know sorry
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
for not picking up earlier cuz it wasn't
 
01:35:56.229 --> 01:35:56.239 align:start position:0%
contained and what was handed out today
 
01:36:01.109 --> 01:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
the earlier draft had eliminated from
 
01:36:06.669 --> 01:36:06.679 align:start position:0%
30621 had eliminated a reference to
 
01:36:10.270 --> 01:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
30631 relative to an Arts education so
 
01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
my question to you commissioner is is
 
01:36:17.870 --> 01:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
30631 an academic standard so what I
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
would tell you is that that is referring
 
01:36:21.550 --> 01:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
to academic standards that are on the
 
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
Department's website at this point is
 
01:36:26.709 --> 01:36:26.719 align:start position:0%
that a yes that 30631 is an academic
 
01:36:28.350 --> 01:36:28.360 align:start position:0%
standard I don't have those with me so
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not prepared to speak to those okay
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
so all right so just for the purpose of
 
01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
because I believe there's a separate
 
01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
rule proposal the back half is coming
 
01:36:38.830 --> 01:36:38.840 align:start position:0%
and we're not here to talk to those at
 
01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
this I understand I understand just for
 
01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
the purpose of of discussion though if
 
01:36:53.709 --> 01:36:53.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:58.270 --> 01:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
if that is an academic standard would
 
01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
eliminating the cross reference to that
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
academic standard be um from from
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
the minimum St minimum standards for
 
01:37:12.669 --> 01:37:12.679 align:start position:0%
school approval would would that mean
 
01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
that a school a public school could be
 
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
approved without providing an Arts
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
education so if it were an academic
 
01:37:23.590 --> 01:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
standard again pointing back to the
 
01:37:25.109 --> 01:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
statute the State Board of Education
 
01:37:27.229 --> 01:37:27.239 align:start position:0%
shall not amend any existing academic
 
01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
standards and this proposal in front of
 
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
you does not amend any existing academic
 
01:37:33.070 --> 01:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
standard right we're talking past each
 
01:37:35.189 --> 01:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
other commissioner what what I'm talking
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
about is when you take an academic
 
01:37:38.950 --> 01:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
standard and it's Tethered to an
 
01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
implementation so the implementation in
 
01:37:45.629 --> 01:37:45.639 align:start position:0%
the existing um rule 30621 if that's
 
01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
still the same number um is the local
 
01:37:50.790 --> 01:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
school board shall adopt for each School
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
a local time schedule which specifies
 
01:37:54.030 --> 01:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
the district distribution of
 
01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
instructional time among the following
 
01:37:58.270 --> 01:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
learning areas to be taught in grades
 
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
1-8 at all learning levels um in the
 
01:38:05.709 --> 01:38:05.719 align:start position:0%
school and this is where it talks about
 
01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
30631 relative to an Arts relative to an
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
Arts education 37 relative to English
 
01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
language arts if all of those things are
 
01:38:17.310 --> 01:38:17.320 align:start position:0%
are are taken
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
out how are those minimum how are those
 
01:38:24.430 --> 01:38:24.440 align:start position:0%
academic standards then incorporated
 
01:38:27.589 --> 01:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
into the standards for M the minimum
 
01:38:29.310 --> 01:38:29.320 align:start position:0%
standards for school
 
01:38:32.470 --> 01:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
approval so I'll talk process here for a
 
01:38:34.510 --> 01:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
moment so the reason those numbers were
 
01:38:37.270 --> 01:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
taken out is because so we we split this
 
01:38:39.669 --> 01:38:39.679 align:start position:0%
into two proposals there were a lot of
 
01:38:41.709 --> 01:38:41.719 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of ring because we added
 
01:38:43.709 --> 01:38:43.719 align:start position:0%
some sections we removed some sections
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
there were sections that were reserved
 
01:38:47.629 --> 01:38:47.639 align:start position:0%
so the numbering as you can see as we've
 
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
been going through it has changed
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
significantly and that includes the
 
01:38:52.990 --> 01:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
numbers in the other half that we
 
01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
haven't yet addressed those numbers are
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
going to change and regardless of the
 
01:39:00.910 --> 01:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
content in those areas they are still
 
01:39:03.669 --> 01:39:03.679 align:start position:0%
part of the rules and so they have to be
 
01:39:05.310 --> 01:39:05.320 align:start position:0%
followed right they haven't gone away
 
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
they're still live there are actual
 
01:39:08.950 --> 01:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
rules that are in place but you just
 
01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:10.360 align:start position:0%
don't know what um but what I would tell
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
you is that changing a reference to an
 
01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
academic standards it does not
 
01:39:19.390 --> 01:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
constitute a as enumerated in statute an
 
01:39:22.270 --> 01:39:22.280 align:start position:0%
amendment to an existing standard right
 
01:39:24.030 --> 01:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
changing changing a reference to a
 
01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
standard is not changing a standard okay
 
01:39:28.830 --> 01:39:28.840 align:start position:0%
no no fair fair fair enough um I'm
 
01:39:30.790 --> 01:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
wondering what the what the obviously
 
01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
what the legislative intent was you know
 
01:39:35.709 --> 01:39:35.719 align:start position:0%
when the when the legislature created
 
01:39:41.109 --> 01:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
193 e2a Roman for um C and D but but
 
01:39:42.669 --> 01:39:42.679 align:start position:0%
regardless of that what what you just
 
01:39:46.149 --> 01:39:46.159 align:start position:0%
read off um uh with respect to academic
 
01:39:48.589 --> 01:39:48.599 align:start position:0%
standards is actually the language um in
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
the law so what I want to get at is is
 
01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
if um
 
01:39:56.550 --> 01:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
if you take out all those cross
 
01:39:59.709 --> 01:39:59.719 align:start position:0%
references 30631 relative to Arts
 
01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
education 37 relative to language arts
 
01:40:05.790 --> 01:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
does a local school board need to um
 
01:40:09.870 --> 01:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
need to provide uh a local time schedule
 
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
it specifies the distribution of
 
01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
instructional time among the following
 
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
learning years do does the Schoolboard
 
01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
have to do anything to provide
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
instruction in those in for those
 
01:40:22.589 --> 01:40:22.599 align:start position:0%
academic standards he's on 21 do they
 
01:40:25.470 --> 01:40:25.480 align:start position:0%
need to be compliant with the academic
 
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
standards in order to be approved
 
01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
question wasy understand find the place
 
01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
where you are there so again it says in
 
01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
30621 right so the rule as adopted will
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
state that the local school board shall
 
01:40:42.669 --> 01:40:42.679 align:start position:0%
distribute instructional time to allow
 
01:40:44.669 --> 01:40:44.679 align:start position:0%
each student to make progression toward
 
01:40:46.189 --> 01:40:46.199 align:start position:0%
proficiency and competencies in the
 
01:40:47.870 --> 01:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
following areas and it enumerates those
 
01:40:50.109 --> 01:40:50.119 align:start position:0%
areas so that is a requirement that a
 
01:40:51.990 --> 01:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
local school distribute their time to be
 
01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
able to offer that instr ruction and
 
01:40:56.510 --> 01:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
then I would point you again back to
 
01:40:58.629 --> 01:40:58.639 align:start position:0%
over on page 22 where it says school
 
01:41:00.830 --> 01:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
districts shall develop competencies
 
01:41:03.189 --> 01:41:03.199 align:start position:0%
based on State academic standards right
 
01:41:04.589 --> 01:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
so all of those standards that have been
 
01:41:06.430 --> 01:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
adopted were applicable for all courses
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
of study can I just ask question so
 
01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:10.719 align:start position:0%
there that's how see just so finalize
 
01:41:12.910 --> 01:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
this question so it says right there
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
that school districts shall develop
 
01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
competencies based on State academic
 
01:41:20.189 --> 01:41:20.199 align:start position:0%
standards where applicable for all
 
01:41:22.750 --> 01:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
courses of study so if art is a course
 
01:41:26.070 --> 01:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
of study then you shall have you shall
 
01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
uh have competencies that uh are based
 
01:41:30.910 --> 01:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
on State academic
 
01:41:33.790 --> 01:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
standards Cornell yes on on page 20
 
01:41:35.109 --> 01:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
where it says the local school board
 
01:41:37.470 --> 01:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
shall distribute instructional time I'm
 
01:41:39.149 --> 01:41:39.159 align:start position:0%
just is there a definition for
 
01:41:41.109 --> 01:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
instructional time is that a
 
01:41:43.350 --> 01:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
class is it's
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
defined I I missed it instruction is is
 
01:41:50.149 --> 01:41:50.159 align:start position:0%
defined so instructional time is also
 
01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
all around page
 
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:58.149 --> 01:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
so um so so I I I appreciate that and I
 
01:42:00.589 --> 01:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
and and thank um representative Cornell
 
01:42:02.629 --> 01:42:02.639 align:start position:0%
for that for that question with regards
 
01:42:04.430 --> 01:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
to instructional time does that
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
instructional time have to be consistent
 
01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
with with the academic standards in each
 
01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
of these areas for and I'm looking at on
 
01:42:15.669 --> 01:42:15.679 align:start position:0%
on the bottom of page 20 from today's
 
01:42:18.270 --> 01:42:18.280 align:start position:0%
handout where you've got
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
c1a for instance Arts education
 
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
including music and visual arts it so
 
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
what is the question it
 
01:42:28.229 --> 01:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
is so
 
01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
c1a requires the local Schoolboard sh
 
01:42:33.310 --> 01:42:33.320 align:start position:0%
distribute instructional time to allow
 
01:42:35.950 --> 01:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
each student to make a progression
 
01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
towards Proficiency in competencies in
 
01:42:42.189 --> 01:42:42.199 align:start position:0%
the following areas right and so a is
 
01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
Arts education including music and
 
01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
visual arts so is that does that
 
01:42:50.229 --> 01:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
instruction instructional time that the
 
01:42:53.229 --> 01:42:53.239 align:start position:0%
school board
 
01:42:56.350 --> 01:42:56.360 align:start position:0%
has to provide is that is that
 
01:42:59.310 --> 01:42:59.320 align:start position:0%
consistent with I how does that have to
 
01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:02.360 align:start position:0%
be consistent with an academic standard
 
01:43:04.030 --> 01:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
yes so the academic standards are not
 
01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
defining how much instructional time
 
01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
they are not connected to the
 
01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:11.149 align:start position:0%
they are not connected to the
instructional

01:43:11.149 --> 01:43:11.159 align:start position:0%
instructional
 
01:43:14.669 --> 01:43:14.679 align:start position:0%
time that that changed you know we we
 
01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
once had uh in all the New England
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
states we had specific minutes per week
 
01:43:23.669 --> 01:43:23.679 align:start position:0%
where you must teach
 
01:43:26.510 --> 01:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
history or you must teach
 
01:43:29.550 --> 01:43:29.560 align:start position:0%
science um then we came along with
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
thematic reading and everything else and
 
01:43:32.750 --> 01:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
they're saying well I'm teaching Social
 
01:43:34.430 --> 01:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
Studies by way of this thematic reading
 
01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
program in my reading time so I'm Co
 
01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
covering two subjects at one time less
 
01:43:42.750 --> 01:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
minutes we got away from that uh what we
 
01:43:45.270 --> 01:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
are primarily interested in the issue of
 
01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
time is how much that time is engaged
 
01:43:51.910 --> 01:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
time time in which instructions actually
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
occurring or is it time that's just well
 
01:43:57.709 --> 01:43:57.719 align:start position:0%
the clock started at 9:00 it's now 9:45
 
01:43:59.229 --> 01:43:59.239 align:start position:0%
we've had our time well how much is that
 
01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
really engage time maybe 20 minutes 25
 
01:44:03.390 --> 01:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
minutes out of that whole time so that's
 
01:44:06.669 --> 01:44:06.679 align:start position:0%
an instructional methodology that it it
 
01:44:08.910 --> 01:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
comes underneath a different baileywick
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
which you know it's it's a supervisory
 
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
issue it's a a a a a teacher issue to
 
01:44:17.390 --> 01:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
use time wisely um I mean and it's also
 
01:44:19.310 --> 01:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
a flexibility issue for a local District
 
01:44:21.550 --> 01:44:21.560 align:start position:0%
to make determinations in terms of the
 
01:44:23.149 --> 01:44:23.159 align:start position:0%
allocation of their time because they're
 
01:44:24.189 --> 01:44:24.199 align:start position:0%
going to have different cohorts of
 
01:44:26.270 --> 01:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
student and what we're saying is that we
 
01:44:27.589 --> 01:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
want to allocate the time so that
 
01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
students make progression towards
 
01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
proficiency um and so that may look
 
01:44:33.070 --> 01:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
different in different for different
 
01:44:34.990 --> 01:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
students for different schools and would
 
01:44:38.589 --> 01:44:38.599 align:start position:0%
that proficiency have to be um towards
 
01:44:41.790 --> 01:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
the academic standard listed out in
 
01:44:44.669 --> 01:44:44.679 align:start position:0%
30631 for an Arts education program they
 
01:44:46.669 --> 01:44:46.679 align:start position:0%
would be proficient in the competencies
 
01:44:48.709 --> 01:44:48.719 align:start position:0%
as is enumerated there that the local
 
01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
school district has adopted remember
 
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
that was that thing that I just read you
 
01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
out of B on the following page right so
 
01:44:56.669 --> 01:44:56.679 align:start position:0%
so what what what they adopt does does
 
01:44:59.189 --> 01:44:59.199 align:start position:0%
that have to be compliant with an
 
01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
academic with a academic standard so
 
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
what it says is that they have to be
 
01:45:04.629 --> 01:45:04.639 align:start position:0%
based on the academics the state's
 
01:45:06.430 --> 01:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
academic standards but again
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
representative luno and it seems like
 
01:45:09.990 --> 01:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
we're going around in circles here a bit
 
01:45:12.030 --> 01:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
the we don't perceive that that is an
 
01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
amendment to an existing academic
 
01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
standards again uh so I'll just continue
 
01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
to focus on that yeah so where where um
 
01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
I was reading the statute
 
01:45:25.070 --> 01:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
which statute were you reading the one
 
01:45:27.510 --> 01:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
that we continue to refer to in 193c it
 
01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
says the State Board shall not amend any
 
01:45:32.350 --> 01:45:32.360 align:start position:0%
existing academic
 
01:45:35.350 --> 01:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
standards okay so right right so even
 
01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
even where an academic standard is is
 
01:45:44.189 --> 01:45:44.199 align:start position:0%
being used to uh to guide a or to to um
 
01:45:47.550 --> 01:45:47.560 align:start position:0%
to to require a school board to do
 
01:45:51.030 --> 01:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
something um providing uh instructional
 
01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
time to to meet an academic standard
 
01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
where that acade academic standard has
 
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
no longer being referenced in that rule
 
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
um how does the school board know what
 
01:46:06.070 --> 01:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
to do number one and number two how does
 
01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education know if a
 
01:46:12.629 --> 01:46:12.639 align:start position:0%
um no if a school board I'm sorry no if
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
a school should be approved again so you
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
have referenced their using the State
 
01:46:19.229 --> 01:46:19.239 align:start position:0%
academic standards I certainly hope that
 
01:46:21.070 --> 01:46:21.080 align:start position:0%
they are using those standards because
 
01:46:22.589 --> 01:46:22.599 align:start position:0%
we want them to do that that is the
 
01:46:22.599 --> 01:46:23.629 align:start position:0%
we want them to do that that is the
purpose

01:46:23.629 --> 01:46:23.639 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
01:46:25.109 --> 01:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
uh use of a standard would not
 
01:46:28.350 --> 01:46:28.360 align:start position:0%
constitute an amendment to a
 
01:46:30.390 --> 01:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
standard right even when it's taken out
 
01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
of implement I mean I I I honestly I'm
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know my background is engineering so
 
01:46:38.070 --> 01:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
when you don't refer to a to a technical
 
01:46:39.790 --> 01:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
reference eliminating that technical
 
01:46:41.830 --> 01:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
reference is the same thing as changing
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
that Technic so the technical reference
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
because it untethers from the from the
 
01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
implementation I mean so I'm I'm sorry
 
01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
if um if if I'm looking at this process
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
is in a much more rigorous way than um
 
01:46:58.669 --> 01:46:58.679 align:start position:0%
than maybe um what the what the how the
 
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
department interprets it but I have a
 
01:47:03.189 --> 01:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
hard time believing that the
 
01:47:07.870 --> 01:47:07.880 align:start position:0%
legislature would would would feel good
 
01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
with with modifying rules amending rules
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh to uh to relieve School boards from
 
01:47:17.550 --> 01:47:17.560 align:start position:0%
following academic standards so that
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
would be just to be clear like and I
 
01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
want to make sure this is on the record
 
01:47:23.109 --> 01:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
that's an incorrect characterization and
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
I will read again to you uh 30622 B
 
01:47:28.910 --> 01:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
School District shall develop
 
01:47:31.310 --> 01:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
competencies based on State academic
 
01:47:32.910 --> 01:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
standards were applicable for all
 
01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
courses of study the State Board the

public who has provided extensive input
 
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
into these rules has not uh you know
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
untethered the education for these
 
01:47:47.350 --> 01:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
students it is clear in this rule
 
01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:53.149 align:start position:0%
students it is clear in this rule
proposal

01:47:53.149 --> 01:47:53.159 align:start position:0%

helping us out with this um now this is
 
01:48:10.149 --> 01:48:10.159 align:start position:0%
the front side when when's the backside
 
01:48:14.589 --> 01:48:14.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:14.599 --> 01:48:16.270 align:start position:0%
 
up

01:48:16.270 --> 01:48:16.280 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:48:18.430 --> 01:48:18.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you how many versions are you
 
01:48:20.669 --> 01:48:20.679 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:48:24.270 --> 01:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
have there go okay thank you very much
 
01:48:26.270 --> 01:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
have a great afternoon
 
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
okay already as the committee right now
 
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
so on on this front
 
01:48:35.550 --> 01:48:35.560 align:start position:0%
side you know other than what we've
 
01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
discussed here I don't have any other
 
01:48:42.149 --> 01:48:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:45.709 --> 01:48:45.719 align:start position:0%
make yeah I I you know I I I see the
 
01:48:47.629 --> 01:48:47.639 align:start position:0%
role as this committee is not being sort
 
01:48:50.070 --> 01:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
of like a recommendation work group I
 
01:48:52.830 --> 01:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
see it as as as having responsibility
 
01:48:55.990 --> 01:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
and review and and uh uh and
 
01:48:58.270 --> 01:48:58.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation Authority uh as part of
 
01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
the process and I'm I'm
 
01:49:05.709 --> 01:49:05.719 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the academic standards I
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
could make a recommendation right now
 
01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
saying I you know I don't see the
 
01:49:12.030 --> 01:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
academic standards being changed I see
 
01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:13.030 align:start position:0%
academic standards being changed I see
them

01:49:13.030 --> 01:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:49:18.790 --> 01:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
continuing um and so that's part two and
 
01:49:20.950 --> 01:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
that yeah and then we look at part two
 
01:49:23.629 --> 01:49:23.639 align:start position:0%
and and see where we are with that and
 
01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh then we will have of course more uh
 
01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
ability to look at all minimum standards
 
01:49:32.430 --> 01:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
in that part too yeah no I I I I
 
01:49:36.109 --> 01:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate that but um but from a from a
 
01:49:39.510 --> 01:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
um from a you know sort of a process
 
01:49:42.070 --> 01:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
standpoint where where or actually from
 
01:49:44.629 --> 01:49:44.639 align:start position:0%
a um from a I mean I'm making a
 
01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
technical argument here that when when a
 
01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:51.679 align:start position:0%
rule references another rule um that and
 
01:49:54.030 --> 01:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
and that that cross reference to another
 
01:49:56.510 --> 01:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
rule is in fact a technical standard
 
01:49:59.470 --> 01:49:59.480 align:start position:0%
then that becomes incorporated into the
 
01:50:03.870 --> 01:50:03.880 align:start position:0%
rule that was using it and and I I I I
 
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
certainly understand that that in the
 
01:50:10.350 --> 01:50:10.360 align:start position:0%
areas that we talked about no if if Ed
 
01:50:13.750 --> 01:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
30631 relative in arts education is and
 
01:50:17.629 --> 01:50:17.639 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at it right here so so it's
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know one and a quarter P one you
 
01:50:22.750 --> 01:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
know one one and a half one and a quter
 
01:50:24.669 --> 01:50:24.679 align:start position:0%
one and a half pages long that you would
 
01:50:26.270 --> 01:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
just cross reference it you wouldn't
 
01:50:29.709 --> 01:50:29.719 align:start position:0%
actually copy and paste all those words
 
01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh into it you'd cross reference it and
 
01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
and and the reason it was cross
 
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
referenced because it was actually
 
01:50:39.229 --> 01:50:39.239 align:start position:0%
saying the School Board needs to do
 
01:50:42.069 --> 01:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
something with this with this academ to
 
01:50:45.629 --> 01:50:45.639 align:start position:0%
follow this academic standard and by by
 
01:50:47.629 --> 01:50:47.639 align:start position:0%
taking out the cross reference you're
 
01:50:50.270 --> 01:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
essentially taking out the language from
 
01:50:53.510 --> 01:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
that cross reference um that was
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
incorporated by reference into the rule
 
01:51:00.069 --> 01:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
and and and I I think it's a I think
 
01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
it's a very fair way of of of both you
 
01:51:09.189 --> 01:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
know making um uh making it easier what
 
01:51:11.430 --> 01:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do and also be being
 
01:51:13.510 --> 01:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
being rigorous getting academic
 
01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
standards located in one place getting
 
01:51:17.910 --> 01:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
them clarified uh is important I can
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
remember going back to July 1 2015 when
 
01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
I sat on jail car
 
01:51:26.350 --> 01:51:26.360 align:start position:0%
and there was a proposed rule change of
 
01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
course the department missed the
 
01:51:31.310 --> 01:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
deadline and so
 
01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:33.669 align:start position:0%
deadline and so
36.

01:51:33.669 --> 01:51:33.679 align:start position:0%
36.
 
01:51:36.589 --> 01:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
311 didn't go forward and that was more
 
01:51:38.350 --> 01:51:38.360 align:start position:0%
than one and a half pages I believe when
 
01:51:40.510 --> 01:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
you talking about art and the health and
 
01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
some of those other areas it became
 
01:51:45.189 --> 01:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
almost three pages and it was turning
 
01:51:48.149 --> 01:51:48.159 align:start position:0%
into the 306 is becoming the academic
 
01:51:51.229 --> 01:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
standards and very confusing and I think
 
01:51:53.069 --> 01:51:53.079 align:start position:0%
that confusion has now been eliminated
 
01:51:55.149 --> 01:51:55.159 align:start position:0%
through what we did what we need to do
 
01:51:57.189 --> 01:51:57.199 align:start position:0%
now is make sure those curriculum
 
01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
Frameworks are updated make sure the
 
01:52:02.589 --> 01:52:02.599 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks reflect those
 
01:52:05.149 --> 01:52:05.159 align:start position:0%
academic standards that we we are
 
01:52:07.229 --> 01:52:07.239 align:start position:0%
wanting because I think that's the key
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
to having successful curriculum
 
01:52:12.189 --> 01:52:12.199 align:start position:0%
instruction in our local schools if we
 
01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
have those all aligned and aligned with
 
01:52:16.990 --> 01:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
our Statewide assessment we want that
 
01:52:19.189 --> 01:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
assessment assessing what we're
 
01:52:21.990 --> 01:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
supposedly teaching and so I I think
 
01:52:23.750 --> 01:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
we're on the right right track here it's
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
going to take a little bit to get this
 
01:52:27.030 --> 01:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
thing all in line but I think we're
 
01:52:30.790 --> 01:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
moving it very very quickly here and uh
 
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
I mean in terms of what we are directing
 
01:52:36.109 --> 01:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
we we we believe academic standards are
 
01:52:39.229 --> 01:52:39.239 align:start position:0%
extremely important as a state and and
 
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
that's why we need to look at those
 
01:52:42.830 --> 01:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
Frameworks which are the academic
 
01:52:44.830 --> 01:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
standards I'd like to see some clarity
 
01:52:47.550 --> 01:52:47.560 align:start position:0%
within the Frameworks as far as this the
 
01:52:50.350 --> 01:52:50.360 align:start position:0%
the specific academic standards and
 
01:52:51.990 --> 01:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
because the rest of it's guidelines in
 
01:52:53.950 --> 01:52:53.960 align:start position:0%
terms of how you might teach economics
 
01:52:56.310 --> 01:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
or whatever and and what you might
 
01:52:58.149 --> 01:52:58.159 align:start position:0%
incorporate into it in terms of content
 
01:53:02.189 --> 01:53:02.199 align:start position:0%
and skills but uh I I I'm I'm good with
 
01:53:03.750 --> 01:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
the 306 is the way we are because I
 
01:53:05.629 --> 01:53:05.639 align:start position:0%
don't think we're cutting anything out I
 
01:53:07.109 --> 01:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
think we're referencing it in the proper
 
01:53:07.119 --> 01:53:10.669 align:start position:0%
think we're referencing it in the proper
space

01:53:10.669 --> 01:53:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:14.350 --> 01:53:14.360 align:start position:0%
now yeah I disagree on that
 
01:53:17.950 --> 01:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
but it's okay to disagree yeah we'll
 
01:53:19.589 --> 01:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
walk out of here shaking hands still
 
01:53:21.189 --> 01:53:21.199 align:start position:0%
yeah no worries about that okay good
 
01:53:23.629 --> 01:53:23.639 align:start position:0%
enough so it is lunch time and we have
 
01:53:25.470 --> 01:53:25.480 align:start position:0%
another meeting starting up in another
 
01:53:30.589 --> 01:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
hour uh some of us so um with that we'll
 
01:53:33.069 --> 01:53:33.079 align:start position:0%
close this this uh education study
 
01:53:36.149 --> 01:53:36.159 align:start position:0%
committee and uh we look forward to the
 
01:53:38.109 --> 01:53:38.119 align:start position:0%
the second
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
