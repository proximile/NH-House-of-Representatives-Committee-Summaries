00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
incorporated very few changes I can
 
00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
point to in the event that anyone didn't
 
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:20.840 align:start position:0%
see uh what went out that
 
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.629 align:start position:0%
see uh what went out that
late

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
late
 
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 align:start position:0%
um I think our business for
 
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
today is to take any comments any disc
 
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
discussion regarding the draft um and uh
 
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
also we can uh uh turn to representative
 
00:07:41.869 --> 00:07:41.879 align:start position:0%
shamber uh at a appropriate point for
 
00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:43.639 align:start position:0%
any comments he wants to make regarding
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
his Minority Report yes representative H
 
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
um I thank the chair for putting
 
00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:52.879 align:start position:0%
together a pretty good uh a very good um
 
00:07:56.189 --> 00:07:56.199 align:start position:0%
historical analysis of both the uh uh
 
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
issue in front of us and the actions of
 
00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
this particular commit Mission
 
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I think that for the
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
remainder of the day if we begin in page
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
eight because everything prior to that
 
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
yes is historical yes uh I don't without
 
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
an object if there's an
 
00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
objection I think that's a I think
 
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
that's a good plan I would just ask
 
00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:22.599 align:start position:0%
quickly we have now had
 
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
the process and procedures and the
 
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
testimony and record in front of of us
 
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
from a PRI meeting there were very small
 
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
edits that were essentially grammatical
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
typ of spelling I'm very much thank uh
 
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
Keen W for contributing to to that
 
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
editing process and I found a whole
 
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:47.720 align:start position:0%
bunch of my own but unless there are any
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
specific questions relating to the uh uh
 
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
testimony and
 
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:56.680 align:start position:0%
record I just look for those first and
 
00:08:58.829 --> 00:08:58.839 align:start position:0%
then I agree with representative ol we
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
can jump to page eight where the
 
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.310 align:start position:0%
can jump to page eight where the
findings

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
begin okay we're all set then on the
 
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:09.160 align:start position:0%
process and on the uh
 
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
Records representative Alie and
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
following up on that discussion it it
 
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
appears the way that this is a Manu or
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
was created is that there is a finding
 
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:22.360 align:start position:0%
and there's a historical analysis of the
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
finding and I think that the historical
 
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
analysis there may be a word or two here
 
00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:33.519 align:start position:0%
but the historical analysis is pretty St
 
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
stated and the finding itself the bolded
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
areas the one the numerical numbers the
 
00:09:43.069 --> 00:09:43.079 align:start position:0%
bullet points um are the ones that we
 
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
should P primarily focus on okay good
 
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
point yeah and I would
 
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
uh I would just point out I think it's
 
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
obvious to those of us who uh members
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
who've been reading this but for the
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
record the purpose and the testimony and
 
00:10:03.389 --> 00:10:03.399 align:start position:0%
record are intended to be completely
 
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
neutral just
 
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
narrative uh the
 
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:12.680 align:start position:0%
findings represent conclusions of the
 
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
commission at large uh so they make
 
00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
judgments but they're judgments as to
 
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
which we I believe have come to a
 
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
consensus in fact I believe the minority
 
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%
um is is probably in Harmony and will
 
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
let us know if he's not uh on the
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
findings so the findings are
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
organized around the draft that Mr Foley
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
and Mr Kennedy
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
prepared uh to you know represent the
 
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.590 align:start position:0%
prepared uh to you know represent the
filtered

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
filtered
 
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
conclusions of the commission as to the
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
State of Affairs the landscape within
 
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:57.959 align:start position:0%
which we're examining this um they are
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
not intended to be you know
 
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
argumentative and I think that they're
 
00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:04.910 align:start position:0%
argumentative and I think that they're
not

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
controversial in contrast if you jump
 
00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.509 align:start position:0%
controversial in contrast if you jump
over

00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:09.519 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:11.550 align:start position:0%
over
to

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:11.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
page 15 the analysis which was added
 
00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:17.959 align:start position:0%
yesterday and the recommendations which
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
were added Friday
 
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
morning are the judged conclusions of
 
00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.190 align:start position:0%
morning are the judged conclusions of
the

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:24.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:27.389 --> 00:11:27.399 align:start position:0%
majority and would be in contrast to the
 
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
position of the minority
 
00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
okay is that fairly fairly delineated so
 
00:11:35.949 --> 00:11:35.959 align:start position:0%
with uh with that let somebody else
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
wants to make General comments let's
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
just go to page
 
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
nine and as uh representative ol has
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
suggested let's just
 
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
read each bolded
 
00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
finding and we won't wait into the
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
discussion unless somebody points to
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
something that they
 
00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
question is that good before you go on
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
yes representative shamber yes
 
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:07.720 align:start position:0%
uh I sent a final
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
draft to Jen with
 
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
attachments will those be
 
00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
distributed electronically or should we
 
00:12:19.189 --> 00:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
do it
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
paperwise I think if we could have a
 
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
printed copy here with us this morning
 
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
that would be great good glad to know
 
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
that's in sent right you sent it to J so
 
00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen it but we will see it
 
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's basically the things that we've
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
covered and where would that go into
 
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:37.240 align:start position:0%
this report it won't go into the
 
00:12:39.629 --> 00:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
memorandum it'll be included in the
 
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
reports right yes I'm going to ask Jen
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
to help me make sure this is formatted
 
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
correctly but this 16-page document that
 
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:51.160 align:start position:0%
we have in front of us will be the
 
00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
commission's report okay the
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
commission's report will include The
 
00:12:59.470 --> 00:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
Minority Report as the first ATT
 
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
attachment and it will include the
 
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
bibliography now the the narratives on
 
00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
page uh um 2
 
00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:15.959 align:start position:0%
to8 addresses basically the the
 
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
testimony uh and uh the record from
 
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
those who appeared before
 
00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
us there are references to other
 
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
collateral documents court cases
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
articles in the findings all of which
 
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
and many more of those are included in
 
00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:34.110 align:start position:0%
and many more of those are included in
the

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
bibliography and unless the commission
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
members ask and decide to do this it's
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
not currently my intent to attach any
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
collateral documents like articles or
 
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
cases to the report but rather to let
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
the bibliography lead anybody who wants
 
00:13:55.629 --> 00:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
to go further to find them okay
 
00:13:55.639 --> 00:13:57.110 align:start position:0%
to go further to find them okay
representative

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
Valerie like you
 
00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
one or two
 
00:14:03.749 --> 00:14:03.759 align:start position:0%
papers had a little
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
practice and I noticed there were no
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
footnotes that's true so rather than the
 
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
footnoting we're putting this in the uh
 
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
um biblography at the end yes that's a
 
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
very good point
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
so references I did not write this like
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
a legal brief right uh where we cited a
 
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
court case I do give in parentheses in
 
00:14:32.509 --> 00:14:32.519 align:start position:0%
where we've quoted a given parentheses
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
the actual citation of that volume and
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
page for the US Supreme Court or for the
 
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court with respect
 
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
to those who testified in the record the
 
00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
references and the quotes are all to the
 
00:14:49.629 --> 00:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
body of what they physically presented
 
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
to us and that's in the record which of
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
course is also accessible on the general
 
00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.629 align:start position:0%
course is also accessible on the general
Court's

00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
Court's
 
00:14:58.829 --> 00:14:58.839 align:start position:0%
website um as far as external articles
 
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:01.240 align:start position:0%
are referred to the article the citation
 
00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
itself is in the bibliography and so
 
00:15:07.629 --> 00:15:07.639 align:start position:0%
there was no effort to uh indicate where
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
a quote came from a particular page but
 
00:15:13.749 --> 00:15:13.759 align:start position:0%
there is an effort to uh indicate what
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh speaker or what document that came
 
00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
from but so the the citations I think
 
00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:23.720 align:start position:0%
are loose in terms of you know if you
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
compare this to a legal uh opinion or a
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
scholarly article but uh but I believe
 
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:31.160 align:start position:0%
that they all do lead you exactly to
 
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
where those quotes came from yes Mr Wong
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you chair I just have a quick
 
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
question on the um the attachment that
 
00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
was sent out by Jen on Friday from
 
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
representative shanberg on the glossery
 
00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
of terms how is that going to be
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the uh the report I
 
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
haven't seen
 
00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:51.959 align:start position:0%
that that's one I was sent that last
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
week on Friday yeah
 
00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
sen she'll be bringing it in okay we'll
 
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
see that in a little bit and then I
 
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:07.949 --> 00:16:07.959 align:start position:0%
question I did not send direct to you I
 
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
sent I sent anything to Jen to send it
 
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
out whether she did or okay well that's
 
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
not something that I've seen but we will
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
see it this morning and so we can Circle
 
00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
back right okay good so
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
um and we don't need to labor this more
 
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
than you want to since you've all read
 
00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
it uh but uh in fact yeah I don't think
 
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
I need to actually read the bolded part
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
but let's go to number one the the point
 
00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
here is that while there was a statute
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
on the books from 81 to 86 on worldwide
 
00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
combined reporting that was never
 
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
implemented and so there is no actual
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
pre precedent for um this program in the
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
state despite the fact that it was on
 
00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:03.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
yes Mr Wong um thank you chair so um I'm
 
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
just going into the uh the the
 
00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:13.480 align:start position:0%
discussion in the uh below the bullet
 
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
point or below the bould boulder Point
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
um and I think it's uh based on the the
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
memo and this is in regards to New
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um not enforcing the um the
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting in terms in
 
00:17:34.029 --> 00:17:34.039 align:start position:0%
relations to uh foreign based multi
 
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
Corporation the letter of commissioner
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
price from had the letter from
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner price to the a white
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
unitary taxation World working group
 
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:43.640 align:start position:0%
task force back in
 
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
1983 um so I think that's fine because
 
00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
that's what's stated in in the letter um
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to check if um later down
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
on the in the middle of the uh the
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
section in the paragraph where it says
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh in the testimony from commissioner uh
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
commissioner price back in
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
1986 on the implementation of the the
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
waterers Edge limitation says right
 
00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
wrong or indifferent and then in in
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
Brackets in parenthesis the Dr never did
 
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
go totally worldwide um we never did tax
 
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
foreign dividends from foreign parents
 
00:18:25.149 --> 00:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
uh we never tax foreign parents um so I
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
wonder if if that would was me to say um
 
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire never did go
 
00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
worldwide supposed to the Dr never did
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
go totally worldwide um not sure if
 
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
that's uh more accurate are you asking
 
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
what's the we he's referring to yeah so
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
the in in parenthesis the Dr never did
 
00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
go worldwide so I wonder if that's
 
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's an added term in there from the
 
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
testimony okay so so this is a direct
 
00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
quote but you'll see in bracket the Dr
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
yeah because the word he used is we and
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
I just inserted using brackets the Dr
 
00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
because that's what he meant by wi okay
 
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if he meant the New
 
00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:08.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire never did go worldwide totally
 
00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
because that's what's his written
 
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
testimony was in he he did mean New
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but are you saying that you
 
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
think it should be stated New Hampshire
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
instead of the Dr that's my thought I'm
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
not the state rather than the the agency
 
00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:23.720 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I'm fine with that what does
 
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
the letter say itself it says uh on
 
00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
point number five New Hampshire takes
 
00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
the position that since the United
 
00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
States Supreme Court has never yet ruled
 
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
on the constitutionality of subjecting a
 
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
foreign based multinational corporation
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
doing business in the United States to
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting it will not
 
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
require nor accept a petition to file a
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
combined report let's just be clear that
 
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:50.799 align:start position:0%
that the the first of the quotes the one
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
you've just read again yeah comes from
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
the letter dated November 30th 1983
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
that's right and that's clearly cited
 
00:20:01.549 --> 00:20:01.559 align:start position:0%
here Y and the second quote comes from
 
00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
his testimony before the house Ways and
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
Means Committee on February 20th 1986
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
right right so I think the only question
 
00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:11.919 align:start position:0%
you're asking is where we're picking up
 
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
on his quote and it's saying we that you
 
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
feel more comfortable inserting that we
 
00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
means New Hampshire yeah so I'm not I
 
00:20:21.789 --> 00:20:21.799 align:start position:0%
wasn't present at that time I'm not sure
 
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
if he meant we as in the Dr or as in the
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
state I I don't need I don't think it
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
makes a big difference but I believe he
 
00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
was speaking as commissioner for the
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
agency right yeah so we know we know
 
00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:37.799 align:start position:0%
what the law said yeah but the agency
 
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
took a position and it wasn't even
 
00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
really just a matter of interpretation
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
it was a matter of policy
 
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
restraint not to enforce in a way that
 
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
was going to
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
attract constitutional litigation and
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
not to enforce in a way that was going
 
00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
to attract Congressional preemption at
 
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
the the federal level it's an an
 
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
interesting instance of an agency saying
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
we see what the law says but we aren't
 
00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:09.279 align:start position:0%
going there yeah Mr
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr price was no longer
 
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner at that time Mr ever Taylor
 
00:21:18.029 --> 00:21:18.039 align:start position:0%
was commissioner at that time
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
so he had been appointed he he had I
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
think he's speaking about the past tense
 
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
of this we never as a state back then
 
00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:32.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
yes and I think that's clear is that
 
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair I I can clarify if he was no
 
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
longer in the position that's easy to do
 
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
yeah then okay yeah okay good I'll make
 
00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:56.630 align:start position:0%
yeah then okay yeah okay good I'll make
that

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
change all right so the second nothing
 
00:22:02.269 --> 00:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
uh moving to worldwide combined
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
reporting would not be constitutionally
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
borrowed so we have a constitutional
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
discussion that takes in the container
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
and Barkley cases uh before the US
 
00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:14.039 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court I've added a quote from
 
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
Justice Brennan's majority opinion last
 
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
night which is uh colorful and um I just
 
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559 align:start position:0%
thought that this uh really adds to the
 
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
P you our sense of what the court was
 
00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.630 align:start position:0%
P you our sense of what the court was
thinking

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
allocating income among various taxing
 
00:22:32.669 --> 00:22:32.679 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions Bears some resemblance as
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
we have emphasized throughout this
 
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
opinion to slicing a shadow in the
 
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
absence of a central coordinating
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
Authority absolute consistency even
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
among taxing authorities whose basic
 
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
approach to the task is quite similar
 
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:48.440 align:start position:0%
may just be too much to
 
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
ask so I think that there's often a
 
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
sense amongst um
 
00:22:57.269 --> 00:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
Layman that uh the Commerce Clause of
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
the 14th amendment
 
00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:03.559 align:start position:0%
requires absolute zero
 
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
discrimination but this quote and the
 
00:23:08.269 --> 00:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
quote in the next paragraph from the New
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court's caterpillar
 
00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:13.720 align:start position:0%
decision are put in here to reflect the
 
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
fact that the courts acknowledge that
 
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:19.480 align:start position:0%
there's differential
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
treatment but they come to the
 
00:23:23.149 --> 00:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
conclusion that that differential
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
treatment is within a the range of
 
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable Behavior behavior and is not
 
00:23:32.909 --> 00:23:32.919 align:start position:0%
therefore discriminatory in the
 
00:23:32.919 --> 00:23:34.350 align:start position:0%
therefore discriminatory in the
Constitutional

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
Constitutional
 
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
sense discriminatory in the
 
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
Constitutional sense is not an absolute
 
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
term that requires that there be zero
 
00:23:44.669 --> 00:23:44.679 align:start position:0%
differentiation so in the next quote you
 
00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
see the latter
 
00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
uh the plaintiffs fail however to meet
 
00:23:55.789 --> 00:23:55.799 align:start position:0%
their burden in proving
 
00:23:58.149 --> 00:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
discrimination and uh although New
 
00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's unitary apportionment
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
formula may not apportion income
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
perfectly the Federal Constitution does
 
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:07.240 align:start position:0%
not require a mathematical exactitude
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
only a rough
 
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
approximation so they had said in the
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
earlier part of that that merely
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that there is differential
 
00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
treatment does not rise to a
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional problem with
 
00:24:24.669 --> 00:24:24.679 align:start position:0%
discrimination I thought these two
 
00:24:28.389 --> 00:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
quotes added a good bit to u to our
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
narrative and the justices were speaking
 
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
federally correct in the first quote at
 
00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
the top of page 10 that's Justice branon
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
uh which is indicated at the bottom of
 
00:24:41.389 --> 00:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
page nine for the Supreme Court in the
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
quotation set off in the middle of page
 
00:24:46.389 --> 00:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
10 uh that's the New Hampshire Supreme
 
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
Court in caterpillar
 
00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.909 align:start position:0%
Court in caterpillar
okay

00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh anything further on
 
00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
this constitutional BAS basically what
 
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional discussion says is
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
we're not constrained one way or the
 
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
other that isn't the
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
problem okay number three simple and
 
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
exists I've added uh there are four
 
00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
paragraphs here three of these were
 
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:21.640 align:start position:0%
provided by um Matt and Kevin Mr Foley
 
00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:25.559 align:start position:0%
Mr Kennedy excuse me and then I added
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
the second paragraph Yes yesterday the
 
00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of the second paragraph is to
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
reflect the comments that Mr Kennedy was
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
making at the end of our meeting last
 
00:25:38.909 --> 00:25:38.919 align:start position:0%
week and I'll just read them quickly it
 
00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
must be emphasized that transfer pricing
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
is not inherently bad in fact it's
 
00:25:46.909 --> 00:25:46.919 align:start position:0%
actually necessary and even mandatory it
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
is common in distributing the economic
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
burdens for shared economic benefits
 
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
across a range of Affiliated entities of
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
a variety of expenses or Investments
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
incurred for research and development
 
00:25:59.870 --> 00:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
intellectual property shared brand
 
00:26:01.789 --> 00:26:01.799 align:start position:0%
development and marketing and a broad
 
00:26:04.269 --> 00:26:04.279 align:start position:0%
range of other expenditures particularly
 
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
intangibles these are the same sort of
 
00:26:08.909 --> 00:26:08.919 align:start position:0%
benefits procured at a cost from
 
00:26:10.909 --> 00:26:10.919 align:start position:0%
non-affiliated or arms length suppliers
 
00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
of goods and services a clear analogy
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
can be found in the normal practice of
 
00:26:18.669 --> 00:26:18.679 align:start position:0%
franchise operations in which the
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
franchisee contractually commits to
 
00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
share in a variety of expenses and
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
Investments made by the franchise or so
 
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
that's new language as of last night
 
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
Mr Foley does that fit with everything
 
00:26:33.389 --> 00:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
that you've
 
00:26:36.669 --> 00:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
okay good sorry labor that I just wanted
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
to you know I did say in my memo last
 
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
night that anything that got added late
 
00:26:42.389 --> 00:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
on I would point
 
00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
to so we're good with three number four
 
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
transfer pricing May create an unlevel
 
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.710 align:start position:0%
transfer pricing May create an unlevel
playing

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
playing
 
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
field and I think this is very uh
 
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
important because three and four
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
acknowledge core beliefs of the
 
00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:14.200 align:start position:0%
truths yes representative Valerie while
 
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
it's unknown what level exists I believe
 
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
we also discuss that it's
 
00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.950 align:start position:0%
we also discuss that it's
unknowable

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
unknowable
 
00:27:27.149 --> 00:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
correct correct and um in number six
 
00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
you'll find that the caption has been uh
 
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
amended to include the last three words
 
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
method is unknown and probably
 
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
unknowable and I'm just suggesting that
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
perhaps in uh par paragraph three that
 
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:46.120 align:start position:0%
uh in the U second sentence at the
 
00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.039 align:start position:0%
beginning it is unknown comma and
 
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
unknowable and likely
 
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
unknowable I'm fine with that everyone
 
00:28:07.509 --> 00:28:07.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:19.039 align:start position:0%
good so that's in the first paragraph of
 
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:30.590 align:start position:0%
 
line

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
four says three are you using the same
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
sheet as the rest of
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
us Jordan your papers are down there
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:49.389 --> 00:28:49.399 align:start position:0%
version that seems to be where you've
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
been hanging
 
00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:55.039 align:start position:0%
out sorry I thought that was your
 
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
address that was a very funny joke Mr
 
00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:03.029 align:start position:0%
address that was a very funny joke Mr
chairman

00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:03.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
okay if you're saying it was in number
 
00:29:07.149 --> 00:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
three all I I went around the corner of
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
my barn during the weekend when I was
 
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
doing yard work and on the back door of
 
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
an unoccupied Barn I found a FedEx
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
package at the door it was addressed to
 
00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
somebody with a different number on a
 
00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:21.950 align:start position:0%
somebody with a different number on a
different

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
street so I took it over to her so we we
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
got to stay on our toes so it's going to
 
00:29:29.549 --> 00:29:29.559 align:start position:0%
be on number four it's number four okay
 
00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:39.789 --> 00:29:39.799 align:start position:0%
you all right uh so to the top of page
 
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:51.640 align:start position:0%
five um New Hampshire currently taxes
 
00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
for an income generated by businesses
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
subject to the business profits
 
00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
tax so this hits the foreign dividends
 
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
guilty not to C some words here but it
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
says taxes foreign income is generated
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
by business subject to the business
 
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
profits tax that would be only us
 
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
multinational corporations here in the
 
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
correct you saying all porn income
 
00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.990 align:start position:0%
correct you saying all porn income
generated

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
generated
 
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.430 align:start position:0%
generated
All

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
All
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
Foreign Mr Foley help me with this it's
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
all foreign income that is repatriated
 
00:30:39.509 --> 00:30:39.519 align:start position:0%
to the United
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
States and I could imagine that a
 
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
foreign parent might have a subsidiary
 
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
in the United States that might have a
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
further sub subsidiary in a foreign
 
00:30:53.669 --> 00:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
country so I think generalizing doesn't
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
work it's it's from any of these uh
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
foreign Affiliates of a unitary
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
group to the extent that the funds are
 
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:06.200 align:start position:0%
repatriated into the
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
US okay is that fair okay I so I believe
 
00:31:13.389 --> 00:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
we're accurately stated
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative yeah and at the
 
00:31:18.269 --> 00:31:18.279 align:start position:0%
same time we do not need to continually
 
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
use New Hampshire because somebody
 
00:31:22.509 --> 00:31:22.519 align:start position:0%
created a glossery of
 
00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
terms without uh that was part of mine
 
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
00:31:30.909 --> 00:31:30.919 align:start position:0%
and I I think that glosy of terms is
 
00:31:33.789 --> 00:31:33.799 align:start position:0%
something that uh should be lted just a
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
little bit or comment made as to its
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
appropriateness to for
 
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
inclusion okay so you'll address that in
 
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
a little bit or you want to address it
 
00:31:46.629 --> 00:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
right now okay just saying this is a
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
it it came to the front of my mind so I
 
00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:55.799 align:start position:0%
said it yes
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
and represent Senator shamber let's pass
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
it last p in I think
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
is okay and representative oler have you
 
00:32:17.549 --> 00:32:17.559 align:start position:0%
had a chance to read this Glasser I
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
glanced over it last night yeah and does
 
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
you didn't that I okay first re exam so
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
arms length principle unitary business
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:38.200 align:start position:0%
reporting and we had some discussion
 
00:32:41.549 --> 00:32:41.559 align:start position:0%
last week on that kind of uh topic about
 
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
the use of the term transfer pricing
 
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
which is a term of Art in the accounting
 
00:32:49.149 --> 00:32:49.159 align:start position:0%
World versus
 
00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
using certain other terms like profit
 
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
shifting or abusive that you'll find in
 
00:32:59.870 --> 00:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
quotes in several places where they've
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
been used so where an advocate has used
 
00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
them it's part of what they told us
 
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
where the report uses those terms there
 
00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.230 align:start position:0%
where the report uses those terms there
in

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:33:10.669 --> 00:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
quotations and as we learned the
 
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
transfer price uh the soall transfer
 
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
pricing is merely the transfer of a
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
fungible um resource available to any
 
00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
Corporation engaged in that particular
 
00:33:25.629 --> 00:33:25.639 align:start position:0%
activity it's not done by a particular
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
corporation for particular purpose
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
exactly it's it's it's an accounting
 
00:33:31.039 --> 00:33:32.190 align:start position:0%
exactly it's it's it's an accounting
entry

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:32.200 align:start position:0%
entry
 
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
and usually a transfer of funds between
 
00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:38.149 align:start position:0%
and usually a transfer of funds between
Affiliated

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:42.559 align:start position:0%
entities okay um finding number six the
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
revenue impact of changing to the
 
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting method is
 
00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.870 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting method is
yes

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
represent are we gon just for the
 
00:33:52.509 --> 00:33:52.519 align:start position:0%
minutes here where are we going to
 
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
include this will just be are we going
 
00:33:56.629 --> 00:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
to include those definitions in there is
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
that what you want no okay thank you
 
00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:02.629 align:start position:0%
that what you want no okay thank you
that's

00:34:02.629 --> 00:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:08.589 --> 00:34:08.599 align:start position:0%
good okay yep so finding number six uh
 
00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:10.919 align:start position:0%
any comments
 
00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:14.200 align:start position:0%
here and again this
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
unknowable Mr je yes this particular
 
00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
paragraph does uh clear out the uh
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
confusion or not confusion it eliminates
 
00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
any source of confusion that the
 
00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
transfer the transfer pricing is purely
 
00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
for X purpose as opposed to merely
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
existing thank you okay yes I think
 
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's certainly the
 
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:54.839 align:start position:0%
purpose okay other
 
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
finding number seven uh was newly
 
00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.230 align:start position:0%
finding number seven uh was newly
included

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:05.240 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh and uh so this goes beyond
 
00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
the portion of the findings that were
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
prepared by Mr fly Mr Kennedy and comes
 
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:15.640 align:start position:0%
from our
 
00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:18.200 align:start position:0%
discussions at least four other states
 
00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:20.440 align:start position:0%
in the past half dozen years or so have
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
evaluated proposals to adopt wwcr and
 
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
have rejected these proposals so this is
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
a very brief r view of recent
 
00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:33.640 align:start position:0%
um uh proposals that were in the state
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
of Indiana Minnesota Maine and Rhode
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
Island and uh the purpose here is to
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
reflect that the commission is well
 
00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
aware of proposals and discussions in
 
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
other states we're not
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
alone also to
 
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
distinguish those proposals from what's
 
00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:57.309 align:start position:0%
distinguish those proposals from what's
being

00:35:57.309 --> 00:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh considered here and characterize them
 
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
very briefly in about a sentence each
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
and ultimately to draw the conclusion
 
00:36:10.349 --> 00:36:10.359 align:start position:0%
that in the 40 years or so that uh uh
 
00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about there has been
 
00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
no state that has reverted to worldwide
 
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
combined reporting and no current
 
00:36:20.309 --> 00:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
direction Al are we set on that
 
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
one and finally uh finding eight also
 
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
has been added uh to reflect the
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
commission's discussions the commission
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
has heard of no credible methodology for
 
00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
effectively estimating the potential
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
state tax revenue to be gained from
 
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
wwcr and has concluded that any
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
estimates of which we are aware
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
represent broad conjecture without a
 
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
sound factual
 
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
foundation and this
 
00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
cites the study by uh Institute on
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
Taxation and economic policy itep as
 
00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
well as the rebuttal
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
from the tax
 
00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:02.200 align:start position:0%
Foundation anybody who wants to delve
 
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
into this there's direct citations of
 
00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:05.390 align:start position:0%
into this there's direct citations of
those

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
articles and uh it does not attempt to
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
um weigh in on and participate in the
 
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
debate just to draw the conclusion that
 
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
there is no consensus on how a State
 
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
might even rationally approach an effort
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
to estimate the impact on potential tax
 
00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
revenues may I bring something up
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
it you said it has re it is not there is
 
00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
no conclusion yet the statement has has
 
00:37:39.309 --> 00:37:39.319 align:start position:0%
heard of no credible
 
00:37:42.309 --> 00:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
methodology doesn't that say
 
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
that the reports that have been uh
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
developed are you saying that they are
 
00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.790 align:start position:0%
developed are you saying that they are
not

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
credible yes and you're saying that the
 
00:37:57.069 --> 00:37:57.079 align:start position:0%
tax foundations the tax found
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
foundation's position is the credible
 
00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:01.640 align:start position:0%
one that's that's the impression I'm
 
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
getting here yes on the first no on the
 
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.230 align:start position:0%
getting here yes on the first no on the
second

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
so what this says it reflects certainly
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
my conclusion that the tax Foundation
 
00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.030 align:start position:0%
my conclusion that the tax Foundation
has

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.950 align:start position:0%
has
effectively

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
demolished the itep estimates what the
 
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
tax Foundation has not done is
 
00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:26.079 align:start position:0%
identified an alternative method so
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
what's been
 
00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
offered as estimates are not
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
credible and we lack any credible
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
alternative we don't
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
have um the commission has heard of no
 
00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.670 align:start position:0%
have um the commission has heard of no
credible

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:45.880 align:start position:0%
methodology and has concluded any
 
00:38:48.309 --> 00:38:48.319 align:start position:0%
estimates of which we're aware represent
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
broad conve conjecture without a sound
 
00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
factual foundation so it's it's not that
 
00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:57.400 align:start position:0%
the tax Foundation has given us a way of
 
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
estimating it's simply shown us that one
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
particular effort to
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
it the words that the tax Foundation
 
00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:22.349 --> 00:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
believe they used words versus
 
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
finding the methodology of the it or uh
 
00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
methodology they have shown where is
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
that methodology wrong I don't think
 
00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
they've shown that the tax Foundation
 
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
that's why I I just sort of disagree
 
00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:41.480 align:start position:0%
with the when you say no credible
 
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
methodology you're taking
 
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
one organization that says this
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
methodology is completely wrong it
 
00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't have its foundations
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
downright uh maybe it's the word no
 
00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
credible methodology that's got me stuck
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
on this right now because I believe that
 
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
are are appropriate or are good until
 
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
someone can actually show
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
using data using a methodology to show
 
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
me why is it wrong why is it not so I
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
think we have two two choices here um
 
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
one is uh you know again the the
 
00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
certainly it's been the effort to make
 
00:40:27.309 --> 00:40:27.319 align:start position:0%
sure that the
 
00:40:32.349 --> 00:40:32.359 align:start position:0%
findings speak for all of us but uh um
 
00:40:34.589 --> 00:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
this is uh you know perhaps one of those
 
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
things that representative shamberg may
 
00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
want to address in his Minority Report
 
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
if the rest of us agree on the other
 
00:40:44.589 --> 00:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
hand if we want to make a modification
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
we can do that so I look to other
 
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
members to react to What representative
 
00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
shamberg has just said um my personal
 
00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.470 align:start position:0%
shamberg has just said um my personal
view

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
view
 
00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
is the tax found foundation's analysis
 
00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
of the itep
 
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
estimates is absolutely
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
convincing and demonstrates that the ITP
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
effort is not
 
00:41:12.829 --> 00:41:12.839 align:start position:0%
credible and that's what this finding is
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
intending to say that's fairly strong
 
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
but it it's not so much that we're
 
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
indict uh itep or any particular effort
 
00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
it's simply to say that as we look
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
across the um you know the universe we
 
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:33.160 align:start position:0%
see nothing that gives us something that
 
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
upon okay representative all did want to
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
add no the the line the sentence that
 
00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
you just used sounds like something that
 
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
um if you can remember
 
00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:56.440 align:start position:0%
it uh might resolve the uh arguments
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
that representative shamberg is
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
attempting to to raise here uh as that
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
it indicates This research versus that
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
research This research resounds better
 
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
than that
 
00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:12.280 align:start position:0%
research and that may just be
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
phraseology that would be appropriate
 
00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
sir so I'm willing to uh
 
00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
um look at softening the words a little
 
00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:24.079 align:start position:0%
bit so it doesn't sound like it's
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
intended to be damning
 
00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
but uh before I do that representative
 
00:42:32.589 --> 00:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
shamberg would that satisfy you
 
00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
or if you can make it not sound so as
 
00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
you say
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
damaging because I I I remember us we
 
00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
had a
 
00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
um Michael maerov gave us a piece when
 
00:42:49.069 --> 00:42:49.079 align:start position:0%
he was talking about profit let see here
 
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
this is this is in a private I mean a
 
00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
prior session of the yeah legislature he
 
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
had mentioned that
 
00:42:58.829 --> 00:42:58.839 align:start position:0%
independent California estimate a
 
00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
potential gain from the wwcr is actually
 
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
larger than the it study so there's
 
00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
other studies out
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
there somehow if we
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
can make this as you say not so damaging
 
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
so um the maerov I'm I'm aware of him
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
and some of his work just from the
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
collateral readings I've done but it's
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
not part of the record of this
 
00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:25.640 align:start position:0%
commission and uh that doesn't preclude
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
you from from mentioning it in your
 
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
minority but you would want to indicate
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
you know where you're drawing that
 
00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:36.950 align:start position:0%
you know where you're drawing that
information

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
from do you
 
00:43:42.829 --> 00:43:42.839 align:start position:0%
have give me a moment uh here to just
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.079 --> 00:43:59.390 align:start position:0%
 
it

00:43:59.390 --> 00:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
well is are we hung up on the word
 
00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:06.280 align:start position:0%
credible or is it deeper than that no I
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
workable sounds good okay everyone's
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:29.109 --> 00:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
right good then um thank
 
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
you so I I think that uh for anybody who
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
you know is coming to this uh
 
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
commission's report from the
 
00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
outside and uh they're looking at it you
 
00:44:46.109 --> 00:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
know to really pick the meat out of it
 
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
and scan through it they jump right past
 
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
the findings and testimon I mean that
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
rather the testimony and record and they
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
come to these bolded passages and they
 
00:44:58.829 --> 00:44:58.839 align:start position:0%
just read the eight findings I think
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
they get a very good idea of what we
 
00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
determined and again I want to give a
 
00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
lot of thanks to uh Mr Foley and Mr
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
up um now the uh I think that the
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
remaining part of the findings are less
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
likely to require discussion but uh
 
00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
let's just quickly so the mitigating
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
factors are the reduction of the federal
 
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 and the
 
00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
introduction of guilty that both
 
00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
occurred in
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
2017 as part of the tax cuts and jobs
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
act um the third grouping is the uh
 
00:45:45.069 --> 00:45:45.079 align:start position:0%
arguments in support
 
00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
against uh I believe these are virtually
 
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
unedited from uh the draft provided by
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
Mr Foley and Mr Kennedy and I'm s
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
satisfied with those as being a very
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
crisp reduction not all Arguments for
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
and against but those that uh that are
 
00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
pivotal now that takes us to the
 
00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
analysis now of course the analysis is
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
where we actually take a stand as a
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
commission and this is where um the U
 
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
Minority Report will diverge um I tried
 
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
to be uh very brief
 
00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
and uh just you know bring it down to uh
 
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
to rationale so not to repeat what's
 
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
already been stated in the findings and
 
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:39.640 align:start position:0%
so we have uh what two five
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
paragraphs um I did a little bit of
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
addition to this last
 
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
night um I would point in particular to
 
00:46:52.829 --> 00:46:52.839 align:start position:0%
the last paragraph that's completely new
 
00:46:56.069 --> 00:46:56.079 align:start position:0%
last night all methods of apportionment
 
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
just like Geographic or separate entity
 
00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:00.200 align:start position:0%
accounting are
 
00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
imperfect that's essentially what the
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
courts um from Brennan's passage and
 
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire caterpillar case
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
passage acknowledge they are proxies
 
00:47:15.549 --> 00:47:15.559 align:start position:0%
devices methodologies for triangulating
 
00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:18.839 align:start position:0%
in on a fair share taxation they all
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
embody trade-offs and merely pointing to
 
00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
a flaw or limitation in any one method
 
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
does not signify that any the other
 
00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
method will achieve a better result
 
00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:30.520 align:start position:0%
there will be tradeoffs there will be
 
00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
winners and losers amongst taxpayers and
 
00:47:34.829 --> 00:47:34.839 align:start position:0%
there will be gains and losses for the
 
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
state but there's no generalization that
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
will forecast reasonably how these will
 
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
play out in practice prospectively at
 
00:47:44.589 --> 00:47:44.599 align:start position:0%
the end of the discussion on balance the
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
commission finds that there is
 
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:47.839 align:start position:0%
insufficient evidence to make such a
 
00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:49.240 align:start position:0%
radical change in New Hampshire's
 
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
business tax policy as
 
00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:54.680 align:start position:0%
wwcr given the many implications clearly
 
00:48:02.109 --> 00:48:02.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
equation okay does anybody have anything
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
analysis and the
 
00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:17.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh the purpose is to be
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely succinct number one we
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
recommend that New Hampshire not proceed
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
with wwcr
 
00:48:29.549 --> 00:48:29.559 align:start position:0%
and therefore not with HB
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
1221 and we acknowledge in the second
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation while the commission does
 
00:48:37.549 --> 00:48:37.559 align:start position:0%
not recommend further study at this
 
00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
time the commission notes that there may
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
in the future be alternative means
 
00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:43.240 align:start position:0%
available to the state of New Hampshire
 
00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
to address the incentives a unitary
 
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
business might have to abuse transfer
 
00:48:48.069 --> 00:48:48.079 align:start position:0%
pricing methods for the purpose of
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
Shifting tax this is again I think very
 
00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
much trying to incorporate uh Mr
 
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
Kennedy's very constructive comment that
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
we go One Step Beyond merely saying
 
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
don't adopt worldwide combin reporting
 
00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
and acknowledge that there may still be
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
developments in the future that we
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
become aware of especially if there is
 
00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
level yes Mr Wong um this is a question
 
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
from a uh process standpoint so the Dr
 
00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
being neutral and not having a position
 
00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:26.680 align:start position:0%
on either way um whe going with
 
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:28.559 align:start position:0%
Worldwide combin reporting or not and
 
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
then the U the recommendations and the
 
00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
analysis of the report is mainly
 
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
proposing to
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
um to that that's not sufficient
 
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
information to change the
 
00:49:44.789 --> 00:49:44.799 align:start position:0%
um uh the current I guess taxing
 
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
position uh for for business profits tax
 
00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:49.430 align:start position:0%
position uh for for business profits tax
purposes

00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:54.510 align:start position:0%
 
believe

00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.710 align:start position:0%
believe
um

00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:59.870 --> 00:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
I might have to just check in but just
 
00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:03.160 align:start position:0%
in case if if we find that if Dr thinks
 
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
that we're not able to sort
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
of stand in that position because just
 
00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:12.200 align:start position:0%
to that might uh that
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
might might sort of put us in a position
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
to say that oh uh the Dr does not
 
00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:19.480 align:start position:0%
approve of worldwide combined reporting
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
so we're not sort of jeopardizing our
 
00:50:23.549 --> 00:50:23.559 align:start position:0%
neutral position H how would we go about
 
00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
doing that okay that's a very good
 
00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:29.480 align:start position:0%
question it's one I've been anticipating
 
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
um and uh I think maybe it would be a
 
00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
good idea for me to phone and have a
 
00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
brief conversation with commissioner
 
00:50:39.789 --> 00:50:39.799 align:start position:0%
stepp just to make sure I I know exactly
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh how she uh feels about It ultimately
 
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
it's your judgment I think that uh on
 
00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
one hand you wear the hat of the dr's
 
00:50:49.789 --> 00:50:49.799 align:start position:0%
representative on the other hand you're
 
00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:51.160 align:start position:0%
a member of the commission who's
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
participated in the findings if you come
 
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:50:58.630 --> 00:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
conclusion that let's just say for
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
example that the drra stands behind
 
00:51:03.549 --> 00:51:03.559 align:start position:0%
every aspect of the
 
00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:06.559 align:start position:0%
report accepting that it takes no stance
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
on the recommendation itself I think a
 
00:51:11.349 --> 00:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
supplemental statement to that
 
00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:13.640 align:start position:0%
effect would just be
 
00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:16.349 align:start position:0%
effect would just be
attached

00:51:16.349 --> 00:51:16.359 align:start position:0%
attached
 
00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:19.839 align:start position:0%
right think think of it this way in a
 
00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
court uh you have a majority position
 
00:51:23.789 --> 00:51:23.799 align:start position:0%
you have a minority you also have what
 
00:51:27.069 --> 00:51:27.079 align:start position:0%
are called concurring opinions right uh
 
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
and sometimes uh concurring opinions say
 
00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
I uh you know um agree in part and
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
descent in part whatever so so I think
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
you can
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
qualify uh your signing on still
 
00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:43.240 align:start position:0%
represents the U report of the
 
00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
commission representative Valerie if if
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
I may address Mr Wong
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
um having seen the reports and of other
 
00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
commissions and participated in other
 
00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
commissions agencies routinely
 
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
participating commissions because of
 
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
the effect of what that Commission
 
00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:05.240 align:start position:0%
report may have upon the operation of
 
00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
the agency within the state un and it is
 
00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
understood that the agency does what the
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
agency's told to do by
 
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
law the only thing that the agency is
 
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
doing is making input as to
 
00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
their understanding of the effects not
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
whether they agree or dis disagree but
 
00:52:28.589 --> 00:52:28.599 align:start position:0%
their understanding of the effects so
 
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
when if you sign off on this report with
 
00:52:32.829 --> 00:52:32.839 align:start position:0%
or without a modification you're only
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
signing off that the agency has made
 
00:52:38.789 --> 00:52:38.799 align:start position:0%
input this and the agency agrees with
 
00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
the general analysis not that they are
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
advocating for one position or the other
 
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
position particularly since we have an
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
opposing position present so I think
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
that's valuable and key not to twist
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
your arm one way or the other but um I
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
defer to the Judgment that you reach uh
 
00:53:00.109 --> 00:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
with the commissioner but I would
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
suggest just keep in mind our
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation does not recommend action
 
00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
it recommends not action right so you I
 
00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
I think there is there is a way in which
 
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
it could be viewed as a neutral position
 
00:53:18.789 --> 00:53:18.799 align:start position:0%
to not change current law and uh you
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
know and we're also not recommending
 
00:53:23.549 --> 00:53:23.559 align:start position:0%
some specific follow on representative
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
shamberg when you said does not
 
00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
recommend action it says here we
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
recommend that the pending Bill be voted
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate does that put
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
the Dr into a a position that maybe
 
00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:37.720 align:start position:0%
should be discussed with the
 
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:39.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner well that's precisely what
 
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
we just said it it puts them in a
 
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
position of discussing it with the
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner and deciding what they're
 
00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:48.510 align:start position:0%
commissioner and deciding what they're
comfortable

00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
with so if when we vote
 
00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
today will the Dr have to make a vote
 
00:53:58.829 --> 00:53:58.839 align:start position:0%
vote on what's here right
 
00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:01.880 align:start position:0%
now yes because other we don't have
 
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
a the answer is yes I'm going to ask
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
everyone for an approval of the report
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
subject to several edits that we've made
 
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
and if the drra then feels that it needs
 
00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
to qualify uh its position it can do
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
that uh with a supplemental statement
 
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
that will be incorporated in just as The
 
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
Minority Report will be is that fair
 
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.150 align:start position:0%
Minority Report will be is that fair
yeah

00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:32.109 --> 00:54:32.119 align:start position:0%
okay okay so we we've we've marched
 
00:54:34.589 --> 00:54:34.599 align:start position:0%
through the findings the analysis and
 
00:54:38.349 --> 00:54:38.359 align:start position:0%
the recommendations but let's just pause
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
and uh take in further comments I know
 
00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:44.440 align:start position:0%
there's got to be some yes Mr W just one
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
more comment uh back to point number six
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
um the revenue impact of the worldwide
 
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
combine reporting uh for a point a um
 
00:54:56.589 --> 00:54:56.599 align:start position:0%
says that the Dr does not have the
 
00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
capability to determine the uh the
 
00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
amount of tax generated by the state's
 
00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
current method of taxing foreign income
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
um not sure if if the uh the word
 
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
capability is um an accurate
 
00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
representation uh is that the certain
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
fields in the um in the form are not
 
00:55:21.789 --> 00:55:21.799 align:start position:0%
currently mapped by the system and so
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
um if we map those fields be able to
 
00:55:31.029 --> 00:55:31.039 align:start position:0%
um calculate the the tax impact but
 
00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
currently it's not mapped and if we do
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
it now we won't have the data from the
 
00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
previous uh returns that we submitted
 
00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
you you're M you're making a a good
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
technical Point um so this is on page 12
 
00:55:48.029 --> 00:55:48.039 align:start position:0%
6A um and and you're highlighting the
 
00:55:50.309 --> 00:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
capability maybe it's not a lack of
 
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
capability but a lack of I'm glad to
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
have you supply me some words that would
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
make this more specifically accurate I
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
just a little editorial
 
00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
sidebar nothing's impossible right I was
 
00:56:10.029 --> 00:56:10.039 align:start position:0%
horrified when I was reading the Rhode
 
00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:14.200 align:start position:0%
Island uh study this 90 page study at
 
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
what they did to their taxpayers
 
00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
apparently if I'm understanding it
 
00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:21.400 align:start position:0%
correctly they required every business
 
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
tax filer in Rhode Island to prepare two
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
additional Pro
 
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
forers so that's a unitary filing state
 
00:56:35.789 --> 00:56:35.799 align:start position:0%
and for two tax years as a Prelude to
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
the study their way of trying to get you
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
know the data that we were discussing
 
00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
before was to require the the the filers
 
00:56:47.589 --> 00:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
to prepare three tax
 
00:56:51.789 --> 00:56:51.799 align:start position:0%
returns and file one as their official
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
return and file two more on an
 
00:56:58.750 --> 00:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
information basis just so that the state
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
could get data and start to track it I
 
00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
mean wow that if that was something that
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
somebody here proposed I would be an
 
00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:10.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
no yes representative oler uh would
 
00:57:18.549 --> 00:57:18.559 align:start position:0%
representative would Mr Wong be um
 
00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
um amiable to inserting the word
 
00:57:24.270 --> 00:57:24.280 align:start position:0%
currently in that sentence which
 
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
indicates possibility of future
 
00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
modification right uh probably something
 
00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:31.640 align:start position:0%
like currently unable to fully determine
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
um yes the amount
 
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
um uh of tax generated by the state's
 
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
current method of tax so the New
 
00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:40.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Revenue
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
Administration is not currently able is
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
that where you're going yeah it's not
 
00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
currently able to fully determine uh the
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.799 --> 00:57:58.029 align:start position:0%
 
generated

00:57:58.029 --> 00:57:58.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
so we're we're merely striking out does
 
00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
not have the capability and putting in
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:13.029 --> 00:58:13.039 align:start position:0%
me representative Valery no that's oh
 
00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
okay that was an accent Ascent
 
00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:19.789 align:start position:0%
okay that was an accent Ascent
okay

00:58:19.789 --> 00:58:19.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:22.109 --> 00:58:22.119 align:start position:0%
good well thank you for giving me the
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
latitude to do a lot of drafting against
 
00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
thank you to Mr foing Mr Kennedy for
 
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
giving me the meat of the
 
00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:33.349 align:start position:0%
giving me the meat of the
findings

00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:36.069 --> 00:58:36.079 align:start position:0%
um I'll look around once more to see if
 
00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
there are further comments and uh then
 
00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
I'll turn it over to representative
 
00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
shamberg for anything he might want to
 
00:58:44.109 --> 00:58:44.119 align:start position:0%
say I haven't read his current uh report
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
but it stands on its own it's his
 
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:54.400 align:start position:0%

uh one of the items that was just
 
00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
delivered is the minority
 
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
position uh it's a
 
00:59:40.349 --> 00:59:40.359 align:start position:0%
seven page seven pages long and I do not
 
00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:43.720 align:start position:0%
think there was much change other
 
00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
than I can't remember any of the changes
 
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440 align:start position:0%

01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
is when representative shamberg asked
 
01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
genen 4 to circulate it so was it was
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
not directed to me although it is
 
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:13.640 align:start position:0%
so okay and
 
01:01:17.069 --> 01:01:17.079 align:start position:0%
concerning I'm sorry what okay
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
concerning uh the report today I had uh
 
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
developed a response
 
01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
from a little excerpt from an earlier
 
01:01:31.950 --> 01:01:31.960 align:start position:0%
note you sent out to us and I did not
 
01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
see your final report till 9:15 last
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
night when I had finished my so but I
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
think I hit the points that you have
 
01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
brought up today uh in regard to The
 
01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
Minority Report versus various position
 
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
statements of the
 
01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
majority The Minority Report responds
 
01:01:53.269 --> 01:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
that there is a flaw in the waters edge
 
01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
method that shows Dom domestic New
 
01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses have been competing
 
01:02:00.430 --> 01:02:00.440 align:start position:0%
at an economic disadvantage since 1986
 
01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
with foreign multinational corporations
 
01:02:05.269 --> 01:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
which allow these organizations to
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
reduce their tax liability no matter how
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
much business they do in the granite
 
01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:13.720 align:start position:0%
state and as a result domestic companies
 
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
face a disportionate disproportionate
 
01:02:19.390 --> 01:02:19.400 align:start position:0%
tax liability while the state is losing
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
Revenue to pay for State services and
 
01:02:24.589 --> 01:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
what supports the minority position the
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
statements first the majority and
 
01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
minority in statements and in written
 
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
form say that transfer pricing exist
 
01:02:35.269 --> 01:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
that transfer pricing and profit
 
01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
shifting exist but at an unknown levels
 
01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:41.480 align:start position:0%
and amounts and that transfer pricing
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
May create an unlevel playing field the
 
01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:47.720 align:start position:0%
second support statement from reporting
 
01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
sources articles submitted for review by
 
01:02:52.589 --> 01:02:52.599 align:start position:0%
this commission from the tax Justice
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
Network CNN tax games it and others
 
01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:00.079 align:start position:0%

01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
liability a third source of support for
 
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
the minority
 
01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:12.799 align:start position:0%
position is the IRS that just launched
 
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
ir-2 23-1 194 new initiatives using the
 
01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
inflation reduction act funding to
 
01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
ensure large corporations pay taxes owed
 
01:03:27.309 --> 01:03:27.319 align:start position:0%
this includes large foreign owned
 
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
corporations transfer pricing initiative
 
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
these foreign companies report losses or
 
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
exceedingly low margins year after year
 
01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:39.160 align:start position:0%
through the improper use of transfer
 
01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
pricing to avoid reporting appropriate
 
01:03:45.269 --> 01:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
amounts of us profits to the US
 
01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
government if this is happening at the
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
federal level with these foreign
 
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
multinationals who have substantial
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries like New Hampshire does
 
01:03:58.510 --> 01:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
with 424 at last count there is a saying
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
where there is smoke there is a
 
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
fire these mentioned sources from above
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
at least indicate there is an unlevel
 
01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
playing field that can be applied to New
 
01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire domestic businesses who pay BP
 
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
taxes on 100% of their taxable profits
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
when the provisions of Water's Edge
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
allow foreign
 
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
multinationals with subsidiaries to
 
01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
obscure the full picture of their
 
01:04:28.109 --> 01:04:28.119 align:start position:0%
activities in New Hampshire and from the
 
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
Dr because these companies are not
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
required to account for their operations
 
01:04:36.829 --> 01:04:36.839 align:start position:0%
outside the United States Beyond Water's
 
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
Edge my friend the chair of this
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
commission should have been a football
 
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
coach because of the plays that can be
 
01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
called in a
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
game I knew I get knew I get a little a
 
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
of you one play that a coach that is
 
01:04:55.549 --> 01:04:55.559 align:start position:0%
called by coach
 
01:04:55.559 --> 01:04:57.150 align:start position:0%
called by coach
is

01:04:57.150 --> 01:04:57.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:04:59.470 --> 01:04:59.480 align:start position:0%
misdirection getting players to go one
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
way while the ball carrier is going
 
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
another way in the 1999 caterpillar Inc
 
01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
versus New Hampshire Dr the appeal
 
01:05:11.109 --> 01:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
involved only questions of federal
 
01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional law especially the
 
01:05:16.109 --> 01:05:16.119 align:start position:0%
Commerce cause and if royalty and
 
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
interest payments by Foreign members to
 
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
domestic members are to be included as
 
01:05:24.829 --> 01:05:24.839 align:start position:0%
income of the waters's edge group group
 
01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
because they represent value earned by
 
01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
The Waters Edge group that is not
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
otherwise captured the answer was it is
 
01:05:35.829 --> 01:05:35.839 align:start position:0%
taxable and reported under the water's
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
edge and not in violation of the
 
01:05:41.789 --> 01:05:41.799 align:start position:0%
Commerce cause yet the misdirection play
 
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
of the majority is trying to argue that
 
01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
The Waters Edge method is not
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional in regard to foreign
 
01:05:51.630 --> 01:05:51.640 align:start position:0%
affiliates with subsidiaries in the
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
United States the New Hampshire Supreme
 
01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
Court said the nature of the Waters Edge
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
formula requires that foreign
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries be treated differently from
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
domestic subsidiaries most
 
01:06:09.269 --> 01:06:09.279 align:start position:0%
significantly the latter income is
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
subject to taxation while the former's
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
income is not close quote the New
 
01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:17.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Court also said in the same
 
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
case quote in 1986 the legislature
 
01:06:23.349 --> 01:06:23.359 align:start position:0%
adopted The Waters Edge method
 
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
eliminated in overseas business
 
01:06:28.349 --> 01:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
organizations from subjection to the
 
01:06:31.870 --> 01:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
business profits tax close quote that is
 
01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
why the fourth source of support for the
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
minority is the New Hampshire Supreme
 
01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
Court when it said we point
 
01:06:43.470 --> 01:06:43.480 align:start position:0%
out wat's edge method was adopted for
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
the benefit of foreign businesses prior
 
01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:47.190 align:start position:0%
the benefit of foreign businesses prior
to

01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:06:50.069 --> 01:06:50.079 align:start position:0%
1986 New Hampshire utilized worldwide
 
01:06:52.349 --> 01:06:52.359 align:start position:0%
combined reporting in which the net
 
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
income of all members of the unitary
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
group domestic and foreign was included
 
01:07:01.109 --> 01:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
in the tax base close quotes it was
 
01:07:03.549 --> 01:07:03.559 align:start position:0%
unfair for the state not to enforce the
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting law from
 
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
1981 to
 
01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
1986 the new law in 1986 The Waters Edge
 
01:07:15.269 --> 01:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
seems to have changed an equal and Level
 
01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
Playing Field law for all into an
 
01:07:20.829 --> 01:07:20.839 align:start position:0%
unequal law for domestic
 
01:07:24.029 --> 01:07:24.039 align:start position:0%
businesses that is why the minority is
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
saying that there is a competitive
 
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
disadvantage facing domestic companies
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
that is why there is a question of the
 
01:07:33.870 --> 01:07:33.880 align:start position:0%
rule of law those domestic taxpayers of
 
01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
BPT are treated differently from foreign
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
companies this is
 
01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional the foreign
 
01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:42.839 align:start position:0%
multinational company's competitive
 
01:07:45.230 --> 01:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
Advantage by its very Nature has the
 
01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
tendency to erode trust in the equity of
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
our government and thus in the
 
01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
government itself making Waters Edge BPT
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
an unlevel playing field there should
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
not be tears in our tax system anymore
 
01:08:03.069 --> 01:08:03.079 align:start position:0%
than there should be two tiers of
 
01:08:06.069 --> 01:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
Justice this is
 
01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
anti-democratic and anti-free market and
 
01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you'll let me read that and
 
01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:15.560 align:start position:0%
I'll make sure that I do send a copy on
 
01:08:20.110 --> 01:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
to Jen so that she can or will this be
 
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
recorded anywhere else other than we are
 
01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:29.149 --> 01:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
Jen I will just make sure you get a copy
 
01:08:31.870 --> 01:08:31.880 align:start position:0%
I believe we're recorded okay thank you
 
01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I hope you didn't mind me
 
01:08:35.070 --> 01:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
saying you're a football coach or you
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
time okay um this is why there's
 
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a Minority Report and I
 
01:08:53.470 --> 01:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
do think that uh those who read both
 
01:08:55.229 --> 01:08:55.239 align:start position:0%
will understand that there is a
 
01:08:57.309 --> 01:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
different understanding of the reach of
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
the caterpillar decision for example um
 
01:09:05.709 --> 01:09:05.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
comments okay well I don't know exactly
 
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
what the protocol is with the commission
 
01:09:13.829 --> 01:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
but I think I'm going to ask for a vote
 
01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:17.080 align:start position:0%
to adopt the majority
 
01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:18.630 align:start position:0%
to adopt the majority
report

01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:09:22.110 --> 01:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
yes um I would like to address some of
 
01:09:26.269 --> 01:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
the uh the uh the text that's provided
 
01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
in the glossery from uh representative
 
01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
shamber if I may yes which I have not
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
even read yet
 
01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
so and by the way our our deadline to
 
01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
file is on Wednesday November 1st we
 
01:09:44.189 --> 01:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
have several adits that we've already
 
01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:46.359 align:start position:0%
discussed if there's something further
 
01:09:48.749 --> 01:09:48.759 align:start position:0%
that somebody sees it can be brought up
 
01:09:50.829 --> 01:09:50.839 align:start position:0%
and Incorporated within the next 48
 
01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
hours but I would say it's Our intention
 
01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
that we're basically
 
01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh going to resolve whether this is a
 
01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
finished product as closely as we can so
 
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
um with that comment um I this I feel
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
the same way about anything attached to
 
01:10:06.149 --> 01:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
uh representative Schamberg's go feel
 
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
free to go ahead and address it um so
 
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
the the first point I want to to bring
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
up for discussion is the the I guess the
 
01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
definition for the unitary business
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
principle um written here is the
 
01:10:23.950 --> 01:10:23.960 align:start position:0%
principle is applicable to Corporation
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
that own and control subsidiaries for
 
01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
tax purposes corporations and or taxing
 
01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
authorities are allowed to treat
 
01:10:33.709 --> 01:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
integrated Corporation with subsidiaries
 
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
as if a single taxable entity for tax
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
purposes the entire Enterprise
 
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
corporations and subsidiaries are taxed
 
01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
as one um within the uh RSA
 
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
77-a um the BPT statute itself there is
 
01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
a definition for unitary business in uh
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
77- a colon one
 
01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
Roman 14 um and and it's defined that
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
within our statutes that a unitary
 
01:11:04.350 --> 01:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
business means one or more related
 
01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:05.350 align:start position:0%
business means one or more related
business

01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
organizations engaged in business
 
01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
activity both within and without this
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
state among which there exists a Unity
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
of ownership operation and use or an
 
01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:16.280 align:start position:0%
inter interdependence of in their
 
01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
functions I was wondering if it's um
 
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
better in terms of uh not creating any
 
01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
kind of source of
 
01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
definition to that we replace the first
 
01:11:32.189 --> 01:11:32.199 align:start position:0%
three sentences of this um in the
 
01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
glossery with the exact definition from
 
01:11:37.870 --> 01:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
the statute so it's not to create any
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
kind of confusion with with um or create
 
01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
any yeah confusion with with taxpayers
 
01:11:47.310 --> 01:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
tax preparers um
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
administrators so that the statutory
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
definition stands on its own and there's
 
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
nobody trying to figure out pars whether
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
they're the same or different uh without
 
01:11:59.470 --> 01:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
having read these I just wonder first of
 
01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
all um Jen when we assemble the report
 
01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
anything that representative shamberg
 
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
has elected to attach to his Minority
 
01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
Report should be marked in a way where
 
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
it's clearly an append appendix to The
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
Minority Report in other words this
 
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
isn't speaking for the majority but I
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
wonder whether the glossery is actually
 
01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
helpful or should be excluded if it's
 
01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
included I think it needs to be made
 
01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
clear it's part of The Minority Report
 
01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
because I haven't read it haven't
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
evaluated it and I think that questions
 
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
of the sort that Mr Wong has just
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
brought up that might just be one
 
01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
example where we would later wonder
 
01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
whether we had really comb through this
 
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
carefully representative allery yeah
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and uh just a comment
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
to representative shanberg we've done
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
exactly what Mr Wong suggested with
 
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
other items in the majority report uh to
 
01:12:57.070 --> 01:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
to clarify uh and make sure that we were
 
01:12:58.870 --> 01:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
using consistent language as a matter of
 
01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
fact our last meeting on uh uh pricing
 
01:13:05.629 --> 01:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
transfer was based specifically on using
 
01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
commonly accepted accounting
 
01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
terms um
 
01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
just right we're certainly not trying to
 
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
create and and introduce
 
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
ambiguity I I have no problem with the
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
using the RSA definition uh the arms
 
01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
length principle is that ever is that in
 
01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:28.280 align:start position:0%
the RSA
 
01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:30.430 align:start position:0%
the RSA
anywhere

01:13:30.430 --> 01:13:30.440 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
01:13:32.830 --> 01:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
or I think we would lean on federal law
 
01:13:41.629 --> 01:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
yeah for arms length
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
482 for uh for the statute from what I
 
01:13:51.229 --> 01:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
can based on my memory I don't have the
 
01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:53.560 align:start position:0%
statute in front of me I do not think
 
01:13:55.070 --> 01:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
that the New Hampshire statute
 
01:13:58.189 --> 01:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
specifically mentions arms length but it
 
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
might make reference to um the Internal
 
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
Revenue code that um that would require
 
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
arms length am I am I right so again
 
01:14:09.669 --> 01:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
representive shamberg I I'm unable to
 
01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
even react to these I haven't read
 
01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
them but I I
 
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
would ask you to consider carefully
 
01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
whether you really think that they add
 
01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
to your Minority Report um we're not
 
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
waiting into a territory here that you
 
01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
know where where we're defining the
 
01:14:28.990 --> 01:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
terms this is uh these are terms that
 
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
have been in common usage for decades
 
01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
and there's plenty of collateral source
 
01:14:37.149 --> 01:14:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:39.390 --> 01:14:39.400 align:start position:0%
interpreted so I I would encourage you
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
to delete them but I leave it to you I
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
guess there's a way to delete it just
 
01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
you go like this and then it's off the
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
page all right well if we can agree to
 
01:14:49.470 --> 01:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
that that's probably that then we don't
 
01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
need to look so
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
closely well that's unfortunate because
 
01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of good ammunition in
 
01:14:59.229 --> 01:14:59.239 align:start position:0%
here then I I'll not make any further
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
comments on the other parts of the
 
01:15:03.550 --> 01:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
glossery you're so nice okay all right
 
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank you fair enough okay I think it's
 
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
understood then that they will not be
 
01:15:09.390 --> 01:15:09.400 align:start position:0%
part of it okay very
 
01:15:11.950 --> 01:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
good okay
 
01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
um Jen help me with the process do we do
 
01:15:18.590 --> 01:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
this as a matter of a formal Vote or uh
 
01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
or do we just simply uh the members
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
succeed to the
 
01:15:22.199 --> 01:15:35.550 align:start position:0%
succeed to the
report

01:15:35.550 --> 01:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
okay okay very good so I'm going to
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
invite a motion to adopt the commission
 
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
report as drafted with the very few
 
01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
um edits that were U described
 
01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
verbally Mr chair I would um move to
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
adopt the report has made with the uh uh
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
edits and additions made today subject
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
to scribers review um of the report that
 
01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
we've made with an attached Minority
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
Report that is unedited by the board in
 
01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
total okay thank you for that motion
 
01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
second second seconded by Senator
 
01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
Murphy um and uh brief discussion I
 
01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
would expect to incorporate those edits
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
into turn it
 
01:16:29.629 --> 01:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
today and um hasn't had a copy yet well
 
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
I mean I think I can incorporate the
 
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
edits into something that you can see
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
online right uh and I assume that we can
 
01:16:37.950 --> 01:16:37.960 align:start position:0%
then leave it in Jen's hands to make
 
01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
sure that it's properly
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
filed with uh the speaker the president
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:57.709 --> 01:16:57.719 align:start position:0%
that's yes I meant as a final draft
 
01:16:59.910 --> 01:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
today to incorporate these edits so that
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
yeah solely to the chair and uh more or

01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
peace okay so we have a motion in a
 
01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
second Mr Foley down there has a
 
01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
question Mr Foley not not a question but
 
01:17:23.669 --> 01:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
just um
 
01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:25.400 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll do a similar thing for the
 
01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
Society of CPAs just to see if we will
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
um maybe join Kean with with kind of his
 
01:17:34.990 --> 01:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
supplemental statement just to confirm
 
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
where our stance will be um and I will
 
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
communicate with Kevin that that's
 
01:17:42.669 --> 01:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
ongoing just to see your Mr Kennedy uh
 
01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
to the extent he feels the obligation to
 
01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
say the same where we had each been
 
01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
neutral sure on the recommendations I
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify that I think that's
 
01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
fine so I'll be looking in this motion
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
this vote for um Ascent to the report
 
01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
adoption of the report and noted that
 
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
there may be a caveat coming from either
 
01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
or both and uh we do have a quorum um
 
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
and Mr Kennedy will also be asked to
 
01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
confirm his asent uh when the redraft is
 
01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
turned out yes M representative Valerie
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
we could add that caveat that the the
 
01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
adoption of this report does not not
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
recommend um does not indicate approval
 
01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
of the recommendations merely a
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
committee as part of as part of the
 
01:18:40.709 --> 01:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
affirming so that's a suggested way of
 
01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
going about it I leave it to you yeah I
 
01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
think that's fair as long as it
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
preserves um our um dr's neutral
 
01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
position um we we're not prepared to
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
vote in any way in terms of um the
 
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations of um adopting or of not
 
01:18:57.790 --> 01:18:57.800 align:start position:0%
going forward this this is understood
 
01:19:00.030 --> 01:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
and it's also understood I should point
 
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:02.520 align:start position:0%

01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation second no I don't I I
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
would not include that now you're now
 
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
you're altering the motion I think um no
 
01:20:42.990 --> 01:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
I would leave that out I would let
 
01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
anybody who wants a
 
01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:46.950 align:start position:0%
anybody who wants a
qualifying

01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
qualifying
 
01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
addendum to choose their own
 
01:20:54.430 --> 01:20:54.440 align:start position:0%
wording that's fair too so make simp and
 
01:20:56.669 --> 01:20:56.679 align:start position:0%
and and and the motion doesn't include
 
01:20:58.830 --> 01:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
The Minority Report the motion is to
 
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
adopt the report of the commission we
 
01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
all understand that the Minority Report
 
01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
stands on its own but will be
 
01:21:11.310 --> 01:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
accompanied okay so the motion does not
 
01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
include the caveats it does not include
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
the Minority Report it's the document
 
01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:20.669 align:start position:0%
the Minority Report it's the document
we've

01:21:20.669 --> 01:21:20.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
goty position
 
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
that's not part of the motion that's
 
01:21:28.830 --> 01:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
not okay right the motion doesn't
 
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
include so we're just going with it's to
 
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
adopt the commission's report with the
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
