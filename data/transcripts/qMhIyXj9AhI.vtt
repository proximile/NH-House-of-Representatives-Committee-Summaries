we cannot forget that service takes

teaching it takes
 
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
demonstrating and if we don't teach our
 
00:57:41.789 --> 00:57:41.799 align:start position:0%
kids we they aren't going to learn it it
 
00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
is so important that we root our lives

in something bigger than ourselves and
 
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
it is critical for the health of our

state and our communities that our next
 
00:57:56.349 --> 00:57:56.359 align:start position:0%
Generation step up and contribute so so
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things I am looking forward
 
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
to the most as Governor is when those

fourth graders uh they come to the state
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
house and I get to speak with them and I
 
00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
want to talk to them about how service
 
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
feels what it feels to help others to be
 
00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
part of something larger than yourself I
 
00:58:20.589 --> 00:58:20.599 align:start position:0%
want them to know that there are as many
 
00:58:24.549 --> 00:58:24.559 align:start position:0%
ways to serve as you can imagine and
 
00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
that the Fulfillment that you can can
 
00:58:30.069 --> 00:58:30.079 align:start position:0%
receive from giving all that you can to
 
00:58:33.789 --> 00:58:33.799 align:start position:0%
help others that's how Joe and I raised
 
00:58:37.029 --> 00:58:37.039 align:start position:0%
our kids and that is what I will have in
 
00:58:40.010 --> 00:58:40.020 align:start position:0%

01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and the reason I did is
 
01:01:11.549 --> 01:01:11.559 align:start position:0%
because it's a cautionary
 
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:14.720 align:start position:0%

Massachusetts it wasn't always that way
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
year after year their model of higher
 
01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:30.200 align:start position:0%
taxes and more government has made it
 
01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
harder for small businesses to make and
 
01:01:36.029 --> 01:01:36.039 align:start position:0%

period New Hampshire has gotten stronger
 
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:45.920 align:start position:0%

01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
transition I to bring people from
 
01:03:59.309 --> 01:03:59.319 align:start position:0%
outside of government to sit with me and
 
01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
to give me perspective on how things are
 
01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
going I've been glad to have Business

Leaders sit with me as we meet with
 
01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
Commissioners to see where things are so
 
01:04:11.269 --> 01:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
that we can look for new ideas about
 
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
where things should go next when you've
 
01:04:17.549 --> 01:04:17.559 align:start position:0%
got as many accolades as this state has
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
it would be easy for us to rest on our
 
01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
successes and not strive forward with
 
01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
the same energy
 
01:04:30.190 --> 01:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
but nothing helps battle complacency
 
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
more than bringing new people into the
 
01:04:37.269 --> 01:04:37.279 align:start position:0%
fold from my time in the private sector
 
01:04:39.309 --> 01:04:39.319 align:start position:0%
these past number of years I saw
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
firsthand the benefit of challenging the
 
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
status quo of and bringing New Blood to
 
01:04:47.549 --> 01:04:47.559 align:start position:0%
it so we're going to make sure that we
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
have new people new ideas and new energy
 
01:04:54.029 --> 01:04:54.039 align:start position:0%
to get the job done for the people of

01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
the young family looking to buy their
 
01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:11.480 align:start position:0%
first home to the business that's trying
 
01:06:14.349 --> 01:06:14.359 align:start position:0%
to hire more workers to the retiree who
 
01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
wants to stay in their home and
 
01:06:19.349 --> 01:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
selfishly as the mom of a 20-year-old
 
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
and a teenager um you know I want them
 
01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
to stay here but our young people aren't
 
01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
going to stay here if they can't afford
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
to we need to get serious about housing
 
01:06:34.589 --> 01:06:34.599 align:start position:0%
production we need to streamline agency
 
01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
approvals and we need to partner with
 
01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
our local
 
01:06:41.549 --> 01:06:41.559 align:start position:0%
communities the Journey of a Thousand
 
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
Steps begins with the first one and
 
01:06:47.309 --> 01:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
there isn't a simple solution to this
 
01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
crisis so we will pursue an all the
 
01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.069 align:start position:0%
crisis so we will pursue an all the
above

01:06:51.069 --> 01:06:51.079 align:start position:0%
above
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
strategy we have to bring everyone to
 
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
the table the state the local community
 
01:06:58.589 --> 01:06:58.599 align:start position:0%
the private sector so we can figure out
 
01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:01.640 align:start position:0%
where the opportunities are and how we
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
can be clear to build and strengthen new
 
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
and existing
 
01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
Partnerships a great example of this is
 
01:07:13.069 --> 01:07:13.079 align:start position:0%
happening in Rochester under mayor pal
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
Paul Callahan this fall I had the chance
 
01:07:18.349 --> 01:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
to join the mayor at a ground breaking
 
01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
at Rapids at Kono project a 52 unit
 
01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:25.640 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing project that came to
 
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
together because the city stepped up HUD
 
01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
was there the private sector New
 
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing and state government
 
01:07:39.069 --> 01:07:39.079 align:start position:0%
all working together or look at Berlin
 
01:07:42.430 --> 01:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
where the old Brown Elementary School it
 
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
was repurposed for new housing we need
 
01:07:49.589 --> 01:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
to look at State Property like this and
 
01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
find Opportunities to leverage
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
underutilized assets on our books and
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that they are using their in
 
01:07:58.990 --> 01:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
their highest and best
 
01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
use as a state we need to model good
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
behavior if we're going to ask the same
 
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
of our local communities who make these

zoning
 
01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
decisions that starts with overhauling
 
01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
the agency process to make sure that it
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
takes no more than 60 days to get
 
01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:27.890 align:start position:0%

the bottom line is we need to make the

process as frictionless as possible so
 
01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
projects that are great for our
 
01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
communities are not getting halted by

unnecessary red
 
01:08:48.510 --> 01:08:48.520 align:start position:0%

job I can tell you the biggest job that
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
I've had in my life and I know Joe
 
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
agrees is that of being a
 
01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
parent as a parent our life's work is
 
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
our children we pour into them in so
 
01:09:28.189 --> 01:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
many ways when they're under our roofs
 
01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
and when they leave they're never far

from our
 
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
hearts as public servants we must bring
 
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
that spirit and focus to our education
 
01:09:42.749 --> 01:09:42.759 align:start position:0%
system we are in the top 10 in total

education funding per pupil in the

country I think that's wonderful and we
 
01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
need to keep it up but it's not only
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
about dollars and cents it's also about
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
how best do our children learn and what

every child learns differently and we
 
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
should give each child the opportunity
 
01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
to be in the education setting that
 
01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
allows them to reach their full

our state they're on the front lines of
 
01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
our education system teachers know

uniquely what's working for our students
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
and we need to listen to them that's why
 
01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:15.320 align:start position:0%

01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
when it comes to our kids one of the
 
01:13:08.590 --> 01:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
things that we need to make sure that we
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
aren't doing and unfortunately it has
 
01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
happened is that sometimes in our
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
schools we haven't had the hard
 
01:13:19.390 --> 01:13:19.400 align:start position:0%
conversations that we need to have when
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
it comes to where our children are and
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
how prepared they are for the next step
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
these hard conversations are very very
 
01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
important so that we aren't passing
 
01:13:32.830 --> 01:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
children along when they aren't prepared
 
01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
to go on to their career or on to their
 
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
next studies this is
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
critical we also need to expand in our
 
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
state uh Career Technical education this
 
01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:04.310 align:start position:0%

expand uh the existing public private
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
Partnerships that are already in place
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that we expand the
 
01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
pipeline at our community colleges that
 
01:14:23.470 --> 01:14:23.480 align:start position:0%
are in place how important it is and
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
what is happening we we need that our
 
01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
young people to understand that there
 
01:14:31.149 --> 01:14:31.159 align:start position:0%
are so many amazing jobs that are open
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
in our trades and that those jobs need
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
to be filled if we want to build all
 
01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
this housing if we want to get things
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
done in this state uh and these are
 
01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
great paying jobs and we need to keep
 
01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
telling the Amazing Stories of the
 
01:14:48.669 --> 01:14:48.679 align:start position:0%
opportunities that exist in the trades
 
01:14:51.189 --> 01:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
and the more and more Pathways to and
 
01:14:53.470 --> 01:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
create more Pathways to a good paying
 
01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
career we need to work together on this
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
this is an issue for all of
 
01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
us so one of the things I'm really proud
 
01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
of about New Hampshire is that our state
 
01:15:10.629 --> 01:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
stands as a model for the rest of the
 
01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:12.840 align:start position:0%

Playbook I'm even prouder that we do it
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
with no income tax no sales tax with our
 
01:15:39.310 --> 01:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:15:42.430 --> 01:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
advantage and taxpayers now are keeping
 
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
more money in their pockets due to the
 
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
elimination of the interest in dividends

01:15:59.629 --> 01:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
surprise anyone when I say no income tax
 
01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:13.930 align:start position:0%

ever and I would also say to our local
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
officials don't don't forget the
 
01:16:27.790 --> 01:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
importance of keeping the tax burden as
 
01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
low as possible property taxes are a
 
01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
burden in New Hampshire in spite of the
 
01:16:34.709 --> 01:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
fact that the state is sending more
 
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
money than ever before down to the local
 
01:16:41.310 --> 01:16:41.320 align:start position:0%
level but while we have a lot to be
 
01:16:44.669 --> 01:16:44.679 align:start position:0%
proud of when it comes to financial
 
01:16:47.470 --> 01:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
restraint challenges are ahead of us in
 
01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
the coming
 
01:16:51.669 --> 01:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
budget the large amount of federal
 
01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
funding from the American Rescue plan is
 
01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:55.390 align:start position:0%
funding from the American Rescue plan is

01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
iring business revenues are coming in
 
01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
lower than the past several
 
01:17:04.669 --> 01:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
years and that means we have gotten to
 
01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
tight we've got to tighten our belt here
 
01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:07.750 align:start position:0%
tight we've got to tighten our belt here

01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:07.760 align:start position:0%

conquer and just like any
 
01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:13.639 align:start position:0%
family what's going out has to match
 
01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
what's coming in so we are going to have
 
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
to make reductions and re-calibrate from
 
01:17:20.430 --> 01:17:20.440 align:start position:0%
the higher spending over the last
 
01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:24.390 align:start position:0%

we are going to have to look for better

ways to do things with less
 
01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
money now whenever we talk about Cuts
 
01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
just like a family making hard decisions
 
01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
there's things that we cannot skimp on
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
protecting our most vulnerable and those
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
in our state most in need
 
01:17:57.550 --> 01:17:57.560 align:start position:0%
like this is
 
01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
non-negotiable like groceries and gas
 
01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:01.550 align:start position:0%
non-negotiable like groceries and gas

01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
families this is
 
01:18:07.470 --> 01:18:07.480 align:start position:0%
important but we do have to carefully
 
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
look across our budgets of every agency
 
01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
and find savings to deal with the
 
01:18:17.229 --> 01:18:17.239 align:start position:0%
financial realities that we
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
Face I've instructed our commissioners
 
01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
to roll up their sleeves and find ways
 
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
to rethink our approach and where
 
01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate do more with less we need to
 
01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that government is operating
 
01:18:32.629 --> 01:18:32.639 align:start position:0%
more like the lean process in
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturing where waste is eliminated
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
each step in the process for a better
 
01:18:41.189 --> 01:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
result and to help us do this because I
 
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
know there is nothing harder than
 
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
politicians and asking them not to spend
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
money um so today I'm announcing the
 
01:18:54.910 --> 01:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
creation of the commission on government
 
01:18:58.270 --> 01:18:58.280 align:start position:0%

cach um what can I say uh the Cod will
 
01:19:26.189 --> 01:19:26.199 align:start position:0%
make us smarter than ever before when it
 
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
comes to saving taxpayer dollars and
 
01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
finding better ways to serve the people
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
of this state and I can think of no
 
01:19:37.390 --> 01:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
better Duo to lead this effort than two
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%

today but if we're going to keep New
 
01:20:55.030 --> 01:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the safest state in the nation
 
01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
we need to make critical investments in
 
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
our group two retirement system to make
 
01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
sure we retain and
 
01:21:05.550 --> 01:21:05.560 align:start position:0%
recruit if we do not make these critical
 
01:21:07.629 --> 01:21:07.639 align:start position:0%
Investments we will not be able to
 
01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
recruit and retain the people that work
 
01:21:12.189 --> 01:21:12.199 align:start position:0%
in our communities on nights weekends
 
01:21:14.830 --> 01:21:14.840 align:start position:0%

do that this term
 
01:21:57.750 --> 01:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
we've got Massachusetts illegal

investing it on their law-abiding
 
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:19.040 align:start position:0%

we're also not done on bail reform I
 
01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
firmly believe the legislature did more
 
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
harm than good when they changed our
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
bail law and the recent reforms just
 
01:22:41.550 --> 01:22:41.560 align:start position:0%
don't go far
 
01:22:44.189 --> 01:22:44.199 align:start position:0%
enough listen I think many of you heard
 
01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
me talk about this but I did a ride
 
01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
along with the Manchester police
 
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
department and it really stuck with me
 
01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
uh this young officer I was with he lost
 
01:22:56.830 --> 01:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
six months of work because he had his
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
pinky noded to the Bone by someone who
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
was out on bail that should not have
 
01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
been I want to thank mayor Rue because
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
he has worked really hard to turn the
 
01:23:12.430 --> 01:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
tide in Manchester but we need to get
 
01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
this law fixed so that we can keep all
 
01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
of our communities
 
01:23:32.250 --> 01:23:32.260 align:start position:0%

and the other issue that we need to work
 
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
on to improve our quality of life is our
 
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
system our mental health system is so
 
01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:51.560 align:start position:0%
important to strengthening our

traveled around the

state and throughout New Hampshire I've
 
01:24:09.070 --> 01:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
heard about the urgent need that we need
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
more Mental Health Providers there are
 
01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
