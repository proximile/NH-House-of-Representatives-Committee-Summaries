00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Thank you.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Thank you.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Thank you.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Thank you.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Thank you.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Thank you.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Thank you.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Thank you.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Thank you.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Thank you.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:56,000
for everybody here first we do have a subcommittee first this morning which is dealing with the the bill which we have on the university college system that we will do first and of course and then chair that is Oliver Ford here represent Ford we do have some amending language and he's going to be opening that up when we conclude this then we go into the executive sessions Thank you.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Thank you.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thank you.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Thank you.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Thank you.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Thank you.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So what we've done is that we've taken the bill that was initially put forward by Representative Ford and addressed the issue that can the associate's degree that you earn at the community college level can you use those credits and everything you've done through that degree and come into the university system being Keene State, Plymouth State and UNH and Granite State merging in with UNH Manchester can you use those credits and come as a junior?

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,500
Well, we looked at that and copied law that came out of Tennessee.

19
00:01:51,500 --> 00:02:09,500
Since then, and throughout this process, the subcommittee's been working vigorously with the university system and the community college system to look at all the articulation agreements which we have between community college and university system.

20
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:46,000
And there's a lot of issues that I've found along the way that this giant leap that we are taking maybe needs to be refined, maybe needs to be retooled a little bit, but everybody's anxious to try and get credit stackable from one level to another level and get the common understandings that this basic course right here may be applied as a general ed course in a university system as well.

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And those agreements, we have many, many articulation agreements now between the two systems.

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Part of the problem we found out during the study is the two systems are all operating on different software, which makes it extremely difficult to have something automatically go from here to there.

23
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So, and the systems are working on that.

24
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What I'd like to do, we've had input from, regarding this amendment, it's come from both Mark Rubinstein, who's's here from the community college system and the Board of Presidents and the trustees and and Kathy Provincia has been very involved with that level where this through our university system meeting we had on has been well well received by the trustees they recognize this is the direction we need to be moving in.

25
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,000
They also very much appreciate what we did with Granite State College and that merger process.

26
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Those are all part of their initiatives to try to look at the structure and organization of how we're functioning in higher education today.

27
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:55,500
And there's a lot going on there so this bill right here provides the the transfer pathways that we need in order to get credit from one system to another system and approve so a student doesn't lose 25% what they did in the community college system so that they don't lose this time this money and and have some of these courses show up all that doesn't count towards our program we want to get better communication and so before I go any more with this perhaps mr.

28
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:12,000
chair that you'd want to have some input maybe from Catherine Fincher or mark Rubenstein in regard to the amendment, where they are on it, if they feel comfortable with this or not.

29
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Good morning, Mr.

30
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Chair and members of the committee.

31
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The community college system and university system have worked closely together over the past two to three weeks.

32
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,500
We've done research into the Tennessee law and the Tennessee history.

33
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:37,500
That was the basis of the last proposed amendment that came forward.

34
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:52,000
Had lots of discussions about the previous language was that all associates degrees would transfer in, but not all associates degrees are intended to be transferable, if you will.

35
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:04,500
So the language that we've worked on, and we've pulled in the provost at the university system, we're all really committed to moving this forward.

36
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
And so I definitely...

37
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:19,000
So the language that we've worked on, and we've pulled in the provost at the university system, we're all really committed to moving this forward.

38
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:55,500
And so identifying the 30 top majors to really benefit our community college students and have a universal agreement between the community college system and the university system so there aren't't hundreds of articulation agreements, will identify the 30 top transfer pathways and have a universal agreement between the seven institutions at the community college system and the, I'll say, three and a half right now because of the Granite State-UNH merger process.

39
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:05,000
And have that universal agreement in place for at least 30 programs no later than July 1st of 2024.

40
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's going to take some work in both systems to make sure we can get that universal language that's hopefully seamless for our students.

41
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Thank you.

42
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Good morning, Mr.

43
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,500
Chair, members of the committee.

44
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:31,500
As Chief Administrative Officer Preventure described, we've been working collaboratively on this for a while now.

45
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:40,000
And a couple of things I'd like to highlight in the language that we've come up with.

46
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You'll note that the 30 programs that are described on line 18, for which the demand from students in the community college system is the highest.

47
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The rationale for that language was with thought because it allows us to identify where our students want to go.

48
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It allows us to tailor the demand among our students across the university system because if we simply did where the largest enrollments were, they would tend to concentrate primarily with UNH.

49
00:08:19,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Nothing wrong with that except that for a lot of our students in the North Country and other parts of the state their ambitions and where they best will be fulfilled would align with work being done at Plymouth or Keene so the intent was to make sure that this was driven by the demand from the community college students the other piece you'll see in there on line 16 reference to optimizing utility and affordability in some states there's a mandate that an associate degree is 60 credits and a bachelor's degree is 120 we don't have that and so for a lot of our students the ability to complete an associate degree may be 66 or 68 or 70 credits in doing that they're continuing to benefit from the lower tuition and the more accessible locations, the community college system.

50
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And part of this language was intended to say, let's allow students not simply to think about 60 credits and an associate degree, but as much of the educational opportunities as they can take advantage of the community college system and then partner with the university system to complete that.

51
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:19,500
And specifically, the reference to the utility of the community college system, Twelve instructional locations around the state, in some cases similar to what President Lloyd from White Mountains has done with Plymouth, being able to complete bachelor's degree on-site in locations that are more accessible and more familiar.

52
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:42,500
So this was really crafted with thoughtful intent to try and align with the needs that our students, the students served by the community college system, to allow them to benefit from what the university system offers, but in ways that are more accessible to them.

53
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,500
Thank you.

54
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:54,000
but it starts with getting students as well as kindergarten to understand the mistake is to get to that.

55
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That is to begin to build a ladder.

56
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And the ladder goes all the way to the university.

57
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And so we're seeing that as part of the way of selling this idea to students who probably haven't thought of the university yet.

58
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
They never think about how do I get a job.

59
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And so they go to the community college and they take over.

60
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Thank you.

61
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
for students who probably haven't thought of the university yet.

62
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
They never, they're just thinking about how do I get a job?

63
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:53,500
And so they go to the community college and they say, okay, we want to maybe do something like, these are just ideas going out there, who will enroll?

64
00:11:53,500 --> 00:12:01,500
So that any student who enrolls in the community college also enrolls in, say, Granite State.

65
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:07,500
I believe now they can't realize there's some people problem in her.

66
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:13,500
But fortunately, one of the former directors of Granite State, Thank you.

67
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:21,500
That was not perhaps the name was to say, look, you're admitted to the community college.

68
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,500
You're also admitted to the university.

69
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:30,000
So that creates a reminder of students to come and continue.

70
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Not I'm in an end game.

71
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,500
I go here, I graduate, I get a job.

72
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:44,000
But I go here, I grow, I get a job, and I continue.

73
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Oh, And that's a different mindset.

74
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,500
And so now we can have complete college as a model.

75
00:12:52,500 --> 00:13:01,500
And so complete college for manager then becomes the thing that creates the momentum in the student's mind.

76
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,000
Creates the expectation of more.

77
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
This is really better.

78
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And of course we've got, as you Chair.

79
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Just a quick question about the 30 majors.

80
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,500
Do you have some sense of what those are?

81
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:28,500
Do you have data so you know where you're going or starting from scratch and trying to figure that out?

82
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:34,500
We currently do, and there's a fair amount of stability to it.

83
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,500
A lot of them will be in programs.

84
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:49,000
Our single largest enrollment in terms of degree completion in the community college system over the last decade has been nursing.

85
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,500
And so we already have bachelor's completion programs, liberal arts, business.

86
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,000
So the top five, top ten are relatively consistent.

87
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:18,500
In fact, the top 20, one of the things that we'll want to be able to do, though, is take a look college by college to make sure that, again, the large isn't overshadowing the importance of regional differentiation.

88
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:35,500
So we've got good data on what the demand has been and we're going to have to see if over time that shifts and make sure we don't overshadow you know smaller regional commitments.

89
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
Thank you.

90
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
You're welcome sir.

91
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm not sharing this one.

92
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Thanks very much, Oliver.

93
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And I think sort of following on Art's question about the 30 undergraduate majors at the community college level, but I'm sort of interested in sort of a tangential thing.

94
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:10,500
How many majors approximately do we have at the community college associates level that have no transferability or continuity into the four-year system?

95
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:22,500
I'm reluctant to say no transferability, but in terms of tendency, likelihood, last year we offered over 150 distinct associate degree and certificate programs.

96
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:29,500
I would venture to say that a fair number of those are certificate programs.

97
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Massage therapy might be an example.

98
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:49,500
Does it mean that there's not a bachelor's completion opportunity for somebody who completes a certificate or an associate degree, but ultimately wants to be a sole proprietor and may want a business degree?

99
00:15:49,500 --> 00:16:42,000
So almost any of the programs could, But what we're focused on with those 30 are primarily going to be programs that have a strong foundation that that points in the direction of probable transfer so in a follow-up on that the the you know the reason I'm asking I'm not sure if this is still the case but it certainly was sort of pre-COVID where where there was was a significant amount of marketing being done by out-of-state institutions at our community colleges to try to pick up, you know, students who may want to continue into a bachelor's program outside of New Hampshire.

100
00:16:42,000 --> 00:17:26,500
And so I think this is a great opportunity here to sort of get out in front of that and say oh no your opportunities are right here in New Hampshire but beyond the 30 that have sort of very direct pathways you know I think it would be interesting also to consider a you know I think that Maybe the terminal degree is an associate's degree or is a certificate program, but these students may want to continue and may want to apply those classes towards general education.

101
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:40,500
And it would seem like the structure of this would support that type of transferability as well, should the community college and the university system identify those opportunities.

102
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,000
I think that that's right, Representative Luna.

103
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I think our underlying thought about all of this is that life is ideally long and complicated, maybe not ideally complicated, but it is.

104
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:08,500
And people don't always take a straight line to where they need to get to or where they need to get to changes over time.

105
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:15,000
We want to optimize the flexibility, the utility, the value that students have.

106
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:24,500
Again, Representative Ford was describing Complete College New Hampshire as a concept of, you know, K through 20 plus.

107
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:32,500
For a lot of the students who will be serving, they're long since past 20 plus.

108
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:40,000
They're coming back looking for something different that they need to find in their lives.

109
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,500
And we want to optimize flexibility for all of those students.

110
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:55,500
Could I also add, there's a real commitment on the part of the university system and the community college system.

111
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,000
This is a start, right?

112
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,500
It says at least 30.

113
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,000
The chancellor and I have biweekly meetings.

114
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:46,000
We were just talking at our last meeting about running start and how do we really strategically leverage the benefit of that in the high schools to for a transfer to community college and and beyond there's a lot going on between the two systems in addition to to this work here so again I just want to make certain that folks recognize that there's a commitment on on the part of both to really start partnering on at a lot of different levels.

115
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Thank you.

116
00:19:48,000 --> 00:20:37,000
On the complexities of life issue, I think there are a number of people that, like you said, start maybe community college or even maybe start the university and then drop out and then you know have their family or whatever and then want to go back so if if somebody got an associates degree that's it is there like a retroactive so that if you had it if you received your associate degree maybe 10 years ago at a community college, and now you want to go into the university, do you come in as a junior?

117
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:47,500
I mean, I know that some colleges have a time limit on how far back they'll accept credits from other institutions.

118
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:56,500
Some of those more complicated situations, it does still have to be a little bit case by case.

119
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:09,000
Without getting to the extreme of a computer science degree from 1974, that may be a little bit different than it would be in 2020.

120
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:48,500
Although some of the foundational principles might still still be the same again case by case typically the the issue is going to be you know a student's not likely to lose all of that if it's a completed associate degree but it really will depend on the applicability and the foundation that provides I don't believe in the university system there's an interest in simply selling more credits, requiring a student to repeat work that they can demonstrate.

121
00:21:48,500 --> 00:22:12,000
And there are a number of vehicles, credit by examination would be one of those, to try and ensure that a student doesn't have to repeat work for which they can demonstrate that they still have the foundational knowledge that they build on for the bachelor's degree.

122
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So on page one, the 24, 25, 26 line, where it says that enrolled in a pathway shall be deemed to have met all general education and lower division requirements.

123
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:37,500
Again, if another industry maybe is health care and nursing, things change pretty rapidly sometimes in that particular area as well.

124
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:46,000
Is there a time limit on completing one and being accepted as a junior at the other?

125
00:22:46,000 --> 00:23:24,500
Assuming this language is adopted, I would think that one of the things that we normally think about when a student enrolls they enroll in a catalog year catalog is published here are the guidelines here the requirements for your degree as long as a student maintains continuous enrollment then the student is typically deemed to be will honor that commitment so I think that that in my experience with transfer pathways between institutions, it's been similar.

126
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:46,000
When the agreements are struck that a student who begins enrollment at an institution under that pathway, as long as they maintain continuous enrollment, even on a part-time basis, and at a fairly slow but steady pace, that we still honor those commitments.

127
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,500
Thank you very much, Mark.

128
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,500
Catherine.

129
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,500
that we still honor those commitments.

130
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,000
Thank you very much, Mark.

131
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Catherine, the other day when we were in Keene on Thursday and Friday, there was much discussion dealing with structure and organization.

132
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:31,500
And as I've gotten into this, and I'm just on the fringe side looking in and trying to become more knowledgeable and understanding some of those issues which are confronting the systems in terms of engaging in the processes that are laid out here, this is a step forward.

133
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,000
It's certainly not the end of it.

134
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:53,000
What are some of the significant issues which we're going to have to overcome in order to really get, I think, where everybody wants to get from, you know, the management side to the technology side?

135
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:05,500
What are some of those issues which are really hindering us in the stackable credit type concept where all engaged in trying to move towards?

136
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,000
I'll speak just for the university system.

137
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
You mentioned it earlier, Representative Ladd.

138
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Technology is a barrier.

139
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:35,500
And the university system is about to embark on a massive project for a new ERP enterprise resource planning system for the student side finance human resources right now again on the university system side our student systems can't talk to one another.

140
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:42,500
And it makes it challenging to even seamlessly transfer credits from Plymouth to UNH.

141
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:48,000
So we recognize this as a barrier, committed to overcoming that.

142
00:25:48,000 --> 00:26:33,000
It is a huge project, costly project, but there's commitment to ensure that we see the finish line on that because that's where that's where we have to head right that's where the public higher education in New Hampshire must head As as you well know representative lad our board of trustees voted on Thursday to name the president of UNH, President Jim Dean, also as interim chancellor and to review that in no more than two years to drive the work of shared student-facing services across the university system.

143
00:26:33,000 --> 00:27:14,500
I've been very involved in the administrative, sharing all of the administrative services across the university system but president Dean and the other presidents president Treadwell and President Burks will lead the sharing of I call them student facing services in the coming year or two as as we move forward so and that refers to structural flexibility and transition right now as we think about the significant headwinds, demographic headwinds that we'll be facing by the time we get to 2025, 2026.

144
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:19,000
If I might add a couple of other thoughts.

145
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,500
We talked about stackable credentials.

146
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:30,000
A lot of those credentials are not authored by the community college system or the university system.

147
00:27:30,000 --> 00:28:08,000
They're delivered by industry, by other agents, and creating a useful universal repository for those things to have sort of a credential database, if you will, so that employer-issued or industry-issued certifications and credentials and ones that we offer, as does the university system, that a student can have that type of a digital platform and portfolio to take that education wherever they may get the education to wherever they may need to deliver the education.

148
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
So I think that's one of the resources.

149
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Dr.

150
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,500
Fisher at NHTI and Dr.

151
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:37,000
LaValle at UNH are collaborating on a proposal we hope to bring forward shortly looking to create a statewide repository for that type of digital credential that I think will benefit the entire state and employers and industries in New Hampshire.

152
00:28:37,000 --> 00:29:04,000
The other piece in terms of what we're looking at, I've focused on sort of the older student, but looking back to what Representative Ford described about K-through, New Hampshire is increasingly diverse, and one of the data points I may have shared with this committee in the past, it stays with me often.

153
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Prior to the pandemic in the 2019-2020 school year, even though it had gotten a little bit better, percentage of New Hampshire students grades 1 through 12 on free and reduced lunch, still about 25%, and grades 1 through 8 still about 28% in that year.

154
00:29:27,000 --> 00:30:06,500
The data have gotten a little bit strange because of changes made to the program in the pandemic but you look at Berlin you look at Laconia look at Rochester You look at Nashua all of those school districts serving students where 40% of the students on free and reduced lunch in the 1920 school year you look at Concord a third of the students state capital a third of the students at Manchester, over 50% of the students.

155
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:13,500
This is the future of New Hampshire's population, its workforce over the next generation.

156
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:20,500
Right now their parents are in the workforce and are eligible for that service.

157
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:31,000
This is the future and we've got to make sure that they are not excluded, that they don't feel left behind.

158
00:30:31,000 --> 00:31:13,500
When we talk about whether college is possible, price can can't be a barrier cost can't be a barrier we've got to show them that their pathways to get there and we've got to actually make that real as they progress through high school we've got a running start program allow students to take college courses while in high school contribute to the affordability but they have to see that that's not just a course that that's a stepping stepping stone to what comes next.

159
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:19,500
We've got to do a better job of building out that pathway.

160
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:26,500
And if I might follow up with that a little bit with a question.

161
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:50,000
With that poverty level we have throughout the state and in places where you wouldn't assume there would be that much like a third or even more than that, and those that are going on on this pathway into a two-year or four-year type program Thank you.

162
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,500
or even more than that.

163
00:31:52,500 --> 00:32:06,000
And those that are going on on this pathway into a two-year or four-year type program or some kind of certification, it takes dollars to do that.

164
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And with this shrinking demographic we have in the state and the marketing being done by those that are competing with us from outside, and we saw a list of those on Thursday and Friday that are challenging Keene and challenging Plymouth State and challenging UNH.

165
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
We need to attract these students.

166
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:47,000
So what we are doing, we're giving scholarship money to the, not giving, well granting scholarship money to allow some of these students to come to the higher education level.

167
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,500
That creates a real expense issue associated with revenue.

168
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,500
Where is the dollar coming from?

169
00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:36,500
And we talk in this program right here, the challenges associated with the dollars that are needed to get everybody on the same page in terms of application software, which is, I would, we're talking huge huge dollars way up in the millions of dollars so for us to be sustainable the competing against those others that are marketing against us and challenging us and taking students away from this state how can the legislature help you accomplish what you're trying to do here?

170
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:42,500
This is just the edge of it right here in this bill.

171
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,500
What do we have to do?

172
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,500
Go for it, Catherine.

173
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,000
I can see you churning.

174
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
We need more funding.

175
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Yeah.

176
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,500
Even one-time funding would help with some of these.

177
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:08,500
This ERP project, we're projecting over the next five years, that could cost the university system $25 to $30 million.

178
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:13,000
And we're working on ways to identify funding sources.

179
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
That's one example.

180
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,500
Chancellor Rubinstein mentioned the repository.

181
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:22,500
And again, community college system, university system working on that.

182
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:28,500
I think even the Department of Education is being pulled into that.

183
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,000
That's going to require resources.

184
00:34:31,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And Chancellor Rubinstein and Representative Ladd, you mentioned our neediest New Hampshire students if you are Pell eligible and a New Hampshire resident Pell eligible is a federal scholarship program federally funded scholarship program for for needy students if you're Pell eligible in a New Hampshire resident you receive free tuition at all of our institutions and and those dollars those last dollar scholarships are funded through the university system.

185
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,500
So these are all necessary.

186
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:15,000
and those dollars, those last dollar scholarships are funded through the university system.

187
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:52,000
So these are all necessary costs that we need to incur to deliver on our mission, but it puts incredible pressure on the ability to continue to deliver affordable and accessible quality education for our students the granted get the granted guarantee program that I referred to as a last dollar scholarship so you'd first apply your Pell Grant and then and then the grant a guarantee do you you need anything, Representative Rubenstein?

188
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Chancellor Rubenstein?

189
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,500
I'm reluctant to ask for money at this point.

190
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:07,000
In part, it's what you have available, but I'm not sure that that's what changes the dynamic.

191
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:26,000
New Hampshire for years has been characterized as the leading exporter on a percentage basis of college-bound seniors looking for four-year institutions, and that's not necessarily a dollar issue as much as it's a perception and attitude issue.

192
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,500
I think that the investments that Ms.

193
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:42,000
Provencher describes are ones that would not so much just produce the impact of the spending, but create a perception that the systems are valued.

194
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:55,000
One of the things that I think that we've got to continue to work on is figuring out how to collaborate, not compete with each other.

195
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I think that's true within systems.

196
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I think it's true between systems.

197
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And it may not be intentional, but I think it's still an outcome that we've got to try and figure out a better way to do.

198
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:25,000
How do we focus resources, create the most efficiency, the most high-quality programs we can with less duplication where it's not helpful?

199
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:34,000
So, again, I think some of this is maybe more things that we need to work on internally.

200
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:44,000
But the investments that the legislature makes are perhaps investments that are also endorsements, that change the way people perceive.

201
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,500
Several years ago, the legislature introduced scholarships.

202
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:53,500
Running Start costs a student $50 per credit, a three-credit course, $150.

203
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:59,000
But the legislature invested in scholarships for students in STEM courses.

204
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:56,500
STEM STEM is certainly important but it's not the only part of the curriculum and so maybe that's another opportunity to invest to reinforce in the value that getting an early start on college for those who are able and motivated and want to capitalize on the affordability gives them more reason and you build out these pathways that we've been talking about in a a student who finishes high school, not with two or three running start courses, but with a year's worth of college, sees a very affordable, very sensible pathway to finish the associate degree and then go on to a bachelor's without leaving the borders of the state for post-secondary education.

205
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,500
Thank you.

206
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:07,000
We've had a wonderful discussion on the STEM and why we're not involving other courses of study.

207
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And I think the dollar has restricted us to STEM.

208
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Thanks, Oliver.

209
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:25,500
And to Mark, to your and Catherine's just prior comments, I think it is important that the systems work together to reduce inefficiencies.

210
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:36,000
But at the same time, the community college mission leading with access, and that's why seven colleges spread throughout the state.

211
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:46,000
And even satellite campuses beyond that, such as White Mountains, provides that level of high-quality educational experience in my hometown.

212
00:39:46,000 --> 00:40:16,500
And one of the things and and you know we talked about this I think a little bit last week at the NHTI advisory board meeting which is the the really the almost the disappearance of of on-site engineering technology programs here in Concord and and instead, students, NHTI students in Concord are traveling down to Manchester to do associate's programs.

213
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:42,500
While that's not, you know, for many of us, we don't think traveling from Concord to Manchester is very difficult, but for a lot of students, so we've got a lot of new Americans in the Concord area, any time they have to travel, you know, much beyond downtown becomes an obstacle.

214
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:57,000
And while, you know, it may be efficient, given that the university system is now offering a four-year program in engineering technology out of University of New Hampshire-Manchester campus.

215
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Having those first two years available through NHTI and other community colleges in my hometown gives me the option of, oh, I can sort of take that program and then later on decide if I want to continue with it.

216
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,500
I may not even want to continue with a four-year program right away.

217
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:38,500
I might want to go into industry for a few years and put that NHTI engineering technology degree to work and then see where I want to go with it.

218
00:41:38,500 --> 00:42:08,500
So I would just sort of want to put out a caution on the efficiency side because I think it's such an important role that our community colleges play in keeping students here in New Hampshire and attracting them to programs that they might not otherwise be considering if they had to travel much beyond their hometown to get there.

219
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:12,000
Your point is well made, Representative Luno.

220
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I believe, and if I did not, I intended to say that duplication without adding value for students, that there are places where we will have mirrored programs, but it makes sense for purpose.

221
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:41,500
I'll also, if you don't mind, use the opportunity to add one more thing about what I think this committee, what the legislature can do.

222
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:47,000
You already invest in the community college system, the university system.

223
00:42:47,000 --> 00:43:10,500
We're a resource for this state to the extent that there are state agencies that have direct workforce needs or state agencies who are responsible for serving the citizens of New Hampshire, where you can identify opportunities where we can strengthen the work they do through collaboration.

224
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,000
It also strengthens our mission.

225
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:24,500
So, again, thinking of us as top of mind, when you've got a problem you're trying to solve with agencies throughout the state.

226
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:28,500
How can public higher education be of service?

227
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,500
Absolutely.

228
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,500
Especially our students.

229
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:38,500
We find our students are definitely more drawn to paid internships, right?

230
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,500
Because it's...

231
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,500
Absolutely.

232
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:53,500
So paid internships is a great opportunity if there are opportunities in state government for community college students or university system students.

233
00:43:53,500 --> 00:44:09,000
internships is a great opportunity if there are opportunities in state government for community college students or university system students Please understand that I come to this problem of personal media.

234
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:22,500
My wife went to the three-year college before moving on to the three-year college, before marrying and having children moving all the way up to the doctor.

235
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,500
So I know how it works.

236
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:30,000
I know all they have to put into it.

237
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,500
I tried to babysit a one-year-old in the library.

238
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,500
But I'll never do it again.

239
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:41,500
But I also have a daughter in college.

240
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:48,500
She dropped out of college in New York, married my son, We can floor.

241
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,500
Thank you.

242
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:55,000
And I appreciate all the work that you do.

243
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Anyone else?

244
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:07,000
If you want to add something from another perspective, having been a college president, I know there's also another perspective.

245
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,500
I think it's a little bit covered.

246
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:14,000
I think it's a little bit covered.

247
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,500
I think it's a little bit covered.

248
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:25,500
I think it's a little having a student information system that is compatible across the system.

249
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:30,500
I think we have that now at the community college.

250
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:38,000
And I think Ross could tell, that was a leading effort from the prior chancellor.

251
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:52,500
And so I think we do have some probably good data, good information at this time in terms of how that has improved movement within the community college system.

252
00:45:52,500 --> 00:46:08,500
And hopefully we can use that data to help provide the resources that we need at the university system to complete a similar type, you know, yet obviously more expansive, extensive project.

253
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:14,000
I have one last comment, just sort of wrapping it up.

254
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:27,500
About a year and a half ago, it was in March 2021, I think, that we discussed merger here in the House and the governor, et cetera.

255
00:46:27,500 --> 00:47:02,500
And that is an issue which is still there one of which the we had a subcommittee put together some 30 to 40 odd questions or concerns and so I'd like to just to communicate that the legislature is still very interested in working with the university system, the community college system, in working towards the efficiencies and streamlining our higher education system, which we know we have to do.

256
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:16,000
I fear that within the next five years, we're looking at extinction in some of our higher education programming, our competitors out there are eating our lunch.

257
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:31,000
And unless we can address this whole system of efficiencies and working cooperatively together, I think we're going to lose a lot of our students in the state to others.

258
00:47:31,000 --> 00:48:41,000
And therefore, we won't have the students operate our own system and so we're at that i think we're at a critical mass point right now when i look at the margin versus where our revenues are and what our expenses are we're we're there we're eating up some of our resources we have to continue marching the way we're marching if there's any comments on that but i just want to say we we want to work with you I would just add that and representative I think you would concur that our board talked about this a little bit around the edges last week and and if there if there if that is a reasonable path forward, maybe there should be an outside expert funding for that to really examine and assess the opportunities between the two systems.

259
00:48:41,000 --> 00:49:04,500
I'm just not sure that within internally if that might create more conflict where an outside expert that maybe had been through this before could answer some of the questions that your subcommittee had posed and there were as you mentioned 30 to 40 of those questions.

260
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:18,500
So if that conversation is still on the table, the legislature, the governor, may want to consider funding some type of outside study to really dig into that.

261
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:24,500
I'd like to tack on one thing that I see is why.

262
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:29,000
It's always been struck by this education, Thank you.

263
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,000
It doesn't have the assurance that I can do this.

264
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
But I have perhaps that advantage.

265
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,500
I have an English degree.

266
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:43,500
I also have a degree in international physics.

267
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:47,000
And then I have a master's degree.

268
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I have a doctorate.

269
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I don't want to become a university president.

270
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I don't think you want to be educating a lot of universities.

271
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
It's just not fair.

272
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Thank you.

273
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,500
Some of those kids don't know that they don't speak English.

274
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,500
They haven't figured it out yet.

275
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:20,000
We have to find ways for them also to be recognized just because they're not in position.

276
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
They may need even more opportunities to challenge.

277
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,500
So let's keep it easy.

278
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:37,000
One of the problems that we're talking about, maybe the people who are without it, we don't know where it's going.

279
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
We don't feel like we're alive.

280
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
We don't have time.

281
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Anyone else?

282
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:52,000
We very much appreciate your continued support and interest in furthering our partnerships across the state.

283
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Okay, Mr.

284
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:12,500
Chair, what we need to do is that if we're at the point on this subcommittee where we're ready to make a recommendation back to the full committee, I think a motion has to be brought forward.

285
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:19,500
I'll move we recommend ought to pass on the amendment to 1530, amendment 947.

286
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,500
I'll second it.

287
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:27,000
No, it'd be the subcommittee members that are voting on this.

288
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,500
So Art, you, me, Alicia, and you.

289
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,500
Okay.

290
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,500
All in favor, raise your hand.

291
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,500
Thank you.

292
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:43,000
Thank you very much, everybody from the college and university system.

293
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Yeah, what we have to do now is just open up the full body.

294
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Thank you very much.

295
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,500
This is a huge issue, the university and community college system.

296
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:24,500
It's big on our platteratter just like a third party to come in and look at just our facilities what do we tear down what do we renovate all that from the various campuses we have a huge need architects involved you need to have engineers involved you need to have good accounting involved.

297
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:29,500
And it's a huge, huge, huge dollar we're looking at.

298
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:35,000
We're just looking at a small fraction of the academic side.

299
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:41,000
But right now we have an interim chancellor at the four-year system.

300
00:52:41,000 --> 00:53:04,500
We have a chancellor at the community college system who's also acting as president in HTI right now so we're at a time when we're doing a lot of movement and transitioning it's optimal for us to really be looking at the big picture So with that.

301
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,500
Mr.

302
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:11,500
Chair, I have a final follow-up question, if you will.

303
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:37,500
I wonder if we're in a position now for us to consider undertaking a kind of joint study kind of thing, formalizing it in that way, to look at the issues as we see them and then bounce that off of them again and say, all right, this is what we're seeing.

304
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:42,000
What else do we need to be looking at?

305
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:58,000
But maybe go to places like Excel and Ed and the American Council on Education and find out sources from those people who might be able to guide us in this process.

306
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:05,500
Well, what we got right now, we have a higher education study committee by statute.

307
00:54:05,500 --> 00:55:30,000
This year it's headed headed up by Senator Ruth Ward that committee has the responsibility for doing just what you you said okay this committee can make recommendations and talk with the higher education study committee and bring some of our findings to that body that body then is working directly with the two systems and so it's time for us to really activate the study committee and get it really moving and discussing we're not going to get to where we need to get unless the university system the community college system and the legislature are talking with each other yes it's just it's it's a huge issue we have here I suppose as a is an office in this business I'm asking you what is our next best step and should we formalize that committee as a recommendation from this subcommittee to I think this subcommittee is addressing a specific bill okay we were looking at credits and the associate's degree as related to a bachelor's degree.

308
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Right.

309
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
We've come up with a recommendation.

310
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,500
I think it's a good starting step.

311
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,500
We're certainly not there.

312
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:45,500
We need to continue with this perspective and this agenda.

313
00:55:45,500 --> 00:56:21,000
But to get into the larger realm here, which is a huge, huge topic, I think that are working directly with the higher education study committee is the best way and to be working with the two systems and we have people on this this committee right here that are involved with either as trustees or board members that we can convey that message that we want to work cooperatively together.

314
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Does the amendment we've just passed give us a place to stand on to go forward with that, I guess is what I'm asking.

315
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I think that amendment is along the lines of the academic side of things which we're looking at.

316
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I don't think it gives us any other than what we found through our studying and through working with Excel Ed, Excellent Ed, when we dealt with them on the Tennessee legislation.

317
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I think they can engage too.

318
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:09,500
But there's a lot going on on the higher education levels with the management there, the governance.

319
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,500
They're working on this.

320
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:14,000
There's a lot going on.

321
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:22,500
and I was very surprised to hear some of the issues which are being discussed right now.

322
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:48,000
And they've already invested millions of dollars towards this effort of trying to streamline our two systems and to protect our higher education in this state, not to see our kids leaving the state and going to Community College in Massachusetts or to the University of Maine for the four-year degrees.

323
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,500
And we're under attack from those other two systems right now.

324
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,500
Oh, no question.

325
00:57:55,500 --> 00:58:12,500
So, as far as this is, I think what we need is to act on this, and we need to communicate verbally with our Higher Education Study Committee, Representative Ward and others around that.

326
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:15,500
Lou DeAlexander is also on that.

327
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:21,500
Talk with these folks and make them aware of what we're learning.

328
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,500
Anything else?

329
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:28,000
We're going into executive session on this one first?

330
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Yeah, that's what we'll do first.

331
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Yeah, and then...

332
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,500
So I'd like to bring the Education Committee to order here.

333
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:41,500
We are now in executive session.

334
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:46,000
The first bill we're going to exact is 1530.

335
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:53,500
I'd like to make a motion and I'll hand the gavel over to Representative Cordelli.

336
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,500
Thank you.

337
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,500
To move 1530.

338
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,500
Yes.

339
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,500
Thank you, Mr.

340
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,500
Chair.

341
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:16,500
I will recognize Chairman Ladd for a motion related to House Bill 1530 relative to bachelor's degrees offered by the Community College System of New Hampshire.

342
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,500
And I move ought to pass.

343
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,500
Second.

344
00:59:21,500 --> 01:00:21,000
represent of Luno and comments chairman land yes I'd like to further make the motion to move amendment zero nine four seven H referencing establishing curricular transfer pathways between the community college system of New Hampshire and the university system of New Hampshire I'll second that second by representative Luno discussion on the amendment I have no further discussion after the subcommittee discussion earlier yes right further discussion great excuse me do we have copies of the amendment they're there are copies up here they were passed out earlier let's see here do we have it when we had the subcommittee that I think they were taken around to everybody here's another one right here thank you Thank you.

345
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:27,000
We had a pretty healthy discussion on this during the subcommittee meeting.

346
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,000
We started at 9 o'clock and went through 10 o'clock.

347
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
It's a first step.

348
01:00:34,000 --> 01:01:32,000
This is not not the end all but it is a definite first step where we're trying to identify articulation agreements in 30 programs according to this undergraduate majors which will transfer between the community college system and the university system New Hampshire and eliminate that issue where we now have some students coming out of the community college system wanting to get into a pathway and they're losing 25% of the money they put in their program already those 25% may not even transfer and that's disappointing so our effort is to try to get this so we do have this stackable type credit going all the way through as as Representative Ford has mentioned.

349
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:42,500
We want to have this concept of K through, right through the higher education system, whether we're talking with each other.

350
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:56,500
And unfortunately, we can't talk with each other on the higher education system because we're all on different platforms in terms of software we're using between these programs.

351
01:01:56,500 --> 01:02:01,500
Keynes's on here, Plymouth's over here, UNH is over here.

352
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:17,000
They're all not communicating or talking with each other, along with these seven community college, which are on the same platform, but that platform's not talking to the university system platform.

353
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:51,000
So we want to move forward and get beyond this and and and help our kids in the state stay in the state and not leave for what they think is greener ground somewhere else and if I if I may I think an important part of this amendment too is is that it was developed specifically in collaboration with the community college system and the university system.

354
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,000
In fact, they essentially wrote the amendment here.

355
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:21,000
So the testimony we heard this morning during the subcommittee was very much in support both by the university system the community college system to move this this joint effort forward any further comments seen none yeah right I'm just waiting for the clerk to return to see so this Thank you.

356
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
unanimous mr.

357
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:31,000

01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
You have that?

360
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:44,500
Yes, and this will be a roll call vote on ought to pass as amended for House Bill 1530.

361
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:48,500
Okay, I'm going to fill some names here.

362
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:54,000
And do we have a motion on the table to do?

363
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Yeah, yeah, it's a cell rate.

364
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Yeah.

365

Okay, great.

412
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Thank you.

413
01:05:38,000 --> 01:06:13,000
So 1530 is a real important bill, and I appreciate everybody coming through and working on this This is what it's all about and I want to thank represent Ford for heading up that subcommittee I'm gonna take about five minutes all this stuff was just brought in and dumped in front of us by Jen, and I want to get it organized a little bit before I move forward.

414
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,500
I don't even know where my paperwork is now.

415
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:21,000
So let's take a five-minute break here.

416
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:27,000
If somebody has to go to the washroom or something, go ahead.

417
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,500
We'll come back in a few moments.

418
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:33,500
Okay, what do we got here?

419
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:35,500
Thank you.

420
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:37,500
Thank you.

421
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,500
Thank you.

422
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,500
Thank you.

423
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,500
Thank you.

424
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,500
Thank you.

425
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,500
Thank you.

426
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,500
Thank you.

427
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:51,500
Thank you.

428
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,500
Thank you.

429
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:55,500
Thank you.

430
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,500
Thank you.

431
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,500
Thank you.

432
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:01,500
Thank you.

433
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,500
Thank you.

434
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,500
Thank you.

435
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,500
Thank you.

436
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,500
Thank you.

437
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,500
Thank you.

438
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,500
Thank you.

439
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,500
Thank you.

440
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:23,500
Okay, I'd like to go ahead with the executive sessions we have set up for today.

441
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:28,000
As a reminder to folks, we had 103 bills.

442
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:35,000
We have already acted upon at a prior session about a third of those.

443
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:45,500
And right now, Lindsay is working, our administrative assistant is working on getting the reports done for about 40 of those.

444
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:56,000
And so, you know, when the 30 and 40, that leaves another 30-some-odd that we've got to do today and tomorrow.

445
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Thank you.

446
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,500
getting the reports done for about 40 of those.

447
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:14,500
And so, you know, when the 30 and 40, that leaves another 30-some-odd that we've got to do today and tomorrow if it's necessary.

448
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:21,000
And it kind of looks to me like it's going to be necessary.

449
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:39,500
So the first bill which we'd like to have is HB 1047, relative to the Charter Public School Joint Legislative Oversight Committee Now I I'm seeing that There is an amendment floating around here on that one.

450
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,500
Is that correct?

451
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,500
That is correct.

452
01:08:43,500 --> 01:09:01,500
I have an amendment Amendment, okay, what we're going to be doing with amendments will allow discussion, but we're not going to take a motion on the amendment Okay So so you have an amendment amendment.

453
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,500
Yes, I do.

454
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,500
I have an amendment.

455
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,500
It's number 0652H.

456
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:13,500
And it simply is an amendment that actually Representative Ladd, you suggested.

457
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:20,500
And that is that changing the number of Senate representatives on the oversight committee.

458
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:42,500
So the committee shall include the chairperson of the House or designee the chairperson of the Senate committee or designee the chairperson of the House finance or designee one representative appointed by the Speaker of the House and one senator appointed by the President.

459
01:09:42,500 --> 01:10:02,000
In the initial bill, I I had some outside people in and you suggested to take them out so that they could come in as witnesses or experts or give testimony but to not put them on the committee.

460
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,500
So this is meeting your your suggestion.

461
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,500
So thank you.

462
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:10,500
I'm trying to find the amendment.

463
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:12,500
Okay.

464
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:15,000
You need a couple, Bill?

465
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
There's more here.

466
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Okay.

467
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,500
Okay, just open for discussion.

468
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:25,500
Is there any further discussion on this amendment?

469
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:33,000
It appears to me that the amendment primarily whittles down the Senate members on this.

470
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Am I correct?

471
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:43,500
It also takes out, you suggested to take out the non-voting member from the Department of Education.

472
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:59,000
and that was you know so that we had talked about they could come for testimony and that sort of thing, but to not have them part of the committee itself.

473
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,500
Okay, I'm going to get...

474
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,500
Mr.

475
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,500
Chair.

476
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,500
Yes, go ahead.

477
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:29,000
So are those, the members that you you took out are those currently members of the The Charter public school oversight committee So How does the how does the membership now under the proposed amendment differ from the current membership of the Charter?

478
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Public school oversight committee proposed amendment differ from the current membership of the Charter Public School Oversight Committee?

479
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:52,500
So, this amendment, basically, it, you know, speaks to paragraph two, and it remains the same, except for taking out the non-voting member representative from the Department of Education.

480
01:11:52,500 --> 01:12:03,500
And as I said, that was one of the things that Chairman Ladd had suggested as a change in this particular bill.

481
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:07,500
But other than that, it doesn't change it.

482
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:20,000
So just to be clear, though, my question isn't to how it compares with the bill, but how does it compare to the current membership?

483
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,500
Because there is a current charter public school oversight.

484
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:26,500
There is.

485
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,500
Yes, there is.

486
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:34,000
And it doesn't change the makeup of the committee as such.

487
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Okay.

488
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Okay.

489
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Thanks.

490
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,500
The major change was this non-voting member.

491
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,500
Okay.

492
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,500
Yes.

493
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:51,500
I think the membership, doesn't this, I'm sorry.

494
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,500
Thank you.

495
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:58,000
Doesn't the amended bill add House Finance Committee Chair?

496
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:09,500
Yeah, I think it, yes, it had, I'm sorry, yes, it did, it had the House Finance and that's removed also on suggestion.

497
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:12,000
So that we're back down.

498
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,500
This amendment puts it back down to just senators and representatives.

499
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:25,000
I thought, though, that the current committee does not mandate the finance chair or designee.

500
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
It's taken out in the amendment.

501
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Okay.

502
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
No, it doesn't?

503
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,500
It's been so long since I've been in this.

504
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:39,000
Senate, the House, the Senate.

505
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Oh, the chairperson.

506
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,500
Yes, I see that now.

507
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:45,500
Yep.

508
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:49,500
But it's got one senator as opposed to.

509
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:54,000
One representative appointed by the senator and one Senate.

510
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Still has two Senators.

511
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Yes.

512
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
The chairperson.

513
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Yeah.

514
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Yes.

515
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Yes.

516
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Okay.

517
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Is there any further discussion on the amendment?

518
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
That's where we're going.

519
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
So just an informal show of hands here.

520
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,500
Is there anybody here that's not supporting the amendment?

521
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:31,500
But we have to, yeah, and okay, I think we're just going to roll ahead with a motion.

522
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:39,500
And I'm going to ask on this particular one that Representative Boehm provide a motion, please.

523
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:42,500
And I move ITL on 1047.

524
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,500
On the amendment?

525
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:48,500
No, we've had the discussion on the amendment.

526
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,500
Okay.

527
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:54,500
Now we're just moving forward on the bill.

528
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:56,500
Okay.

529
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,500
I'll second that motion.

530
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:03,000
Representative Bohm, would you please speak to your motion?

531
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Yes, thank you.

532
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:12,000
I believe we have another bill, HB 1236, which will cover the same thing.

533
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
So, I don't think this bill is necessary.

534
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Representative Cordelli.

535
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Thank you.

536
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:29,000
My concern is Section 2 at the end of the page in the bill 25 to 29 lines.

537
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:42,500
And this basically requires an annual report by the State Board of Education on recommendations for charter schools where it is not a mandated annual report currently.

538
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:49,500
So I think this is really just creating busy work for the State Board.

539
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,500
Further discussion?

540
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:53,500
Representative Tanner.

541
01:15:53,500 --> 01:16:06,500
Yes, and I'm sorry, I was kind of confused with this whole thing, but the original statute has three senators, and I've reduced it to two.

542
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:18,500
I just want to point out to the committee that the last time this committee met, the legislative oversight for charters, was in 2016.

543
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:36,500
That was the last time they met, because, number one, they couldn't get a quorum, and evidently they didn't think it was necessary to meet, that they didn't have enough information or whatever to go over.

544
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:41,500
The last report that they ever issued was in 2011.

545
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:56,500
And, you know, since 2011, you think of the change that we've had in charter schools and the influx of federal money, actually, as startup money for new charter schools.

546
01:16:56,500 --> 01:17:15,000
I think this is an area where we need to have legislative oversight and we needed to streamline the committee, which I did, and also set a statute that says that they had to file a report.

547
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:25,500
And if there's nothing to be reported, all they have to do is say a report is nothing to be reported.

548
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:29,500
But obviously, they didn't do that since 2011.

549
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:56,000
So that's why that was the impetus for this bill and I certainly think it needs a lot more oversight that the charter schools need a lot more oversight at this point and that I would offer that we vote against this bill and have an ought to pass bill with the amendment.

550
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Thank you.

551
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Any further discussion?

552
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Yes, Representative Luno.

553
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,500
Thank you very much, Mr.

554
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:06,500
Chair.

555
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:15,000
So while the committee is called, and it's an existing committee, I think that's important to know.

556
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:49,000
It's an existing committee with three senators on it the bill with the amendment would streamline that possibly the word oversight committee which is the current name of the committee i don't know if oversight is really a great name for it but just the fact that they they would issue an annual report because of the bill, because of Bill 1047 as amended, I think is tremendous.

557
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:59,500
Because one of the things that I think we've heard on and on is that charters provide the opportunity for innovation.

558
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:10,500
And I don't understand how the state would actually capture those innovative measures without having an annual report on what that is.

559
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:20,000
I think this is a tremendous opportunity to collect information that could be used in our other public schools.

560
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:48,000
And if for whatever reasons the current committee has a difficult time meeting because of its membership composition, then I think this is an opportunity to change that and provide the state with the information that I think all of our public education, all of our students, all 160,000 students across the state could benefit from.

561
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:53,000
So I would urge not going with the ITL motion.

562
01:19:53,000 --> 01:20:05,000
The other bill that Representative Boehm mentioned, 1236, I think, is a state accountability commission for reviewing the accountability standards for our school districts.

563
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:10,500
So it is not the same as what this would do.

564
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:15,500
And like I say, the commission, the committee already exists.

565
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:31,000
And this bill I think substantially improves the membership of the committee and the ability for that committee to produce reports that would be beneficial to all of our public schools.

566
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,500
Is there any further discussion, Representative Porter?

567
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:36,500
Thank you, Mr.

568
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,500
Chair.

569
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:50,500
Having served as chair or on several commissions and committees in my time in the legislature, it's not unusual to require an annual report.

570
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:53,500
In fact, most of them do.

571
01:20:53,500 --> 01:21:06,000
So the legislature knows what's going on in that committee or commission and in that section of life that the committee or commission is overseeing.

572
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:16,000
So I don't see that having to produce a report should be a reason why we should eliminate this bill.

573
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Thank you.

01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:22,500
Our administrative assistant needs to get on this as quickly as possible.

629
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:29,000
So please get them done today, even if it's a two or three-liner.

630
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Get them done, please.

631
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Okay, the next bill is HB 1051 this bill is relative to see to the State Board of Education rules for credits for alternative extended learning and work based programs I hand the gavel over to represent Cordelli thank you you, Mr.

632
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Chair.

633
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,500
And I'll call on the chairman for a motion.

634
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:01,000
I'd like to move ITL.

635
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Thank you.

636
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Is there a second?

637
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
I second.

638
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Representative Lakers, thank you.

639
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Discussion by the chairman?

640
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,500
Yes, some brief discussion here.

641
01:24:13,500 --> 01:25:35,000
I believe that this bill would allow local boards authority to reject credit earned through approved alternative education programs such as learn everywhere program and where it says in the bill on line six the programs which may be accepted by the local school board these these learn everywhere program credits are approved by the State Board of Education based upon the competencies offered in that course and approved by the State Board as the State Board does set academic standards so in conclusion I feel that it provides it will eliminate some of the opportunity we have for the choice of programs taking a program through learn everywhere program you could be out of sequence in your own high school and taking courses you can go to learn everywhere program and get that course or get something equivalent to it so I recommend ITO thank you resident like us any comments you know comments from the committee represented Tanner yes you, Mr.

642
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Chair.

643
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:51,500
The bill was pretty simple, and actually the Department of Education has started to set up on their website vetting and recommending different programs for their Learn Everywhere program.

644
01:25:51,500 --> 01:26:52,000
After the sentence that Chairman Ladd read, there's also one that says nothing in this subparagraph shall prevent us local school district from approving vendors offering credit for the alternative extended learning or work based programs which do not appear on the pre-approved list maintained by the state this was a bill the intent of this this bill from me was to allow for a spot at the Department of Education where people, parents who wanted their child to do a Learn Everywhere program or an alternative program or workplace program could go to a site on DOE and find groups that were vetted by DOE that they actually had an application to them, they vetted them, and they approved them.

645
01:26:52,000 --> 01:27:02,000
And certainly we've talked about criminal background checks and a few other things that are kind of key in consumer.

646
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:12,500
when a consumer is looking for a product, and it's particularly an education product where they are sending their child to.

647
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:24,000
I think the bill was very simple, and I think it's very needed, and I would urge people to vote against the ITL.

648
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Thank you.

649
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Further discussion?

650
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Representative Lakers and then Representative Luno.

651
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:46,500
Yeah, my understanding is that second part, like you said, is they did a lot of work to put it all out there so that it's available for parents to find.

652
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:52,500
But my objection is still the same as was presented by Rep.

653
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:55,000
Ladd is the word may.

654
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Representative Luno.

655
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,500
Thank you very much, Mr.

656
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:01,500
Chair.

657
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:07,500
So I think this is sort of a question of the chair.

658
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:11,500
Obviously, the Learn Everywhere program is relatively new.

659
01:28:11,500 --> 01:29:09,000
Rules came out recently, and I think the list of education service providers has has started to come out and but but given how the the current statute reads and what representative Tanner is trying to accomplish in 1051 under the under under the current law uh mr chair do um do districts have the and i guess beyond the state minimum standards the districts have to accept all learn everywhere credits and apply them towards graduation as we heard from the department and when testified on the bill, that they have matched up these Learn Everywhere courses or programs with competencies, and that those competencies are associated with various courses required for graduation credit.

660
01:29:09,000 --> 01:30:37,500
So what the bill is stating that although the State Board of Education has authority to do so pursuant to the rulemaking process 541-8 there the bill is looking at saying no the school board can reject that particular learn everywhere program that's would be seen by the State Board as meeting those competencies and approved by the State Board but the local board would not have to approve and so the student would therefore I have to take the course again or take some other form some other you know course to acquire that credit so I think there's a lot to this bill I have stated that I think the part of this bill which really is I object to is on line six where the word may is used and it doesn't say shall as is as done and accepted in rulemaking already so so So just a follow up on that Rick, because I'm not sure that, so as an example, the state minimum standards do not require world language for graduation, correct?

661
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:39,500
Correct.

662
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:49,500
So a high school could require, let's say, a year of world language as part of their graduation requirements, correct?

663
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:52,500
A high school could do that.

664
01:30:52,500 --> 01:31:09,500
And would a high school have to accept a Learn Everywhere credit to meet the world language requirement, even if that Learn Everywhere credit did not include any of the competencies for world language?

665
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:55,500
If the high school has gone above the minimum, then you would receive credit for that course in the Learn Everywhere, but it doesn't necessarily say you are going to be offering a credit that parallels with what the school districts looking at so you know I think what we're trying to do is say that by the district or the state board approving a course, if it matches the credits offered or demanded for that course, which the local school district has put in place, then it would count towards graduation.

666
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:58,500
I think, you know, that's what...

667
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:00,500
No, that answers it.

668
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:09,000
So the local board is still the one that sets the graduation requirements for that school district.

669
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Well, we have that in the minimum standards for public school approval.

670
01:32:15,000 --> 01:33:54,000
However, if, in fact, they have this as one of the requirements for their graduation from school district X and the student achieves those competencies through a program offered by through the learn everywhere or you know or maybe in another school that would count towards the graduation credit as long as it's consistent with the local graduation requirements great thank you represent Porter isn't it in still in current law or have we taken it out that the local school board is the one that determines our graduation requirements for their students and sets the standards for them I always understood as a school board member that I am responsible for making sure that all the children who graduate from my school district have met the competencies and requirements that we the local board have set up to to grant the diploma from my high school is that still the law academic standards are set by the state that's not the question that I asked you is it not the responsibility to me of the local school board to set the standards for the local graduation requirements to grant a local diploma from a local high school?

671
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Isn't that their responsibility in law?

672
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,500
You're coming from a different focus here.

673
01:34:00,500 --> 01:35:39,500
If, in fact, and as I just discussed with Representative Luno, if a student took a course which matches and meets the competencies of the course that's required for graduation set by the local school district then the student is should be given approval for that course it's not the local local authorities have no control of it's all about competencies it's not about seat time but it's still under law that local control by local school boards is what determines the graduation requirements for the local high school is that accurate the local school board will set graduation requirements and courses or requirements and we oftentimes used course or program and when in fact we're really looking at competencies my point being that requiring local school boards to accept something that they have not approved seems contradictory to me from their local control that they have over the content that they're responsible for providing a school district's responsible especially a high school to submit 43 courses for approval for the minimum public school standards with those 43 submitted courses there are also associated competencies if in fact the state recognizes that the there are also associated competencies.

674
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:54,000
If, in fact, the state recognizes that the student has mastered those competencies via another avenue, then the student should get credit for that requirement at the local level.

675
01:35:54,000 --> 01:36:05,500
So you are telling me that it is not the local board that has responsibility for acknowledging that those competencies have been met.

676
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:20,000
It is the board sets the competencies for their course, but if that is accomplished via some other Learning Everywhere activity, then they should get credit for those competencies.

677
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Thank you.

678
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:35,500
I'm just going to chime in even on the sub, but some of you know I'm also the squadron commander for our legislative Civil Air Patrol squadron.

679
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:45,000
And I am actually in the middle of doing this process for the Civil Air Patrol's aerospace education program.

680
01:36:45,000 --> 01:37:03,000
And if anybody thinks it's an easy way to get a kid a credit, they have no idea the ridiculous amount of paperwork I have to submit to DOE to try to get this program approved.

681
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:10,500
So I think they already have a significant and robust vetting process in doing this.

682
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:15,000
And I guess I see this bill as redundant.

683
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:20,500
And as it served on JALCAR, I also saw those rules.

684
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:23,500
So again, I think it's covered.

685
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:31,000
And ITL is the appropriate recommendation Further discussion on the bill not seeing any Mr.

686

01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Okay.

730
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
We have amendments.

731
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:47,500
So we will open up the discussion with no motions made on the discussion during the separate.

732
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:49,500
Okay, let's see.

733
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:51,500
11-14.

734
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:53,500
Okay.

735
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:55,500
This stack here.

736
01:39:55,500 --> 01:40:04,000
Where did you put all of the, they, all they got mixed up in this other stack.

737
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Okay.

738
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Okay.

739
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Sure.

740
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Representative Tanner, what, is it your, or Representative Cornell, is it yours?

741
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Yeah.

742
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Why don't you go ahead, Patty, and start explaining, I'll find it.

743
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
All right.

744
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Pardon me?

745
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Oh, I know.

746
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
I'm just hunting through.

747
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:49,000
The amendment actually just removes lines 7 through 19 of the original bill and just states that the scholarship organization shall comply in a directory of public profiles for each education service provider listed.

748
01:40:49,000 --> 01:41:14,000
And the intent of this was to make the information easy and convenient for parents to find when they're looking for a provider for their student that they want to go somewhere other than the local public school so the intent of this was to make it easier for parents.

749
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:18,500
On line six, where do you end that sentence?

750
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:20,500
That includes.

751
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:22,500
After the word listed.

752
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:24,500
Okay.

753
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:28,500
And then everything A through J is eliminated?

754
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:30,500
Yes.

755
01:41:30,500 --> 01:42:13,000
The effective date remains the same and I believe this information is already available so should be easy for them to just put it into a list that parents can just look at the represent lakers yes not only is this already done when they did rules they added to the original stuff and and added particular things that had to be done by the vendors and said that it had to go on the DOE website it is already on on the DOE website.

756
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:20,500
It already has a bunch more information than was in the original, and it's done.

757
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:22,500
It's there.

758
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:24,500
You can find it.

759
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:26,500
Further discussion?

760
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:29,500
You know, on the discussion here.

761
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:45,000
So my question to everybody is that if it's already being done, and we assume that it is, then what does this really make any difference one way or the other?

762
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:56,500
Or by doing it, do we just enforce the idea that the directory profiles of the providers will just be listed on listed.

763
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:58,500
Mr.

764
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:00,500
Chair?

765
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:02,500
Yeah.

766
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:10,500
Yes, by putting this in law, it would assure that it would continue to be done.

767
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:12,500
It strengthens the program.

768
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:16,000
So it is being done right now.

769
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Okay.

770
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Education site, so it's covered in both places.

771
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Thank you, Mr.

772
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Chair.

773
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:37,500
It just seems like it would be a good way to assure that the program that you all want to succeed so much.

774
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:39,500
We want to see?

775
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:54,500
You all want to see succeed so much that it would protect that program by having a piece of legislation that requires this to happen, because rules can be changed.

776
01:43:54,500 --> 01:44:08,500
But if it's in the RSA's it's harder to do is there further discussion on the discussion okay I'm going to take about a five-minute caucus okay Okay.

777
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:12,000
What was the bill and amendment number?

778
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
It's 1114.

779
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Bill number?

780
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Bill number?

781
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
1114?

782
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,500
Yeah, this one right here.

783
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:24,500
And amendment number?

784
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:27,500
Let's see, I don't have to.

785
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:29,500
Yeah.

786
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:31,500
I don't have to.

787
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:35,500
Dave, do you have any more of those?

788
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:38,000
I didn't have the amendment.

789
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
I'm looking for it.

790
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,500
I just can't find it.

791
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:44,500
Okay, good.

792
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:46,500
I have a show.

793
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:48,500
Thank you.

794
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:52,000
Make sure all the mics are off.

795
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Thank you.

796
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Thank you.

797
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Thank you.

798
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Thank you.

799
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Thank you.

800
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Thank you.

801
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Thank you.

802
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Thank you.

803
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Thank you.

804
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Move ITL.

805
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Thank you.

806
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:22,500
I think as we discussed briefly before the motion, I don't think that this bill is needed.

807
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:24,500
It's already being done.

808
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:26,500
It's in rules.

809
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:31,000
So I don't see any need for the bill.

810
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Nothing to add.

811
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Thank you.

812
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Thank you, Mr.

813
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Chair.

814
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:47,000
I'm trying to find the list on the sites, and I'm really having a difficult time.

815
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:59,000
So I'm really concerned that we say this is up here, but when I went to the Department of Education, I couldn't find it.

816
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:05,000
When I went to the scholarship fund page, I couldn't find it.

817
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Now I'm on New Hampshire Education Freedom Accounts, and there is a parent handbook, but it's not listed on the Department of Education site.

818
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,500
A list of schools is.

819
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:30,000
So just so you know, I've been working for the last 10 minutes trying to find it thanks very much mr.

820
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:44,500
chair yeah I think I telling this speaks volumes about what the what the real purpose behind quote education freedom accounts otherwise known as voucher programs in other states.

821
01:46:44,500 --> 01:47:12,500
The New Hampshire ZFA is more expensive than any voucher program in any state of the union and provides opportunities for parents or for families to collect money from the state to be used to pay private school tuition or homeschooling costs or who knows what else because of the lack of accountability in the program.

822
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:25,000
At least this bill would have provided families with a directory of educational service providers that could be useful for helping to educate their children.

823
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:44,000
But given the fact that apparently the legislature is not interested in doing that, I really do think it confirms most Granite Staters' suspicion about how their tax money is being stolen to be used for this program.

824
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Thank you.

825
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Thank you.

826
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:54,500
I would just take exception to the comment that money is being stolen.

827
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:56,500
Mr.

828
01:47:56,500 --> 01:47:58,500
Chair?

829
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:00,500
Sorry again.

830
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:11,000
So we just approved these rules in Jalcar no more than, I think, two, three weeks ago after an extensive debate.

831
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:14,500
And this list is being compiled regularly.

832
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:18,500
I understand this is a brand new law.

833
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:41,000
So whether Representative Porter can find the list or not, just understand they're still establishing, evaluating, and creating that list, especially everything that fell under Section O, which was other things the legislature can't think of section that allows for the expenditure of those funds.

834
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:45,000
So, again, I think they are doing it.

835
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:56,500
The testimony in the JALCAR committee was that both from the scholarship fund and from Commissioner Edelbluth was these things are being done.

836
01:48:56,500 --> 01:49:00,500
They're establishing the list, and they'll be up.

837
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:20,000
As they approve more and more organizations or more and more opportunities to use EFA funds they will add to that list but understand it is they literally just have the rules approved three weeks ago thank you mr.

838
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:34,500
chair I did but we've been told they're up already and we've been told that they've been up already for the last two weeks And the list is there.

839
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:39,500
It's easy for people to find Who provides the services?

840
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:51,000
It's easy to know what services they provide because it's in rules and it's up online and Right now I'm not finding it.

841
01:49:51,000 --> 01:50:11,000
And I think that, for me, makes passing HB 114 more important because it needs to be there so parents can make informed decisions about how they're going to spend the money that they are getting for their children's education.

842
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:25,500
If you the program to be successful I would think you would want to make sure that that kind of information was readily available representative Mullen thank you mr.

843
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:31,500
chair I have seen the list but that's exactly what it is.

844
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:34,000
It's a list of programs.

845
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:38,500
It does not include profile information about the programs.

846
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:52,000
So there are schools and tutoring agencies and things like that, the names of the organizations on the list, but there's nothing about what kinds of programs.

847
01:50:52,000 --> 01:51:04,500
And I just want to draw attention to the fact that when this bill was originally presented to the committee, it was presented by me.

848
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:58,500
And the complaint at that time, because Representative Cornell had asked me to present her bill in her absence, at the time, the concern from the committee was that the information that was being asked for was not necessarily appropriate to every single education service provider when I look at this list I don't see any individuals on the list so I guess my question to representative Lang would be are there rules that allow for the collection of information on individuals who are functioning as educational service providers, as opposed to just the name of a school or the name of Brave Writer or Timber Doodle Company.

849
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:04,500
I mean, there are names here, but there's no information about them.

850
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:09,000
So my concern is that these are not profiles.

851
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Thank you.

852
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Representative Cordelli and then Representative Lekas.

853
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Thank you.

854
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:37,500
Representative Lange discussed the rules that were recently passed, and the rules include the requirement for the scholarship organization to include not just the name, but the eligible services provided, the fee amounts received for services, and the number of EFA students received.

855
01:52:37,500 --> 01:53:47,500
Those are all in rules that were recently passed represent lekkas yes originally what had intended to be done before the rules were passed was there was a person who was going to set up a website specifically so that all this stuff could to be on there but then in rules they said no it had to be on the DOE website and so the names are there and and that was just last Monday and the scholarship organization has been working at getting all that together and I believe the intent is there's even going to be direct links to each of these organizations once it's completed but that was last Monday so they've had to change what they were going to do to what they are going to do now and they're scrambling to do do that.

856
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:53,500
But my understanding is they are, at this moment, entering that information.

857
01:53:53,500 --> 01:54:08,500
Can I just answer, Representative Lakers, I do not for a second doubt the fact that an attempt is being made to gather information and get it up and running.

858
01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:41,000
My concern is that if we do not put this into statute ten years from now how are we going to be you know God well and everybody will be retired by then right that's involved with this process right now and how are we going to guarantee moving forward that the process remains mandatory and and that's that's why we put things into statute.

859
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
So thank you.

860
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:48,500
By then I hope to be in the Bahamas growing oranges.

861
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:50,500
Okay.

862
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:54,000
Any further discussion on the committee's part?

863
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Yes, Representative Hall.

864
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:12,000
I'm just going to say 15 minutes ago I heard this was was all up, everything's there, and now we find out it's not there, well then it's going to be there.

865
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:17,000
And I think that that's difficult when you're making decisions.

866
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:20,500
I'm basing it on what I'm hearing.

867
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:28,500
I'm new to the committee and I hear something and then I say, well, maybe not.

868
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:32,000
So, I just want to say that.

869
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Thank you.

870
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Representative Luno?

871
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,500
No, thanks very much, Mr.

872
01:55:38,500 --> 01:56:21,500
Chair mr chair and and thank you representative hall for pointing that out because i think we all have a responsibility to uh to not be deceptive and not to lie in front of the to other members of the committee nor to people across the granite state so when you say something like it's already up but fail to recognize as representative Representative Mullen pointed out, that the actionable thing that this brings is the word profiles, not just the names of these service providers.

873
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:40,500
So, you know, I would just caution members of the committee to make sure you read the bill and understand what the bill is intended to do before bringing that information before the committee and to our constituents.

874
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:42,500
Thank you.

875
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:44,500
Representative Cordelli.

876
01:56:44,500 --> 01:56:46,500
Thank you.

877
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:54,500
I would just point out that the law requires that a parent advisory committee be formed.

878
01:56:54,500 --> 01:57:01,500
And I think that they're starting to look at that in the scholarship organization.

879
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:17,000
And I think that that parent advisory committee will be perfectly capable of making recommendations on what information should be available to parents in addition to what is required in rules.

880
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Further discussion?

881
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Yes, Representative Lucas.

882
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
I'm sorry.

883
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:26,500
I was looking at the other part.

884
01:57:26,500 --> 01:57:29,000
Yes, the list was there.

885
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:33,000
In fact, we just looked it up here.

886
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,000
The profiles are being put up.

887
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:42,500
And I was referring to the fact that there is a list there.

888
01:57:42,500 --> 01:57:47,000
They are improving that list as time goes on.

889
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,500
But the list is there.

890
01:57:49,500 --> 01:57:53,500
I was not saying everything is completely done.

891
01:57:53,500 --> 01:58:34,500
How can it be be in one week so I wasn't trying to lie or give misinformation I was simply trying to say that list is up there we found it here there's just a link and it says providers and you click on it and it comes right up it's very easy to see it's there they are entering the information to add more information to that but the list is there and has been it was here there last week.

892
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:37,000
Thank you Any further discussion?

893
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Mr.

894
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:42,500

895
01:58:42,500 --> 01:58:44,500
All represent Porter.

896
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:46,500
Thank you, mr.

897
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:51,500
Chair, and this is this is not a Angry debate.

898
01:58:51,500 --> 01:59:30,500
It's just to let you know I learned something this morning that there's two different places that you might look that the education scholarship children's scholarship fund is not the same as the children's scholarship fund for EFA's and then in order to if you look children's scholarship fund in New Hampshire you're looking up the tax credit program but if you look up of Children's Scholarship Fund in New Hampshire, you're looking up the tax credit program.

899
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:39,500
But if you look up Children's Scholarship Fund under Education Freedom Accounts, you're looking at Education Freedom Accounts.

900
01:59:39,500 --> 01:59:48,000
So a parent would need to know the difference between those two elements of the scholarship-granting organization.

901
01:59:48,000 --> 02:00:14,000
I looked up Children's Scholars's scholarship fund which I understood to be the name of the scholarship granting organization that works with EFA but evidently it's a different one or it has a different name or it's under somehow different because the information is different when you look at the two sites.

902
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Thank you.

903
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:19,500
Thank you for your point of clarification.

02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:21,500

908

Okay, uh, some have up is 1131.

02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:36,000
This is a bill relative to facial covering policies for schools.

969
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
1131.

970
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Do we have amendments out on this one?

971
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
I believe so.

972
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Search through your paperwork.

973
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
1131.

974
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:51,500
Do you have one on 1131, Bill?

975
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:53,500
No?

976
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:55,500
Okay.

977
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:57,500
Okay.

978
02:02:57,500 --> 02:02:59,500
Yeah, okay.

979
02:02:59,500 --> 02:03:01,500
That's it.

980
02:03:01,500 --> 02:03:03,500
Here it is.

981
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:05,500
It's just coming around.

982
02:03:05,500 --> 02:03:07,500
Okay.

983
02:03:07,500 --> 02:03:09,500
Someone to look.

984
02:03:09,500 --> 02:03:11,500
Yeah.

985
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:13,500
Okay.

986
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:17,000
I'll recognize Representative Cordelli for a motion.

987
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:23,500
Yes, I would like to move out to pass and offer amendment 0896.

988
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:28,000
You need a second on the out to pass.

989
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Yeah, sorry.

990
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
Representative Bowen.

991
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Okay.

992
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Representative Cordelli, do you want to speak to your motion of ought to pass?

993
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
Yes, thank you.

994
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:58,500
We recently had a joint announcement by the governor, the Department of Health, the Department of Education no longer recommending universal face masking in the state, and that included for schools.

995
02:03:58,500 --> 02:04:11,500
I think that, excuse me, I think for too long, schools have been driven by things other than educational considerations when it comes to face masks.

996
02:04:11,500 --> 02:04:21,500
And I think now with this bill, I think we should move forward with eliminating face mask policies in schools.

997
02:04:21,500 --> 02:04:24,000
Do you want to offer...

998
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:36,500
forward with eliminating face mask policies in schools yes the amendment is zero eight nine six yeah I'm yes, ought to pass on the amendment.

999
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:50,000
So we have a motion on the floor to OTP for the bill, but we have the amendment of 0896H as an amended amendment to that bill.

1000
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:54,500
Would you like to speak to that, Representative Cordelli?

1001
02:04:54,500 --> 02:04:56,500
Thank you, Mr.

1002
02:04:56,500 --> 02:04:58,500
Chairman.

1003
02:04:58,500 --> 02:05:01,500
This amendment is actually very simple.

1004
02:05:01,500 --> 02:05:03,500
It does two things.

1005
02:05:03,500 --> 02:05:11,000
One, it removes from the original bill that non-public schools are included in the legislation.

1006
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:16,000
This will apply to public schools and public academies only.

1007
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:25,000
And the second thing it does is on line 25, it changes the effective date to upon passage.

1008
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Okay.

1009
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
Is there...

1010
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:34,000
We never got a second on the amendment, did we?

1011
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
Representative Saude?

1012
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
So, okay.

1013
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:44,500
So we got a second on it, and you've already given your discussion.

1014
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:47,000
Sorry for the miscue here.

1015
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
A further discussion?

1016
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
Yes, Representative Mullen.

1017
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Thank you, Mr.

1018
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Chair.

1019
02:05:55,000 --> 02:06:18,000
I believe it also removes the superintendent of schools as a determining factor in, if you look at line four of the original bill, the school board of a school district, the superintendent or chief administrative officer of a school district, and authorities, yada, yada, yada.

1020
02:06:18,000 --> 02:07:12,000
if you look at the amended bill it says the school board of a school district or the chief executive officer of a chartered public school I was wondering if representative Cordelli could speak to why the superintendent seems to have disappeared thank you the question it's really the school board that adopts policies not the superintendent who adopts policy so we're talking about policies here so I thought it was appropriate that it's specifies the school board since that's their responsibility would that not be the same for the charters or the, I mean, you've given the authority to the executive officer of a chartered public school.

1021
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:24,500
They have a board of trustees, but I don't think that the board of trustees would necessarily get involved with policies at the charter school.

1022
02:07:24,500 --> 02:07:26,500
Follow up to that?

1023
02:07:26,500 --> 02:07:30,000
Do we know that that's the case?

1024
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Do we not think that the board of trustees is responsible for the development of policies at their charter school?

1025
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:48,500
And Representative Cordelli, I'll open that question up to anybody that can answer it, not just you.

1026
02:07:48,500 --> 02:07:54,500
The representative from Bedford's opened up a question for all of us.

1027
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:56,500
There you go.

1028
02:07:56,500 --> 02:08:16,500
Is the Board of Trustees on a – I mean, it has been our practice to sort of acknowledge that Board of Trustees in a similar way, if not identical, to the school board of the public school at large.

1029
02:08:16,500 --> 02:08:30,500
So I guess I'm confused as to why the executive officer would be left in, the superintendent would be taken out, and the board of trustees appears nowhere.

1030
02:08:30,500 --> 02:08:32,500
Representative Luna?

1031
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:34,500
So thank you, Mr.

1032
02:08:34,500 --> 02:08:36,500
Chair.

1033
02:08:36,500 --> 02:09:25,500
And Representative Mullen's point, I think, is very clear that boards are responsible for policy and they're responsible for enforcement through their selection as a chief executive officer, whether that's the superintendent of the school district or the the ceo of of another organization that's just governance structure and um and i i think this um you know this is an indication that um that that uh 11 31 is just not ready for prime time because it has basically a conflicting charge that's different for public schools or school districts than it is for other public schools.

1034
02:09:25,500 --> 02:09:38,500
And furthermore, it is completely quiet on any consideration for a non-public school that may be under contract with a school district to provide educational services.

1035
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:40,500
Further discussion?

1036
02:09:40,500 --> 02:09:42,500
Representative Porter?

1037
02:09:42,500 --> 02:09:44,500
Thank you, Mr.

1038
02:09:44,500 --> 02:09:46,500
Chair.

1039
02:09:46,500 --> 02:10:33,000
if in the future when COVID is gone if another viral deadly viral infection comes forward and it is known without a doubt that wearing a mask protects people from that deadly disease will this passing this amendment prevent all All our public schools from requiring people to wear masks but not private schools just public schools I should mean I think that's covered on lines seven and eight six seven and eight shall not adopt to enforce enforce implement a policy that requires students remembers the public to wear a facial covering.

1040
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:36,500
And operative words they are not require.

1041
02:10:36,500 --> 02:10:39,500
So it's a student parental option.

1042
02:10:39,500 --> 02:10:41,500
Representative Hull.

1043
02:10:41,500 --> 02:10:43,500
Thank you, Mr.

1044
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:45,500
Chair.

1045
02:10:45,500 --> 02:10:52,500
Could someone explain to me why non-public schools are not held to this account?

1046
02:10:52,500 --> 02:10:56,000
I'm not really sure I understand that.

1047
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:01,000
I think our responsibility primarily is for the public schools.

1048
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:08,000
I did not think that delving into policies for non-public schools was appropriate here.

1049
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:22,500
And I think that during the pandemic, we saw that many non-public schools remained open while public schools were closed and also provided optional masking rather than mandatory masking.

1050
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:24,500
Representative Boone.

1051
02:11:24,500 --> 02:11:26,500
Thank you.

1052
02:11:26,500 --> 02:11:30,000
In response to a couple of questions.

1053
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:37,500
Number one, the superintendent worked for the school board, so that's really not an issue.

1054
02:11:37,500 --> 02:11:45,000
And for the board of trustees, they don't really read that often to run things.

1055
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:58,500
Also, for the school boards, cannot require, if there's a further epidemic of some kind, the state can require, just like the government in an emergency thing.

1056
02:11:58,500 --> 02:12:06,000
One of the problems we have now is the governor says it's not needed anymore.

1057
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:11,000
Yes, there are some schools saying we're still requiring it.

1058
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:15,000
No, that should not be the school's responsibility.

1059
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
That's the government's responsibility.

1060
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:52,000
And by having some schools requiring it and some schools not, it just makes more people saying why are they doing it why aren't we doing it and just causes all kinds of confusion so I think it's it's the government's responsibility the state can do an emergency thing saying that's what it is but let's not give authority to a school board that really should not have that authority.

1061
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Thank you.

1062
02:12:54,000 --> 02:13:03,500
I have a question, and I think everybody knows I'm a person that believes in choice on this topic.

1063
02:13:03,500 --> 02:13:13,500
I'm looking at this bill in terms of the amendment on line 17 and the original bill on line 1617.

1064
02:13:13,500 --> 02:14:01,500
and I'm going to read it and I'm going to ask for somebody to please explain to me because I do not like passing anything which I cannot give a definition for terminology any person claiming to be aggrieved by a violation of this section including the attorney general may initiate a civil action against the school school district school board or other public entity in superior court other public entity are we now the title of this bill deals with schools now are we now taking this a whole huge step beyond the public schools?

1065
02:14:01,500 --> 02:14:03,500
That's my question.

1066
02:14:03,500 --> 02:14:41,500
I'm asking out there other entity public entity Question Other words if we're going to address schools perhaps we need to get other public entity out of it yes I must apologize that I wasn't here for the hearing on this but I'm also confused by that last paragraph because if if a person feels aggrieved by a violation of this section, it sounds like they can go to the attorney general and do civil action.

1067
02:14:41,500 --> 02:15:00,000
But then section three says a violation of this section by an educator, and the educator is an employee of the school and filling out the policy of the school, how are they liable under this law?

1068
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:09,500
And I don't understand why it even has anything to do with the code of conduct because they're employees.

1069
02:15:09,500 --> 02:15:23,000
They're doing a job that the school board and the superintendent who works for the school board and the governor who sets things and, you know, Dr.

1070
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Chan who comes out with the latest deal.

1071
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:34,000
I don't – that whole section seems like it's just – shouldn't belong there.

1072
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:37,500
I mean, I just don't understand it.

1073
02:15:37,500 --> 02:15:47,500
So maybe when we're talking about any entity, we might also talk about why are educators singled out in this?

1074
02:15:47,500 --> 02:16:08,500
Why, you know, should, if the cafeteria lady says to the person next to her that's working there, you have to wear a face mask, is she you know they have to wear gloves and they have to wear a face mask.

1075
02:16:08,500 --> 02:16:19,000
Is she, you know, and they have to wear gloves and they have to keep their hair out of the food.

1076
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:44,000
If anybody is individually listed, it should be somebody like that or the janitor that has people working for him that he says to the janitor, to the people working, employees, that they have to have proper covering for, you know, doing spraying for mosquitoes or whatever around the school.

1077
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:52,500
So I just find that last paragraph really offensive to me as a former educator, I guess.

1078
02:16:52,500 --> 02:16:54,500
Representative Ford?

1079
02:16:54,500 --> 02:16:56,500
Use your mic.

1080
02:16:56,500 --> 02:17:15,500
I'm wondering if that might include things like collective bargaining units so that that as a unit might raise an objection or call for some action to be taken by way of being representatives of groups of employees.

1081
02:17:15,500 --> 02:17:18,500
No, it doesn't preclude it, though.

1082
02:17:18,500 --> 02:17:20,500
It's a union.

1083
02:17:20,500 --> 02:17:22,500
It says an educator.

1084
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:24,500
Any person?

1085
02:17:24,500 --> 02:17:26,500
Representative Allison.

1086
02:17:26,500 --> 02:17:28,500
Thank you, Mr.

1087
02:17:28,500 --> 02:17:30,500
Chair.

1088
02:17:30,500 --> 02:17:38,500
This bill and the amendment make no sense from a public health perspective, none at all.

1089
02:17:38,500 --> 02:18:00,000
And in terms of schools who had varying policies about mask mandates, in most cases there were schools where there were surges or classes where there were surges, and it made sense to have a different policy in that school from another school.

1090
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:13,500
So I strongly object to the bill and I would build on what Representative Porter said, that in the future, we don't know what this looks like.

1091
02:18:13,500 --> 02:18:19,000
And to tie the hands of these institutions is unconscionable, actually.

1092
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Thank you.

1093
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
Further discussion?

1094
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:27,000
Representative Lekas and then I think Representative Luna.

1095
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:41,500
As we all heard from the professional who deals with risk management and risk amelioration, masks do not have any effect against viruses, and we're talking about a virus.

1096
02:18:41,500 --> 02:19:29,500
said if you wear a respirator it has a very tiny effect that there are much more effective things that schools could do and could have used the ESSER money for including what we do here with the machines that actually kill the virus and so forcing children to and he also said the respirators could not be fitted for children age 12 and under and so forcing children to wear a mask for to no purpose whatsoever since it has no effect against viruses if it was was bacteria, that would be a different matter.

1097
02:19:29,500 --> 02:19:43,500
But viruses are so small, he said it makes no difference because you cannot seal them well enough, and they just come in the sides, the top, whatever.

1098
02:19:43,500 --> 02:19:54,000
And therefore, he said, you know, it makes no sense to have a law that does something ineffective that harms children.

1099
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Thank you.

1100
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Thank you.

1101
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:05,500
It makes no sense to have a law that does something ineffective that harms children.

1102
02:20:05,500 --> 02:20:07,500
Thank you.

1103
02:20:07,500 --> 02:20:09,500
Representative Luna?

1104
02:20:09,500 --> 02:20:11,500
Thank you, Mr.

1105
02:20:11,500 --> 02:20:13,500
Chair.

1106
02:20:13,500 --> 02:20:41,000
So, you know, notwithstanding my earlier comments with regards to the truthfulness of information presented to this committee, Obviously, we hear from various interested parties with different levels of information that may or may not correspond with science, but that's what we do when we listen to testimony from people that present to the committee.

1107
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:55,500
So I think from some of that you really need to take it with a grain of salt because we've obviously heard testimony in the other direction Thank you.

1108
02:20:55,500 --> 02:21:23,500
So, so I think from some of that, you really need to take it with a grain of salt because we've obviously heard testimony to the other in the other direction to to support the use of of masks as a as a sound mitigation approach to to slowing down transmission of of of a contagion.

1109
02:21:23,500 --> 02:22:00,000
So, you know, I think another thing that's very relevant when looking at 1131, in particular, if we're seeing this as, well, this basically prevents it from being decided at a local level, but instead should be determined by a statewide public health, is that we actually heard from the governor specifically that the public health needs can vary significantly at the local level, maybe by county, maybe by city, maybe by town.

1110
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:14,500
And obviously, the state is in a position to understand all of those differences the way the leadership, school district leadership, school district governance is at the local level.

1111
02:22:14,500 --> 02:22:26,000
So I think this actually removes one of the tools that the governor found so important during the management of the COVID pandemic.

1112
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:32,500
So thank you and I hope we'll see fit to ITL this bill.

1113
02:22:32,500 --> 02:22:34,500
Representative Porter.

1114
02:22:34,500 --> 02:22:36,500
Thank you Mr.

1115
02:22:36,500 --> 02:22:38,500
Chair.

1116
02:22:38,500 --> 02:22:57,000
If I were a parent of a child that was medically fragile, and that child got COVID and died because there was no mask mandate in their school, what would be my legal rights under this bill?

1117
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
Thank you.

1118
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:29,000
I'm not sure I understood the question but basically it's a parental option under the spill so that parent would be able to mask their child if they saw fit they could mask their own child but the kid next to him who's got COVID and sneezes at him and gives him COVID doesn't have to have a mask on.

1119
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:34,500
I'm just wondering what would be the recourse for that parent.

1120
02:23:34,500 --> 02:24:08,500
I think that children are in school from approximately 7.30 to 2.30 during the day, those hours children are in school from approximately 7 30 to 2 30 during the day those hours children are outside of school for the majority of time i think trying to identify where someone caught covid might be a difficult task i don't see that as a valid argument against the bill.

1121
02:24:08,500 --> 02:24:10,500
Representative Cornell.

1122
02:24:10,500 --> 02:24:26,000
I may have missed it, but did we get an answer to the definition of the person claiming to be aggrieved by a violation of the sectional, what that aggrieved meant?

1123
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:32,500
I may have missed it, but wasn't that your question, Chairman, about the...

1124
02:24:32,500 --> 02:24:39,000
My question was relative to what is the definition of other public entity.

1125
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:43,500
I still haven't had an answer to that yet.

1126
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:48,500
I do have some other concerns with where we're going.

1127
02:24:48,500 --> 02:25:17,000
we had a bill earlier which we dealt with, HB 1336, which dealt with the Code of Ethics, and we, by unanimous consent here on this particular committee, decided to write an administrative letter to the Department of Education stating that we opine that the modifications to the code can best be accomplished through the rulemaking process.

1128
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:22,500
Now, here we are again going down a similar type road.

1129
02:25:22,500 --> 02:25:28,500
I have some concern with that, and maybe I'm interpreting it incorrectly.

1130
02:25:28,500 --> 02:25:33,500
I'm one that's all for masks should be totally optional.

1131
02:25:33,500 --> 02:25:39,500
And I agree in the science that we had presented to us.

1132
02:25:39,500 --> 02:25:45,000
However, how we're approaching it here gives me some real concerns.

1133
02:25:45,000 --> 02:26:33,000
I don't know what entity means and this is what got us into trouble with another bill earlier quite a while ago and and when we're talking about discrimination and and then we have this other that we just finished in 1336 so those are two concerns i'm going to have to have answered yes i i didn't get an answer either about why if the school board and the school district or the chief executive officer of the charter school makes these decisions and implements them, why on earth is Section 3 about an educator?

1134
02:26:33,000 --> 02:27:00,500
I mean, I don't even, I don't understand that at all, why an educator is liable under this section, why it's even listed under this section, because they have nothing, you know, the teacher, if they're requiring masks or doing it, fulfilling their job and can be fired for, you know, not doing their job.

1135
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:06,500
And then you're saying that if they do their job Thank you.

1136
02:27:06,500 --> 02:27:15,000
master doing it, fulfilling their job, and can be fired for, you know, not doing their job.

1137
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:30,000
And then you're saying that if they do their job and the public entity sues them, then they can lose their job anyway by certification through the code of ethics.

1138
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:35,500
I just don't understand how that whole section is even there.

1139
02:27:35,500 --> 02:28:08,000
That's, the public entity bothers me too because that that is like the whole world I mean it was anybody and then the other thing is that section three I don't know if it's the fuddling to anybody besides me if we have to represent you laying I can give one answer to representative Mullen's question about the Board of Trustees versus the chief executive.

1140
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:18,500
Under RSA 194-5, 194-B, colon 5, charter public schools authority and duties of the Board of Trustees, policy is not listed.

1141
02:28:18,500 --> 02:28:43,500
They're actually a financial board for the most part dealing with contracts and dealing with you know money issues and receiving donations real estate that kind of thing so the chief executive officer of would be responsible for the policy and dictates represent Cordelli thank you I see section three.

1142
02:28:43,500 --> 02:28:55,000
If a teacher within a school required their students to wear a mask, I think that's where this section three might come in.

1143
02:28:55,000 --> 02:29:32,500
come in and in terms of, entity enrollment number 2 a person claiming to be aggrieved in violation of this section and this section relates to schools charter schools can be chartered via the several means one a public school can form a charter school community college a group of parents a foundation can form a charter school according to our law so I think that maybe they would meet the criteria for other entities.

1144
02:29:32,500 --> 02:29:34,500
Representative Mullen.

1145
02:29:34,500 --> 02:29:36,500
Thank you, Mr.

1146
02:29:36,500 --> 02:29:38,500
Chair.

1147
02:29:38,500 --> 02:29:48,000
So let me run something by you and see whether or not I'm considering this in the right light.

1148
02:29:48,000 --> 02:30:17,500
if I'm a classroom teacher and I have a student in my class that is allergic to peanuts or tree nuts or ground nuts or any nuts and I confab with the counselor, the administration or whatever and we decide that we're going to send home a note to parents that says, in this, I thought that was us.

1149
02:30:17,500 --> 02:30:20,500
I'm like, okay, eat the nuts.

1150
02:30:20,500 --> 02:30:27,500
And I send home, it's agreed that I'm going to have a nut-free classroom.

1151
02:30:27,500 --> 02:30:29,500
This happens.

1152
02:30:29,500 --> 02:30:49,500
It's happened in my life that I have been that school counselor that has coordinated the writing and dissemination of the letter that says in this particular classroom, because of the severity of this child's illness or allergy, it's nut-free.

1153
02:30:49,500 --> 02:31:04,500
So now we're in 2022, and we've got a kid who's immunocompromised in a classroom, and it's cold and flu season, or they're a cancer patient and they're undergoing chemo.

1154
02:31:04,500 --> 02:31:06,500
If we put...

1155
02:31:06,500 --> 02:31:31,000
What are we we do are we contemplating putting a law into effect that says that the school does not have the authority in that situation to require masks in that classroom and if so if they can bring they can start litigation and receive just reward or whatever.

1156
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:41,500
Are we going to be doing that for granola bars that have peanuts in it or perfumes that students are allergic?

1157
02:31:41,500 --> 02:31:43,500
Where does this end?

1158
02:31:43,500 --> 02:31:48,500
It would seem to me that this is a philosophy.

1159
02:31:48,500 --> 02:32:05,500
and whether or not you agree that everything should be optional or everything should be mandated, in the end it's going to come down to the individuals in that classroom or in that school.

1160
02:32:05,500 --> 02:32:10,500
How do we not make this into a litiginous situation?

1161
02:32:10,500 --> 02:32:12,500
Go ahead.

1162
02:32:12,500 --> 02:32:19,000
I think we're talking about facial coverings, not nuts, in regard to this.

1163
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:33,500
I don't see where the nut argument comes in, but certainly if there were students who were compromised, the parents can say that they want them to be masked.

1164
02:32:33,500 --> 02:32:43,500
And certainly, we've seen classrooms, when classrooms reopened after being closed, they had spacing between children as a preventative measure.

1165
02:32:43,500 --> 02:33:01,500
Some had plexiglass Partitions I see I see all kinds of options to protecting an immune immunity compromised individual student within that classroom Without the need to mandate that every child in that class be masked.

1166
02:33:01,500 --> 02:33:12,500
The parents in the classroom, other parents could certainly choose to cover their, have their students face covered if they so chose.

1167
02:33:12,500 --> 02:33:22,500
But no, we can't lose sight of the fact also about the educational impact that the mask mandates have had.

1168
02:33:22,500 --> 02:33:32,500
You know, young children with facial recognition, all sorts of studies about the impact of facial masks during this period.

1169
02:33:32,500 --> 02:33:39,500
And the educational impact was really left out of the equation, in my opinion.

1170
02:33:39,500 --> 02:33:46,000
With all due respect, Representative Cordelli, I don't think they're two separate issues.

1171
02:33:46,000 --> 02:34:08,500
I think that if you're requiring a student to wear a mask in a classroom and requiring a student not to bring peanuts in their lunch bag, you're still requiring them to do something that they might otherwise have wanted or not wanted to do.

1172
02:34:08,500 --> 02:34:21,000
And I would caution everybody at thinking about what we're doing and what kind of a can of worms this is going to open up.

1173
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:30,500
I pledge not to offer any legislation prohibiting nut usage in the classroom or mandating nut usage either way.

1174
02:34:30,500 --> 02:34:37,000
I'd like to just read a section out of the Code of Ethics.

1175
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
It's Responsibility to Students.

1176
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
It's ED 510.02.

1177
02:34:41,000 --> 02:35:01,000
In fulfilling responsibilities to students, a credential holder shall maintain a professional relationship with all students, both inside and outside the educational setting, and make reasonable efforts to protect students from conditions which are harmful to their health and safety.

1178
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:25,500
My concerns are that we are starting to get into this code of ethics and changing some of this stuff without working through the department where we have already stated in a letter to them that we would like to have things handled that way through the JLCAR process.

1179
02:35:25,500 --> 02:35:31,000
I totally agree that kids should not have to wear masks.

1180
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:48,000
My grandkids, ages 3 1⁄2 right through the middle school that are living with me, shouted for joy today because today is the first day the West Barnett Village School does not require masks.

1181
02:35:48,000 --> 02:37:09,500
And they're all going and a little three and a half year old you couldn't believe his face you know of course he never wore it properly to begin with it was down around his neck and and so I think that you know for us to you know get into this right now through trying to mandate something in statute may be not the way we've always advocated as a group here certainly I believe it's choice I absolutely do believe it's choice and I think that that's where we should be and however we know now that the mask mandate is being eliminated many schools at this point So, at best, I would suggest that we think about an interim study on this and start looking at how this gels in with our code and how we move forward to deal with situations like this in the future that we've been encountering here for the last two and a half years.

1182
02:37:09,500 --> 02:37:11,500
Yes, Representative Nelson.

1183
02:37:11,500 --> 02:37:13,500
Thank you, Mr.

1184
02:37:13,500 --> 02:37:15,500
Chairman.

1185
02:37:15,500 --> 02:37:18,500
I understand where you're coming from.

1186
02:37:18,500 --> 02:37:34,000
I've also been at the other side where this could easily get blown out of proportion in the sense that how many other things are people going to come up with?

1187
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:55,000
So I agree with the peanuts and I agree with where you're going, but I just think it could get out of hand with people making different demands as time goes on as so many things have happened so thank you mr.

1188
02:37:55,000 --> 02:38:04,500
chair again I look at this bill and I see it do exactly what you were speaking about mr.

1189
02:38:04,500 --> 02:38:21,500
chair as an option bill that this puts the onus on the parents to be responsible for their children if they choose to want to mask their child they tell to wear a mask.

1190
02:38:21,500 --> 02:38:26,000
If they choose not to, they don't have to.

1191
02:38:26,000 --> 02:39:04,500
I think the biggest thing this thing does is about the state, whether the state's going to force people who choose not to want to wear a mask to have to wear a mask, and then all of the implications that went around that, whether it was the shaming that occurred when a kid didn't wear a mask and had it down below and all that aggravation that occurred because we had a mandate versus an option.

1192
02:39:04,500 --> 02:39:21,000
And I think this bill goes a long way towards, again, making it back to the parent's choice to be able to allow a parent to make the medical decision for their child.

1193
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:32,500
If the child is immunocompromised or medically fragile, they can choose to get an N95 mask or a bigger mask and manage that.

1194
02:39:32,500 --> 02:39:43,500
So I guess I look at this bill and I just see that we're putting, again, we're trusting parents with this bill.

1195
02:39:43,500 --> 02:39:53,000
We're saying parents are going to do the right thing, and I think they will when given the chance.

1196
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
Thank you.

1197
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,500
Further discussion on the bill?

1198
02:39:57,500 --> 02:40:03,000
Okay, I'm going to call a caucus on this right now.

1199
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:07,500
And following caucus, we'll just go right into lunch.

1200
02:40:07,500 --> 02:40:11,000
So we won't, we are coming back.

1201
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
After lunch.

1202
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
After lunch.

1203
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
Let's do it.

1204

And following caucus, we'll just go right into lunch.

1205
02:40:21,500 --> 02:40:25,000
So we are coming back after lunch.

1206
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:28,500
Let's just make it at 1 o'clock.

1207

Thank you.

1244
02:41:42,500 --> 02:41:44,500
Thank you.

1245
02:41:44,500 --> 02:41:46,500
Thank you.

1246
02:41:46,500 --> 02:41:48,500
Thank you.

1247
02:41:48,500 --> 02:41:50,500

1249
02:41:52,500 --> 02:41:54,500
Thank you.

1250
02:41:54,500 --> 02:41:56,500
Thank you.

1251
02:41:56,500 --> 02:41:58,500
Thank you.

1252
02:41:58,500 --> 02:42:00,500
Thank you.

1253
02:42:00,500 --> 02:42:02,500
Thank you.

1254
02:42:02,500 --> 02:42:04,500
Thank you.

1255
02:42:04,500 --> 02:42:06,500
Thank you.

1256
02:42:06,500 --> 02:42:08,500
Thank you.

1257
02:42:08,500 --> 02:42:10,500
Thank you.

1258
02:42:10,500 --> 02:42:12,500
Thank you.

1259
02:42:12,500 --> 02:42:14,500
Thank you.

1260
02:42:14,500 --> 02:42:16,500
Thank you.

1261
02:42:16,500 --> 02:42:18,500
Thank you.

1262
02:42:18,500 --> 02:42:20,500
Thank you.

1263
02:42:20,500 --> 02:42:22,500
Thank you.

1264
02:42:22,500 --> 02:42:26,500
We, of course, we left for a caucus.

1265
02:42:26,500 --> 02:42:36,500
We're going to recess any further action on the bill we were talking about, 1131, until later on this afternoon.

1266
02:42:36,500 --> 02:42:48,500
And with that, I'd like to jump on to the next bill I'm going to take up, and that's going to be HB 1261.

1267
02:42:48,500 --> 02:42:55,500
That's prohibiting the use of Native American mascots in public schools, colleges, and universities.

1268
02:42:55,500 --> 02:43:00,500
And I'd like to recognize Representative Boone for a motion.

1269
02:43:00,500 --> 02:43:02,500
Thank you, Mr.

1270
02:43:02,500 --> 02:43:04,500
Speaker, for 1261.

1271
02:43:04,500 --> 02:43:06,500
Mr.

1272
02:43:06,500 --> 02:43:08,500
what?

1273
02:43:08,500 --> 02:43:11,500
Don't upgrade me to anything, please.

1274
02:43:11,500 --> 02:43:13,500
I'm thinking ahead, Mr.

1275
02:43:13,500 --> 02:43:15,500
Chairman.

1276
02:43:15,500 --> 02:43:17,500
Thank you.

1277
02:43:17,500 --> 02:43:21,000
I'd like to recommend 1261 to ITL.

1278
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
Is there a second?

1279
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
I'll second.

1280
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
Thank you.

1281
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:44,000
So we have a motion made by Representative Boehm and seconded second by represent hobson itl is that motion prohibiting the use of native american mascots in public schools colleges and universities that's 1261.

1282
02:43:44,000 --> 02:44:02,500
you're recognized for for the discussion represent bohm thank you the reason i'm saying itl because one, this is a local school issue, and I find that using Native American Indian symbiology or whatever is inherently disrespectful.

1283
02:44:02,500 --> 02:44:04,500
That is not true.

1284
02:44:04,500 --> 02:44:12,500
To the contrary, such symbology was intended to honor various qualities and attributes of Native Americans.

1285
02:44:12,500 --> 02:44:21,500
Indeed, many polls show significant importance among Native Americans for continued association with sports teams and educational institutions.

1286
02:44:21,500 --> 02:44:27,500
One of the issues is, what about, why just North American names?

1287
02:44:27,500 --> 02:44:29,500
What about other groups?

1288
02:44:29,500 --> 02:44:35,000
For example, I found out some years ago I'm 25% Scandinavian.

1289
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:41,000
I don't like Minnesota Vikings because of the bad thing about Vikings.

1290
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:48,500
The same way, what about the Boston Celtics that have a mascot of a leprechaun?

1291
02:44:48,500 --> 02:44:53,000
To Celts around the world, that's totally not right.

1292
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:57,000
I mean, so the thing is Thank you.

1293
02:44:57,000 --> 02:45:01,500
to Celts around the world, that's totally not right.

1294
02:45:01,500 --> 02:45:07,000
I mean, so the thing is, yeah, this is local control.

1295
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:17,000
If they want to do it, and if, for example, like the Florida State Seminoles, that's licensed by the Seminoles.

1296
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:21,500
So I think the same thing can happen here.

1297
02:45:21,500 --> 02:46:45,000
If any North American group wants wants their name they can ask for it or not ask for it in other words so it's a local control issue and the word warrior for example is not any group can be warriors so there's some problems with the designations thank you is there further discussion from the maker the second further discussion from the committee represent luno thank you very much mr chair so um so we're taking the uh the boil the ocean argument when it comes to the itl that uh that we cannot um in fact support the wishes of Native Americans who, among the eight people that came, or nine people that came to speak to the committee, all in favor, none opposed to this bill, including two people from the Grand Council of the Pentecook-Abenaki people who spoke very eloquently as to what this and how use of Native American mascots in public schools, colleges, and universities really doesn't honor them at all.

1298
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:49,000
In fact, they feel completely different about it.

1299
02:46:49,000 --> 02:47:07,000
So it's interesting that we're choosing to ignore how Native Americans, or at least two that are representing the Pinnacook Abenaki, feel when it comes to public institutions that use their likeness and names as mascots.

1300
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:22,500
You know, it's just I certainly understand the point that Representative Boehm makes when it comes to other mascots that might be used, whether in intercollegiate or interscholastic or professional sports.

1301
02:47:22,500 --> 02:47:28,000
And perhaps those can be taken up at a later time.

1302
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:50,500
but when it comes to Native Americans, I think there's a lot we can do, and there's a lot that's being done, certainly in the professional sports world, to move away from taking advantage and disparaging them, certainly not honoring them by using those mascots.

1303
02:47:50,500 --> 02:48:31,500
So it's just, it's incredible that somehow this committee feels that while maybe the Boston Celtics are taking advantage of some group and the Minnesotanesota minnesota vikings are taking advantage of scandinavians that we can't stop that so we can't stop this but we can stop this because we've got a bill in front of us right now that that does it so i hope we can defeat the itl and um and look favorably upon this bill further discussion any handsackus.

1304
02:48:31,500 --> 02:49:13,500
I just wonder how much this is the objection of a few as opposed to the objection of the many, because I know there were a few in Cleveland who thought it was unreasonable to have the Cleveland Indians as the baseball team, and I know that after that got changed, many of the local Native Americans, of which I am a descendant, from that area, objected strongly to having the Cleveland Indians no longer the Cleveland Indians, because they were proud of that.

1305
02:49:13,500 --> 02:49:24,000
So I just want, you know, we heard from a few, and I'm just wondering how much is a few complaining.

1306
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:33,000
And so I find it hard to pass a law based on a few, but I don't know.

1307
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
Further discussion?

1308
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
Representative Olson?

1309
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:42,000
I didn't know who had their hand up over there.

1310
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
Representative Olson?

1311
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,500
Thank you very much, Mr.

1312
02:49:46,500 --> 02:49:48,500
Chair.

1313
02:49:48,500 --> 02:49:55,000
We pass laws all the time based on representation of just a few.

1314
02:49:55,000 --> 02:50:13,000
For instance, the education freedom accounts that were in House Bill 20 and eventually made its way into House Bill 2 with virtually no public support or certainly very little public support over tremendous public opposition.

1315
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:20,000
So apparently we do this all the time, but only when we want to.

1316
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
Further discussion?

1317
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
Not seeing any.

1318
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000

Representative Black.

1348
02:51:25,500 --> 02:51:27,500
Yes.

10 to 9.

1350
02:51:29,500 --> 02:51:31,500
Okay.

1351
02:51:31,500 --> 02:51:33,500
Okay.

1352

Okay, you can do that.

1353
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,000
Okay.

1354
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
Okay.

1355
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
Okay.

1356
02:51:42,000 --> 02:52:03,000

Representative Boehm, you made the motion.

1363
02:52:34,500 --> 02:52:37,000
Are you open to discussion?

1364
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:47,000
Yes, I also have an amendment to the bill which fixes a grammatical error that was in the original bill.

1365
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,500
The amendment is 0189 H.

1366
02:52:49,500 --> 02:52:52,500
What was that number again please?

1367
02:52:52,500 --> 02:52:54,500
0189 H.

1368
02:52:54,500 --> 02:52:56,500
the original bill...

1369
02:52:56,500 --> 02:52:59,000
Do we all have that?

1370
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:02,000
I passed it out this morning.

1371
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000
Yeah.

1372
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:07,500
Because I had it for a month.

1373
02:53:07,500 --> 02:53:09,500
Go ahead, Representative Bo.

1374
02:53:09,500 --> 02:53:11,500
Okay, thank you.

1375
02:53:11,500 --> 02:53:13,500
Go ahead, Representative Bohm.

1376
02:53:13,500 --> 02:53:15,500
Thank you.

1377
02:53:15,500 --> 02:53:25,000
The amendment just fixes on line 12, the original bill that said that allow requires, and that was fixed.

1378
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:32,000
Sort of a grammatical error, I guess, when they did a cut and paste.

1379
02:53:32,000 --> 02:54:07,000
So that's the only thing the amendment does is fixes that but just just on the while the amendment just fixes that but on the whole thing is I guess we need to vote on the amendment first well you have to introduce the amendment I introduced it there was a second would you do it again please I like to make a motion on the amendment 0189H to 1639.

1380
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
Is there a second?

1381
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
Thank you.

1382
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
Representative Hobson second.

1383
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:16,000
Representative Bohm's motion for amendment 0189H.

1384
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:24,000
The amendment, like I said, fixes a grammatical error on line 12 in the original bill.

1385
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:31,500
Okay, that was on line 12 where it read provision that allow requires a parent.

1386
02:54:31,500 --> 02:54:33,500
Right, yeah.

1387
02:54:33,500 --> 02:54:37,000
Didn't make a whole lot of sense.

1388
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
Right.

1389
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
Okay.

1390
02:54:41,000 --> 02:55:00,500
Now you have that requires a okay further discussion on the amendment go ahead yeah um i can't support anything about this bill typo or not so i'm certainly not going to be supporting the amendment thank you further.

1391

Further discussion?

1392
02:55:02,500 --> 02:55:04,500

1393
02:55:04,500 --> 02:55:06,500

1394
02:55:06,500 --> 02:55:11,000
Clerk, would you please call the roll on the...

1395
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:17,500
Well, we can do that in a show of hands with the amendment.

1396
02:55:17,500 --> 02:55:19,500
It's amendment 0189H.

1397
02:55:19,500 --> 02:55:21,500
Ought to pass.

1398
02:55:21,500 --> 02:55:23,500
Okay.

1399
02:55:23,500 --> 02:55:26,500
You're going to show a hand.

1400
02:55:26,500 --> 02:55:29,000
Is that what you said?

1401
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
Yeah.

1402
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
What we're doing.

1403
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:35,000
Okay.

1404
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,000
Those opposed?

1405
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
Okay.

1406
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
10-9.

1407
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
Okay.

1408
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:47,500
Now we have the bill in front of us.

1409
02:55:47,500 --> 02:55:51,500
Will you make a motion, please, Representative Bohm?

1410
02:55:51,500 --> 02:55:53,500
Make a motion.

1411
02:55:53,500 --> 02:55:56,000
Author passed with the amendment.

1412
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:58,000
Okay.

1413
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:00,000
Second.

1414
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:02,000
Yep.

1415
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:28,500
of us would you make a motion please represent bone make a mention off the pass with amendment okay yep further discussion yeah those members bill is on the youth risk behavior survey which we found from different testimony and and I don't even know the person that pretty much dittoed my presentation.

1416
02:56:28,500 --> 02:56:34,500
Most school kids, especially in high school, don't take these things seriously.

1417
02:56:34,500 --> 02:56:37,000
It's taken as a joke.

1418
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:48,500
And I remember when we did it in our school, I mean, the kids were taking it as pretty much as a joke.

1419
02:56:48,500 --> 02:57:18,000
And it's not an anonymous survey because you had to do the first six, seven questions, and pretty much in any school you can determine who the person is, except for what we heard in testimony, people just lying about even, about who they are, what race they are, how much they weigh, what sex they are, and everything.

1420
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:31,000
So the thing is, if that's all taken as a joke, including what if a student was taking drugs, will they say that on that survey?

1421
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
I don't think so.

1422
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:37,000
So they're not going to say anything illegal.

1423
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:50,500
When it happened in our school some years ago, I heard from my spies in the school, some students and whatnot, that this was all a joke.

1424
02:57:50,500 --> 02:58:10,500
Then when our principal came in with the disastrous surveys, I mean, and I told him and the school board that, and backed up by the student representative of the school board that the students took us as a joke.

1425
02:58:10,500 --> 02:58:18,500
So the thing is, DHHS saying we need this information for all these studies and whatnot.

1426
02:58:18,500 --> 02:58:24,500
What good is a study when people are lying about their identity?

1427
02:58:24,500 --> 02:58:26,500
They're lying about drugs.

1428
02:58:26,500 --> 02:58:31,500
They're just answering the questions as if, hey, it's funny.

1429
02:58:31,500 --> 02:58:34,500
It's a fun thing they do.

1430
02:58:34,500 --> 02:58:37,000
They do it on Facebook.

1431
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:41,000
How are we going to answer these questions?

1432
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:43,000
Thank you.

1433
02:58:43,000 --> 02:59:20,000
about drugs to just answering the questions as if hey it's funny it's a fun thing they do they do it on Facebook how are we going to answer these questions so if this bill is it's a waste of time and I think it needs to be opt-in just like every other survey so let the parents know and and look at the survey before they allow their kids to take the survey.

1434
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:22,000
Thank you.

1435
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:24,000
Representative Mullen.

1436
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:26,000
Thank you, Mr.

1437
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:28,000
Chair.

1438
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:35,000
So New Hampshire has been administering the Youth Behavior Risk Survey for 29 years.

1439
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:41,500
And during the hearing, we heard from the National Institute of Mental Illness.

1440
02:59:41,500 --> 02:59:44,000
We heard from New Futures.

1441
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:48,000
We heard from the Department of Public Health.

1442
02:59:48,000 --> 03:00:03,500
In the interim, we have heard from the Raymond Coalition of Youth, from the drug coordinator of the anti-drug program in Dover, and the police chief out of Franklin, New Hampshire.

1443
03:00:03,500 --> 03:00:10,000
And all of those people spoke impassionedly about the importance of this survey.

1444
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:54,000
When you conduct a survey of this nature, and I speak with some authority because I've administered it and I spent I spent 27 professional years using the results there are two metrics that are involved in a survey like this one is referred to as validity the other is referred to as reliability and there what that translates into is that the creators of a measure like this build into the measure certain patterns of answers that rule a test in or out as valid and reliable.

1445
03:00:54,000 --> 03:01:18,500
So if somebody were to draw pictures with their penciled-in answer on the test or on the survey, or if they were to answer questions in a manner that came across as particularly skewed, the results of that test or survey would not be included in the aggregate scores.

1446
03:01:18,500 --> 03:01:28,500
We have heard over and over and over again, in Bedford, New Hampshire, we have an organization called Be Bold.

1447
03:01:28,500 --> 03:01:38,000
And the goal of that organization is drug and alcohol awareness and prevention and assisting youth in healthy lifestyles.

1448
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:56,000
It is a group of very active parents and professionals who have spoken to me at length about making sure that this remains a carve-out and that we continue to administer the youth behavior risk survey.

1449
03:01:56,000 --> 03:02:05,500
We plan parent nights, we plan programs in the schools, we disseminate information, we participate in Red Ribbon Week.

1450
03:02:05,500 --> 03:02:18,000
A lot of what we offer to parents and students is based upon the results, which are in fact posted on the school district website.

1451
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:25,000
A lot of the programming depends upon the results that come out of this.

1452
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:35,000
And if you read, I understand that we received like 1,000 emails last week, not about this, but in general.

1453
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:43,500
So you may not have actually seen the information that came in from Dover and from Raymond.

1454
03:02:43,500 --> 03:02:58,500
I wish you would have the opportunity before we had to vote on this to read it and to see the community impact that this survey has in developing programs.

1455
03:02:58,500 --> 03:03:17,500
with regards to the opt-in and opt-out parents already have a choice they already all they have to do is notify the school and tell them that they don't want their student to participate, and they don't participate.

1456
03:03:17,500 --> 03:03:22,500
So it's not that this is being forced on anyone.

1457
03:03:22,500 --> 03:03:34,500
And I've heard the argument over and over again about if they can return a field trip permission slip, then they can return this.

1458
03:03:34,500 --> 03:03:39,000
Well, the reality is, you know how children are.

1459
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:44,000
You wouldn't be sitting on this committee if you didn't.

1460
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:52,000
Children will respond to a preferred activity in a way that is quite different than others.

1461
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:54,000
So it's not equitable.

1462
03:03:54,000 --> 03:04:01,500
There is an out for any family that does not want to participate in this.

1463
03:04:01,500 --> 03:04:08,500
But adding this layer of bureaucracy, jeopardizing the number of responses that come back.

1464
03:04:08,500 --> 03:04:26,500
We heard from the people who testified in front of us that if a certain percentage of the student body does not participate, then the results are invalid, and funding is challenged, and programs go away.

1465
03:04:26,500 --> 03:04:34,500
1993 was the first year that the Youth Risk Behavior Survey was given in New Hampshire.

1466
03:04:34,500 --> 03:04:39,000
Why are we trying to take it away now?

1467
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:41,000
Thank you.

1468
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:43,000
Further discussion, Representative Likas?

1469
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:47,000
I have just a few things to say.

1470
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:52,500
One is that I was always taught garbage in, garbage out.

1471
03:04:52,500 --> 03:05:13,000
And if you're basing your results and what you're going to do on something that, and I have heard from not just our wonderful representative over here, but from various other kids and whatever, that they do not answer that accurately.

1472
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:20,500
So if you're basing your things on inaccurate ends, you're going to get inaccurate outs.

1473
03:05:20,500 --> 03:05:26,000
Number two, there's lots of good things that are going on.

1474
03:05:26,000 --> 03:05:30,500
Why do we need a survey to do them?

1475
03:05:30,500 --> 03:05:33,500
Why don't we just do them?

1476
03:05:33,500 --> 03:05:38,500
We know there's some of these issues in the schools.

1477
03:05:38,500 --> 03:05:43,500
Why don't we just do the programs that they're doing?

1478
03:05:43,500 --> 03:05:50,000
Why do we need a survey to be able to do the programs?

1479
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:59,000
But the third one is, well, it's already on there, and the parents just have to opt out.

1480
03:05:59,000 --> 03:06:01,000
Here's the problem.

1481
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:12,500
I remember when my granddaughter, who was living with us when she was in high school, and took this, and she came home.

1482
03:06:12,500 --> 03:06:30,500
She was very upset because of the personal questions that were being asked, and she was not the kind of person who even wants to talk about those things and to have to answer this survey.

1483
03:06:30,500 --> 03:06:34,500
I was on the school website every day.

1484
03:06:34,500 --> 03:06:44,500
I was talking to her teachers every day, making sure her homework was done, making sure how she was doing.

1485
03:06:44,500 --> 03:07:00,500
I never saw an announcement that said that this was coming up because I would have opted her out of it because I knew what her feelings were about something like this.

1486
03:07:00,500 --> 03:07:37,500
And so somewhere on that website it probably existed, but I was on there every day talking to teachers looking at her results they have a great website never saw it didn't know until she came home very upset so and I've heard this from other you heard parents who came in and talked about kids who came and said kids who were young who home and said, Mom, should I be having sex?

1487
03:07:37,500 --> 03:07:40,500
Because it was on the survey.

1488
03:07:40,500 --> 03:07:45,500
I mean, a lot of parents were upset about this.

1489
03:07:45,500 --> 03:07:55,500
That's why it got changed a long time ago to parent opt-in, not parent opt-out, because parents were very upset.

1490
03:07:55,500 --> 03:07:59,500
And so it got changed back to opt-out.

1491
03:07:59,500 --> 03:08:06,000
At any rate, we really, I think, that's what I have to say.

1492
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:08,000
Thank you.

1493
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:10,000
Representative Tanner.

1494
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:12,000
Thank you.

1495
03:08:12,000 --> 03:08:18,000
I guess I had written down the points that Representative Lekas made.

1496
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:24,500
I think Representative Mullen made a great point about how surveys are done.

1497
03:08:24,500 --> 03:08:36,500
This is a survey that's done by very professional people, and they certainly know how to make the validity and reliability of the responses.

1498
03:08:36,500 --> 03:08:46,000
So I think the whole thing about garbage in, garbage out is really garbage in, garbage out as well.

1499
03:08:46,000 --> 03:09:13,500
I think the other thing is that as a health teacher um you know you just and and the kids as well i think you hear rumors all the time and parents hear rumors all the time and and you know one or two people can be talking about something just like our Indian mascot.

1500
03:09:13,500 --> 03:09:21,500
And do you refer that what you take in as a personal rumor or an antidote?

1501
03:09:21,500 --> 03:09:26,000
Or do you take that as applicable to everybody?

1502
03:09:26,000 --> 03:09:42,000
Or is it better to have a survey that's done professionally that allows results that then give you a picture of the whole rather than just of the few kids that come?

1503
03:09:42,000 --> 03:09:44,000
Thank you.

1504
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:54,500
that allows results that then give you a picture of the whole rather than just of the few kids that come.

1505
03:09:54,500 --> 03:10:07,500
And I guess my third part of it, because I did teach health, and there was a section on sex education, and it was ninth graders.

1506
03:10:07,500 --> 03:10:13,000
And some ninth graders are ready for it and some aren't.

1507
03:10:13,000 --> 03:10:55,500
Some ninth grade parents are ready for it, and some ninth grade parents are ready for it and some ninth grade parents are not and um they had an opt out for it they could come and see the curriculum they they um parents could could do that and some of them did and and had their own uh discussion and whatever but you know one of the things about kids going through school is that they have a point where discussions need to happen.

1508
03:10:55,500 --> 03:11:07,000
And sometimes it's unfortunate that the parents get kind of put in the position that they have to discuss maybe before they're ready.

1509
03:11:07,000 --> 03:11:22,000
But I don't think that's necessarily any more from this risk survey than it is from what they hear in the hall, hear on the bus, hear from their friends.

1510
03:11:22,000 --> 03:11:27,500
I think that's where a lot of the misinformation comes from.

1511
03:11:27,500 --> 03:11:42,500
And so this survey is very important if you're any kind of health or wellness field to get a real, you know, picture from 100 feet up rather than anecdotally.

1512
03:11:42,500 --> 03:11:57,000
And I think we're doing a very big disservice to put more restrictions on it that's going to effectively make it less valid and less reliable and less accessible.

1513
03:11:57,000 --> 03:11:59,000
So that's my bit.

1514
03:11:59,000 --> 03:12:01,000
Thank you very much.

1515
03:12:01,000 --> 03:12:03,000
Representative Nelson.

1516
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:05,000
Thank you, Mr.

1517
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:07,000
Chairman.

1518
03:12:07,000 --> 03:12:14,500
From my experiences, these are rigged, fake results when you ask one of those surveys.

1519
03:12:14,500 --> 03:12:27,000
So I'm assuming if it had something to do with masks and they all decided to do one thing or another, you would accept it.

1520
03:12:27,000 --> 03:13:11,000
In other if the school the kids all in the school voted no mask whatsoever and you know some wanted it because they wanted to be popular would you think that would be a good idea in other words false information one of the people asked one of the entities asking us to continue continue this as an opt-out is our own New Hampshire Health and Human Services Department, and they stated how useful they found it is, and I don't think they would go by false information.

1521
03:13:11,000 --> 03:13:28,000
It is one of our own state departments, and I don't think they make things up when saying that they liked it and found it useful and didn't want it to be an opt-in.

1522
03:13:28,000 --> 03:13:35,500
And to get into the opt-in, I too worked in a school for many years.

1523
03:13:35,500 --> 03:14:05,500
And when you talk about kids remember bringing things in for field trips, I remember making phone calls to parents on the morning of a field trip because their kids were crying because they weren't going to be able to go, asking them to please bring in the permission slip so that the kid could go on the field trip.

1524
03:14:05,500 --> 03:14:12,000
So they don't remember to bring things home to show them either way.

1525
03:14:12,000 --> 03:14:18,500
So it's not that they remember when it's something they want to do.

1526
03:14:18,500 --> 03:14:26,500
It happens, it depends on the kid if they remember to bring it in or not.

1527
03:14:26,500 --> 03:14:41,000
But I don't think we can say that it's not useful information when so many respected New Hampshire Health and Human Services, NAMI, think they can really use this.

1528
03:14:41,000 --> 03:14:43,000
Thank you.

1529
03:14:43,000 --> 03:14:45,000
Further discussion?

1530
03:14:45,000 --> 03:14:47,000
Representative Luno?

1531
03:14:47,000 --> 03:14:49,000
Thanks very much.

1532
03:14:49,000 --> 03:15:23,000
And actually, I'd seen Representative Mullen's hand go up after the last question, too, and I think I want to take that up because unlike the scenario that Representative Nelson says with a single question, the YRBS is a number of questions, and the survey is designed by professionals in order to be able to protect the validity and reliability of the data, and that can be determined.

1533
03:15:23,000 --> 03:15:44,500
I'm sure it is some sort of statistical analysis that goes into looking at not only how each question is answered in order to determine the validity of each one of those responses and therefore maximize the reliability of the data that's collected.

1534
03:15:44,500 --> 03:15:52,500
We heard specifically from Chief Goldstein and his quote is that the YRBS produces legitimate results.

1535
03:15:52,500 --> 03:16:08,000
And I suspect due to the chief's education in this area, he has a strong understanding of both those survey design parameters to protect validity and ensure reliability of the data.

1536
03:16:08,000 --> 03:16:22,000
Representative Mullen also listed out several groups, New Futures, NAMI, DHHS for Public Health, the Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, all speaking in opposition to this bill.

1537
03:16:22,000 --> 03:16:36,500
the Department of Health and Human Services further goes on, and I am paraphrasing because it's in the second-to-last paragraph of the letter that Director Tilly provided the committee.

1538
03:16:36,500 --> 03:16:57,000
And basically it goes on to say that a district that does not have YRBS data may not be able to apply for grants that could support students and districts with identified needs related to behavioral health or substance use disorders.

1539
03:16:57,000 --> 03:17:30,000
And really important for, I would dare say, all communities across the state of New Hampshire, but I think there's certain communities that do run into very acute conditions of behavioral health and substance use and disorder that would, because of this, because of a bill like this, may be denied the ability to apply for grants and run programs to protect kids and their families.

1540
03:17:30,000 --> 03:17:44,500
So, you know, I understand that some people may have, you know, anecdotal information coming from spies that among, you know, kids in school that don't take it seriously.

1541
03:17:44,500 --> 03:18:15,500
In fact the the the survey the analysis process for the survey would would would show the lack of validity and in some of those survey completions and and still the results would would be reliable useful for those communities and incredibly useful useful as far as applying for grants to run the programs that help these kids and help their families.

1542
03:18:15,500 --> 03:18:37,000
So I hope we can overturn the ought to pass and go with the straight opposition that we heard from so many qualified and credible organizations, government organizations as well as non-government organizations across the state and how important this survey data is.

1543
03:18:37,000 --> 03:18:39,000
Thank you.

1544
03:18:39,000 --> 03:18:41,000
Thank you.

1545
03:18:41,000 --> 03:18:43,000
Further discussion.

1546
03:18:43,000 --> 03:18:53,500
I'm also going to try to remind everybody that we're going to try to get through some of these bills today.

1547
03:18:53,500 --> 03:18:58,500
So let's try to hustle a little bit, Representative Ling.

1548
03:18:58,500 --> 03:19:00,500
Thank you, sir.

1549
03:19:00,500 --> 03:19:02,500
Thank you, Mr.

1550
03:19:02,500 --> 03:19:04,500
Chairman.

1551
03:19:04,500 --> 03:19:14,000
I'm looking at this bill, and I guess I go back to, you know, I'm a technologist by trade.

1552
03:19:14,000 --> 03:19:32,000
The default privacy for a technologist is you ask to collect data, not just take the data first, and then say, oh, if you don't want me to do it, I'll erase it from my system.

1553
03:19:32,000 --> 03:19:37,000
So you always ask first before you collect the data.

1554
03:19:37,000 --> 03:19:47,500
And this also goes in line with, remember back in 2018, we passed our right to privacy law, a constitutional amendment.

1555
03:19:47,500 --> 03:20:06,000
Over 80% of New Hampshire citizens said, and I'll quote the statute, agreed with a statement that says, an individual's right to live free from governmental intrusion and private and personal information is natural, essential, and inherent.

1556
03:20:06,000 --> 03:20:34,000
So when I look at this and the idea of asking parents, especially how personal these questions are, as I just went through and read the 2021 survey, how personal some of these questions are asking about drug use and sex and whether you've tried alcohol, whether it's alcohol, guns in your home kind of questions.

1557
03:20:34,000 --> 03:20:39,000
Those kind of things are extremely personal and extremely private.

1558
03:20:39,000 --> 03:20:58,000
And to protect our citizens and go in alignment with our constitutional provision, 85% said they don't want the government to collect this data unless we give them a chance to say, yes, you can have my data.

1559
03:20:58,000 --> 03:22:20,000
So I look at this strictly, besides whether you believe any of the data is accurate or not accurate the first provision is no matter what your need is for the data you have to first get permission for it and that's why I'll be voting to support yes represent Porter they do get permission first parents can opt out if parents opt out that's saying they don't want this information given if parents don't opt out it means it's fine with them to have the information given so I think that's a permission that's what opt out and I'll tell you based on the constitutional amendment that was passed in that data we just just over in HHS is passing an opt-in for the registry, is that because of the changes in our constitution and the law, and again, changes in data as technologists, that the fact is that now the privacy standard is you ask for data before you take the data.

1560
03:22:20,000 --> 03:22:22,000
That's the technology standard.

1561
03:22:22,000 --> 03:22:24,000
Further discussion?

1562
03:22:24,000 --> 03:22:26,000
Not seeing any.

1563
03:22:26,000 --> 03:22:28,000
Mr.

1564
03:22:28,000 --> 03:22:30,000
Clerk's the technology standard.

1565
03:22:30,000 --> 03:22:32,000
Further discussion?

1566
03:22:32,000 --> 03:22:34,000
Not seeing any.

1567
03:22:34,000 --> 03:22:36,000
Mr.

1568
03:22:36,000 --> 03:22:39,500
Clerk, would you please call the rule?

1638
03:25:25,000 --> 03:26:44,000
The amendment keeps items one and two, and this is amend the bill by replacing all after section two with the following okay so after section two section three is a new one and add some new language a move this and previously notified the resident district superintendent as part of it I mean the thing is yeah it strikes out the and so in addition to okay for that part of it and then the rest of it it's all new language best we say in the portfolio at all times remains the property of the parent okay with the child the sec line 22 adds in and or disability the parent the child shall be deemed to have successfully completed an annual evaluation upon meeting requirements of any of the following and what's removed on line 28 where it says complete results at or above the 40th percentile such days shall be deemed reasonable academic proficiency.

1639
03:26:44,000 --> 03:27:00,000
The issue there is in public schools, we don't make any difference between what a child passes on the annual evaluation or if a school, entire school is below the 40th percentile.

1640
03:27:00,000 --> 03:27:02,000
Nothing happens to them.

1641
03:27:02,000 --> 03:27:05,500
So the same thing for homeschool students.

1642
03:27:05,500 --> 03:27:09,000
Why did they be treated any differently?

1643
03:27:09,000 --> 03:28:04,500
Also, the child on line 30 or 31 removes that composite results out of both the 40th percent I should be deemed reasonable the same thing I had said before it's it's not it's it's the same pretty much the same as public school students okay and then authority of school district officials no superintendent school board and and adds ends with and the predictions of this chapter period and any rules pursuant RSA 193 83 so it includes the whole 193 and home education and so everything else is pretty much what's in 193 now so those were the changes Okay, is there further discussion on this from the committee?

1644
03:28:04,500 --> 03:28:06,500
Any questions?

1645
03:28:06,500 --> 03:28:08,500
Okay, Representative Tanner?

1646
03:28:08,500 --> 03:28:10,500
Yes.

1647
03:28:10,500 --> 03:28:24,000
is the intent of this, like when you took out in addition, that only the Commissioner of Education possibly could be receiving these portfolios or test results?

1648
03:28:24,000 --> 03:28:28,500
Is that what your intent is in line five?

1649
03:28:28,500 --> 03:28:30,500
Thank you.

1650
03:28:30,500 --> 03:28:36,000
or the non-public school principal within 15 days of said termination.

1651
03:28:36,000 --> 03:28:40,500
That's just, I'm not going to do it anymore.

1652
03:28:40,500 --> 03:28:57,500
So you can file the commission with the commissioner, the student, the district superintendent, or a non-public school, which is pretty much, and now I think the and in addition was just messed up.

1653
03:28:57,500 --> 03:28:59,500
Yeah.

1654
03:28:59,500 --> 03:29:02,000
So you can file with.

1655
03:29:02,000 --> 03:29:17,500
I understood it as the and in addition was that they filed it with the commissioner and in addition they could do the resident district superintendent or the non-public school principal.

1656
03:29:17,500 --> 03:29:30,500
I think, I mean, initially, the and in addition, no, it should be basically it's either, I mean, any of the above, whatever you filed initially.

1657
03:29:30,500 --> 03:29:57,500
Because right now when you file file you don't have to file with your school you can file with the commissioner or if you're going to or a principal in a non-public school and not in addition to you just doing it just repealing what you had done before when you filed represent cordiallyelli.

1658
03:29:57,500 --> 03:29:59,500
Thank you.

1659
03:29:59,500 --> 03:30:02,500
Maybe a question for Representative Boehm.

1660
03:30:02,500 --> 03:30:09,500
So this is making the termination notification consistent with the notification to home school.

1661
03:30:09,500 --> 03:30:11,500
Right.

1662
03:30:11,500 --> 03:30:13,500
Definitely.

1663
03:30:13,500 --> 03:30:15,500
Further discussion?

1664
03:30:15,500 --> 03:30:17,500
Yes.

1665
03:30:17,500 --> 03:30:19,500
Thank you, Mr.

1666
03:30:19,500 --> 03:30:22,000
Chair, for taking my questions.

1667
03:30:22,000 --> 03:30:28,500
So the question I have is with reference to lines 18 and 19.

1668
03:30:28,500 --> 03:30:36,500
What happens if a student comes in and out of the homeschool and public school spheres?

1669
03:30:36,500 --> 03:30:55,000
Does this potentially mean that a body of evidence may not exist if they're homeschooled for two years and maybe then back in the public school sphere for three years and then potentially would come back out?

1670
03:30:55,000 --> 03:30:59,500
What happens to that body of evidence and work?

1671
03:30:59,500 --> 03:31:02,000
It's up to the parent.

1672
03:31:02,000 --> 03:31:19,000
If the parent is going to do that, then they have to prove that the child has taken the prerequisites, for example, in those schools, or the school does not have to allow it.

1673
03:31:19,000 --> 03:31:43,000
I mean, the prerequisite there, and so if the home school is going to do that, allow the students, which they can, go to a public school for one class, they have to prove that they met the prerequisite, say, for that chemistry class or that calculus class.

1674
03:31:43,000 --> 03:31:50,500
So it just leaves it up to the parent as to what information they keep.

1675
03:31:50,500 --> 03:31:52,500
Further discussion?

1676
03:31:52,500 --> 03:31:54,500
Yes, Representative Lekas.

1677
03:31:54,500 --> 03:32:37,500
Well, I would think that information that was three years old, a portfolio that was three years old wouldn't be that particularly important anyways I mean as a parent I kept all of mine and all the parents that I know have all the portfolios kept but if you're if you're talking about evaluation and something a three-year-old portfolio you want to see this year's portfolio anyways so whether or not they kept a three-year-old portfolio shouldn't make a whole lot of difference should it Rep.

1678
03:32:37,500 --> 03:33:07,500
Santa Porter yes but you could say the same thing for the grades that the kid earned in third grade you know when they're in sixth grade do they really matter well yeah they're part of the kid's record so there's evidence that learning and was continuing over the period of time further discussion yes represent mullen thank you mr.

1679
03:33:07,500 --> 03:33:16,500
chair on the second page of the amendment line 9 begins 7, the repeal of home education rulemaking.

1680
03:33:16,500 --> 03:33:26,500
Am I correct that this would remove the State Board of Education from any of the rulemaking for homeschooled students?

1681
03:33:26,500 --> 03:33:28,500
Correct.

1682
03:33:28,500 --> 03:33:32,500
And additional rules will expire when they expire.

1683
03:33:32,500 --> 03:33:40,500
So my follow-up, I guess, to you, Representative Boehm, is who's going to make the rules?

1684
03:33:40,500 --> 03:33:42,500
Nobody.

1685
03:33:42,500 --> 03:33:45,000
The law is the law.

1686
03:33:45,000 --> 03:33:49,000
We don't need rules based on the law.

1687
03:33:49,000 --> 03:34:05,000
For example, and this was in the original law, which was done in 2011 and passed in 2012, where the only school districts and whatnot can only pass laws based on 193.

1688
03:34:05,000 --> 03:34:29,000
So the problem is the rules which, when I first did this back Back in 2011, I chaired a subcommittee to come up with rules and the 193 initially I had it as the rules came from the Home Education Advisory Council, not from the Board of Ed.

1689
03:34:29,000 --> 03:34:32,000
The Senate took that part out.

1690
03:34:32,000 --> 03:34:40,500
But the thing is, there are very few rules now, and there doesn't need to be any.

1691
03:34:40,500 --> 03:34:42,500
It's the parent's responsibility.

1692
03:34:42,500 --> 03:34:49,000
And if they want to go back and forth to the public schools...

1693
03:34:49,000 --> 03:34:56,500
The thing is, there's very few rules now, and there doesn't need to be any.

1694
03:34:56,500 --> 03:34:58,500
It's the parent's responsibility.

1695
03:34:58,500 --> 03:35:09,000
And if they want to go back and forth to the public school, they've got to prove to the public school.

1696
03:35:09,000 --> 03:35:12,500
I mean, there shouldn't be any rules.

1697
03:35:12,500 --> 03:35:14,500
Thank you.

1698
03:35:14,500 --> 03:35:16,500
Representative Cordelli.

1699
03:35:16,500 --> 03:35:18,500
Thank you.

1700
03:35:18,500 --> 03:35:31,500
there have been an issue with rules in the past in that rules were put in place that went way beyond what is in the statutes.

1701
03:35:31,500 --> 03:35:36,000
And rules made it more restrictive on homeschool parents.

1702
03:35:36,000 --> 03:35:53,000
So this is a protection against that type of activity or the activity possibly in the future where the state board might want to loosen up home education rules beyond what is in law.

1703
03:35:53,000 --> 03:35:57,000
It would guard against both sides of that.

1704
03:35:57,000 --> 03:35:59,000
Further discussion?

1705
03:35:59,000 --> 03:36:01,000
Representative Cornell.

1706
03:36:01,000 --> 03:36:05,000
It seems to me that things are changing.

1707
03:36:05,000 --> 03:36:16,000
When we were discussing 11-14 earlier, we said we didn't have to put things into law because we had them in rules.

1708
03:36:16,000 --> 03:36:27,000
But now we're saying we don't have to put we can get rid of the rules because we're putting things into law.

1709
03:36:27,000 --> 03:36:31,000
So is it different for a different thing?

1710
03:36:31,000 --> 03:36:40,500
Didn't we just say that we didn't need to put something in law because we had it in rules?

1711
03:36:40,500 --> 03:36:49,500
But now we're saying that it should be in law because we can do away with the rules.

1712
03:36:49,500 --> 03:36:51,500
Reverend Cordelli.

1713
03:36:51,500 --> 03:36:53,500
Thank you.

1714
03:36:53,500 --> 03:37:02,500
I think in terms of home education statutes are very clear as to the processes and the requirements.

1715
03:37:02,500 --> 03:37:20,500
So I think that there is no need for the rules, whereas possibly other programs, more complicated programs with more requirements might need rules for clarification purposes and processes to be followed within the executive branch.

1716
03:37:20,500 --> 03:37:22,500
Further discussion?

1717
03:37:22,500 --> 03:37:24,500
Not seeing any.

1718
03:37:24,500 --> 03:37:53,000
any okay we've just gone through the discussion phase now we we need to yeah we need to have this amendment okay I move Amendment 0398 H for OTP I have a motion on the floor that this amendment we just looked at 0398 H is moved ought to pass to be amended to the bill itself.

1719
03:37:53,000 --> 03:37:57,000
Made by Representative Boehm, seconded by Representative Likas.

1720
03:37:57,000 --> 03:37:59,000
Any further discussion?

1721
03:37:59,000 --> 03:38:01,000
Representative, Mr.

1722
03:38:01,000 --> 03:38:03,000
Clerk.

1723
03:38:03,000 --> 03:38:05,000
Thank you.

1724
03:38:05,000 --> 03:38:07,500
Motion is ought to pass.

1725
03:38:07,500 --> 03:38:09,500
On amendment.

1726
03:38:09,500 --> 03:38:12,000
On is ought to pass.

1727
03:38:12,000 --> 03:38:14,000
On amendment.

1728
03:38:14,000 --> 03:38:16,000
On the amendment.

1729
03:38:16,000 --> 03:38:18,000
Okay.

1730
03:38:18,000 --> 03:38:20,000
All right.

1731
03:38:20,000 --> 03:38:22,000
Representative Cordelli.

1732
03:38:22,000 --> 03:38:28,000
You can raise hands or you can do it the other way.

1733
03:38:28,000 --> 03:38:30,000
It's up to you.

1734
03:38:30,000 --> 03:38:32,000
Raise hands.

1735
03:38:32,000 --> 03:38:34,000
Nose.

1736
03:38:34,000 --> 03:38:36,000
Nose.

1737
03:38:36,000 --> 03:38:38,000
Nose?

1738
03:38:38,000 --> 03:38:40,000
Nose.

1739
03:38:40,000 --> 03:38:42,000
Okay, thank you.

1740
03:38:42,000 --> 03:38:46,500
Okay, Representative Boone, now they can make a motion.

1741
03:38:46,500 --> 03:38:48,500
No, Mr.

1742
03:38:48,500 --> 03:38:52,000
Chair, I'd like to move amendment 973H.

1743
03:38:52,000 --> 03:38:54,000
973H.

1744
03:38:54,000 --> 03:38:56,500
Everybody should have a copy.

1745
03:38:56,500 --> 03:38:58,500
It's stapled.

1746
03:38:58,500 --> 03:39:02,500
Got a staple through the corner of it.

1747
03:39:02,500 --> 03:39:04,500
But no holes.

1748
03:39:04,500 --> 03:39:09,000
I asked for holes, but I got no holes.

1749
03:39:09,000 --> 03:39:11,000
It's okay.

1750
03:39:11,000 --> 03:39:14,500
We asked for a lot around here.

1751
03:39:14,500 --> 03:39:18,000
It's got a staple in the corner.

1752
03:39:18,000 --> 03:39:20,000
I have more.

1753
03:39:20,000 --> 03:39:22,000
Wait a minute.

1754
03:39:22,000 --> 03:39:24,500
This has staples in it.

1755
03:39:24,500 --> 03:39:30,000
No, that one where all the amendments end up, the extras.

1756
03:39:30,000 --> 03:39:32,000
We're on 1663-0973H.

1757
03:39:32,000 --> 03:39:34,000
No, I...

1758
03:39:34,000 --> 03:39:36,000
Same bill.

1759
03:39:36,000 --> 03:39:39,500
It may have been given to me.

1760
03:39:39,500 --> 03:39:42,500
I need an extra amendment, please.

1761
03:39:42,500 --> 03:39:48,500
Okay, we're going to have to take a little second minute here.

1762
03:39:48,500 --> 03:39:50,500
We have a...

1763
03:39:50,500 --> 03:39:52,500
Clerk's...

1764
03:39:52,500 --> 03:39:54,500
Oh, 0973?

1765
03:39:54,500 --> 03:40:15,500
For up oh those are visiting us this is our backup clerk to the backup okay we're all set we're all set good thank you okay would you please explain the motion or no I'd be happy to thank very much, Mr.

1766
03:40:15,500 --> 03:40:17,500
Chair.

1767
03:40:17,500 --> 03:40:24,000
So, Amendment 973H is a lighter touch, I think, on 1663 as introduced.

1768
03:40:24,000 --> 03:40:31,500
And just going through what it does, it actually strikes Section 1 from the bill.

1769
03:40:31,500 --> 03:40:45,500
and section one really doesn't do anything because it already requires that home-educated pupils shall have access to curricular courses and curricular programs offered by a school district.

1770
03:40:45,500 --> 03:40:54,000
So that's already there regardless of whether a school district actually has a written policy on that.

1771
03:40:54,000 --> 03:41:00,500
So they already have access to those resources provided by the public school.

1772
03:41:00,500 --> 03:41:17,000
So it picks up from the original bill on line 14 with section 2 and mirrors all of that, brings it through, actually mirrors all of that with the exception of Roman 3.

1773
03:41:17,000 --> 03:41:48,000
So now I'm on page 19 of the, I'm sorry, line 19 of the amendment, which corresponds to line 30 of the bill, and I think straightens out some of the somewhat confusing language about what happens when a student leaves one is homeschooling, leaves one district, goes to another district, and potentially withdraws from homeschooling at that point, who gets notified.

1774
03:41:48,000 --> 03:42:15,500
and rather than notifying the the department of education it really vests notification with the with the superintendent at the district of residence since they're the ones that that really do have the sort of the the child find responsibility and the responsibility to make sure that students are in compliance with the attendance statute.

1775
03:42:15,500 --> 03:42:20,000
That's actually with the superintendent, so not the department.

1776
03:42:20,000 --> 03:42:26,000
So that's what the very light touch changes at Roman 3 do.

1777
03:42:26,000 --> 03:42:52,000
I think a very important part of this bill is carried through in section 3 of the amendment, which is section 4 of the original bill, which eliminates the composite result, the student's performance having to be above the 40th percentile, which is just not going to be possible for every student.

1778
03:42:52,000 --> 03:43:15,500
So that carries through in Section 3, and then it concludes in Section 3, let's see, just as the bill was written, and then the final thing the amendment does is it deletes Section 5 from the original bill, which I think Representative Boehm's amendment also does.

1779
03:43:15,500 --> 03:43:21,500
Yeah, actually, it deletes Representative Boehm's amendment also deletes the same language.

1780
03:43:21,500 --> 03:43:28,500
which just deletes a little bit more in any rules adopted pursuant to a...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1781
03:43:28,500 --> 03:43:36,000
also repeals 193A colon 3 rulemaking completely, which I think is really a heavy-duty change.

1782
03:43:36,000 --> 03:43:43,000
So, like I said, I think this is the amendment that I'm proposing here.

1783
03:43:43,000 --> 03:43:45,500
973 is a lighter touch.

1784
03:43:45,500 --> 03:43:58,000
I think it captures the important elements that come through in the bill and preserves the limited rulemaking that the department has in this area.

1785
03:43:58,000 --> 03:44:00,000
That's all I got.

1786
03:44:00,000 --> 03:44:02,000
Okay.

1787
03:44:02,000 --> 03:44:04,000
Thank you very much.

1788
03:44:04,000 --> 03:44:11,500
In looking at the bill as introduced, I'm looking at Section 5, Home Educated Students.

1789
03:44:11,500 --> 03:44:23,500
It talks about authority of the school district officials and talks about when a child comes back in from homeschooling into the rigor program.

1790
03:44:23,500 --> 03:44:34,500
That's also alluded to in the amendment which we just passed in section 8, the classroom placement of a formerly home-educated student.

1791
03:44:34,500 --> 03:44:52,500
It reads in the one we did, a student who was home-educated in accordance with 193a and is enrolling in public schools, shall be placed according to their age unless the parent and school agree otherwise.

1792
03:44:52,500 --> 03:45:00,000
In the bill as it was introduced, there are other factors which come into play.

1793
03:45:00,000 --> 03:45:03,000
In yours, I don't see anything.

1794
03:45:03,000 --> 03:45:06,000
How do we reconcile all this?

1795
03:45:06,000 --> 03:46:30,000
Obviously, the bill as amended would replace what was in the introduction bill has introduced and it says we place by age right but but you how I guess that's that's something that that may be very difficult for a um for a district of a school district of residents to do not knowing what the uh the student has done and in particular if um if uh if a family is placing a student uh taking them out withdrawing from the homeschool environment and placing a student into the school district let's say June of their of the let's say they're 17 years old and and they would technically be a senior and graduation is 10 days later and the school district has not been provided any proof of any competencies or any student outcomes whatsoever, but at that point would be required, I guess, to graduate the student and provide them with a high school diploma, not knowing what courses, if any, the student actually completed.

1796
03:46:30,000 --> 03:46:36,000
And I think that puts the school district in an untenable position.

1797
03:46:36,000 --> 03:47:00,500
And just follow-up, as introduced it says unless students within the school are stratified or placed by academic performance so that's another way of placing whereas what we've just done says they're placed in accordance with their age, and as you've introduced, it doesn't have it in the bill.

1798
03:47:00,500 --> 03:47:04,000
No, it's as currently is in law.

1799
03:47:04,000 --> 03:47:06,500
Oh, as currently in law.

1800
03:47:06,500 --> 03:47:08,500
And I apologize, Mr.

1801
03:47:08,500 --> 03:47:10,500
Chair.

1802
03:47:10,500 --> 03:47:14,500
It's very difficult to look at current law.

1803
03:47:14,500 --> 03:47:20,000
The bill is introduced, the Boehm Amendment, and the Luno Amendment.

1804
03:47:20,000 --> 03:47:27,500
Yeah, I'm not looking at statutes, so I'm just looking at what I have here.

1805
03:47:27,500 --> 03:47:29,500
Yeah.

1806
03:47:29,500 --> 03:47:31,500
Yeah.

1807
03:47:31,500 --> 03:47:33,500
Yes, Representative Cordelli.

1808
03:47:33,500 --> 03:47:52,500
Thank you you I believe that section one as in the is important in changing the may to shall for a policy because we actually had an instance where a homeschooled child was denied access to extracurricular activities.

1809
03:47:52,500 --> 03:47:55,500
The parent went to the department.

1810
03:47:55,500 --> 03:48:09,500
The department actually had to file a suit against the school district before they recognized that they were in error and let the student participate in that activity.

1811
03:48:09,500 --> 03:48:18,000
So I think that requiring the policy and recognition of some of this in policy is needed.

1812
03:48:18,000 --> 03:48:20,500
So a follow-up on that.

1813
03:48:20,500 --> 03:48:26,000
That's not the primary purpose of the amendment that I'm offering.

1814
03:48:26,000 --> 03:48:33,000
I could certainly let Section 1, would certainly support Section 1 coming back in.

1815
03:48:33,000 --> 03:48:54,500
I just don't see it as being necessary because if in the case that you, the situation that you just laid out, with or without a policy, that school shall provide access to the curricular courses and co-curricular programs for a homeschooled student.

1816
03:48:54,500 --> 03:49:03,000
So they're clearly in violation of state law, regardless of whether they have a policy on that.

1817
03:49:03,000 --> 03:49:20,000
But I'm fine to put that back in if we want to try to do a committee amendment that, you know, merges the Boehm amendment and the Luno amendment and the bill is introduced.

1818
03:49:20,000 --> 03:49:53,000
I know that when we initially wrote this legislation years and years ago, in fact, I wrote it, for a student that's not in the public school or is in a charter school or some other educational arena and they want to come and participate in the athletic program or the theater program or something in the co-curricular area, then their school district does have policy.

1819
03:49:53,000 --> 03:50:15,000
And the same policy and expectations of a student in the public school as you're passing your courses or you've got a certain average and you're not delinquent as far as coming to school, that same policy would be appropriate for the person coming.

1820
03:50:15,000 --> 03:50:20,000
So the game is fair on both sides and equal.

1821
03:50:20,000 --> 03:50:24,000
That I do not want to see disturbed.

1822
03:50:24,000 --> 03:50:26,500
I think that's very important.

1823
03:50:26,500 --> 03:50:51,000
I was in charge of athletics for the school district where we were, and we sometimes saw that a student that was unable to muster the academic levels, then went on a different level and then came back and said, yeah, I want to participate in this hockey program.

1824
03:50:51,000 --> 03:50:55,000
And our primary purpose, of course, is academics.

1825
03:50:55,000 --> 03:50:57,000
And so we disallowed.

1826
03:50:57,000 --> 03:51:03,000
And that was a district where we had tremendous dollars for athletics.

1827
03:51:03,000 --> 03:51:44,500
Our travel budget alone was $1.5 million dollars this was in Alaska so I think that same formula or intent was put into law right in this state when we initially put this together I think represent boom you're on the committee at that time when we did it definitely yeah and I think that one of the problems we had in up by public school we had it kids can go to what came to athletics though the problem was Thank you.

1828
03:51:44,500 --> 03:51:58,500
And I think that one of the problems we had in our public school, when we had it, the kids can go to what came to athletics, though.

1829
03:51:58,500 --> 03:52:03,000
The problem was to have to make the team.

1830
03:52:03,000 --> 03:52:09,500
And we had one case where the homeschool student didn't make the team.

1831
03:52:09,500 --> 03:52:15,000
So the parents moved to Nashua and made the Nashua team.

1832
03:52:15,000 --> 03:52:17,000
Wait a minute.

1833
03:52:17,000 --> 03:52:24,500
You didn't make the small school team, but you made the big city school team.

1834
03:52:24,500 --> 03:52:28,500
So, yeah, there are still problems with that.

1835
03:52:28,500 --> 03:52:30,500
Thank you.

1836
03:52:30,500 --> 03:52:32,500
the Nashua team.

1837
03:52:32,500 --> 03:52:34,500
Wait a minute.

1838
03:52:34,500 --> 03:52:42,000
You didn't make the small school team, but you made the big city school team.

1839
03:52:42,000 --> 03:52:52,500
So yeah, there are still problems with that, but the law has got to be, you know, you have the opportunity.

1840
03:52:52,500 --> 03:52:55,000
It's got to be fair.

1841
03:52:55,000 --> 03:52:57,000
So Mr.

1842
03:52:57,000 --> 03:53:19,500
Chair, I guess I'm not sure then how we follow what you're just saying, given the fact that Representative Boehm's bill repeals rulemaking in Section 7, because clearly you do need to have some rulemaking when it comes to, and I agree with you, Mr.

1843
03:53:19,500 --> 03:53:40,000
Chair, it's not so much participation in co-curricular activities, but that's part of it, but in terms of academics and where to place a student who returns to a school district, that should be laid out in rules based on law.

1844
03:53:40,000 --> 03:54:05,500
and and honestly I think if you wanted to for the in order to be expedient maybe really the only things that need to be addressed here are in section 2 of the original bill which is eliminating those sentences in B and C about composite results above the 40th percentile.

1845
03:54:05,500 --> 03:54:13,500
You know, maybe we need to take a little more care on the rest of it.

1846
03:54:13,500 --> 03:54:15,500
Mr.

1847
03:54:15,500 --> 03:54:18,500
Chair, could I ask a question?

1848
03:54:18,500 --> 03:54:20,500
Sure.

1849
03:54:20,500 --> 03:54:31,000
Back to that idea of the returning student being placed by age, how would that work in a high school setting?

1850
03:54:31,000 --> 03:54:33,000
I don't know.

1851
03:54:33,000 --> 03:55:25,000
You know, that's the question, and that's part of why I brought this thing up, because it's easy to do that in the lower L, but when you talk about getting into the intermediate level, especially when you start like sixth grade, which is considered middle school in some, we have middle school in four through eight in some locations in the state, but when you get in the upper levels of middle school, you're now starting to also get offerings that are offered at the high school level, presented in the 7th and 8th grades now, especially in the mathematics areas and that.

1852
03:55:25,000 --> 03:55:31,500
So this is getting into an area where it's not just age places.

1853
03:55:31,500 --> 03:55:34,500
We place based upon the competencies.

1854
03:55:34,500 --> 03:55:37,500
We place upon where they're achieving.

1855
03:55:37,500 --> 03:55:41,000
And we look at maturation as well.

1856
03:55:41,000 --> 03:55:44,000
So there's a whole lot here.

1857
03:55:44,000 --> 03:55:55,000
There's one area I know that we all agree on, that the 40th percentile is an area that needs to be gone.

1858
03:55:55,000 --> 03:56:46,500
We are looking now more at growth and achievement, and certainly we want to see some some growth but 40th percentile that was an old denominator used years ago and it needs to be gone so mr chair would it be reasonable to offer a um a committee amendment or possibly amendment from represent bohm and myself that restores um uh section one from the original bill which is what represent cordelli was talking about assuring access having a policy that assures access to curriculum and co-curricular activities and then uh and then having a another section that takes away the 40th percentile.

1859
03:56:46,500 --> 03:56:54,500
And just until we get a better understanding of what the rest does, leave it alone.

1860
03:56:54,500 --> 03:56:58,000
Well, you mentioned yourself and Representative Boehm.

1861
03:56:58,000 --> 03:57:00,000
Let's see what Mr.

1862
03:57:00,000 --> 03:57:02,000
Boehm wants to say.

1863
03:57:02,000 --> 03:57:04,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1864
03:57:04,000 --> 03:57:06,000
I'm just offering that.

1865
03:57:06,000 --> 03:57:09,000
Just one thing on age difference.

1866
03:57:09,000 --> 03:57:11,000
You're in high school.

1867
03:57:11,000 --> 03:57:13,000
What age?

1868
03:57:13,000 --> 03:57:15,000
So it's really not.

1869
03:57:15,000 --> 03:57:20,000
I mean, you can be 13 and be a senior.

1870
03:57:20,000 --> 03:57:24,000
You can be 18 and be a freshman.

1871
03:57:24,000 --> 03:57:29,500
I mean, so age really doesn't matter in a high school.

1872
03:57:29,500 --> 03:57:33,000
No, Representative Boehm, if I may, Mr.

1873
03:57:33,000 --> 03:57:36,000
Chair, my question was exactly that.

1874
03:57:36,000 --> 03:57:43,000
It was not, you know, can you go to high school when you're 13?

1875
03:57:43,000 --> 03:57:50,500
It's if somebody's returning back to school at age 15, where does that put them?

1876
03:57:50,500 --> 03:57:52,500
Is he a junior?

1877
03:57:52,500 --> 03:57:54,500
Is he a sophomore?

1878
03:57:54,500 --> 03:57:59,500
You know, how does that determination get made by age?

1879
03:57:59,500 --> 03:58:07,000
Yeah, I mean, it depends on, I mean, your portfolio, your school, your testing, whatever.

1880
03:58:07,000 --> 03:58:13,000
At that point in high school, since there isn't any age different.

1881
03:58:13,000 --> 03:58:16,500
So I don't think it's an issue.

1882
03:58:16,500 --> 03:58:18,500
Representative Lekas?

1883
03:58:18,500 --> 03:58:23,000
Yeah, the age part is in the original bill.

1884
03:58:23,000 --> 03:58:27,500
I'm not finding it in the amendment at all.

1885
03:58:27,500 --> 03:58:46,500
And in the original bill, it said, on line 15 on the second page you know the amendment replaces that aspect of it in a reps like this is correct it's in the amendment we just looked at.

1886
03:58:46,500 --> 03:58:49,000
The amendment replaces everything below.

1887
03:58:49,000 --> 03:58:54,500
According to their age, unless the parent and school agree otherwise.

1888
03:58:54,500 --> 03:59:04,000
And so in a high school, if the, you know, the original says unless they're already being stratified, right?

1889
03:59:04,000 --> 04:00:04,500
So in this case, it would be the parent in school to work out would it not you where where they belong well it'd be depending upon yet in the high school you're talking what happens if the parent and school don't agree because this is if and is there not or and what happens if the we're looking at the number of courses which were required for graduation then there's going to have to be some kind of a competencies you know done somewhere along the way to find out you know just like they do down University of Maryland for people in the service, they try to figure out what's going to count as a course as general ed.

1890
04:00:04,500 --> 04:00:16,500
So we'd have to have that process in place to determine where to place them, but we're not placing based on age, are we?

1891
04:00:16,500 --> 04:00:20,000
We're placing based upon knowledge and skills.

1892
04:00:20,000 --> 04:00:24,500
So we've got to be careful with this one.

1893
04:00:24,500 --> 04:00:30,500
Just because they're 15 doesn't mean they come in as a sophomore.

1894
04:00:30,500 --> 04:00:36,000
That's no different from a student coming from a different state.

1895
04:00:36,000 --> 04:00:40,000
And they come into school in their age.

1896
04:00:40,000 --> 04:00:50,000
I know in our school, a lot of schools, they give a student the test to see where they're at.

1897
04:00:50,000 --> 04:00:53,500
In some cases, they skip a grade.

1898
04:00:53,500 --> 04:01:00,000
I've seen that happening because their school where they came from was better.

1899
04:01:00,000 --> 04:01:04,000
I think the parent in the school agrees.

1900
04:01:04,000 --> 04:01:09,000
If they don't agree, the parent can continue the homeschooling.

1901
04:01:09,000 --> 04:01:15,000
Or they make, okay, that, or they make, okay, we need this.

1902
04:01:15,000 --> 04:01:20,000
If it takes this course, then we can do it.

1903
04:01:20,000 --> 04:01:41,000
We have within law here, if you look at the military compact, and when a student comes in that's in military, families military, there are conditions and steps that must be taken, and that's done through all 50 states in our country.

1904
04:01:41,000 --> 04:01:44,000
We are all part of that.

1905
04:01:44,000 --> 04:02:42,500
Now come in from a school in another state let's say Connecticut and they're coming in from an accredited school down in Connecticut then of course that's a different deal too they probably are going to be placed where their their file shows they belong but the principal of school I as a principal would certainly take a healthy look at this and determine well I going to place this kid in some kind of an AP course or am I going to go rigor ed or am I going to put where this child really belongs so that the child's not going to be overwhelmed and going to gain the knowledge that they need to have.

1906
04:02:42,500 --> 04:02:47,500
So I'm a little leery about just placing by age.

1907
04:02:47,500 --> 04:02:54,500
I think that's not going to work on the high school level at all.

1908
04:02:54,500 --> 04:03:08,500
I think what we need to do is that, and as Representative Cordelli just mentioned to me quietly, maybe we need to do some more work on this.

1909
04:03:08,500 --> 04:03:15,500
Maybe we need to, you can't retain it, but we could interim study it.

1910
04:03:15,500 --> 04:03:18,000
And because this is important.

1911
04:03:18,000 --> 04:03:23,000
You can't retain it, but we could interim study it.

1912
04:03:23,000 --> 04:03:25,000
Because this is important.

1913
04:03:25,000 --> 04:03:28,500
Representative Tanner, you got your hand up?

1914
04:03:28,500 --> 04:03:41,000
I just wanted to say that I think the home advisory group should be involved in this, that we should get some feedback from them.

1915
04:03:41,000 --> 04:03:47,000
And if we had an interim study, that would be a great...

1916
04:03:47,000 --> 04:03:49,000
I concur with you.

1917
04:03:49,000 --> 04:04:05,500
Could we work out something to just move the language from the original bill on lines 31 to 34 in terms of academic performance and substitute that for age in the BOMA amendment?

1918
04:04:05,500 --> 04:04:15,000
So we know we have a homeschool community, which is split, in terms of how they perceive home education.

1919
04:04:15,000 --> 04:04:17,000
We know that.

1920
04:04:17,000 --> 04:04:26,500
And I don't think there's anything so imperative in this bill that we have to do it right now.

1921
04:04:26,500 --> 04:04:37,000
And if I also know, PI, that we have about a day and a half left to get this work done.

1922
04:04:37,000 --> 04:04:50,000
I don't think we should be putting a whole lot more off before we deal with the other 25 bills we haven't dealt with yet today.

1923
04:04:50,000 --> 04:04:52,000
Mr.

1924
04:04:52,000 --> 04:04:54,000
Chair?

1925
04:04:54,000 --> 04:04:56,000
Yes.

1926
04:04:56,000 --> 04:05:12,500
Could we recess this until tomorrow and give me a chance tonight to talk to the chair of the HIAC, the Home Education Advisory Council, to see if they've had input to this.

1927
04:05:12,500 --> 04:05:28,000
I think all the input we can have is there, but I'd like to also have input from the High School Principals Association and find out where they are on it.

1928
04:05:28,000 --> 04:05:30,000
Pardon me?

1929
04:05:30,000 --> 04:05:32,000
Oh, great.

1930
04:05:32,000 --> 04:06:10,000
so yeah so that might be an angle but are they going to be able to get that information to you other than one person or I could at least check and see if they've discussed this in he act yeah so I was not at the last meeting I think we need to recess this bill right now and if if we go forward with it, we can always come forward with more work tomorrow.

1931
04:06:10,000 --> 04:06:22,000
If we can gain any, if any of us got hit by a bolt of lightning on this topic, maybe we can go forward.

1932
04:06:22,000 --> 04:06:29,000
If not, maybe we ought to be looking at a study of some kind.

1933
04:06:29,000 --> 04:06:31,000
Any objections to that?

1934
04:06:31,000 --> 04:06:33,000
Okay, let's move on.

1935
04:06:33,000 --> 04:06:39,500
Yeah, we approved the amendment, and there was a motion on the bill.

1936
04:06:39,500 --> 04:06:44,000
We have not acted on the bill as amended.

1937
04:06:44,000 --> 04:06:46,000
Pardon me?

1938
04:06:46,000 --> 04:06:48,500
We just did the one?

1939
04:06:48,500 --> 04:06:50,500
Yeah.

1940
04:06:50,500 --> 04:06:52,500
Okay.

1941
04:06:52,500 --> 04:06:56,000
This is education for all those people.

1942
04:06:56,000 --> 04:07:05,500
We move a little slower than they do maybe in commerce, but we try to get the job done.

1943
04:07:05,500 --> 04:07:12,500
The next bill, I don't think Representative Boehm has any more missiles for us.

1944
04:07:12,500 --> 04:07:17,000
Okay, let's keep walking down through where we were.

1945
04:07:17,000 --> 04:07:19,000
We were at 11.31.

1946
04:07:19,000 --> 04:07:25,000
Did we get any kind of feedback on that one over lunch?

1947
04:07:25,000 --> 04:07:28,500
Any, you know, we broke for caucus?

1948
04:07:28,500 --> 04:07:34,000
Or we can go on if we haven't gotten that yet.

1949
04:07:34,000 --> 04:07:36,000
Okay, we'll go on.

1950
04:07:36,000 --> 04:07:38,000
Okay.

1951
04:07:38,000 --> 04:07:41,000
Can we pick an easy one?

1952
04:07:41,000 --> 04:07:43,500
Okay, HB 1196, that's good.

1953
04:07:43,500 --> 04:07:47,500
Relative to school financial reports of public academies.

1954
04:07:47,500 --> 04:07:50,000
Okay, here, take the gavel.

1955
04:07:50,000 --> 04:08:29,000
This is 1196 and I'll ask representative I'll make a motion of ITL Second you second second by resident of Luno comments from chair I'd like to read the blurb this bill requires that public academies file a financial report each year to the Department of Education as an Academy pickington Academy is a unique independent learning school and its mission is to strive to ensure the growth of all students in a challenging, respectful, and collaborative environment.

1956
04:08:29,000 --> 04:08:41,000
It is an independent high school with contracts with area school districts and independent applicants, which serve 3,100 students in grades 9 through 12.

1957
04:08:41,000 --> 04:08:52,000
During the previous year, the Academy operated an extensive program of studies, including more than 320 unique courses and 60 co-curricular activities.

1958
04:08:52,000 --> 04:09:03,500
Having reviewed the most recent tax reports, the Academy is a not-for-profit organization exempt from federal and state income tax under Section 501c3.

1959
04:09:03,500 --> 04:09:37,000
The Academy has adopted accounting policy and has communicated to the committee Pinkerton Academy's tax exempt status and exemptions are identified in tax reporting and this material is publicly available the committee views this bill is unnecessary the second or have any comment exactly the same thoughts any further comment from the committee or maybe we can move straight to a uh roll call yes yes Yes.

1960
04:09:37,000 --> 04:09:39,000
Representative Ellison.

1961
04:09:39,000 --> 04:09:41,000
Representative Lullen.

Representative Porter.

1966
04:09:49,000 --> 04:09:51,000
Yes.

1967
04:09:51,000 --> 04:09:53,000
Representative Mary.

1968
04:09:53,000 --> 04:09:55,000
Yes.

1969
04:09:55,000 --> 04:09:57,000
Representative Porter.

Yes.

1973
04:10:03,000 --> 04:10:05,000
Representative Ladd.

1974
04:10:05,000 --> 04:10:07,000
Yes.

1975
04:10:07,000 --> 04:10:09,000
18.

1976
04:10:09,000 --> 04:10:11,000
Zip.

1977
04:10:11,000 --> 04:10:13,000
Yeah, one is absent.

1978
04:10:13,000 --> 04:10:15,000
Any problems with consent?

1979
04:10:15,000 --> 04:10:17,000
Okay.

1980
04:10:17,000 --> 04:10:19,000
Okay.

1981
04:10:19,000 --> 04:10:21,000
Okay.

1982
04:10:21,000 --> 04:10:23,000
Okay.

1983
04:10:23,000 --> 04:10:25,000
Okay.

1984
04:10:25,000 --> 04:10:27,000
Okay.

1985
04:10:27,000 --> 04:10:29,000
Okay.

1986
04:10:29,000 --> 04:10:31,000
Okay.

1987
04:10:31,000 --> 04:10:33,000
Okay.

1988
04:10:33,000 --> 04:10:35,000
Okay.

1989
04:10:35,000 --> 04:10:37,000
Okay.

1990
04:10:37,000 --> 04:10:39,000
Okay.

1991
04:10:39,000 --> 04:10:41,000
Okay.

1992
04:10:41,000 --> 04:10:43,000
Okay.

1993
04:10:43,000 --> 04:10:45,000
Thank you.

1994
04:10:45,000 --> 04:10:59,500
any problems with consent okay what one was what you say Dave okay let's go to 1402ative to inclusion of charter public schools in school district bond issuance quotes.

1995
04:10:59,500 --> 04:11:01,500
1402.

1996
04:11:01,500 --> 04:11:16,500
Well, I tell you, I've mentioned many times, if I had got a dime every time I've turned these pages, I wouldn't have to buy any more gas this year.

1997
04:11:16,500 --> 04:11:18,500
I don't know.

1998
04:11:18,500 --> 04:11:21,500
Yeah any more gas this year.

1999
04:11:21,500 --> 04:11:23,500
Maybe I would.

2000
04:11:23,500 --> 04:11:39,000
If walking down the hall with one of you guys at noon to him I mentioned what we get paid with that $100 a year will fill our car up twice.

2001
04:11:39,000 --> 04:11:41,000
Once?

2002
04:11:41,000 --> 04:11:46,000
An 18-wheeler takes about $1,400 to fill it up once.

2003
04:11:46,000 --> 04:11:48,000
300-gallon tank.

2004
04:11:48,000 --> 04:11:51,000
Okay, what are we on here?

2005
04:11:51,000 --> 04:11:53,000
1402.

2006
04:11:53,000 --> 04:12:01,000
Okay, this is relative to inclusion of charter public schools and school district bond issuance votes.

2007
04:12:01,000 --> 04:12:03,000
We need a motion.

2008
04:12:03,000 --> 04:12:06,000
You don't have to make it.

2009
04:12:06,000 --> 04:12:09,000
Do you want to make it?

2010
04:12:09,000 --> 04:12:12,000
Representative Luno will write another one.

2011
04:12:12,000 --> 04:12:14,000
Oh, no.

2012
04:12:14,000 --> 04:12:16,000
I'm happy to.

2013
04:12:16,000 --> 04:12:18,000
I'll move ITL.

2014
04:12:18,000 --> 04:12:20,500
You want a second, Rep.

2015
04:12:20,500 --> 04:12:22,500
Scoredelli?

2016
04:12:22,500 --> 04:12:24,500
I will second.

2017
04:12:24,500 --> 04:12:29,000
So we have a motion on table on 1402.

2018
04:12:29,000 --> 04:12:34,000
ITL made by Representative Luno and seconded by Representative Cordelli.

2019
04:12:34,000 --> 04:12:37,000
Discussion on the bill, Representative Luno?

2020
04:12:37,000 --> 04:12:39,000
Sure, just very quickly.

2021
04:12:39,000 --> 04:13:19,500
You know, while I think there's good intentions behind this, I think there's a number of very specific aspects that that are not considered in this in this bill and it's something that should have uh you know uh be considered as more of a comprehensive look when it comes to the building um i'm sorry the bonding uh authority so uh so i think at this point um you know we're not going to be able to fix everything here.

2022
04:13:19,500 --> 04:13:24,500
So ITL, I think, is the right place for this.

2023
04:13:24,500 --> 04:13:26,500
Representative Cordelli?

2024
04:13:26,500 --> 04:13:28,500
Nothing further?

2025
04:13:28,500 --> 04:13:30,500
Any further discussion?

2026
04:13:30,500 --> 04:13:32,500
All those in favor?

2027
04:13:32,500 --> 04:13:37,000
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2028
04:13:37,000 --> 04:13:39,000
We can't do that.

2029
04:13:39,000 --> 04:13:41,000
Yeah.

2030
04:13:41,000 --> 04:13:44,000
I know we're trying to move.

2031
04:13:44,000 --> 04:13:46,000
Representative Nelson.

2032
04:13:46,000 --> 04:13:48,000
Roll call.

2033
04:13:48,000 --> 04:13:50,000

2044

2052
04:14:28,500 --> 04:14:30,500
Yes.

2053
04:14:30,500 --> 04:14:32,500
Yes.

2054
04:14:32,500 --> 04:14:34,500
Yes.

2055
04:14:34,500 --> 04:14:36,500
Yes.

2056
04:14:36,500 --> 04:14:38,500
Yes.

2057
04:14:38,500 --> 04:14:40,500
Yes.

2058
04:14:40,500 --> 04:14:42,500
Yes.

2059
04:14:42,500 --> 04:14:44,500
Yes.

2060
04:14:44,500 --> 04:14:46,500
Yes.

2061
04:14:46,500 --> 04:14:48,500
Yes.

2062
04:14:48,500 --> 04:14:50,500
Yes.

2063
04:14:50,500 --> 04:14:52,500
Yes.

2064
04:14:52,500 --> 04:14:54,500
Yes.

2065
04:14:54,500 --> 04:15:06,000
There were a number of financial issues dealing with the bonding on property values and all that and it's just of the organization.

2066
04:15:06,000 --> 04:15:08,000
Mr.

2067
04:15:08,000 --> 04:15:17,000
18 that's right give me a jingle I didn't look over there I I wouldn't have done that.

2068
04:15:17,000 --> 04:15:19,000
No, no, no.

2069
04:15:19,000 --> 04:15:21,000
We're all right.

2070
04:15:21,000 --> 04:15:23,000
Okay.

2071
04:15:23,000 --> 04:15:26,000
I'd like to go to 1263.

2072
04:15:26,000 --> 04:15:30,500
We're going to have some amendments on this bill.

2073
04:15:30,500 --> 04:15:32,500
Yes.

2074
04:15:32,500 --> 04:15:34,500
Oh, yeah.

2075
04:15:34,500 --> 04:15:36,500
We will do that.

2076
04:15:36,500 --> 04:15:38,500
1263.

2077
04:15:38,500 --> 04:15:45,000
I'm going to try and get all the amendments here for this bill.

2078
04:15:45,000 --> 04:15:47,500
Let's see what we got.

2079
04:15:47,500 --> 04:15:52,500
I think we only have one amendment on this one.

2080
04:15:52,500 --> 04:15:54,500
There's two.

2081
04:15:54,500 --> 04:15:59,000
Okay, we have 0-9-2-3-H, and what's the other one?

2082
04:15:59,000 --> 04:16:01,000
0-9-7-4-H.

2083
04:16:01,000 --> 04:16:03,000
9-7-4-H.

2084
04:16:03,000 --> 04:16:05,500
Do you have it, Rick?

2085
04:16:05,500 --> 04:16:07,500
Yeah.

2086
04:16:07,500 --> 04:16:09,500
Probably somewhere.

2087
04:16:09,500 --> 04:16:11,500
Which one is this?

2088
04:16:11,500 --> 04:16:13,500
This is 1263.

2089
04:16:13,500 --> 04:16:15,500
Yeah, we do have.

2090
04:16:15,500 --> 04:16:19,000
The one I gave you was 1236.

2091
04:16:19,000 --> 04:16:21,000
That's not right.

2092
04:16:21,000 --> 04:16:23,000
So we're talking 1263.

2093
04:16:23,000 --> 04:16:39,500
Yeah, there's several amendments here yeah yes there are no we got two yeah okay we have zero nine four two h and zero nine seven four h We have 0942H and 0974H.

2094
04:16:39,500 --> 04:16:44,000
Can you remember those numbers for me again, please?

2095
04:16:44,000 --> 04:16:46,000
0942H and 0974H.

2096
04:16:46,000 --> 04:16:48,000
Okay.

2097
04:16:48,000 --> 04:16:54,500
What we're going to do is just open up to have a discussion.

2098
04:16:54,500 --> 04:17:06,000
We'll discuss both of these amendments and show the likenesses and differences between them, and then move forward and hopefully get it resolved.

2099
04:17:06,000 --> 04:17:11,000
Do you want to go first with yours, Representative Luno?

2100
04:17:11,000 --> 04:17:13,000
Sure, sure.

2101
04:17:13,000 --> 04:17:15,000
Thanks very much, Mr.

2102
04:17:15,000 --> 04:17:17,000
Chair.

2103
04:17:17,000 --> 04:17:27,000
I think both amendments try to accomplish very similar things by basically hijacking, I'll use that term, House Bill 1263.

2104
04:17:27,000 --> 04:17:45,500
and using that section to basically put an emphasis on wellness education and also to capture, I think, the intention that we heard in a different bill with respect to healthy relationships and respect for personal boundaries.

2105
04:17:45,500 --> 04:17:51,500
And the amendment that I'm offering, 974, uses that terminology in here.

2106
04:17:51,500 --> 04:18:01,500
It rolls out the PE number of minutes per week for physical education, which I think was the initial purpose.

2107
04:18:01,500 --> 04:18:03,500
Both amendments do that.

2108
04:18:03,500 --> 04:18:13,000
I think Representative Ladd's amendment uses language not the same as healthy personal relationships in respect to personal boundaries.

2109
04:18:13,000 --> 04:18:23,000
It uses the term interpersonal relationships, which I think is very similar to that and certainly a big step forward.

2110
04:18:23,000 --> 04:18:32,000
And Representative Ladd also has a new section on personal finance literacy, which I think is very strong.

2111
04:18:32,000 --> 04:18:35,000
Okay, I will address the 0942H.

2112
04:18:35,000 --> 04:18:37,000
Thank you.

2113
04:18:37,000 --> 04:18:40,000
Okay, I will address the 0942H.

2114
04:18:40,000 --> 04:19:18,500
What we've done is that we're recognizing this section of law, 189 colon 10, which is in your statute studies, which deals with various studies that go on K through 12 in our schools it references physical education wellness and our physical education in health primarily now and various issues within it within education 306 which are our rules dealing with the standards standards for public school approval, minimum standards, it speaks to health and wellness throughout.

2115
04:19:18,500 --> 04:19:31,000
It's a terminology that's been used by the State Board and by the Department of Education prior to 2015 and going forward to this date.

2116
04:19:31,000 --> 04:19:34,500
So wellness should be brought into that.

2117
04:19:34,500 --> 04:19:39,000
You're going to see the same terminology in 1761.

2118
04:19:39,000 --> 04:19:42,500
So both bills have the term wellness.

2119
04:19:42,500 --> 04:19:47,500
Both bills have fiscal education in there at the top.

2120
04:19:47,500 --> 04:20:06,000
This bill also has personal finance literacy, whereas it's mentioned in when we want to have in the area of a content of an adequate education, and you have to look at the amended version of 1761.

2121
04:20:06,000 --> 04:20:10,000
It's not at all what we had introduced.

2122
04:20:10,000 --> 04:20:12,000
1761.

2123
04:20:12,000 --> 04:20:14,000
16!

2124
04:20:14,000 --> 04:20:16,000
1671.

2125
04:20:16,000 --> 04:20:18,000
Yeah, I'm tired.

2126
04:20:18,000 --> 04:20:20,000
1671.

2127
04:20:20,000 --> 04:20:23,500
And all subjects are treated the same.

2128
04:20:23,500 --> 04:20:26,500
All subjects are part of adequacy.

2129
04:20:26,500 --> 04:20:39,000
And we've had the New Hampshire Bankers Association, the Business Industry Association, pushing heavily for personal finance literacy as a learning area, a learning domain.

2130
04:20:39,000 --> 04:20:42,000
We're not calling it core anything.

2131
04:20:42,000 --> 04:20:57,000
It's just a learning domain, which needs to be taught, just not in the economics course, to be included within economics as it's stated as a graduation requirement right now.

2132
04:20:57,000 --> 04:21:13,000
But it needs to be taught, as some schools are doing right now, and wonderfully that they're doing that, and certain banks are also contributing to the curriculum for personal finance literacy.

2133
04:21:13,000 --> 04:21:23,500
One up my neck of the woods is Posumptak Bank, which is out of Littleton and across the river in Vermont.

2134
04:21:23,500 --> 04:21:26,000
They provide support to students.

2135
04:21:26,000 --> 04:21:30,000
In fact, they do matching funds for students.

2136
04:21:30,000 --> 04:21:35,500
You put in 50 bucks, we match into a savings account.

2137
04:21:35,500 --> 04:21:37,500
Pardon me?

2138
04:21:37,500 --> 04:21:43,500
Mary and I worked on this one for many, many a day.

2139
04:21:43,500 --> 04:21:47,500
And so personal finance literacy really does belong.

2140
04:21:47,500 --> 04:22:03,000
But when we put it into the area of those learning domains or what we call subjects, in adequacy, you don't want to start talking about how it should be done.

2141
04:22:03,000 --> 04:22:06,500
That comes down in the studies area.

2142
04:22:06,500 --> 04:22:12,000
And we know it can be embedded into things like economics.

2143
04:22:12,000 --> 04:22:18,000
And we can know it can be embedded in many different courses.

2144
04:22:18,000 --> 04:22:28,000
And that's the way it should be done because it should intertwine with economics, with mathematics, with social studies, etc.

2145
04:22:28,000 --> 04:22:46,000
So I've included this area in here which says the school board shall ensure that personal finance literacy instruction designed to prepare students for success in making financial decisions is taught as part of the curriculum.

2146
04:22:46,000 --> 04:22:54,000
Personal finance literacy may be embedded in an existing course or grade level program of studies.

2147
04:22:54,000 --> 04:23:03,000
And in the content bill, you're going to see that doesn't go into effect for a full year.

2148
04:23:03,000 --> 04:23:06,500
It wouldn't go into effect until FY24.

2149
04:23:06,500 --> 04:23:18,000
It gives the schools a whole year to prepare and get ready for how to insert this into their content area of adequacy.

2150
04:23:18,000 --> 04:23:21,000
So that's been inserted in there.

2151
04:23:21,000 --> 04:23:38,000
Also, in looking at the bill, as Representative Tanner gave this us, I think we all understand we can't be saying, you're going to teach 25 minutes of this and 30 minutes of this.

2152
04:23:38,000 --> 04:23:48,000
That's where we were back when I started as a teacher back in 1970, after I came home from Vietnam.

2153
04:23:48,000 --> 04:23:51,000
And it was for every subject.

2154
04:23:51,000 --> 04:23:58,500
You had to do 35 minutes of this and mathematics, reading, literature, and all that.

2155
04:23:58,500 --> 04:24:04,000
And then we started doing thematic teaching where it was integrated.

2156
04:24:04,000 --> 04:24:08,500
You could be doing reading and social studies concurrently.

2157
04:24:08,500 --> 04:24:13,000
So how do you match all those minutes up?

2158
04:24:13,000 --> 04:24:15,000
You can't do it.

2159
04:24:15,000 --> 04:24:17,500
So every school is unique.

2160
04:24:17,500 --> 04:24:19,500
Every school is different.

2161
04:24:19,500 --> 04:24:22,500
So the minute thing is gone.

2162
04:24:22,500 --> 04:24:40,000
But there's also parts within what was in that bill, which we were dealing with areas of, that's, I've got in here, which we address prevention of sexual violence, which is needed in our society.

2163
04:24:40,000 --> 04:24:52,000
and that's in the amendment what I have and I believe that I saw that in the bill that was presented by Representative Tanner.

2164
04:24:52,000 --> 04:24:55,000
And I know it's in there.

2165
04:24:55,000 --> 04:24:58,500
I just, you know, can't place it.

2166
04:24:58,500 --> 04:25:06,000
And I thought that was important to lift that out and put it in here.

2167
04:25:06,000 --> 04:25:57,000
And also to have these relationships where people learn how to have relationships with each other interpersonal relationships and so that's the difference I think between the two bills here I think the one amendment includes that personal finance literacy and the reference to sexual prevention violence which I think should go in here where we talk about HIV, where we talk about other issues which we have in our society physiology, hygiene, health interpersonal relationships, that's all good stuff so that's it I'll open it up to discussion on the amendments amongst the committee yes, Representative Luno so thank you Mr.

2168
04:25:57,000 --> 04:25:59,000
Chair Thank you, Mr.

2169
04:25:59,000 --> 04:26:01,000
Chair.

2170
04:26:01,000 --> 04:26:06,000
No, I very much support the amendment you're offering, 942.

2171
04:26:06,000 --> 04:26:16,500
I think it's more comprehensive by the fact that it offers prevention of sexual violence and the personal finance literacy sections.

2172
04:26:16,500 --> 04:26:32,000
I sort of marginally like the terminology for healthy personal relationships and respect for personal boundaries, but I think both those things are wrapped up into your phrase of interpersonal relationships.

2173
04:26:32,000 --> 04:26:47,500
I would be fine to just move forward with the chair's amendment, given the hour and the amount of work we have left to do, if the chair's good with that.

2174
04:26:47,500 --> 04:26:53,500
Well, I'm fine with it, and it's just not all my work.

2175
04:26:53,500 --> 04:27:03,500
I know that the idea of interpersonal relationships came from the man with the hand up over there, Representative Ford.

2176
04:27:03,500 --> 04:27:05,500
Thank you.

2177
04:27:05,500 --> 04:28:07,000
interpersonal relationships came from the man with a hand up over there represent ford your mic you red button just another on word choice we were I noticed in the copy I have here it refers to pupils and I was wondering if we might get consistent on our use of students or whatever for all levels of I mean, before spoken to the idea of people being K through 12 or K through 6 or something like that and and just be consistent on that throughout these bills that's all yeah that's something that we're going to change throughout the entire statutes that we have students are referenced to higher ed okay pupils are K-12 or actually it's pre-K through 12th grade.

2178
04:28:07,000 --> 04:28:10,500
I'm not saying one or the other.

2179
04:28:10,500 --> 04:28:13,000
I'm just saying be consistent.

2180
04:28:13,000 --> 04:28:16,000
But we've got to get consistent.

2181
04:28:16,000 --> 04:28:23,500
What you see most of in the area we're talking here is the word pupil.

2182
04:28:23,500 --> 04:28:25,500
Okay.

2183
04:28:25,500 --> 04:28:27,500
So, yeah.

2184
04:28:27,500 --> 04:28:52,500
I don't have the, here's the word pupil okay so so yeah I don't have it here's the gavel do I hear a motion from the chair yes I'd like to move off to pass on 1263 a bill dealing with health fiscal, wellness, and personal finance literacy in schools.

2185
04:28:52,500 --> 04:28:54,500
Second.

2186
04:28:54,500 --> 04:28:56,500
Second.

2187
04:28:56,500 --> 04:28:58,500
Second, Representative Luno.

2188
04:28:58,500 --> 04:29:00,500
Discussion?

2189
04:29:00,500 --> 04:29:06,500
Yes, I'd like to move Amendment 0942H ought to pass to 1263.

2190
04:29:06,500 --> 04:29:09,000
Representative Cornell will second that.

2191
04:29:09,000 --> 04:29:29,000
Any further discussion on the amendment no but I think we're gonna have to wait for the clerk a little bit here yeah that's what we're gonna do now that's what we're doing right now okay on the 0942 amendment.

2192
04:29:29,000 --> 04:29:31,000
0942.

2193
04:29:31,000 --> 04:29:33,000
Thank you.

2194
04:29:33,000 --> 04:29:35,000
Representative Ling.

2195

I'm sorry.

2196
04:29:37,000 --> 04:29:43,000
I just thought we were going to raise hands for the amendment.

2197
04:29:43,000 --> 04:29:46,000
I was getting ahead of myself.

2198
04:29:46,000 --> 04:29:48,000
Sorry.

2199
04:29:48,000 --> 04:29:52,000
So all those in favor of 0942H amendment?

2200
04:29:52,000 --> 04:29:54,500
That looks to be 19-0.

2201
04:29:54,500 --> 04:29:56,500
Thank you.

2202
04:29:56,500 --> 04:30:11,000

Yeah.

2263
04:32:37,000 --> 04:32:39,000
Okay.

2264
04:32:39,000 --> 04:32:44,500
How about if we go down and just tackle 1671 now?

2265
04:32:44,500 --> 04:32:46,500
We could do that.

2266
04:32:46,500 --> 04:32:48,500
We've got the amendment.

2267
04:32:48,500 --> 04:32:50,500
1371 is a quickie.

2268
04:32:50,500 --> 04:32:53,000
You think it's a quickie?

2269
04:32:53,000 --> 04:32:55,000
Let's see.

2270
04:32:55,000 --> 04:32:57,000
Okay, let's do 1371.

2271
04:32:57,000 --> 04:32:59,500
That should be a cookie.

2272
04:32:59,500 --> 04:33:01,500
It should be.

2273
04:33:01,500 --> 04:33:03,500
Okay.

2274
04:33:03,500 --> 04:33:15,000
okay okay 1371 is a bill relative to school district policies on facial mass of students in schools representative Cordelli thank you mr.

2275
04:33:15,000 --> 04:33:18,500
chair I would move ITL on 1371.

2276
04:33:18,500 --> 04:33:20,500
Is there a second?

2277
04:33:20,500 --> 04:33:22,500
I'll second.

2278
04:33:22,500 --> 04:33:24,500
Okay.

2279
04:33:24,500 --> 04:33:29,500
Representative Cordelli, would you like to speak to your motion?

2280
04:33:29,500 --> 04:33:31,500
Thank you.

2281
04:33:31,500 --> 04:33:36,000
We have two bills regarding facial coverings or masks.

2282
04:33:36,000 --> 04:33:41,500
I think that this bill treads into the bullying discrimination area.

2283
04:33:41,500 --> 04:34:22,500
I think that is not needed and that our bullying statutes, I believe believe are quite comprehensive and I think would cover any incidents related to bullying and harassment of a student because they were or were not wearing a mask so for that reason I don't think that this bill is is needed represent Luna I agree with representative Cordelia don't have anything else to add open to the committee not see any hands are you ready yes sir Representative Cordelli.

2284
04:34:22,500 --> 04:34:24,500

Simpler names.

2329
04:35:56,000 --> 04:35:58,500

04:36:47,000 --> 04:36:49,500
We can do 1164, too.

2349
04:36:49,500 --> 04:36:51,500
Yeah.

2350
04:36:51,500 --> 04:36:53,500
Egg in the classroom.

2351
04:36:53,500 --> 04:36:57,000
There's a few more we can do.

2352
04:36:57,000 --> 04:36:59,000
Yeah.

2353
04:36:59,000 --> 04:37:02,500
I was saying we've got Bonnie here.

2354
04:37:02,500 --> 04:37:07,500
I don't know if you want to do 11 Yeah.

2355
04:37:07,500 --> 04:37:09,500
Assume that's on consent?

2356
04:37:09,500 --> 04:37:12,000
Yeah, she's been sitting here.

2357
04:37:12,000 --> 04:37:22,500
Okay, so we're going to go ahead with HB 1141, relative to special education services for children in charter public schools.

2358
04:37:22,500 --> 04:37:24,500
Okay, 1141.

2359
04:37:24,500 --> 04:37:26,500

04:37:26,500 --> 04:37:28,500
Yeah.

2361
04:37:28,500 --> 04:37:34,000
Everybody, I'd like to take a moment of silence right now.

2362
04:37:34,000 --> 04:37:38,000
It was just confirmed that Rene died today.

2363
04:37:38,000 --> 04:37:45,000
And so would we all please stand up and take a moment of silence.

2364
04:37:45,000 --> 04:37:47,000
Thank you very much.

2365
04:37:47,000 --> 04:37:54,500
We've just lost too many good people this year, and my heart is just breaking.

2366
04:37:54,500 --> 04:37:58,000
Let's take a 10-minute break right now.

2367
04:37:58,000 --> 04:38:01,500
For everybody, just try to collect yourselves.

2368
04:38:01,500 --> 04:38:06,500
I know this is a shock to all of us.

2369
04:38:06,500 --> 04:38:22,500
When we're in the House here, when I first met Terry Norelli, she indicated to me, Rick, when you get out of here, you're going to remember just not Republican and Democrat.

2370
04:38:22,500 --> 04:38:40,500
You're going to remember all the reps that have been with you, and you've come to know some as real close friends and family, and we just lost a family member, and it's hard to take.

2371
04:38:40,500 --> 04:38:42,500
Thank you.

2372
04:38:42,500 --> 04:38:44,500
Thanks, Rick.

2373
04:38:44,500 --> 04:38:54,500
member and it's it's hard to take thank you for letting us know did that just happen today right now?

2374
04:38:54,500 --> 04:38:56,500
What's up?

2375
04:38:56,500 --> 04:38:58,500
Did that just occur?

2376
04:38:58,500 --> 04:39:00,500
Yeah.

2377
04:39:00,500 --> 04:39:03,500
Yeah, the speaker just confirmed it.

2378
04:39:03,500 --> 04:39:05,500
Oh, no.

2379
04:39:05,500 --> 04:39:07,500
Oh, geez.

2380
04:39:07,500 --> 04:39:14,500

2388
04:39:28,500 --> 04:39:30,500
Thank you.

2389
04:39:30,500 --> 04:39:32,500

2394
04:39:40,500 --> 04:39:42,500

Thank you.

2397
04:39:46,500 --> 04:39:48,500
Thank you.

2398
04:39:48,500 --> 04:39:50,500
Thank you.

2399
04:39:50,500 --> 04:39:52,500
Thank you.

2400
04:39:52,500 --> 04:39:58,000
Okay, we're going to go ahead and reopen this executive session.

2401
04:39:58,000 --> 04:40:18,500
and we're starting out with HB 1141 1141 relative to the special education process for individualized education programs IEPs and represented Cordelli do you have a motion that works going I would like to offer a motion of ought to pass.

2402
04:40:18,500 --> 04:40:20,500
Is there a second?

2403
04:40:20,500 --> 04:40:23,000
Okay, Representative Nelson seconds that.

2404
04:40:23,000 --> 04:40:28,000
Representative Cordelli, do you care to speak to your motion?

2405
04:40:28,000 --> 04:40:32,000
Just to offer an amendment, if I might.

2406
04:40:32,000 --> 04:40:34,000
Okay.

2407
04:40:34,000 --> 04:40:38,500
It is amendment 0961H that I think went around.

2408
04:40:38,500 --> 04:40:42,000
Okay, you're offering 0961H as amendment 2-1141.

2409
04:40:42,000 --> 04:40:45,500
Is there a second to his motion?

2410
04:40:45,500 --> 04:40:48,000
Representative Ford makes that second.

2411
04:40:48,000 --> 04:40:53,000
Representative Cordelli, would you like to speak to the amendment?

2412
04:40:53,000 --> 04:40:55,000
Yes, thank you.

2413
04:40:55,000 --> 04:41:02,000
This amendment makes several changes, and I can just walk you briefly through that.

2414
04:41:02,000 --> 04:41:19,500
down on the first page in the area of line 23 it adds new paragraphs beginning with roman 4 it leaves in place roman 3 currently which had been previously removed in the prior amendment.

2415
04:41:19,500 --> 04:41:24,000
Roman 3 related to short-term objectives within the IEP.

2416
04:41:24,000 --> 04:41:42,000
Roman 4 and 5 remain the same as in the previous amendment on second page line seven to nine rulemaking is to be consistent with federal law and this chapter being special education in state law.

2417
04:41:42,000 --> 04:42:09,000
And down on the bottom of page two, in bold, in subsection G, discusses the agreement from mediation and states that the agreement shall state that all discussions that have occurred in the mediation process shall be confidential and shall not be used in evidence of any subsequent due process hearing or civil proceeding.

2418
04:42:09,000 --> 04:42:27,500
And then over on the next page, on lines 3 through 10 or 11, it indicates that discussions that occurred during the mediation process shall be confidential and shall be not, which actually might be a repeat.

2419
04:42:27,500 --> 04:43:06,500
but the next in line eight excuse me nine parties to mediation process shall not be required to sign a confidential confidentiality pledge or non-disclosure agreement prior to or as a condition to commencement of the mediation process which is consistent with federal law if there is an agreement reached in the mediation process then according according to federal law, you can then, as part of that agreement, indicate that the discussions within the mediation process are confidential.

2420
04:43:06,500 --> 04:43:11,500
But you cannot require that going into the mediation process.

2421
04:43:11,500 --> 04:44:04,500
And I know that there is a current form that the department has that in the agreement to go into mediation, it has one provision in there that was questioned because it says that discussions are confidential and I think that that might be the source of some problems so to be consistent with federal law I don't think that that should be in there the agreement about confidentiality is signed as part of the agreement if there is an agreement made in the mediation process there was another section in the amendment that related to special education that I did not think was necessary anymore.

2422
04:44:04,500 --> 04:44:08,500
So that was removed in this amendment, 961.

2423
04:44:08,500 --> 04:44:10,500
Excuse me, yeah, 961.

2424
04:44:10,500 --> 04:44:33,000
So I think that those are basically the changes that were made in this amendment represent porter or excuse me hold on one second there was a second uh do you have any uh discussion mr this is just the amendment oh that was you.

2425
04:44:33,000 --> 04:44:35,000
Thank you, Mr.

2426
04:44:35,000 --> 04:44:38,000
Chair, and thank you, Representative Cordelli.

2427
04:44:38,000 --> 04:44:50,000
I was not able to be here for the original hearing last week, so I didn't get a chance to ask my question here.

2428
04:44:50,000 --> 04:45:22,500
I'm wondering if you can tell me when the reason why, this seems like a pretty big change to the way things have gone on, and I'm wondering if you did this in consultation with members of the special ed community or organizations that work with those folks, and if they felt that these changes were needed and that's why you brought forth this bill.

2429
04:45:22,500 --> 04:45:30,000
I brought this forward after hearing from members of the special ed community Thank you.

2430
04:45:30,000 --> 04:45:52,500
I brought this forward after hearing from members of the special ed community during the fall study committee that we had, and a number of problems that we heard from parents in that that I tried to address in here were, one the non-disclosure provisions.

2431
04:45:52,500 --> 04:46:03,000
Two, I think the main other one was intimidation was felt by parents with the presence of lawyers in the IEP.

2432
04:46:03,000 --> 04:46:06,500
And so that's in here as well.

2433
04:46:06,500 --> 04:46:46,000
and the amendment relates to federal law in terms of who are valid participants in the IEP meeting and I do not believe that lawyers in any way qualify as participants according to IDEA de a years ago my husband worked as a parent advocate from the for the parent information center which helped parents work through issues related to IEP and special ed and I'm wondering if you worked with that organization while you were bringing this forward.

2434
04:46:46,000 --> 04:46:48,000
Sorry.

2435
04:46:48,000 --> 04:46:53,000
I have talked to someone in the Parent Information Center.

2436
04:46:53,000 --> 04:46:55,000
Not the organization itself.

2437
04:46:55,000 --> 04:46:57,000
Just one person.

2438
04:46:57,000 --> 04:47:01,000
One person who is a parent advocate there.

2439
04:47:01,000 --> 04:47:03,000
Thank you.

2440
04:47:03,000 --> 04:47:05,000
Further discussion?

2441
04:47:05,000 --> 04:47:07,000
Yes, Representative Mullen.

2442
04:47:07,000 --> 04:47:09,000
Thank you, Mr.

2443
04:47:09,000 --> 04:47:13,000
Chair, and thank you for taking my question.

2444
04:47:13,000 --> 04:47:25,000
Representative Cordelli, as you know, I sat on that study committee with you, which was the sort of handheld piece to House Bill 581.

2445
04:47:25,000 --> 04:47:52,500
That study committee's recommendation was basically for a performance audit, and that audit has not been completed yet because the request, the report was filed November 1, and though I have spoken to Senator Reagan about it, and I understand that the scope of that audit has gotten broader since we met as a committee.

2446
04:47:52,500 --> 04:48:04,500
This seems, I know that we requested a side-by-side at the hearing, and the side-by-side is a volume of information in and of itself.

2447
04:48:04,500 --> 04:48:20,000
And now in the 11th hour, and that's no fault of your own, Representative Cordelli, you are not in charge of whether or not today is March 7th or March 17th.

2448
04:48:20,000 --> 04:48:23,500
So I won't hang that on you.

2449
04:48:23,500 --> 04:48:25,500
But for this to...

2450
04:48:25,500 --> 04:48:28,000
Yes, yes, here it comes.

2451
04:48:28,000 --> 04:49:08,000
So for this amendment to come in today when we have already mentioned about 100 times that we're under the gun and that things requiring lengthy discussions and close examination and how are we going to accommodate that and make room for it, is there any easy way for this document to now be compared to the side-by-side so that members of this committee and anybody watching would actually be able to say, this is in and that is out.

2452
04:49:08,000 --> 04:49:59,500
I mean, I know a fair amount about special education, and I don't feel that I have the adequate time right now to look at this amendment and make any kind of a cognizant judgment about what's what's good about it and what I might not agree with thank you yeah I put together this amendment based on the public hearing we had on the 25th and it was not completed by OLS until I think after maybe some of the side-by-side work was done by by our assistant director is everybody aware that you do have the side-by-side handed to you today?

2453
04:49:59,500 --> 04:50:03,000
That was for the, yes, exactly right.

2454
04:50:03,000 --> 04:50:07,500
But that information has been provided by Jennifer Fore.

2455
04:50:07,500 --> 04:50:09,500
Representative Tanner?

2456
04:50:09,500 --> 04:50:15,000
I can't express how much I really agree with Representative Mullen.

2457
04:50:15,000 --> 04:50:22,000
I, as a classroom teacher, didn't have the ins and outs of special education.

2458
04:50:22,000 --> 04:50:31,500
I was involved in some of the meetings, and certainly from being on this committee committee I know some.

2459
04:50:31,500 --> 04:50:43,500
But I am just overwhelmed with the information not only in the packet from Gen 4, but then the amendment that we recently had.

2460
04:50:43,500 --> 04:50:46,500
And I've been talking with Ms.

2461
04:50:46,500 --> 04:50:51,000
Dunham in the audience when we've had some breaks.

2462
04:50:51,000 --> 04:50:56,000
And I know she is like right up on things.

2463
04:50:56,000 --> 04:51:03,000
And she has some concerns about the amendment and also about the comparison sheet.

2464
04:51:03,000 --> 04:51:42,000
So, you know, I would love to have the ability to look at these things and also the ability to have some people who work with us day in and day out and are experts in the field, or at least they're really up on it, to come and talk to us about this rather than, I'd feel terrible voting on this and then having some unintended consequences or maybe some intended consequences that I didn't agree with.

2465
04:51:42,000 --> 04:51:53,000
So, you know, I know we're rushing, trying to rush through things, but I don't think this is the place to rush.

2466
04:51:53,000 --> 04:51:59,000
The side-by-side, which we got from Jen, is 17 pages in length.

2467
04:51:59,000 --> 04:52:02,500
We know that we did have that.

2468
04:52:02,500 --> 04:52:05,500
I was on that subcommittee also.

2469
04:52:05,500 --> 04:52:11,000
I worked with Representative Cordelli and Representative Mullen and John Reagan.

2470
04:52:11,000 --> 04:52:22,500
And we do know we've asked for a performance audit, which I think we're all looking forward to seeing the results of that.

2471
04:52:22,500 --> 04:52:27,000
Because there was a need for a performance audit.

2472
04:52:27,000 --> 04:52:29,000
There's absolutely no question.

2473
04:52:29,000 --> 04:52:31,500
We all concur on that.

2474
04:52:31,500 --> 04:53:08,000
So I guess we have to make a decision here whether do we have enough information or understanding of all this that we can move forward at this time or is this a a concern an area of education which is extremely important that we put it into some kind of a study the only option we have is interim study right now but i i don't believe it should be at all.

2475
04:53:08,000 --> 04:53:12,000
This thing should not be done that way.

2476
04:53:12,000 --> 04:53:19,500
This has real implications for students and parents, school districts, special ed teachers, all involved.

2477
04:53:19,500 --> 04:53:23,000
And it's very, very complex, believe me.

2478
04:53:23,000 --> 04:53:27,500
It's mind-boggling in terms of how special ed works.

2479
04:53:27,500 --> 04:53:40,500
so Representative Cordelli do you have any suggestions as to how you might want to see this It's mind-boggling in terms of how special ed works.

2480
04:53:40,500 --> 04:53:50,000
So, Representative Cordelli, do you have any suggestions as how you might want to see this treated right now?

2481
04:53:50,000 --> 04:53:57,000
My preference would be ought to pass, but I understand what the representative said.

2482
04:53:57,000 --> 04:54:09,000
There are some shifts in this, in that rulemaking in the past has gone well beyond state and federal law without any legislative input.

2483
04:54:09,000 --> 04:54:19,500
And to me, that is a huge problem, especially when it deviates so drastically in such an important area for kids.

2484
04:54:19,500 --> 04:54:30,500
And I think it's important that we address issues when parents are feeling intimidated by going in to try and get services.

2485
04:54:30,500 --> 04:54:39,000
And also when they're forced to sign documents that appear to be in conflict with federal law.

2486
04:54:39,000 --> 04:54:47,000
But I would be willing to withdraw my motion and offer a motion of interim study.

2487
04:54:47,000 --> 04:54:51,000
But I definitely intend to pursue this area.

2488
04:54:51,000 --> 04:54:53,000
Representative Mullen.

2489
04:54:53,000 --> 04:54:55,000
Thank you, Mr.

2490
04:54:55,000 --> 04:54:57,000
Chair.

2491
04:54:57,000 --> 04:55:05,500
Representative Cordelli, I agree with you that there are areas that are necessary to be looked at.

2492
04:55:05,500 --> 04:55:14,500
We heard from parents who deserve not only to have an opportunity to speak but to be heard.

2493
04:55:14,500 --> 04:55:47,000
But as is the case with Rome not being built in a day, I just think that if we're cautious as we move ahead and make sure just that everyone who is voting on these measures has a thorough and confident understanding of what they're voting on, then I think it's going to make it a whole lot easier to get consensus on these issues.

2494
04:55:47,000 --> 04:55:49,000
Further discussion?

2495
04:55:49,000 --> 04:55:51,000
Yes, Representative Luna.

2496
04:55:51,000 --> 04:55:53,500
Thank you very much, Mr.

2497
04:55:53,500 --> 04:55:55,500
Chair.

2498
04:55:55,500 --> 04:56:22,500
I agree with much of what's been said with respect to the process that this should go through in terms of making sure that everybody knows what they're voting on and that we're at least supporting something that's robust and durable and will improve the opportunities for students and the access for their parents.

2499
04:56:22,500 --> 04:56:33,000
So I would support moving this to interim study to give us time to really understand this, I think, much better.

2500
04:56:33,000 --> 04:56:35,500
Like it's been said, Ms.

2501
04:56:35,500 --> 04:56:50,000
Forrest's side-by-side is 17 pages long on this, so there's a lot to digest here, and there's a lot we can get wrong, or at least with unintentional consequences.

2502
04:56:50,000 --> 04:56:57,000
I hate to overuse that term, but we can't afford to get this wrong.

2503
04:56:57,000 --> 04:57:19,000
So I would support us if we could reverse the current motion and move something in a process that includes interim study and includes a lot of the groups that I think have indicated that they'd like to be involved in the discussion here.

2504
04:57:19,000 --> 04:57:21,000
Representative Ford.

2505
04:57:21,000 --> 04:57:23,000
Thank you.

2506
04:57:23,000 --> 04:57:25,500
They didn't have any information.

2507
04:57:25,500 --> 04:57:32,000
And so for me, these are all niceties we're talking about right now.

2508
04:57:32,000 --> 04:57:35,000
Oh, I want the final word.

2509
04:57:35,000 --> 04:57:43,000
I want to dot the I and cross the T and all that sort of thing.

2510
04:57:43,000 --> 04:58:05,000
But when it comes down to a school system which does not understand it has to obey the law in implementing these, they're going to go on disobeying the law to so-called give the person, the family, whoever's involved their right in an IEP.

2511
04:58:05,000 --> 04:58:12,000
And I think to a certain extent, we're just pushing it down the road.

2512
04:58:12,000 --> 04:58:14,500
It's more urgent than that.

2513
04:58:14,500 --> 04:58:22,000
People's lives are being very much messed up by their failure to follow this procedure.

2514
04:58:22,000 --> 04:58:38,500
So I don't know whether it means we should go ahead at this point or interim study, but if we interim study, I would urgently request that we interim study in a hurry.

2515
04:58:38,500 --> 04:58:40,500
Thank you.

2516
04:58:40,500 --> 04:58:45,500
Well, if you interim study, let me explain that process.

2517
04:58:45,500 --> 04:58:55,500
We will have to issue a report by November of this year, and it's either up or down with legislation.

2518
04:58:55,500 --> 04:59:26,000
And our thoughts are maybe concerns or recommendations to go along nothing will come out of it until a bill is put forward following this bill other words this is just a catalyst for study interim study for many many bills is just like represent bones often times said a soft polite way of saying it's not going to go anywhere.

2519
04:59:26,000 --> 04:59:35,000
We've had several interim studies committees which have been very instrumental in bringing about change in other topics.

2520
04:59:35,000 --> 04:59:38,000
We've done that with concussion injury.

2521
04:59:38,000 --> 04:59:42,000
We've done it with a number of areas.

2522
04:59:42,000 --> 04:59:46,000
We did it with dual and concurrent enrollment.

2523
04:59:46,000 --> 04:59:59,500
So if we have people that are actively wanting to be on a study committee and put in the time, it means you don't work during July.

2524
04:59:59,500 --> 05:00:04,000
We're not allowed to come in here in July.

2525
05:00:04,000 --> 05:00:08,500
But that is so in terms of interim studies.

2526
05:00:08,500 --> 05:00:21,000
I know the commission we were on last year, we worked almost every week, twice or three times a week, and that was just tiring.

2527
05:00:21,000 --> 05:00:30,500
So before we go interim study route, I want to make sure there's people who actively participate on it.

2528
05:00:30,500 --> 05:00:38,000
Secondly, we're looking at another concurrent report going on right now where the performance audit.

2529
05:00:38,000 --> 05:00:56,500
And I don't know any – I haven't been given a date myself from John Reagan when that should be done or from those people as well, but I understand, as I heard earlier, it's all expanding.

2530
05:00:56,500 --> 05:01:39,000
So that means there's going to be some meat and depth come out of that, and will result in legislation as well I understand I sat on this committee here and I saw the parents come in and we all did and we're all very very concerned and this may or may not help I can't answer that so Representative Cordelli you know I think that there's several ways of doing it, and I'm kind of siding now with let's go forward with the study.

2531
05:01:39,000 --> 05:01:42,500
But I'd like to have your recommendation.

2532
05:01:42,500 --> 05:01:46,500
You're the one that's put forth this bill.

2533
05:01:46,500 --> 05:01:48,500
Yeah.

2534
05:01:48,500 --> 05:01:52,500
As you mentioned, there is the performance audit.

2535
05:01:52,500 --> 05:02:31,500
The last I heard was that they were going to have the scope of work done this month so when they would actually start the performance audit I think would be sometime in the third quarter there is however a bill over in the Senate that passed unanimously out of the Education Committee has bipartisan support of the Senate and was on the consent calendar, passed on the consent calendar that will be coming to us after crossover.

2536
05:02:31,500 --> 05:03:21,500
and the the purpose of that bill is to create an independent office of the advocate for special education so it'll be set up similar to there's an office of child advocate right now this would be an office of special ed advocate and it has a full slate of bipartisan senators as sponsors on the bill so that will be coming over to us and that might be something if we pass it out of the house and get it signed by the governor might provide more rapid relief to some issues than waiting for another bill next year.

2537
05:03:21,500 --> 05:03:24,500
I think that's a strong recommendation.

2538
05:03:24,500 --> 05:03:40,500
I think that's very logical that we use that vehicle as an instrument to accomplish what we're trying to accomplish here if we don't have something that comes out of the audit.

2539
05:03:40,500 --> 05:03:51,000
Or hopefully we would and we'd be able to use it as the vehicle to get the desired end we want.

2540
05:03:51,000 --> 05:04:21,500
So at this point in time then, Representative Cordelli, are you willing to pull pull your motion yes I withdraw my ought to pass motion and offer an emotion of interim study and the seconds willing to pull okay so now we have a motion on the table for interim study put forth by represent Cordelli and second by represented Porter.

2541
05:04:21,500 --> 05:04:26,000
We've had a little bit of discussion on that.

2542
05:04:26,000 --> 05:04:33,000
Is there any further discussion from the maker of the motion or the second?

2543
05:04:33,000 --> 05:04:35,000
None.

2544
05:04:35,000 --> 05:04:37,000
None.

2545
05:04:37,000 --> 05:04:41,000
So Representative Nelson, are you up with us?

2546
05:04:41,000 --> 05:04:43,000
Yep.

2547
05:04:43,000 --> 05:04:45,000
Let's go for it.

2548
05:04:45,000 --> 05:04:47,000
Good.

2549
05:04:47,000 --> 05:04:49,000
Representative Cordelli.

2550
05:04:49,000 --> 05:04:51,000
Yes.

2551
05:04:51,000 --> 05:04:53,000
Representative Lang.

2599
05:06:29,000 --> 05:06:31,000

2613
05:06:57,000 --> 05:06:59,000
Yes.

2614
05:06:59,000 --> 05:07:01,000
Yes.

2615
05:07:01,000 --> 05:07:03,000
Yes.

2616
05:07:03,000 --> 05:07:05,000
Yes.

2617
05:07:05,000 --> 05:07:07,000
Okay.

2618
05:07:07,000 --> 05:07:09,000
Consent.

2619
05:07:09,000 --> 05:07:11,000
Okay.

2620
05:07:11,000 --> 05:07:13,000
Okay.

2621
05:07:13,000 --> 05:07:15,000
Okay.

2622
05:07:15,000 --> 05:07:17,000
Okay.

2623
05:07:17,000 --> 05:07:19,000
Okay.

2624
05:07:19,000 --> 05:07:21,000
Okay.

2625
05:07:21,000 --> 05:07:23,000
Okay.

2626
05:07:23,000 --> 05:07:25,000
Okay.

2627
05:07:25,000 --> 05:07:27,000
Okay.

2628
05:07:27,000 --> 05:07:29,000
Okay.

2629
05:07:29,000 --> 05:07:31,000
Okay.

2630
05:07:31,000 --> 05:07:33,000
Thank you.

2631
05:07:33,000 --> 05:07:35,000
Okay.

2632
05:07:35,000 --> 05:07:37,000
Okay.

2633
05:07:37,000 --> 05:07:39,000
Yeah.

2634
05:07:39,000 --> 05:07:42,000
So we could do, you know.

2635
05:07:42,000 --> 05:07:46,500
I'd like to get 1671 taken care of today.

2636
05:07:46,500 --> 05:07:50,000
Get some of the hard bills done.

2637
05:07:50,000 --> 05:07:59,000
Okay, we're going to go do 1671 at this time relative to the content of an adequate education.

2638
05:07:59,000 --> 05:08:01,500
There's an amendment right here.

2639
05:08:01,500 --> 05:08:03,500
I have 18-0.

2640
05:08:03,500 --> 05:08:08,000
Did you get one with three holes in it?

2641
05:08:08,000 --> 05:08:10,000
Yep.

2642
05:08:10,000 --> 05:08:12,000
Let's go that way.

2643
05:08:12,000 --> 05:08:14,000
16-71?

2644
05:08:14,000 --> 05:08:17,000
I don't go back that far.

2645
05:08:17,000 --> 05:08:19,000
Yeah, that's right.

2646
05:08:19,000 --> 05:08:31,500
There were a whole slug going this way too Okay, I'd like to go ahead so we can save some time and use it wisely.

2647
05:08:31,500 --> 05:08:38,000
1671 is a bill that deals with the content of an adequate education.

2648
05:08:38,000 --> 05:08:43,500
And the amendment you received here replaces all of the bill.

2649
05:08:43,500 --> 05:08:48,500
So you might as well be looking at the amendment.

2650
05:08:48,500 --> 05:08:57,500
And I'll walk you through this amendment right now, the way it reads and the way it is.

2651
05:08:57,500 --> 05:09:03,500
It has lines on it, so I'll go down by the lines.

2652
05:09:03,500 --> 05:09:05,500
Lines 5 through 8.

2653
05:09:05,500 --> 05:09:09,500
There's two changes in lines 5 from 8.

2654
05:09:09,500 --> 05:09:13,000
That's original language right out of statute.

2655
05:09:13,000 --> 05:09:19,500
But the changes are where it says beginning in the school year 2008-2009.

2656
05:09:19,500 --> 05:09:23,500
And we've inserted and for each year thereafter.

2657
05:09:23,500 --> 05:09:26,500
So it's inclusive going through now.

2658
05:09:26,500 --> 05:09:42,500
Okay, the specific criteria and substantive educational program that deliver the opportunity for an adequate education shall be defined and identified as the school approval standards in the following learning domain areas.

2659
05:09:42,500 --> 05:09:46,500
The added language in that is learning domain.

2660
05:09:46,500 --> 05:09:50,500
Core is gone in the learning domain areas.

2661
05:09:50,500 --> 05:09:55,500
And then below that, you'll see items 1 through 10.

2662
05:09:55,500 --> 05:09:57,500
These are those areas.

2663
05:09:57,500 --> 05:10:00,000
English, language, arts, and reading.

2664
05:10:00,000 --> 05:10:04,000
That's the way it is now in law.

2665
05:10:04,000 --> 05:10:06,000
Mathematics.

2666
05:10:06,000 --> 05:10:10,000
That's the way it is now in law.

2667
05:10:10,000 --> 05:10:14,500
Mathematics, that's the way it is now in law.

2668
05:10:14,500 --> 05:10:17,000
Science, that's currently in law.

2669
05:10:17,000 --> 05:11:26,000
Social studies is in law, and we've added following social studies, including civics, government, economics, geography, and history, those five major domains within the area of social studies 16 or excuse me online 13 arts education but that's also been changed it's never before included music which is definitely a area of knowledge and skills that our children should know so it's now arts education including music line 14 is unchanged world languages line 15 which read health education analysis health and wellness education that's as I mentioned earlier today is reflective of what we have currently in the ED 306 including a policy for violations of RRCA 126K colon 8 1a that is in law right now that deals about disseminating cigarettes and things to students that's not what we want we We want to eliminate smoking.

2670
05:11:26,000 --> 05:11:28,000
So that's in law.

2671
05:11:28,000 --> 05:11:30,000
No change.

2672
05:11:30,000 --> 05:11:32,500
Physical education on line 17.

2673
05:11:32,500 --> 05:11:34,500
No change there.

2674
05:11:34,500 --> 05:11:36,500
18.

2675
05:11:36,500 --> 05:11:41,000
Where it says engineering and technologies in law now.

2676
05:11:41,000 --> 05:11:43,500
It's added including technology applications.

2677
05:11:43,500 --> 05:11:45,500
The use of that.

2678
05:11:45,500 --> 05:12:39,000
So that's where we're burying the computer sciences now because computer sciences is something that's really taught in higher ed and what we're doing is computer now is a tool which we use for researching for communicating in language arts for for writing or that way for spreadsheets etc etc so that came about as a result of my working with one of the reps right here on this particular two of the reps which are on the ones not here right now line 10 introduces personal finance literacy which has been requested for years by like mentioned the Bankers Association and business industry is Thank you.

2679
05:12:39,000 --> 05:12:52,000
Line 10 introduces personal finance literacy, which has been requested for years by, like I mentioned, the Bankers Association and Business Industry Association of this state.

2680
05:12:52,000 --> 05:13:05,000
And it's been an item on the floor of this house for many, many times since I've been in the house for the last 14 years.

2681
05:13:05,000 --> 05:13:14,000
Going on down, this section right here, 20, this is on line 20, and it's item B, 1B.

2682
05:13:14,000 --> 05:13:22,000
Teachers shall use academic and applied instruction to teach the learning domain areas under paragraph A.

2683
05:13:22,000 --> 05:13:25,000
So it's the learning domain areas.

2684
05:13:25,000 --> 05:13:28,000
It's not any core areas, anything.

2685
05:13:28,000 --> 05:13:33,500
The following skills shall be integrated into the learning domain areas.

2686
05:13:33,500 --> 05:13:37,000
Digital literacy, that we need to do.

2687
05:13:37,000 --> 05:13:41,500
Digital literacy was something we had in HB 242.

2688
05:13:41,500 --> 05:13:45,500
And logic and rhetoric, thinking and communication skills.

2689
05:13:45,500 --> 05:13:56,500
Then going down to part two, the new subparagraph here you see in line 25, under definitions, okay, we have applied learning.

2690
05:13:56,500 --> 05:14:07,000
Applied learning means an education approach whereby students have the opportunity to directly engage in learning activities using knowledge and skills.

2691
05:14:07,000 --> 05:14:11,500
logic there that was in 242 as is that.

2692
05:14:11,500 --> 05:14:14,500
That's just a duplication from there.

2693
05:14:14,500 --> 05:14:22,000
And rhetoric means the skill of speaking and writing as means of communication or persuasion.

2694
05:14:22,000 --> 05:14:31,500
You notice that rhetoric says F because A, under this section, is the minimum standards for public school approval.

2695
05:14:31,500 --> 05:14:33,500
That's still there.

2696
05:14:33,500 --> 05:14:35,500
That's still there.

2697
05:14:35,500 --> 05:14:41,000
B is the academic standards, which is in statute right now.

2698
05:14:41,000 --> 05:14:51,000
It means what a student should know and be able to do in a course or at each grade level.

2699
05:14:51,000 --> 05:14:53,500
That's in law right now.

2700
05:14:53,500 --> 05:15:14,500
As the definition of minimum standards is, minimum standards for public school approval means the applicable criteria that public schools and public academies shall meet in order to be approved school as adopted by the State Board of Education through administrative rules.

2701
05:15:14,500 --> 05:15:16,500
That is in law.

2702
05:15:16,500 --> 05:15:21,500
It's not here because there's no sense to repeat it.

2703
05:15:21,500 --> 05:15:24,500
So A and B and C.

2704
05:15:24,500 --> 05:15:33,500
You notice there's no C either because C is already in law, and that's the definition of curriculum.

2705
05:15:33,500 --> 05:15:42,000
Curriculum means the lessons and academic content taught in school or in a specific course or program.

2706
05:15:42,000 --> 05:15:49,500
That's in law, so there's no need for the writers to put it in here.

2707
05:15:49,500 --> 05:15:51,500
It will be there.

2708
05:15:51,500 --> 05:15:53,500
It is there.

2709
05:15:53,500 --> 05:15:59,000
So then we add in the logic, the rhetoric, et cetera.

2710
05:15:59,000 --> 05:17:15,000
Going on to the back on page two, there's another section, accountability for the opportunity of an adequate education we have various sections when in statute right we have the delivery of an adequate education with a costing of an adequate education we have accountability for an opportunity for an adequate education this is amending to read as follows the language all remains the same a school shall demonstrate that it provides the opportunity for an adequate education for the school approval standards as set forth and rules adopted by Department of Education the following areas that's in law and you can see English language arts and reading that's not bold type because that's in mathematics science and then what we do is we replicate everything is up on 1a so we're having accountability accountability for all those content areas which have been there and those several areas which they've been modified.

2711
05:17:15,000 --> 05:17:53,000
And lastly, on line 21 on page 2, where it says application, personal finance literacy, which we dealt with today already in studies, the requirement in RSA 193E2A1A10 that is the requirement on the other side which is item 10 personal finance literacy on page 1 references back there as inserted by this act for an adequate education to include the learning domain area of personal finance literacy shall not apply until the 2023-24 school year.

2712
05:17:53,000 --> 05:18:09,500
So it gives one year for everybody to gear up for how we're going to integrate, how we're going to teach, how we're going to have that in our curriculum, personal finance literacy.

2713
05:18:09,500 --> 05:18:14,500
This act shall take effect 60 days after its passage.

2714
05:18:14,500 --> 05:18:18,000
So basically, there's no change in format.

2715
05:18:18,000 --> 05:18:23,500
It doesn't mess with the minimum standards for public school approval.

2716
05:18:23,500 --> 05:18:40,000
In fact, it supports that, but it even strengthens those areas in the content, which we consider part of our adequate education, and adds in things like music, wellness, and personal finance literacy.

2717
05:18:40,000 --> 05:18:43,000
So that concludes this entire bill.

2718
05:18:43,000 --> 05:18:46,000
It's not that lengthy a bill.

2719
05:18:46,000 --> 05:18:52,000
It's one which I think just adds to what is that content.

2720
05:18:52,000 --> 05:19:03,500
And doesn't speak to core, doesn't talk about breaking anything out, doesn't say that public school approval is needed to have these courses.

2721
05:19:03,500 --> 05:19:06,500
No, it's all part of adequacy.

2722
05:19:06,500 --> 05:19:29,500
And if you look at the statutory judicial references under this section of law, you will see that there was a court statement made by the Claremont decisions back in the 1990s where it says that an adequate education is not merely reading, writing, and arithmetic.

2723
05:19:29,500 --> 05:19:39,500
It's all these areas which go beyond and strengthen the knowledge and skills have to walk out of school with.

2724
05:19:39,500 --> 05:19:49,500
So hopefully we'll move this thing forward and strengthen what we identify as an adequate content of an adequate education.

2725
05:19:49,500 --> 05:19:51,500
Thank you.

2726
05:19:51,500 --> 05:19:54,000
They take care of that.

2727
05:19:54,000 --> 05:20:03,000
All the stuff where you see they left an S off or something like that's taken care of.

2728
05:20:03,000 --> 05:20:05,000
When it's reviewed, yes.

2729
05:20:05,000 --> 05:20:08,000
If you keep signing the law.

2730
05:20:08,000 --> 05:20:19,000
After it passes the Senate, then it has to go back for review by the President of the Senate and the Speaker.

2731
05:20:19,000 --> 05:20:22,000
They checked all this stuff out.

2732
05:20:22,000 --> 05:20:26,000
Okay, do you want me to go ahead?

2733
05:20:26,000 --> 05:20:28,000
What's that?

2734
05:20:28,000 --> 05:20:30,500
I'm not really running that.

2735
05:20:30,500 --> 05:20:32,500
I mean.

2736
05:20:32,500 --> 05:20:36,500
Do you want me to take the chair?

2737
05:20:36,500 --> 05:20:55,500
mean well let me let you once you take the chair and that way there won't be any conflict of interest okay we're in discussion any further comments on the amendment correct there's no motion on the table.

2738
05:20:55,500 --> 05:20:57,500
Correct.

2739
05:20:57,500 --> 05:20:59,500
There's no motion.

2740
05:20:59,500 --> 05:21:01,500
Sure.

2741
05:21:01,500 --> 05:21:05,000
I have a question on the amendment.

2742
05:21:05,000 --> 05:21:07,000
Thank you, Mr.

2743
05:21:07,000 --> 05:21:09,000
Chair.

2744
05:21:09,000 --> 05:21:21,500
On page two of the amendment, section three, where we actually sort of ratchet into a different part of the law, so it's the accountability.

2745
05:21:21,500 --> 05:21:28,500
Would the additions to the 12 items here require new rulemaking from the department?

2746
05:21:28,500 --> 05:21:32,000
For each of those school approval standards.

2747
05:21:32,000 --> 05:21:35,000
If you're asking it to me.

2748
05:21:35,000 --> 05:21:37,000
Yeah.

2749
05:21:37,000 --> 05:21:48,000
I know that when we modified, the last time we did this is when we modified it with computer technology and that.

2750
05:21:48,000 --> 05:21:50,000
So that was 2018.

2751
05:21:50,000 --> 05:21:52,000
Yeah.

2752
05:21:52,000 --> 05:21:55,000
I'm just looking at the annotation.

2753
05:21:55,000 --> 05:21:58,000
Yeah, and that's when that occurred.

2754
05:21:58,000 --> 05:22:06,500
But like on line 6 on page 2, for the school approval standards set forth in rules.

2755
05:22:06,500 --> 05:22:12,000
So each of these 12 standards have rules written around them.

2756
05:22:12,000 --> 05:22:14,500
That's how I'm reading this.

2757
05:22:14,500 --> 05:22:21,500
Well, health and wellness is already in rules, even though it wasn't in statute.

2758
05:22:21,500 --> 05:22:29,000
Right, but it's got to be in the school approval standard set forth in rules.

2759
05:22:29,000 --> 05:22:33,000
I'm just wondering if there's rulemaking that's going.

2760
05:22:33,000 --> 05:22:37,000
I think the board has that rulemaking authority.

2761
05:22:37,000 --> 05:22:40,500
I'm sure they've got the rulemaking authority.

2762
05:22:40,500 --> 05:22:47,000
Elsewhere in law, not here, because that would be elsewhere within this statute.

2763
05:22:47,000 --> 05:22:49,000
Yes, yes.

2764
05:22:49,000 --> 05:23:39,500
But in order to comply with this statute, they would have to go through rulemaking to set the standards that would expand on these areas to include civics, government, economic, geography, history, to include music, add wellness to Standard 7, add tech applications to Standard 9 nine personal financial literacy which is completely new would be standard ten school year requirements I imagine that's the days and hours that that's that's already a requirement for yeah right within that's already within the minimum standards and that that's nothing new right that's nothing new that's already a requirement within the minimum standards.

2765
05:23:39,500 --> 05:23:41,500
And that's nothing new.

2766
05:23:41,500 --> 05:23:43,500
Right, that's nothing new.

2767
05:23:43,500 --> 05:23:45,500
That's already there.

2768
05:23:45,500 --> 05:23:47,500
Right.

2769
05:23:47,500 --> 05:23:49,500
And minimum credit's required.

2770
05:23:49,500 --> 05:23:51,500
That's nothing new.

2771
05:23:51,500 --> 05:23:53,500
That's already there.

2772
05:23:53,500 --> 05:23:59,500
But these other areas where there's bold, there would be new rulemaking.

2773
05:23:59,500 --> 05:24:11,500
I can remember when we amended the fourth year of mathematics, the way we did that, we required three years of math classes specific.

2774
05:24:11,500 --> 05:24:30,000
Then we, when I worked at that time with Paul whoather, who was the Deputy Commissioner of Education at that time with Virginia Berry, we recognized that this state needed kids for not getting mathematics as seniors.

2775
05:24:30,000 --> 05:24:37,000
So we required that you shall take mathematics every year you're in a school.

2776
05:24:37,000 --> 05:24:39,000
This is in statute.

2777
05:24:39,000 --> 05:25:05,500
The fourth year, it's done through embedded mathematics in one of your learning domain areas that's approved by the local school board so that that we did without having to jump into this rule business and it's subsequently been added in by believe, the rules are done upon every time we change something.

2778
05:25:05,500 --> 05:25:09,500
So they have the authority to do that.

2779
05:25:09,500 --> 05:25:11,500
It will be done.

2780
05:25:11,500 --> 05:25:57,500
But we didn't write when we put in the embedded math course something specific, oh, you're going to have to do this now by rules that's already there within law I guess I read RSA 193 e colon 2 dash a under section 4 It talks about the minimum standards for public school approval blah blah blah in paragraph 1 Which is all the standards you just changed in the last sentence of that line talks about the fact that the Doe has rulemaking authority to set everything set in chapter 1.

2781
05:25:57,500 --> 05:26:10,000
So if you change Chapter 1, they already have in law rulemaking authority to deal under Section 4A to deal with changes to Chapter 1.

2782
05:26:10,000 --> 05:26:12,000
And that's correct.

2783
05:26:12,000 --> 05:26:23,000
And the changes which we're doing here are areas within these learning domain areas, with the exception of the personal finance, literacy.

2784
05:26:23,000 --> 05:26:34,000
Everything else is we've had arts, education, always understood that that could be theater, it could be music, it could be whatever.

2785
05:26:34,000 --> 05:26:43,000
I think it's time, it's my personal feeling that I had a music teacher in my buildings, always.

2786
05:26:43,000 --> 05:27:40,000
And music was one of the preps that teachers got, but it was was also something the kids needed and in some of the elementary classrooms music was taught ongoing by the classroom teacher that's why an elementary teachers required to take a methods course in the teaching of music I had to do it and I can't hit a tune or anything but except in the shower so oh go ahead I'm not quite yes I'm sorry go ahead representative Hobson thank you thank you for taking my question one of the issues that keeps coming up in emails that I'm getting about this bill is the funding of domains or content areas.

2787
05:27:40,000 --> 05:27:45,500
And I wondered if you could speak to that for me.

2788
05:27:45,500 --> 05:27:47,500
I can do that.

2789
05:27:47,500 --> 05:27:49,500
Yes.

2790
05:27:49,500 --> 05:28:05,500
In the bill as introduced, on the first page of the bill as it's introduced, there on line 13 through 15, there's language, which has really sparked a fire throughout this state.

2791
05:28:05,500 --> 05:28:27,000
It said, applied instruction, which deepens the student's understanding of core knowledge, learning domains, and work-study skills required for an adequate education, shall further integrate the following areas of applied learning or additional areas of study as determined by a local school district.

2792
05:28:27,000 --> 05:28:33,000
So folks are saying, hey, we're going to have to determine this.

2793
05:28:33,000 --> 05:28:40,500
Does that mean we're going to have to pay for this or cost for it?

2794
05:28:40,500 --> 05:28:46,000
And that language does not appear in this amendment at all.

2795
05:28:46,000 --> 05:28:50,500
The amendment is simply language that's already in law.

2796
05:28:50,500 --> 05:28:59,500
So as it's written now, this becomes all of it becomes part of content of an adequate education.

2797
05:28:59,500 --> 05:29:07,500
It will further supplement and support what we're trying to do with the funding commission study.

2798
05:29:07,500 --> 05:29:09,500
Representative Mullen.

2799
05:29:09,500 --> 05:29:14,500
I don't think you're allowed to call on me, Mr.

2800
05:29:14,500 --> 05:29:16,500
Chair.

2801
05:29:16,500 --> 05:29:18,500
Okay.

2802
05:29:18,500 --> 05:29:20,500
Representative Mullen.

2803
05:29:20,500 --> 05:29:22,500
Thank you, Representative Cordelli.

2804
05:29:22,500 --> 05:29:30,500
Can I just ask a question, Representative Ladd, about your use of the phrase learning domain?

2805
05:29:30,500 --> 05:29:52,500
we counselor types when you're talking about learning domains we tend to think about the cognitive domain the affective domain the physical when you're talking about learning domains, we tend to think about the cognitive domain, the affective domain, the physical or psychomotor domain.

2806
05:29:52,500 --> 05:29:58,500
Is that a deliberate turn of phrase, this use of learning domains?

2807
05:29:58,500 --> 05:30:05,000
It's a catch-all, which combines all of the above that you just mentioned.

2808
05:30:05,000 --> 05:30:14,500
It's basically, I've always used the word subjects, but you see this in some of the judicial type decisions.

2809
05:30:14,500 --> 05:30:17,000
The use of learning domain.

2810
05:30:17,000 --> 05:30:19,000
Okay, thank you.

2811
05:30:19,000 --> 05:30:21,000
Additional, yes, Representative Hall.

2812
05:30:21,000 --> 05:30:23,500
Sorry, question for Representative Ladd.

2813
05:30:23,500 --> 05:30:42,500
I just want to make sure, and I think you brought it up initially, and I kind of missed what you said, but are you suggesting that computer science and digital literacy move up to including technology applications?

2814
05:30:42,500 --> 05:30:48,500
I mean, I noticed those were wiped out on the second page.

2815
05:30:48,500 --> 05:31:04,500
See, that was an area that was initially in this bill and in 242 last year, an area that was supposed to be integrated with all subject areas, the use of computers.

2816
05:31:04,500 --> 05:31:22,500
In the discussion I had, I don't want to mention his name, that we were seeing that the computer sciences or studies are usually a thorough study which involves intensive study at a higher education level.

2817
05:31:22,500 --> 05:31:32,000
The use of a computer, though, has now become a tool that every student needs to know how to.

2818
05:31:32,000 --> 05:32:02,500
And I'll tell you, probably their first and second third graders out there can just hop around a computer pretty well now and that is a tool and it's a tool for research for communicating etc what we need to do though is teach kids that everything on the web if you go to Wikipedia don't don't believe everything you're reading.

2819
05:32:02,500 --> 05:32:20,500
You've got to be able to discern between somebody's opinion and fact, against fact, and that's what we're doing with trying to put in logic and rhetoric, logic for thinking, you know, something that's made up.

2820
05:32:20,500 --> 05:32:35,000
So computer studies to me is something, the use of the computer is like the pen, pencil, paper, a slide rule that I was brought up with in school.

2821
05:32:35,000 --> 05:32:51,000
We didn't put the slide rule down, but I certainly had to use that when calculating, dropping in the artillery in Vietnam until we had the old tube computers come into play.

2822
05:32:51,000 --> 05:32:58,000
So it's a tool, and maybe Representative Luno can better explain computers and that.

2823
05:32:58,000 --> 05:33:02,500
He's got that type of a degree and background.

2824
05:33:02,500 --> 05:33:05,500
I use it as a tool.

2825
05:33:05,500 --> 05:33:09,500
So if I could follow up on that.

2826
05:33:09,500 --> 05:33:12,500
Well, you know, I'll be open.

2827
05:33:12,500 --> 05:33:19,500
The conversation is something that Repsoluno and I had this last weekend, was it?

2828
05:33:19,500 --> 05:33:22,500
It all flies by so quickly.

2829
05:33:22,500 --> 05:33:27,000
For me, I guess if I could follow up.

2830
05:33:27,000 --> 05:33:50,500
computer science to me is like, and I taught computers, so in middle school though, and I would have to say there was a component of computer science in middle school, and there was digital literacy, and there were technology tools, and I see those as different.

2831
05:33:50,500 --> 05:34:03,000
Computer science was where, you know, the coding, and so I think by taking it out of there, I'm not sure that it's being replaced.

2832
05:34:03,000 --> 05:34:07,500
And maybe, Representative Bruno, you could speak to that.

2833
05:34:07,500 --> 05:34:11,500
But I know we saw that as different.

2834
05:34:11,500 --> 05:34:17,500
I think computer science and computer programming are two very different things.

2835
05:34:17,500 --> 05:34:47,000
I mean, you could look at computer programming maybe as being a small subset of computer science but but really that's that's not where the you know the the mincing of terms like that obviously computer science at a third grade you know instructional level I think would be different than computer science at a master's degree instructional level.

2836
05:34:47,000 --> 05:34:57,500
But in any case, you know, I think there's probably more straightforward terms that could be used rather than computer science.

2837
05:34:57,500 --> 05:34:59,500
at K-12.

2838
05:34:59,500 --> 05:35:03,500
I think digital literacy is a good one.

2839
05:35:03,500 --> 05:35:07,000
That includes a whole lot of things.

2840
05:35:07,000 --> 05:35:12,500
Could include some basic programming, could include, obviously, use of applications.

2841
05:35:12,500 --> 05:35:16,000
I think you've got that in there.

2842
05:35:16,000 --> 05:35:48,000
I'm really, you know, I think there's some very good things in terms of what's being added into this, these, you know, I'm not quite sure of the term learning domain because I think that's a term of art that's used differently, is my understanding, but in these sort of subject areas, to use the term that Representative Ladd talked about, might be better.

2843
05:35:48,000 --> 05:35:51,500
But I guess I do have concerns.

2844
05:35:51,500 --> 05:35:59,000
I mean, I'm going to support the amendment because I think it's a huge improvement.

2845
05:35:59,000 --> 05:36:07,000
But there's a lot that goes into, I think, changing the definition of an adequate education.

2846
05:36:07,000 --> 05:36:14,000
And certainly, I think a collaborative style to develop it would be very important.

2847
05:36:14,000 --> 05:36:35,500
Given the fact that student outcomes in New Hampshire are already among the best in the country, we don't have that level of urgency that I think Representative Ford may have been alluding to earlier in terms of redefining what's an adequate education.

2848
05:36:35,500 --> 05:36:58,000
And I do have lingering concerns about what it means when we add, you know, including civics, government, economics, geography, and history, including music, including wellness, including technology applications, and then a whole new area of personal finance literacy, all of which I believe in.

2849
05:36:58,000 --> 05:37:12,500
But these are more things that, remember when the commissioner was here, where he was talking about the box, and now you're putting these things into the box, too.

2850
05:37:12,500 --> 05:37:28,500
Well, that box now has gotten a little heavier and a little more expensive, which are all things we've all been working on, school funding, but there's also a pending court case.

2851
05:37:28,500 --> 05:37:33,000
And now we're throwing more things into the box.

2852
05:37:33,000 --> 05:37:50,000
I do have lingering concerns about what the effect of changing that definition during this time is, and I think this is a good first step framework with some really good things in it.

2853
05:37:50,000 --> 05:37:54,000
I'm glad we put personal finance into studies.

2854
05:37:54,000 --> 05:38:03,000
It's not, you know, it would maybe be looked at differently than the things in the adequacy box.

2855
05:38:03,000 --> 05:38:06,000
You know, but I've got concerns.

2856
05:38:06,000 --> 05:38:18,500
And particularly, yeah, I mean, I very much appreciate the time that Rick and Mel and I spent, you know, working on this on Friday.

2857
05:38:18,500 --> 05:38:34,500
But, you know, to be fair, I think the definition of what's inside that box should go beyond the three kitchens that we were, you know, working from on that Friday afternoon.

2858
05:38:34,500 --> 05:38:58,500
And given the importance that it has not just for the 160,000 kids that are guaranteed under our Constitution with the opportunity for an adequate education, but also to the people who are representing the state in terms of making sure that New Hampshire is delivering upon that.

2859
05:38:58,500 --> 05:39:00,500
Senator Murray.

2860
05:39:00,500 --> 05:39:03,500
Thank you for taking me questions.

2861
05:39:03,500 --> 05:39:18,500
So one of the other questions I have around the concept of the learning domain area is sort of in reference to pedagogy and when we're talking about Bloom's taxonomy.

2862
05:39:18,500 --> 05:39:23,000
We then also refer to line 27, applied learning.

2863
05:39:23,000 --> 05:39:45,500
And so I'm wanting to make sure that we're consistent with the terminology here because when we're talking about Bloom's and we're talking about the interrelationship between it with the learning domain, there are several other levels above applied learning when you're talking about thought.

2864
05:39:45,500 --> 05:39:56,500
And so I'm just wanting to make sure that when we're using applied learning that that's not somehow being conflated with pedagogy.

2865
05:39:56,500 --> 05:40:00,500
I'm kind of wondering where that came from.

2866
05:40:00,500 --> 05:40:04,500
You can find pedagogy also in the statutes.

2867
05:40:04,500 --> 05:40:07,500
You can find all these terms.

2868
05:40:07,500 --> 05:40:42,000
And one of the problems is that we've used a lot of education jargon and for many folks in the business of education and I've been in it for many many many years I found that and we've tried to narrow it down we used to have educational standards instructional standards academic standards and more and then we started asking in this committee, okay, define what these things are.

2869
05:40:42,000 --> 05:40:48,500
We had to strike some of that out because a lot of overlap.

2870
05:40:48,500 --> 05:41:06,500
And the introduction of certain subjects that you see there, like in social studies, I'm looking right now in rules which have gone through JALCAR, been approved, and specify required credits for graduation and graduation competencies.

2871
05:41:06,500 --> 05:41:08,500
I'm not going to.

2872
05:41:08,500 --> 05:41:10,500
I'm looking at government.

2873
05:41:10,500 --> 05:41:13,000
I'm looking at civics, economics.

2874
05:41:13,000 --> 05:41:15,000
I'm looking at geography.

2875
05:41:15,000 --> 05:41:17,500
I'm looking at personal finance.

2876
05:41:17,500 --> 05:41:19,500
I'm looking at wellness.

2877
05:41:19,500 --> 05:41:23,000
Those are all mentioned in rule already.

2878
05:41:23,000 --> 05:41:35,500
Then we should then be supporting that through the other side of the coin that this is part of a content of an adequate education.

2879
05:41:35,500 --> 05:41:46,500
These are requirements that we have for students to graduate from a high school that are built from grades K through 12.

2880
05:41:46,500 --> 05:42:09,000
So we can get caught up in the jargon of things, but I believe that the areas which are identified here in this content are contributors to what we want the kids to come out of school with and be prepared for the next step.

2881
05:42:09,000 --> 05:42:17,500
Yeah, we can quarrel over a difference between a learning domain, a subject, or a content area.

2882
05:42:17,500 --> 05:42:25,500
I don't think it's going to make much difference in the long scheme of things here.

2883
05:42:25,500 --> 05:42:27,500
Representative Hobson.

2884
05:42:27,500 --> 05:42:29,500
Thank you, Representative Cordelli.

2885
05:42:29,500 --> 05:42:39,500
Representative Ladd, I can't remember if it was in a private conversation or if it was in our committee earlier.

2886
05:42:39,500 --> 05:42:47,000
You mentioned that the Business Industry Association and the, was it the Chamber of Commerce?

2887
05:42:47,000 --> 05:42:49,000
Well, that's the BIA.

2888
05:42:49,000 --> 05:42:51,000
Okay.

2889
05:42:51,000 --> 05:42:57,500
They had approached you and asked you to work on personal finance literacy.

2890
05:42:57,500 --> 05:43:07,000
Well, they were very excited, too, to see it in 242 and very disappointed to see 242 go down.

2891
05:43:07,000 --> 05:43:09,000
Follow-up, if you could.

2892
05:43:09,000 --> 05:43:36,500
excited to see it in 242 and very disappointed to see 242 go down speaking with employers in my district I have heard that this is an issue for graduates coming out of our schools right now and that something needs to be done so I wouldn't I would encourage you to to pass bill.

2893
05:43:36,500 --> 05:43:38,500
Thank you.

2894
05:43:38,500 --> 05:43:40,500
Representative Porter.

2895
05:43:40,500 --> 05:43:50,000
Thank you Representative Cordelli and I appreciate that this amendment much improves the bill that we had last week.

2896
05:43:50,000 --> 05:45:36,500
One of my concerns with the original bill and I think I'm having the same concern with the amendment is that there seems to have been well the commissioner told us that he didn't meet with any stakeholders to write up his original bill that the department knew what needed to be in it and just put it in there and I'm I'm concerned that this amendment also has been done you can see by the conversations we've had asking what does this mean and have you thought about this, that perhaps not having other stakeholders involved in changing this area of law, which is very important for our children getting a good education, if this needed to have some input from from other people besides state representatives in Concord and it just concerns me it's something that's very important to me that people who are actually in the field and people who are teaching people who are doing the work have a say in what is important and what in their knowledge and understanding of how learning happens and what's adequate for children is also taken into consideration so I just want to throw that out there I think it's important we include more people than just us here in this room.

2897
05:45:36,500 --> 05:45:38,500
Representative Tanner.

2898
05:45:38,500 --> 05:45:40,500
Thank you.

2899
05:45:40,500 --> 05:45:42,500
Thank you.

2900
05:45:42,500 --> 05:45:51,500
So I'm looking in this book that I, you know, wanted to make sure I had this year.

2901
05:45:51,500 --> 05:45:57,500
And under 193E2, it starts out with criteria for an adequate education.

2902
05:45:57,500 --> 05:46:19,500
And from what I'm reading in this, because it starts out with skill in and knowledge of and grounding in and sound wellness and environmental skills, it sounds more like it was drafted and represented, glad you probably know, more for competencies type thing.

2903
05:46:19,500 --> 05:46:32,000
but one of the things that I as I I'm reading through this, and then E2-A is the substantive educational content of an adequate education.

2904
05:46:32,000 --> 05:46:36,500
And that seems to be how you've listed yours.

2905
05:46:36,500 --> 05:47:11,500
but I also noticed in between here that and was well aware of the committee that was formed to study the Holocaust studies and that under criteria for an adequate education where it was more competency based number four was knowledge of civics and government economics geography history and Holocaust and genocide education to enable them to participate in the democratic process and to make informed choices as responsible citizens.

2906
05:47:11,500 --> 05:47:32,000
And I'm just wondering, I know you've got civics, government, economics, geography, and history, but I don't know if you just missed it that, I believe it was just last year that Holocaust and genocide education was added to social studies.

2907
05:47:32,000 --> 05:47:35,000
And whether that's just an oversight.

2908
05:47:35,000 --> 05:47:37,000
It's not an oversight.

2909
05:47:37,000 --> 05:47:39,000
We have a Holocaust.

2910
05:47:39,000 --> 05:47:53,000
And, of course, as you recall, when we were down and moving that bill, I was the one that spoke on behalf of Holocaust on the House floor.

2911
05:47:53,000 --> 05:48:00,000
That happened the year I think we were down south and doing the legislation.

2912
05:48:00,000 --> 05:48:19,000
In 2021, last year, we modified much of this first part in 193E2 with the language that you just moved through some of that, like the referencing knowledge of civics and government and economics and geography and history.

2913
05:48:19,000 --> 05:48:27,500
The next step was to try to incorporate this, and you see sound wellness and environmental practices.

2914
05:48:27,500 --> 05:48:40,000
That was also added in in the bill, which was kind of an omnibus bill that we had, that we added this into last year.

2915
05:48:40,000 --> 05:48:44,500
Some of it was career technical education as well.

2916
05:48:44,500 --> 05:48:54,000
To now go to the next step where we add in and we're better defining what social studies is.

2917
05:48:54,000 --> 05:49:17,000
If you were to go talk to the National Council for Social Studies or the social studies group, which I have a cousin who is president of it in this state, Steve would always say to me, Rick, why are you just putting down social studies?

2918
05:49:17,000 --> 05:49:25,000
Why aren't you putting the things that are the primary themes within it, which are geography?

2919
05:49:25,000 --> 05:49:29,500
How many kids need a better lesson than that?

2920
05:49:29,500 --> 05:49:33,000
How many know where the Ukraine is?

2921
05:49:33,000 --> 05:49:36,000
How many know where Azerbaijan is?

2922
05:49:36,000 --> 05:49:39,500
I wouldn't say a whole lot do.

2923
05:49:39,500 --> 05:49:47,500
And it's all part of our world, and we're seeing how it comes together right now.

2924
05:49:47,500 --> 05:49:53,500
In terms of the other areas of music, that's never been there.

2925
05:49:53,500 --> 05:49:55,500
It should be there.

2926
05:49:55,500 --> 05:50:23,500
And if you were to talk to music teachers, if you were to talk to the choral teachers, if you go down and talk to the teachers at Keene State, which that school now is being founded upon the liberal arts and theater and music and choral groups, they have 15 Steinways in the school now.

2927
05:50:23,500 --> 05:50:25,500
Their emphasis is music.

2928
05:50:25,500 --> 05:50:33,500
So we're seeing this occurring, and I don't see anything radical about what we're doing here.

2929
05:50:33,500 --> 05:50:39,000
It's just a continuance of those criteria for an adequate education.

2930
05:50:39,000 --> 05:50:47,000
We currently spell out under Romans, as was just mentioned by Representative Tanner, 1 through 7.

2931
05:50:47,000 --> 05:50:54,000
And then this right here is putting in the content of an adequate education.

2932
05:50:54,000 --> 05:51:01,000
And it's not changing a great deal, nothing more than teachers are already doing.

2933
05:51:01,000 --> 05:51:10,000
And I think it better protects a content and adequate education by stating this is what we do.

2934
05:51:10,000 --> 05:51:15,000
And I don't think it's putting people on overload either.

2935
05:51:15,000 --> 05:51:18,500
I was an elementary teacher, fourth grade.

2936
05:51:18,500 --> 05:51:21,000
I've been writer of curriculum.

2937
05:51:21,000 --> 05:52:07,000
I wrote the main studies curriculum project that's now bought out by Down East Magazine, which is their their social studies for that state and the themes were the same as you're seeing right here first of all I think I support your amendment it's so much better than the underlying bill um my question is just as as you went to the point of with social studies itemizing it out and because last year uh we so much focused on getting civics into social studies with the civics tests and that.

2938
05:52:07,000 --> 05:52:19,000
And we also did, as I said, a committee in order to get the Holocaust and genocide education listed specifically under civics in government.

2939
05:52:19,000 --> 05:52:26,500
And I think it would be good to include it in the amendment as well.

2940
05:52:26,500 --> 05:52:32,000
That would be one thing I would ask that we include.

2941
05:52:32,000 --> 05:52:34,000
Thank you.

2942
05:52:34,000 --> 05:52:36,000
Further discussion?

2943
05:52:36,000 --> 05:52:40,000
I have one other thing to add here.

2944
05:52:40,000 --> 05:52:43,000
I'm just trying to find it.

2945
05:52:43,000 --> 05:52:47,500
Yeah, we're going to want to talk about this.

2946
05:52:47,500 --> 05:52:50,500
Okay, do you have more discussion?

2947
05:52:50,500 --> 05:52:53,500
Yeah, a little bit more discussion.

2948
05:52:53,500 --> 05:53:19,000
I mean, I think Representative Tanner brings up a very important point that, you know, I could certainly chalk up to personal oversight on this, but something that I think is so important that should be, I mean, it's important to all of us, and it's important to all of us.

2949
05:53:19,000 --> 05:53:37,500
and I don't want to say made more important, but certainly given current events of the last three weeks, to have it very specifically be included in the core, in the subject areas that define inadequate education.

2950
05:53:37,500 --> 05:54:09,000
And, you know, I think at this point, given that Representative Tanner has brought this to our attention, that we should be as specific about genocide studies as we are all these other areas and not just gloss it over, but clearly articulate it in the definition of an adequate education, if this is even going to have any chance of moving forward.

2951
05:54:09,000 --> 05:54:12,500
I just have one more comment here.

2952
05:54:12,500 --> 05:54:37,000
If you look at 189 colon 11, instruction in national and state history in government, there are a number of areas which we have put in there when we're teaching this that came as a result of Senator D'Alessandro and myself introducing this legislation back about four years ago.

2953
05:54:37,000 --> 05:54:39,000
Thank you.

2954
05:54:39,000 --> 05:54:50,000
And we're teaching this that came as a result of Senator D'Alessandro and myself introducing this legislation back about four years ago.

2955
05:54:50,000 --> 05:54:57,000
And in it, we're mentioning civics and we're mentioning government and we're mentioning history.

2956
05:54:57,000 --> 05:55:15,500
But we then get into the sub-themes, which you can see down below there, an A going right down through H, which are themes that came out of the state of Ohio when we put this together.

2957
05:55:15,500 --> 05:55:37,000
There's an emphasis that we need to have here in terms of better defining our content of an adequate education, which that's what we're trying to do, but also later on by putting within studies some of these sub-areas that we're talking about.

2958
05:55:37,000 --> 05:55:39,000
It's all important.

2959
05:55:39,000 --> 05:55:42,000
It all needs to be taught.

2960
05:55:42,000 --> 05:55:46,000
However, the part we're looking at are adequacy.

2961
05:55:46,000 --> 05:55:59,000
We're not supposed to be defining getting down into the very nitty-gritty, into the micromanagement of what is computer science or what is this and that.

2962
05:55:59,000 --> 05:56:07,500
Besides mathematics, you could put arithmetic, you could put algebra, you could put geometry and all that.

2963
05:56:07,500 --> 05:56:09,500
That's not our job.

2964
05:56:09,500 --> 05:56:17,500
However, it is when it comes to social studies, we need to be defining social studies.

2965
05:56:17,500 --> 05:56:19,500
What is that?

2966
05:56:19,500 --> 05:56:25,500
And some people like to glump everything in other states under humanities.

2967
05:56:25,500 --> 05:56:28,500
And you'll see that often now.

2968
05:56:28,500 --> 05:56:43,000
And it really doesn't define what the content of an adequate education is in terms of the subject areas or the learning domain areas that need to be covered.

2969
05:56:43,000 --> 05:56:58,000
And when we get this, we used to have the frameworks in this state, the guidelines, which were guidelines that spelled out the frameworks for each of these subject areas.

2970
05:56:58,000 --> 05:57:00,000
That's gone.

2971
05:57:00,000 --> 05:57:12,000
And when we asked for all those a number of years back, we were given, for example, what is the framework for physical education?

2972
05:57:12,000 --> 05:57:16,500
We were given stuff that was 20 years old.

2973
05:57:16,500 --> 05:57:18,500
It wasn't even relevant.

2974
05:57:18,500 --> 05:57:26,000
And so the issue of developing curriculum at the state level, it's disappeared, totally disappeared.

2975
05:57:26,000 --> 05:57:28,000
It's not there.

2976
05:57:28,000 --> 05:57:30,000
So we downgraded everything.

2977
05:57:30,000 --> 05:57:36,500
Curriculum instruction is now a responsibility of the local government, not the state.

2978
05:57:36,500 --> 05:57:41,000
Look at what we're doing as assessment testing now.

2979
05:57:41,000 --> 05:57:43,000
We're only assessing what?

2980
05:57:43,000 --> 05:57:46,000
Reading, writing, and arithmetic and language.

2981
05:57:46,000 --> 05:57:55,000
We had other subjects in there a few years back, and we dumped that because we weren't assessing.

2982
05:57:55,000 --> 05:57:59,000
We weren't doing our job as a state.

2983
05:57:59,000 --> 05:58:13,500
So I hope that we don't start saying, well, we're just going to make these broad categories and let it free flow, go at it at the local level.

2984
05:58:13,500 --> 05:58:18,500
I think we're going to lose something in this state.

2985
05:58:18,500 --> 05:58:36,500
We have always had pretty high achievement in this state, and that's a result that we've had in the content of inadequate education specific areas which shall be part of this and which we shall fund.

2986
05:58:36,500 --> 05:58:38,500
And that's critical.

2987
05:58:38,500 --> 05:58:40,500
We shall fund them.

2988
05:58:40,500 --> 05:58:45,500
And that means we shall fund these areas right here.

2989
05:58:45,500 --> 05:58:50,000
You take it out, yeah, it's on somebody else.

2990
05:58:50,000 --> 05:58:52,000
Representative Schell.

2991
05:58:52,000 --> 05:59:03,000
Yes, when I think of adequate education, I think of being able to contribute to society and to be a good citizen.

2992
05:59:03,000 --> 05:59:20,000
And following on to what Representative Luno said, what's happening currently in current events, understanding what's happening or not understanding what's happening is the product of either having or not having an adequate education.

2993
05:59:20,000 --> 05:59:34,000
Understanding what ethnic cleansing is or understanding where the Ukraine is and why we have this big train of Russian heavy equipment and the impact of mud season.

2994
05:59:34,000 --> 05:59:38,000
What does mud season in the Ukraine have?

2995
05:59:38,000 --> 05:59:47,000
and a cursory examination of World War II history, or going back further to Napoleon and so forth.

2996
05:59:47,000 --> 05:59:51,500
Mud season has had a dramatic impact on aggressors.

2997
05:59:51,500 --> 05:59:58,000
So when I think adequate education is very important in understanding current events.

2998
05:59:58,000 --> 06:00:07,500
And either being a good citizen or not being a good citizen comes right back down to adequate education.

2999
06:00:07,500 --> 06:00:19,000
And it really brings it to light when college graduates can't put Florida, can't identify Florida on a map of the United States.

3000
06:00:19,000 --> 06:00:21,000
That's pretty pitiful.

3001
06:00:21,000 --> 06:00:26,500
And we're graduating, in some cases, citizens who can't do that.

3002
06:00:26,500 --> 06:00:44,000
So this is, and I'm a sub here, but this is really the core of what I look toward the purpose of this committee, is making sure we have that, that we define adequate education.

3003
06:00:44,000 --> 06:00:57,500
and we follow through and we're able to ensure that maybe we do set the standard or maybe everybody else has fallen back and we're just stable.

3004
06:00:57,500 --> 06:00:59,500
I don't know.

3005
06:00:59,500 --> 06:01:05,500
But I feel that we can always do better in this area.

3006
06:01:05,500 --> 06:01:15,500
I substitute at the local high school in Litchfield, Campbell High, and I see this stuff over and over again.

3007
06:01:15,500 --> 06:01:24,500
And I see some students who take several arts classes and take no science classes, no civics classes.

3008
06:01:24,500 --> 06:01:29,000
And I wonder, are they getting an adequate education?

3009
06:01:29,000 --> 06:01:31,000
I'm not sure.

3010
06:01:31,000 --> 06:01:33,500
But thank you for indulging.

3011
06:01:33,500 --> 06:01:35,500
Thank you.

3012
06:01:35,500 --> 06:01:37,500
Any further?

3013
06:01:37,500 --> 06:01:39,500
Representative Mullen.

3014
06:01:39,500 --> 06:01:49,000
Thank you for sharing your impressions from your work at the high school, congratulations on surviving being a substitute.

3015
06:01:49,000 --> 06:01:51,000
It's an admirable position.

3016
06:01:51,000 --> 06:01:57,500
I'm going to bring us just back to the brick and mortar again.

3017
06:01:57,500 --> 06:02:05,000
When I look at social studies, I see civics, government, economics, geography, and history listed.

3018
06:02:05,000 --> 06:02:11,000
When I look at mathematics, I don't see areas of study listed.

3019
06:02:11,000 --> 06:02:17,000
When I look at science, I don't see areas of study listed.

3020
06:02:17,000 --> 06:02:28,500
My question to you, Representative Ladd, is was that purposeful in listing it in social studies and not listing it in other areas?

3021
06:02:28,500 --> 06:02:52,000
And I think what Representative Tanner is saying is that if you use the definition in Roman 5, then it looks like you forgot Holocaust and genocide studies because all of the other things are listed out just like it is in the list in the amendment.

3022
06:02:52,000 --> 06:02:55,000
So I, I, it's a twofer.

3023
06:02:55,000 --> 06:02:59,500
What about listing out mathematics areas or science areas?

3024
06:02:59,500 --> 06:03:01,500
So it's a twofer.

3025
06:03:01,500 --> 06:03:06,000
What about listing out mathematics areas or science areas?

3026
06:03:06,000 --> 06:03:16,500
And two, if that wasn't your intent at all, then was it an oversight or was it mindfully done that way?

3027
06:03:16,500 --> 06:03:19,500
We're looking at overarching learning domains.

3028
06:03:19,500 --> 06:03:27,500
And that when you start trying to break down mathematics, you could go forever on that.

3029
06:03:27,500 --> 06:03:47,000
In regard to the Holocaust, within the law, we just introduced the Holocaust into the statutes and put it in underneath an adequate education already at the very front side where you gain these knowledge and skills and understandings.

3030
06:03:47,000 --> 06:03:57,500
I don't have that page right in front of me now, but I know you know where it is as well.

3031
06:03:57,500 --> 06:03:59,500
536.

3032
06:03:59,500 --> 06:04:01,500
Yeah.

3033
06:04:01,500 --> 06:04:03,500
536.

3034
06:04:03,500 --> 06:04:10,000
And we modified much of this within the last two or three years.

3035
06:04:10,000 --> 06:04:20,000
And by adding a subject like we put in, for example, under the knowledge of biological, physical, and earth sciences.

3036
06:04:20,000 --> 06:04:26,000
We could have gone into chemistry and natural sciences and all that.

3037
06:04:26,000 --> 06:04:48,500
You can keep going, but it's including environmental environmental sciences that investigate the complex interaction of physical, chemical, and biological processes that take place on the earth to enable them to understand and appreciate the world and the engineering, socioeconomic, and geopolitical challenges around them.

3038
06:04:48,500 --> 06:05:01,500
That was written by myself in conjunction with the regional coal lab up in Hanover, working with the director there, and in conjunction with Senator Kahn.

3039
06:05:01,500 --> 06:05:03,500
I certainly understand that.

3040
06:05:03,500 --> 06:05:14,000
I guess what I'm wondering is why does civics, government, economics, geography, and history appear after social studies in the amendment?

3041
06:05:14,000 --> 06:05:16,500
Why is the list there?

3042
06:05:16,500 --> 06:05:22,000
if it's already listed in the criteria for an adequate education?

3043
06:05:22,000 --> 06:05:28,500
It's criteria within the content of these subject areas that we've so noted.

3044
06:05:28,500 --> 06:05:30,500
Some are duplicated.

3045
06:05:30,500 --> 06:05:39,500
It's just like you see fiscal education mentioned under the content, but you also see it in studies.

3046
06:05:39,500 --> 06:06:03,500
It's because a lot of people have written this book, you know, right here, and it's time really to say, okay, we're not going to do anything for two or three years and rewrite this and get the statutes properly written and get the duplication and edit them.

3047
06:06:03,500 --> 06:06:11,000
And of course, I think the folks over in legislative services would agree on that.

3048
06:06:11,000 --> 06:06:18,000
But I think that what we've got is the criteria for an adequate education.

3049
06:06:18,000 --> 06:06:24,000
Those are some of those criteria, those specific criteria within those domains.

3050
06:06:24,000 --> 06:06:27,500
And I'm 100% supportive of the Holocaust.

3051
06:06:27,500 --> 06:06:42,000
I've been to the museum down in New York City, have taught it, have written curriculum on it, know about Elie Wiesel and Book Night and all the others.

3052
06:06:42,000 --> 06:06:55,000
Those we're engaged in, and that's something that I hope all our students have the right to know and do have the opportunity to learn that.

3053
06:06:55,000 --> 06:07:07,000
I just know I'm somewhat kind of put back from the standpoint that we're looking at the content here and we're strengthening the content.

3054
06:07:07,000 --> 06:07:09,000
It's not there now.

3055
06:07:09,000 --> 06:07:14,000
We have put the social studies trying to define that.

3056
06:07:14,000 --> 06:07:17,500
And basically that's coming as a result.

3057
06:07:17,500 --> 06:07:29,000
We had a task force at the Department of Education, as you may recall, in the area of social studies, which went nowhere.

3058
06:07:29,000 --> 06:07:38,500
And so I think it's important we put these subject areas that are within, that make up social studies.

3059
06:07:38,500 --> 06:07:42,500
Social studies is a compilation of many things.

3060
06:07:42,500 --> 06:07:44,500
And so is mathematics.

3061
06:07:44,500 --> 06:07:49,500
We could put like the commissioner wanted arithmetic and mathematics.

3062
06:07:49,500 --> 06:07:55,000
That was what I think was being suggested at one time.

3063
06:07:55,000 --> 06:08:03,000
But you look at 306, you will see all the different courses spelled out in that.

3064
06:08:03,000 --> 06:08:06,000
At what level do we start?

3065
06:08:06,000 --> 06:08:09,000
That's purpose of rules as well.

3066
06:08:09,000 --> 06:08:11,000
Thank you.

3067
06:08:11,000 --> 06:08:14,000
Just one last comment on it.

3068
06:08:14,000 --> 06:08:16,000
Thank you.

3069
06:08:16,000 --> 06:08:18,000
Thank you.

3070
06:08:18,000 --> 06:08:20,000
Thank you.

3071
06:08:20,000 --> 06:08:22,000
Thank you.

3072
06:08:22,000 --> 06:08:25,000
Just one last comment on it.

3073
06:08:25,000 --> 06:08:28,000
At what level do we start?

3074
06:08:28,000 --> 06:08:31,500
That's the purpose of rules as well.

3075
06:08:31,500 --> 06:08:33,500
Representative Tanner.

3076
06:08:33,500 --> 06:08:35,500
Thank you.

3077
06:08:35,500 --> 06:08:37,500
Thank you.

3078
06:08:37,500 --> 06:08:40,500
Just one last comment on it.

3079
06:08:40,500 --> 06:08:45,500
We spent a lot of time on the civics test.

3080
06:08:45,500 --> 06:08:55,500
And I know you and Senator D'Alessandro did a lot on the instruction in national and state history and government.

3081
06:08:55,500 --> 06:09:21,500
And even under that particular thing where it itemizes things, it has, you know, how tolerance, bigotry, anti-Semitism, national, ethnic, racial, and religious hatred and discrimination have evolved in the past and can evolve into genocide and mass violence such as the Holocaust and how to prevent the evolution of such practices.

3082
06:09:21,500 --> 06:09:25,000
So it's kind of listed right there.

3083
06:09:25,000 --> 06:09:59,500
I just, you know, my gut feeling is that it was important enough that there was a whole committee, commission developed that came with a recommendation and then it came in as an RSA, that if we're going to itemize social studies, and we're going to put civics because the civics test was something that we, and talking about civics, and not that I don't agree with this stuff.

3084
06:09:59,500 --> 06:10:02,500
I think it's really, really important.

3085
06:10:02,500 --> 06:10:10,000
I just think it's equally as important that we itemize out Holocaust and genocide education.

3086
06:10:10,000 --> 06:10:13,500
So that's just my last hurrah today.

3087
06:10:13,500 --> 06:10:15,500
Thanks.

3088
06:10:15,500 --> 06:10:17,500
Thank you, Mr.

3089
06:10:17,500 --> 06:10:19,500
Chair.

3090
06:10:19,500 --> 06:10:27,500
And I can't agree with Representative Tanner any more than I agree with her on this.

3091
06:10:27,500 --> 06:10:44,000
I think really the problem that I see with this, and I think it's been articulated a few times, is the fact that it's an omission and that it's a blatant, flagrant omission.

3092
06:10:44,000 --> 06:10:52,000
And it may have been done by accident, and I'll fall on the sword on that.

3093
06:10:52,000 --> 06:10:56,000
I was certainly involved with conversations about this.

3094
06:10:56,000 --> 06:11:18,500
But because in other places in our statute it uses this phrase and includes Holocaust and genocide studies, that it should not be omitted from here, because I think that omission is meaningful or could be interpreted as meaningful, and none of us want that.

3095
06:11:18,500 --> 06:11:39,000
And I think this is sort of symptomatic of what happens in a committee when we get 103 bills and lose almost a week's worth of committee time to get them done because of some changes in the calendar and deadlines.

3096
06:11:39,000 --> 06:12:53,500
but but more importantly it also speaks to the fact that such important pieces of legislation like this need to be done in a collaborative way, because if it weren't for people like Representative Tanner bringing this to our attention, and unfortunately it's at, I don't know what time we come in at 4 4 30 on the the the day before the day before we need to have all these things uh wrapped up and we still got a lot more bills to do um it it it wouldn't have gotten caught and and um and you know we we it would have been much better, I think, had we were able to develop this collaboratively with the various stakeholders that support a lot of our other initiatives, whether it's in adequacy, whether it's in special education, whether it's in funding, and been able to do this earlier.

3097
06:12:53,500 --> 06:13:01,000
So, you know, and I'm not laying blame or fault to anybody around this table.

3098
06:13:01,000 --> 06:13:19,500
We got dealt 103 bills, and we're trying to get through them in the, you know, I cut my teeth upstairs in the Commerce Committee, and I'll attribute it to Chair Hunt, but we can't fix everything.

3099
06:13:19,500 --> 06:13:26,000
We do our best, but working collaboratively can hopefully get the job done.

3100
06:13:26,000 --> 06:13:28,000
Thank you.

3101
06:13:28,000 --> 06:13:30,000
All right.

3102
06:13:30,000 --> 06:13:52,500
I would just say that in that same E2 criteria for education where you referenced the Holocaust and genocide education, right above that in science it talks about biology and earth science and so forth, but in this amendment we just leave it at science.

3103
06:13:52,500 --> 06:13:59,500
I don't know if we need to go into every aspect of that domain.

3104
06:13:59,500 --> 06:14:04,000
But in science, you're not going to any aspects.

3105
06:14:04,000 --> 06:14:08,000
This one, you're going into most of them.

3106
06:14:08,000 --> 06:14:10,000
Thank you, Mr.

3107
06:14:10,000 --> 06:14:12,000
Chair.

3108
06:14:12,000 --> 06:14:35,500
As one of the two House members on the Holocaust and Genocide Studies Commission, I would hope that the wording that's carried forward in a number of places in the existing statute would be incorporated in whatever the final version is that we come up with here.

3109
06:14:35,500 --> 06:14:37,500
Representative Ford.

3110
06:14:37,500 --> 06:14:43,000
I'd like to offer one other perspective that I haven't heard.

3111
06:14:43,000 --> 06:14:46,000
And it's from the college perspective.

3112
06:14:46,000 --> 06:14:54,500
I hear us all sitting here saying you have to study this, you have to study that.

3113
06:14:54,500 --> 06:14:58,000
Believe me, professors do the same thing.

3114
06:14:58,000 --> 06:15:00,000
And they're all urgent.

3115
06:15:00,000 --> 06:15:02,000
I don't do...

3116
06:15:02,000 --> 06:15:10,500
I hear us all sitting here saying you have to study this, you have to study that.

3117
06:15:10,500 --> 06:15:14,000
Believe me, professors do the same thing.

3118
06:15:14,000 --> 06:15:16,000
And they're all urgent.

3119
06:15:16,000 --> 06:15:18,000
I don't deny that.

3120
06:15:18,000 --> 06:15:29,500
But I remember the day a biology professor came down the hall from a class he was trying to teach of teacher candidates.

3121
06:15:29,500 --> 06:15:39,000
In Massachusetts, for a course to count toward your certification, it has to have four teachers in the title.

3122
06:15:39,000 --> 06:15:42,000
So you get biology, four teachers.

3123
06:15:42,000 --> 06:15:44,000
Thank you.

3124
06:15:44,000 --> 06:15:53,500
In Massachusetts, for a course to count toward your certification, it has to have four teachers in the title.

3125
06:15:53,500 --> 06:15:56,500
So you get biology for teachers.

3126
06:15:56,500 --> 06:16:03,500
Somehow their biology is not like everybody else's biology, but that's beside the point.

3127
06:16:03,500 --> 06:16:14,000
He was almost in tears because he had an entire class of students, college students, who could not read a ruler.

3128
06:16:14,000 --> 06:16:16,500
You hear what I said?

3129
06:16:16,500 --> 06:16:23,000
Read a ruler, the very basic instrument you use in measuring for science.

3130
06:16:23,000 --> 06:16:29,500
And they didn't know what the two different sides of the ruler meant.

3131
06:16:29,500 --> 06:16:36,000
And we're talking about do you have a Holocaust education in a course.

3132
06:16:36,000 --> 06:16:39,500
And I'm sitting here thinking of that.

3133
06:16:39,500 --> 06:16:42,000
Now that's an exception, maybe.

3134
06:16:42,000 --> 06:16:44,500
But just think about it.

3135
06:16:44,500 --> 06:16:59,000
When you can't even assume that someone who's graduated from high school knows that there are two sides to a ruler and they measure differently, what can you assume?

3136
06:16:59,000 --> 06:17:06,500
Alicia and I have this ongoing conversation about how mathematics is taught or not taught.

3137
06:17:06,500 --> 06:17:11,500
And so people don't know how to apply the mathematics.

3138
06:17:11,500 --> 06:17:17,500
How can you apply mathematics if you can't even read a ruler?

3139
06:17:17,500 --> 06:17:24,500
And I'd be embarrassed to put that in the requirements for an adequate education.

3140
06:17:24,500 --> 06:17:34,500
But I know for a fact there's one class in the world, in the history of my life, who couldn't.

3141
06:17:34,500 --> 06:17:38,500
We didn't have a great solution for it.

3142
06:17:38,500 --> 06:17:40,500
We tried.

3143
06:17:40,500 --> 06:17:44,000
sort of pushed back up the pipeline.

3144
06:17:44,000 --> 06:17:48,000
Hey, would they need more preparation in this?

3145
06:17:48,000 --> 06:17:52,000
But, you know, what impact did it have?

3146
06:17:52,000 --> 06:17:54,000
I have no idea.

3147
06:17:54,000 --> 06:17:57,500
But there is another side to it.

3148
06:17:57,500 --> 06:17:59,500
Thank you.

3149
06:17:59,500 --> 06:18:01,500
Yes.

3150
06:18:01,500 --> 06:18:03,500
Right.

3151
06:18:03,500 --> 06:18:05,500
Thanks, Mr.

3152
06:18:05,500 --> 06:18:07,500
Chair.

3153
06:18:07,500 --> 06:18:27,000
You know, I'd be surprised if any New Hampshire student fell into that category of not being able to read a ruler, and especially after spending 12 years, 13 years in kindergarten, elementary, and secondary school in New Hampshire.

3154
06:18:27,000 --> 06:18:31,500
Certainly our student outcomes are not reflective of that.

3155
06:18:31,500 --> 06:18:37,000
I don't even know how to describe that level of performance.

3156
06:18:37,000 --> 06:18:53,000
But to somehow equate the most basic thing of reading a ruler with, I think, a much more complicated and relevant to our human existence, Holocaust and genocide studies, is just outrageous.

3157
06:18:53,000 --> 06:19:22,000
And I think given the fact that we are enumerating, one, civics government, three economics, four geography, five history under standard four for an adequate education, and leave off in the only other area where this is referenced directly, Holocaust and genocide studies, is now that we've been talking about it, it's in front of us, it's there.

3158
06:19:22,000 --> 06:19:27,500
We should certainly adopt that into the definition of inadequate education.

3159
06:19:27,500 --> 06:19:34,500
Since we're touching that statute, or since this amendment touches that statute, Thank you.

3160
06:19:34,500 --> 06:19:43,500
into the definition of inadequate education, since we're touching that statute, or since this amendment touches that statute.

3161
06:19:43,500 --> 06:19:50,000
If the amendment wasn't touching the statute, then we weren't dealing with it.

3162
06:19:50,000 --> 06:20:01,000
Or if the amendment wasn't going beyond the comma to include those, what do we say, five areas where it should be?

3163
06:20:01,000 --> 06:20:03,000
Six.

3164
06:20:03,000 --> 06:20:08,000
Then, I mean, this is something we should look at.

3165
06:20:08,000 --> 06:20:20,500
If, Dave, that it's, you know, I think there's not a person at any of these tables which is oppositional to Holocaust and genocide studies.

3166
06:20:20,500 --> 06:20:28,000
If, in fact, it's the legislature's responsibility to identify the content of an adequate education.

3167
06:20:28,000 --> 06:20:32,500
Flat out, that's what the court system's told us.

3168
06:20:32,500 --> 06:20:34,500
Thank you.

3169
06:20:34,500 --> 06:20:42,000
If, in fact, it's the legislature's responsibility to identify the content of an adequate education.

3170
06:20:42,000 --> 06:20:46,500
Flat out, that's what the court system's told us.

3171
06:20:46,500 --> 06:20:48,500
It's our responsibility.

3172
06:20:48,500 --> 06:20:57,500
If we see now that it's important to put in, and I agree, I'm not oppositional to it.

3173
06:20:57,500 --> 06:21:03,500
We could put in Holocaust and genocide studies in here, in content.

3174
06:21:03,500 --> 06:21:11,000
We could change it from learning domain areas to learning areas, if that's more apropos.

3175
06:21:11,000 --> 06:21:27,500
To me, it's education ease, and it's more jargon that any teacher's going to read that, at least I, as a beginning teacher back in the 70s, would have said, that's the subjects.

3176
06:21:27,500 --> 06:21:36,500
And I'll get a scope and sequence, I'll get the whole thing, and we'll get rolling on it.

3177
06:21:36,500 --> 06:21:47,500
And that's exactly what we have to do if you look further in the statutes here and look at room number five.

3178
06:21:47,500 --> 06:22:00,000
Under this whole thing, it talks about the pedagogy and all the approaches and all that stuff that if you want education ease, it's there.

3179
06:22:00,000 --> 06:22:13,000
So I could come back with an amendment tomorrow with those suggest areas I just mentioned and maybe because we still have a little time here.

3180
06:22:13,000 --> 06:22:19,000
If we see something, we'd like to have it included in there.

3181
06:22:19,000 --> 06:22:21,000
Thank you.

3182
06:22:21,000 --> 06:22:37,500
back to an amendment tomorrow with those suggest areas I just mentioned, and maybe because we still have a little time here, if we see something we'd like to have included in there.

3183
06:22:37,500 --> 06:22:53,500
My feeling is anything we do in a content of an adequate education, it's not going to go anywhere until we have some ownership on not just one party, but on all.

3184
06:22:53,500 --> 06:23:08,000
And we need to all be in this together because this is what we want our children to have an understanding of the knowledge and skills to be educated.

3185
06:23:08,000 --> 06:23:11,000
And so I'm all for it.

3186
06:23:11,000 --> 06:23:16,000
I just was very careful, though, in putting this down.

3187
06:23:16,000 --> 06:23:37,000
I didn't want us to get into the area, which is the studies area, which we put in the 189 areas that we've just been talking about earlier, and rightfully so, probably eventually we should be putting some of this in there.

3188
06:23:37,000 --> 06:23:45,500
But if we want it as the content of an adequate education, it can be done tomorrow.

3189
06:23:45,500 --> 06:23:48,000
We can have it there.

3190
06:23:48,000 --> 06:23:50,000
See how it goes.

3191
06:23:50,000 --> 06:24:03,500
So, Rick, along those lines, what you just said, how we put personal finance literacy under studies, in the studies section, we've got that in there now.

3192
06:24:03,500 --> 06:24:06,000
We also have interpersonal relationships.

3193
06:24:06,000 --> 06:24:12,500
And we have physical education in there, and we have health in there.

3194
06:24:12,500 --> 06:24:18,000
Well, I'm talking about new things that we put in there.

3195
06:24:18,000 --> 06:24:27,000
But see, it's surprising that you have certain subjects here in the content which also appear in studies.

3196
06:24:27,000 --> 06:24:30,500
Why don't they all appear over there?

3197
06:24:30,500 --> 06:24:40,000
And that, I think, would be a good effort for maybe a cleanup, a comprehensive cleanup of these statutes.

3198
06:24:40,000 --> 06:24:57,000
That's something we're working towards, and I've spoken with you about trying to get things into the studies areas where they belong, and just that that messed up section of law needs absolute cleanup.

3199
06:24:57,000 --> 06:25:04,000
So, Rick, we got hundreds, if not thousands, of emails in opposition to 1671.

3200
06:25:04,000 --> 06:25:08,000
Well, that was for not necessarily this area.

3201
06:25:08,000 --> 06:25:10,000
I understand.

3202
06:25:10,000 --> 06:25:12,000
I understand.

3203
06:25:12,000 --> 06:25:16,500
And the amendment does a lot to do that.

3204
06:25:16,500 --> 06:25:35,000
But clearly, 1671 has a reputation out there across the Granite State among educators, among parents, among people who value, and all of us who find public education and the content of an adequate education very important.

3205
06:25:35,000 --> 06:25:42,500
It may be that 1671 is just no longer the vehicle to move this forward.

3206
06:25:42,500 --> 06:25:59,500
We may be better off just leaving it alone now that we've added personal finance literacy and interpersonal relationships into studies and take this as, I mean, it's something that needs to be done.

3207
06:25:59,500 --> 06:26:03,500
It's something that needs to be cleaned up.

3208
06:26:03,500 --> 06:26:15,000
It's something that Representative Ford talked about the use of pupils and students, and sometimes we use one, sometimes we use the other.

3209
06:26:15,000 --> 06:26:18,000
That may be in here too.

3210
06:26:18,000 --> 06:26:29,500
And then, of course, also we've got school funding, which is going to be doing deep dive study and legislation development on that.

3211
06:26:29,500 --> 06:27:27,000
handling this at the same time with funding I think makes a lot of sense and not jumping the gun on what's going to be a court case that's heard, I believe, this summer, decided a year from now, and then no matter what the decision is, an appeal, I mean, it's going to go to the Supreme Court and so you know I I just think we could we could put this in the interim study package and and look at this I think that'd be a dreadful mistake it's sending the wrong message out for one to the court system we are addressing, we're looking at finance through a study right now, yes.

3212
06:27:27,000 --> 06:27:33,500
And we know that the education funding formula needs a lot of overhaul.

3213
06:27:33,500 --> 06:27:44,500
We also know that the court cases have said that it's not a mere study of arithmetic or mathematics, language, and reading.

3214
06:27:44,500 --> 06:27:50,000
It's all these things which we have in front of us.

3215
06:27:50,000 --> 06:28:15,500
We're clarifying that, and we're also sending the message out, yes, we're looking at this, and we're prepared to try to improve upon what we have, to clarify what we have, but to reject it simply because it has a certain bill number on it, I think is just absolutely wrong.

3216
06:28:15,500 --> 06:28:23,500
You know, in our society, we try to teach kids, it's okay to make a mistake.

3217
06:28:23,500 --> 06:28:25,500
Learn from your mistake.

3218
06:28:25,500 --> 06:28:30,000
And this apparently, you make a mistake, it's dead.

3219
06:28:30,000 --> 06:28:33,000
I don't buy into that equation.

3220
06:28:33,000 --> 06:28:37,000
I think that we have an opportunity here.

3221
06:28:37,000 --> 06:28:54,500
And by not doing anything, we're just going to kick the can down the road farther, and we weren't able to get any resolution out of the task force over at DOE on social studies.

3222
06:28:54,500 --> 06:29:01,500
We need to get some resolution here, and maybe it's time for the legislature.

3223
06:29:01,500 --> 06:29:03,500
This is social studies.

3224
06:29:03,500 --> 06:29:11,500
And it has nothing to do with what's going on in the classroom behind those doors.

3225
06:29:11,500 --> 06:29:15,000
It has nothing to do with that.

3226
06:29:15,000 --> 06:29:23,000
It has to do with us stepping up to the plate and hitting the ball here.

3227
06:29:23,000 --> 06:29:31,500
So, you know, some changes to this, incorporating the definition of learning areas, I agreeable to that.

3228
06:29:31,500 --> 06:29:41,500
You know, domain sometimes is, you know, we've got to stop putting language in that's, you know, hard to define.

3229
06:29:41,500 --> 06:29:46,500
And incorporating a Holocaust in genocide studies, there's nothing wrong.

3230
06:29:46,500 --> 06:29:48,500
That's good stuff.

3231
06:29:48,500 --> 06:30:07,000
I don't know how far down we're going to get on this before throwing it in the studies, where it's also stated because we already have established that Holocaust studies will be part of an adequate education.

3232
06:30:07,000 --> 06:30:13,500
If you look at the first section of adequacy right here, It's there.

3233
06:30:13,500 --> 06:30:17,000
Now we're looking at the content areas.

3234
06:30:17,000 --> 06:30:20,000
And what are these content areas?

3235
06:30:20,000 --> 06:30:23,000
They're areas of study or subjects.

3236
06:30:23,000 --> 06:30:25,000
I don't know.

3237
06:30:25,000 --> 06:30:27,500
Because it's not defined anywhere.

3238
06:30:27,500 --> 06:30:33,500
Again, I think it's because we're enumerating those areas underneath social studies.

3239
06:30:33,500 --> 06:30:45,000
So, Rick, I think having an amendment that adds genocide, Holocaust studies, let's make sure we take it exactly how we use it.

3240
06:30:45,000 --> 06:31:06,000
I mean, following what Representative Ford has talked about, let's be consistent in terms of how it's applied in our statute and probably using, I think you used the term subject areas earlier, Rick, which I think is a lot easier to...

3241
06:31:06,000 --> 06:31:12,500
Whatever is in the law right now, or he talks in the following...

3242
06:31:12,500 --> 06:31:14,500
Areas.

3243
06:31:14,500 --> 06:31:16,500
It just says areas.

3244
06:31:16,500 --> 06:31:18,500
Period.

3245
06:31:18,500 --> 06:31:20,500
That's fine.

3246
06:31:20,500 --> 06:31:29,000
I don't think we have to, you see, what's different between a subject, a course, a curriculum?

3247
06:31:29,000 --> 06:31:54,500
We've even had that big discussion on instruction, and materials what's the difference you know we're trying to split a hair and education is good at doing that we've had terminology for everything under the sun and I don't think it's gotten us a lot farther along than you know but.

3248
06:31:54,500 --> 06:31:59,500
Right, but we're not trying to make it more confusing.

3249
06:31:59,500 --> 06:32:03,000
We're trying to make it more straightforward.

3250
06:32:03,000 --> 06:32:05,000
There we go.

3251
06:32:05,000 --> 06:32:07,500
And that's what this does.

3252
06:32:07,500 --> 06:32:17,000
So by making these changes here, I think we even square away what we have in law right now.

3253
06:32:17,000 --> 06:32:26,500
And certainly I don't think we should have any problems with, you know, emphasizing rhetoric, you know, and thinking.

3254
06:32:26,500 --> 06:32:32,500
My gosh, we've already talked about thinking with shared inquiry this year.

3255
06:32:32,500 --> 06:32:38,500
And there's an area that we need to beef up in schools.

3256
06:32:38,500 --> 06:32:55,500
Too many people are teaching how to regurgitate rote memory, that rather than taking it and raising it to the level of understanding the meaning of things and sharing that and having an opinion.

3257
06:32:55,500 --> 06:32:58,500
We don't do enough of that.

3258
06:32:58,500 --> 06:33:08,000
So, hey, if we can give some guidance out there as a legislature, I think that's a great idea.

3259
06:33:08,000 --> 06:33:10,000
Let's do it.

3260
06:33:10,000 --> 06:33:13,500
I'll come back with an amendment tomorrow.

3261
06:33:13,500 --> 06:33:15,500
Representative Hall.

3262
06:33:15,500 --> 06:33:17,500
Representative Hall.

3263
06:33:17,500 --> 06:33:19,500
Representative Hall.

3264
06:33:19,500 --> 06:33:21,500
Representative Hall.

3265
06:33:21,500 --> 06:33:23,500
Representative Hall.

3266
06:33:23,500 --> 06:33:25,500
Representative Hall.

3267
06:33:25,500 --> 06:33:27,500
Representative Hall.

3268
06:33:27,500 --> 06:33:29,500
Representative Hall.

3269
06:33:29,500 --> 06:33:31,500
Representative Hall.

3270
06:33:31,500 --> 06:33:33,500
Representative Hall.

3271
06:33:33,500 --> 06:33:35,500
Representative Hall.

3272
06:33:35,500 --> 06:33:37,500
Representative Hall.

3273
06:33:37,500 --> 06:33:39,500
Representative Hall.

3274
06:33:39,500 --> 06:33:41,500
Representative Hall.

3275
06:33:41,500 --> 06:33:43,500
Representative Hall.

3276
06:33:43,500 --> 06:33:45,500
Representative Hall.

3277
06:33:45,500 --> 06:33:47,500
Representative Hall.

3278
06:33:47,500 --> 06:33:49,500
Representative Hall.

3279
06:33:49,500 --> 06:33:51,500
Representative Hall.

3280
06:33:51,500 --> 06:33:53,500
Representative Hall.

3281
06:33:53,500 --> 06:33:55,500
Representative Hall.

3282
06:33:55,500 --> 06:33:57,500
Representative Hall.

3283
06:33:57,500 --> 06:33:59,500

If you just had visual arts and performing arts, and that way it could be music, it could be theater, it could be dance, it could be, so if you do the visual arts and performing arts, just a thought, because you're just singling out music in that.

3289
06:34:31,500 --> 06:34:34,500
Some states have it that way.
