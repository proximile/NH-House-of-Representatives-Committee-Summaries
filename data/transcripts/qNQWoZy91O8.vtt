here this is to change the revenue
funding

funding
 
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
um from agency income 009
 
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
to a class 004 which is related to
 
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
intra-agency transfers this is just a
 
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.070 align:start position:0%
intra-agency transfers this is just a
new

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
a relatively new way that das is asking
 
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
us to record
 
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
grants that we award to ourselves so
 
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.550 align:start position:0%
grants that we award to ourselves so
typically

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
typically
 
00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
when we award a grant to ourselves in
 
00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
the past we've recorded an agency income
 
00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
now it's going to stick out and show
 
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
that it's an intra-agency transfer
 
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
both of these revenue sources are still
 
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
other income
 
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
when it rolls up so there's no change to
 
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.270 align:start position:0%
 
adjustment

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
adjustment
 
00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
the next page um num
 
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
item number two this is the same
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
situation except this is dealing with
 
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
grants that we receive from external
 
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
um state agencies so so agencies that
 
00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 align:start position:0%
are not the department of safety
 
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
this includes grants we get from the new
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of justice
 
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire department of
 
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
transportation so again in the past we
 
00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 align:start position:0%
recorded these as
 
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
agency income using revenue source zero
 
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
zero nine
 
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
and the it needs to be recorded as
 
00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 align:start position:0%
federal revenue received from another
 
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
state agency instead and so we're
 
00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 align:start position:0%
requesting that change
 
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
no impact it's still other income
 
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%
the third item here this has to do with
 
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
the accounting unit that we use to
 
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.150 align:start position:0%
the accounting unit that we use to
support

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire hospital security
 
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.830 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire hospital security
operations

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
we work with the new hampshire
 
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire hospital to budget
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
those security operations each year and
 
00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
our budgets need to align
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
what happened in this case is that there
 
00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:57.759 align:start position:0%
were adjustments to our benefit amounts
 
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
at das through the budget process which
 
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.110 align:start position:0%
at das through the budget process which
reduced

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
um which reduced the our appropriations
 
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
and um we need to increase our
 
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
appropriations here to match what's
 
00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
budgeted on the new hampshire hospital
 
00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:11.110 align:start position:0%
budgeted on the new hampshire hospital
side

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
the 1.596 and 1.691 and 22 and 23
 
00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 align:start position:0%
and so these were amounts that we had
 
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
originally reduced our budget by
 
00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
to meet the agreed-upon amounts but
 
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
since there were savings and benefits
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
we'd like to add these back in and this
 
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
will align our amounts with
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
health and human services at new
 
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
okay the last two items here oh sorry
 
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
yeah on uh on the third one
 
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.390 align:start position:0%
yeah on uh on the third one
um

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
does health and human services pay for
 
00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
this or do we pay for it
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
health and human services pays for these
 
00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
services directly 100
 
00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
and then the last items are listed as
 
00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.309 align:start position:0%
and then the last items are listed as
4-1

00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
4-1
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%

oh thank you madam chair um what is the
 
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
source of those health and human
 
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
services revenue
 
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
is that gen coming from general fund or
 
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:17.840 align:start position:0%

00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
they transfer the funds for us and and
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
we coordinate with them on the amount
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
required to provide the security
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%

[Music]

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
representative heath uh you can send an
 
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
email to jess
 
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
edwards and ask him that question
 
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
all right thank you okay and uh you know
 
00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm sure he'll
 
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
have an answer or if he doesn't uh he'll
 
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
get one for you
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
right thank you um
 
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
okay and then the last item here i'm
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
listing is 4.1 and 4.2 because they are
 
00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.190 align:start position:0%
listing is 4.1 and 4.2 because they are
related

00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
related
 
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
um again there's there's no impact
 
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
overall to our funding sources but there
 
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
was a keying error that occurred
 
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
when we were adjusting our funds our
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
fund mix at the
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
governor's phase which there's a debt
 
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
service amount within the
 
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
office of the commissioner which needs
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
to be funded at 100
 
00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:22.959 align:start position:0%
highway funds and unfortunately right
 
00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:24.959 align:start position:0%
now it's not so what we're requesting
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
is that we increase the highway fund
 
00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
portion for the the amount in the
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner's office accounting unit
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
and decrease the general funds with an
 
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
offset for the exact same
 
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
um general and highway fund changes in
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
4010 which is the uh enforcement
 
00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
accounting unit in state police
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
so again it's it's neutral no impact on
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
the state budget
 
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
it's really just shifting our fundaments
 
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
and aligning it to where we had
 
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
intended it to be at the end of the
 
00:09:56.949 --> 00:09:56.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
okay um nikki i guess
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
is there anybody that has any other
 
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.310 align:start position:0%
is there anybody that has any other
questions

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry representative murray ah
 
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
um mr lavoy can you just go over again
 
00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:13.839 align:start position:0%
you know the highway fund is has a
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
certain amount
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
does this impact what else you would be
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
able to do with the highway fund that
 
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
these funds are coming out of that
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
instead of the general fund
 
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
does that make sense sure yeah that's a
 
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
good question um
 
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
there's no impact whatsoever so our our
 
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
highway fund draw
 
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
in at a for the entire department is
 
00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:32.630 align:start position:0%
in at a for the entire department is
unchanged

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
unchanged
 
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
all that we've done is shifted where the
 
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
highway funds are coming
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
are being charged to so if you look here
 
00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
you'll see that
 
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
in 4.1 there's an increase of 993
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
000 and in 4.2 there's a decrease
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
equal to the same amount 993 so
 
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
no impact um whatsoever on the amount
 
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
that we're spending for highway funds
 
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't free up highway funds it just
 
00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
moves them to a different account
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
um is there anybody that has a problem
 
00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
okay then could i have a motion to
 
00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:13.519 align:start position:0%

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
changes that um safety has

uh review of your budget um
 
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
yes uh madam chair there is one more
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
piece that i wanted to
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
um to bring up for consideration
 
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
when we met last week we started talking
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
about house bill 2
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
and there's a new program that was added
 
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
to provide body cameras
 
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
and cruiser cameras for locals uh it's a
 
00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
in appropriations um a uh
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing continuously appropriated
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
fund and um and at the time i had
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned that um we would be seeking a
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
full-time position
 
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
to help administer that fund um we um
 
00:13:20.069 --> 00:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
we did um we did go back and and look
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
and made some adjustments to our
 
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
original request that we thought would
 
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.110 align:start position:0%
original request that we thought would
um

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
reduce the cost um in doing so so we we
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
um are changing our request from a
 
00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:31.590 align:start position:0%
um are changing our request from a
program

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
specialist position to a business
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
administrator one position
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh which is a labor grade 21 and that
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
would be 73 000
 
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
in uh fy 2022 and
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
76 000 in fy 2023
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
and we would also um be open to making
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
that a
 
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
a full-time temporary position using
 
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
that language so it aligns with
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
the program if the program expires
 
00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
within the two-year biennium then the
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
position could expire along with it
 
00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:04.959 align:start position:0%
but if it goes longer we would be able
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
to have those discussions moving into
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
the next biennium to determine
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
if we needed to continue the position
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
and so we would request that language be
 
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
added to
 
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
the hb2 line authorizing safety
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
to um to fund and hire that full-time
 
00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.590 align:start position:0%
to um to fund and hire that full-time
temporary

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
temporary
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
business administrator one
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair and
 
00:14:28.079 --> 00:14:28.629 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair and
where

00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
in the budget will that position be
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
reflected because i'm assuming
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
that you are asking for general funds of
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
which there are not very many
 
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
right and so that would be that would be
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
up for um
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
up for the committee to to to decide i
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
mean one option is there's the million
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
dollars appropriated for the program
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
um it might make sense to include it
 
00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:52.870 align:start position:0%
um it might make sense to include it
there

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
and so then that would essentially
 
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
reduce that million dollars by this
 
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
amount as far as funding
 
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
available to distribute but it would
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
allow us to distribute those funds
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
because without this position we're not
 
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
sure how we would make that happen
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
may i follow up madam chair absolutely
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
so that's a million dollars of general
 
00:15:13.519 --> 00:15:15.509 align:start position:0%
so that's a million dollars of general
funds

00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:15.519 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
and that um is
 
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
funding that um is very scarce
 
00:15:25.829 --> 00:15:25.839 align:start position:0%
um i also believe the program is very
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
important and it was i believe a leak
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
recommendation but realistically
 
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
are we going to be able to afford that
 
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars from your safety budget
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
which has been so
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
devastated um by cuts
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
i mean criminal the the lab i just
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
going through your budget um was
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
disturbing to see how much
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
you have had to cut so that's my
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
question to you
 
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
yeah um that that that that's a good
 
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:00.790 align:start position:0%
yeah um that that that that's a good
question

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
so the the house bill
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
um appropriations house bill 2
 
00:16:06.839 --> 00:16:08.069 align:start position:0%
um appropriations house bill 2
appropriations

00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
appropriations
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
are not reflected within our current
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
so those get added in after the fact if
 
00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
they're approved
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
and this is an important program and
 
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
it's a priority you know all the way up
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
to the to the governor's level
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
um to your point funding is scarce
 
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
and so um whichever wherever these funds
 
00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
go if they're supporting cameras or some
 
00:16:31.519 --> 00:16:32.069 align:start position:0%
go if they're supporting cameras or some
other

00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:32.079 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
purpose there's only so many dollars to
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
go around um
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
this this is a program that's in that's
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
in hb2 we do think that it's it's useful
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
our our purpose here is really to say if
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
we are to administer it moving forward
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
we need a resource uh in order to do so
 
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
and to do so correctly
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative heath if i if i
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
could just add to that
 
00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:55.839 align:start position:0%
you know steve and i have been talking
 
00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
offline you know quite a bit about this
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
and i think you know he raises a good
 
00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:00.230 align:start position:0%
and i think you know he raises a good
point

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
i think that we can stand this up and
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
and have a program and have a process
 
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
but again he's going to need the help to
 
00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:09.039 align:start position:0%
administer it just like you know we've
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
done in the past with other other
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
programs but
 
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
you know we are we are working very
 
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
closely on our own
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
project for um for digital evidence
 
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
our rfp has been pushed out um
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
a bit due to the complexity of it so you
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
know that is
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
probably going to be one of our top
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
projects moving forward
 
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
our own to outfit and equip and manage
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire state police with
 
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
digital evidence which includes
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
all evidence pictures data
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
voice not only on the cruiser cameras
 
00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
and body cameras we will have both
 
00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:47.919 align:start position:0%
but all of our digital evidence so you
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
know so this this piece here
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
which would be for local law enforcement
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
to apply for these grant dollars needs
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
to be managed correctly because we want
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure we
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
we i have to ensure that our project is
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh done correctly
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
which we've got a big team here pretty
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
much led by
 
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner rick bailey and
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
colonel noyes
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
so two separate issues but both very
 
00:18:11.679 --> 00:18:12.870 align:start position:0%
so two separate issues but both very
important

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
may i just follow up one more time then
 
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
based on what
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
what the commissioner just said yes go
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
ahead please
 
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner are your funds for your
 
00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:23.590 align:start position:0%
commissioner are your funds for your
project

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
jeopardized because of this item
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
i i i don't believe so and i think that
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
they're two separate
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
we know what we have right now in the
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
budget but we're waiting to see when the
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
rfp comes back
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
you know we there's a lot of you know
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
uncertainties here but i'll let steve
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
you know the funding source the million
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
and what we have for our own project
 
00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.549 align:start position:0%
and what we have for our own project
steve

00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
steve
 
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
yeah no our this is really unrelated
 
00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:51.039 align:start position:0%
um so we budgeted for our project based
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
on the information we had
 
00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:54.799 align:start position:0%
as the commissioner mentioned technology
 
00:18:54.799 --> 00:18:55.510 align:start position:0%
as the commissioner mentioned technology
is

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
we're we're trying to make sure we get
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
the best deals we've pushed the rfp out
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
we'll know more about the true cost in
 
00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:02.630 align:start position:0%
we'll know more about the true cost in
in

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
the next several weeks um we we hope
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
that we've budgeted enough we think that
 
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
but there's a chance that we still we we
 
00:19:11.669 --> 00:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
may have under budgeted
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
um so i i don't believe that these are
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
in conflict with our
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
funding because i i feel like what we
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
have is is where we need to be within
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
our budget
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
with the understanding that we'll know
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
the real number within it within a few
 
00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.070 align:start position:0%
the real number within it within a few
weeks

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
representative lynn you have a question
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you madam chair i'm i'm i'm
 
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
just wondering mr
 
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
voip um i i if
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
if you could sort of explain in a little
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
more detail what it
 
00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
is exactly that you envision
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
this person would do with respect to
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
as i understand it this million dollars
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
is not
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
is not for the use of the the state
 
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
police or the department of safety
 
00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
itself but it's for local
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh local and perhaps county police
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
departments and so
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
i i i guess what i'm not clear on is
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
if this is if this is effectively just a
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
sort of a
 
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
pass through of money um
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
to the to the locals so to speak um
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
what what you know what are you
 
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
what is the person that's going to be
 
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
that you're you're
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
proposing to hire going to exactly be
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
doing sure
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
sure yeah no it's a good question so so
 
00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:29.270 align:start position:0%
sure yeah no it's a good question so so
this

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
is this is treated as a grant program to
 
00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.630 align:start position:0%
is this is treated as a grant program to
locals

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
locals
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
um so if you think of of of
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know the exact number of of
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
towns and municipalities with the police
 
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.190 align:start position:0%
towns and municipalities with the police
force

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
force
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
but let's just say it's it's 200 or
 
00:20:43.919 --> 00:20:45.270 align:start position:0%
but let's just say it's it's 200 or
thereabouts

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
thereabouts
 
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
who may be eligible and may want to take
 
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
advantage of this program
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
the first step as the commissioner noted
 
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
first step is we need to work with the
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
ag's office and develop the parameters
 
00:20:56.549 --> 00:20:56.559 align:start position:0%
of this program
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
what can you apply for what type of
 
00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
cameras are are allowed
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
are we going to require certain um
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
retention data is there you know what
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
what components can we buy
 
00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:08.559 align:start position:0%
cameras will we fund cameras and the
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
um the computer data backup to secure
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
the evidence or
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
only the physical cameras themselves all
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
those pieces will have to be worked out
 
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
then what this position will do is this
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
position will come in
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
and administer this like a grant program
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
what that means is
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
we'll have some sort of an application
 
00:21:25.919 --> 00:21:26.789 align:start position:0%
we'll have some sort of an application
process

00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
that 200 approximately 200
 
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.070 align:start position:0%
that 200 approximately 200
municipalities

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:32.799 align:start position:0%
would submit applications based on their
 
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
um their plans to implement their costs
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
those would be reviewed in addition uh
 
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
in to make sure they're in conformity
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
with the administrative rules
 
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
around the program funds would then be
 
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
awarded to the municipalities
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
in order to be awarded the
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities they would need to then
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
accept the money
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
at the local level provide evidence of
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
that acceptance back to us
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
and we would now then need to go to the
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
gnc and provide
 
00:21:59.830 --> 00:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
a grant document agreement to the
 
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
council for approval
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
we're assuming that each one of these
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
projects will likely exceed the ten
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar
 
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
gnc threshold so now we have 200
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
governor and council items that need to
 
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:10.789 align:start position:0%
governor and council items that need to
be

00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
prepared reviewed processed
 
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.230 align:start position:0%
prepared reviewed processed
appropriately

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
this is before we've officially started
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
the project we haven't awarded the funds
 
00:22:18.159 --> 00:22:18.630 align:start position:0%
the project we haven't awarded the funds
yet

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
so that's to get these things moving
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
once the
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
once the grant award has been accepted
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
and approved by gnc the locals have to
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
implement their project
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
now they have to submit for
 
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursement giving us receipts
 
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
invoices evidence of payment that needs
 
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559 align:start position:0%
to be reviewed
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
again with admin rules that which will
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
be established processed
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
um and then payments would be entered
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
through the system
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
and released to the to the locals um and
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
then at which point would have a
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
close-out process to make sure if the
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
grant award was x amount of dollars
 
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
you've submitted your final
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursements over the next several
 
00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.669 align:start position:0%
reimbursements over the next several
months

00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
um if there's a balance left we would
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
de-obligate that money
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
to return it to the revolving fund
 
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
and be available for others to use so
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
it's really that
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
that process times 200
 
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
and that's that's why we just don't have
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
the administrative resources
 
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the funding is
 
00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
distributed equitably and in accordance
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
with the administrative rules
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
once those are established
 
00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:27.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
the commissioner has six months
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
to work with the ag to come up with all
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
yes the process yes the process
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
so do we need to
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
hire this person
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
for a full year to begin
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
or should we uh give the commissioner
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
and the ag
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh time to set the program up
 
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
we could give them time to set the
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
program up and bring the person
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
on um but i wouldn't want to give
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
i if if we're planning to launch within
 
00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:21.510 align:start position:0%
i if if we're planning to launch within
six

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:23.919 align:start position:0%
months then i think the most amount of
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
time that we would need would be
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
several maybe three months
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
because we want the individual to be up
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
to speed and knowledgeable
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
about the program itself the state
 
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.390 align:start position:0%
about the program itself the state
processes

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
processes
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
what's expected we need to get them
 
00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
trained so that we can move this money
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
out as quickly as possible once it's
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
ready so i'd hesitate to
 
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
go a full six months and then hire the
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
person because i think that'll cause a
 
00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.630 align:start position:0%
person because i think that'll cause a
delay

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
delay
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
in the administration of the program but
 
00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
we could delay the hiring for
 
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
for several months um maybe maybe a nine
 
00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:56.310 align:start position:0%
for several months um maybe maybe a nine
month

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:24:59.590 --> 00:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
maybe nine month funding for year one
 
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm making notes over here so that's
 
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
why i'm
 
00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not talking so are there any
 
00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
representative murray now thank you very
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
much um mr lavoy can you just speak
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
briefly about
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh are there some municipalities that
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
already have the body cameras um
 
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
would this be primarily for smaller
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
communities that don't have the
 
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
resources that say a portsmouth would
 
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.390 align:start position:0%
resources that say a portsmouth would
have

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
i have to defer to the commissioner on
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
yeah i think back back to what um you
 
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
know somebody said it was a leak
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation i believe the
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation is encourage
 
00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919 align:start position:0%
you know encourage but i believe it's a
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
would be an unfunded mandate to require
 
00:26:02.549 --> 00:26:02.559 align:start position:0%
them to all get the cameras
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of police departments
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
that do have them now you know i can
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
think of a
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
you know handful off the top of my head
 
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
i won't mention them but i think to
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
steve's point that's why
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
you know the process is something that
 
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
we're really going to have to work on
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
with the ag you know
 
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
what are the parameters who gets the
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
money who doesn't do we look at what are
 
00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.269 align:start position:0%
money who doesn't do we look at what are
their

00:26:21.269 --> 00:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
opportunities within their own budgets
 
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
you know how do we
 
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
you know is it a partial funding um you
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
know we would obviously want them
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
want to get um we want to make sure that
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
it went
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
to to meet the needs of those that
 
00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
needed it the most
 
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
so um do we look at well you know do we
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
gauge one town against the other do we
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
start so i think that's why
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
the details of this everything has to be
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
done fairly so that's what
 
00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
you know myself and the attorney general
 
00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
are gonna have to sit down and discuss
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
ahead of time because
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
everybody i'm sure who wants to go in
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
this direction is going to
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
probably apply for some state funds for
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
this and i get asked the question all
 
00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
the time are there federal funds you
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
know are there other funds
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
i mean everybody wants us but like like
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
i said
 
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
earlier i'm focused on the state police
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
right now i have to make sure you know
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
we've got 260 plus
 
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
uniform state troopers we're gonna have
 
00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
to equip with body cameras
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
and cameras in the cruisers so it's a
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
lot of work but
 
00:27:23.669 --> 00:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
i think it's a great idea honestly to
 
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
give you know opportunities out there
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
because it is
 
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
this is where we want to go as a state
 
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative heath you have a question
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
commissioner i think your statement
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
is very important and i think we have a
 
00:27:41.279 --> 00:27:42.470 align:start position:0%
is very important and i think we have a
priority

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
priority
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
and that's the state police we have
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
minimal dollars and with the newest
 
00:27:52.389 --> 00:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
funds coming out of washington i believe
 
00:27:52.399 --> 00:27:52.990 align:start position:0%
funds coming out of washington i believe
that

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities will be um
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
getting quite a bit of funding and
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
i just i this budget
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
when i think about the lab and the the
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
wait time that's going to have to take
 
00:28:08.399 --> 00:28:08.950 align:start position:0%
wait time that's going to have to take
place

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
i think about the motor vehicle
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
department that
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
wait times are going to be increased in
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
good conscience
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
i just don't know how we possibly
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
can fund this and yes i agree it's
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
critical for our towns and
 
00:28:23.039 --> 00:28:24.470 align:start position:0%
critical for our towns and
municipalities

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
and i know that many um communities are
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
talking about this
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
but truly with the shape that your
 
00:28:31.919 --> 00:28:32.549 align:start position:0%
but truly with the shape that your
budget

00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
is in right now and chances are we're
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
going to have to cut more
 
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
i can't in good faith vote for this
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other comments
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
okay uh seeing none um
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
we will um slog through
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
this uh this
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
uh book yeah this budget
 
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
so um is there anyone that has any
 
00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.389 align:start position:0%
so um is there anyone that has any
questions

00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
that they would like to uh like to ask
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
or or mr lavoy
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
they might are scattered about so can i
 
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
pop in when
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
we get to or skip over you know if we
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
skip something that i have a question
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
can i pop in at that point
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh actually uh reps and murray if you
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
if you want to go through your questions
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
and then uh if any of us have questions
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
on those
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
sections or pages we'll uh
 
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
we'll jump in happy to
 
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
take that
 
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
so should i just go ahead then let's go
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
ahead and just give us the page number
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
so we can
 
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
find it in our book i think you answered
 
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
this the first time but i'm not sure
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's page 376
 
00:30:08.549 --> 00:30:08.559 align:start position:0%
and um where did the ignition interlock
 
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
device program go
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
that moved to um the financial
 
00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
responsibility accounting unit which is
 
00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:19.330 align:start position:0%

it's still within the dmv uh it just
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
moved within that
 
00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
that area and i can that is on
 
00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:30.549 align:start position:0%
that area and i can that is on
page

00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
um 493 steve
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
yep 493 thanks mickey how'd you get that
 
00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
so fast wow
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
i'm working off the electronic the
 
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
control f is quicker than flipping the
 
00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:45.669 align:start position:0%
control f is quicker than flipping the
pages

00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
pages
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
okay yep so we've so we've absorbed that
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
and the positions that are scattered
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
throughout here i mean you're missing a
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
lot of positions
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
they're all reflected in the budget here
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
the numbers
 
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
they're reflected in the dollars so so
 
00:31:06.149 --> 00:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
the salary and benefit amounts are lower
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
the position count they are not
 
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
reflected in the position count
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
so the position count includes all the
 
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions in them
 
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
and please if people have questions i'm
 
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
going through my notes here but if there
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
are other questions
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
um i don't want to take time on flipping
 
00:31:31.039 --> 00:31:31.350 align:start position:0%
um i don't want to take time on flipping
through

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
notes on page 402
 
00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:39.039 align:start position:0%
is that a new program the um
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:49.039 align:start position:0%
uh yes yes so that is to implement a um
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's the seaview program so this is a we
 
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
brought this item forward
 
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
through fiscal um and it will not be
 
00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:56.870 align:start position:0%
through fiscal um and it will not be
completed

00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
completed
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh during this biennium and this
 
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
implements a single
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
sign-on system for state police
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
commercial enforcement
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
right now when they pull over a a
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicle they have to query
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
several different databases
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
to get the information they're looking
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
for this will allow them to make one
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
query in the system and will return all
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
the safety and
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
historical information about the carrier
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
at that one time so
 
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
we just accepted that in this fiscal
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
year through fiscal
 
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:27.039 align:start position:0%
but we we believe that uh we'll be able
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
to complete the work on that grant next
 
00:32:29.039 --> 00:32:30.470 align:start position:0%
to complete the work on that grant next
year

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
um 405 the substance abuse enforcement
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
it looks like you have a slight increase
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
very slight increase
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
but there's the numbers um can you just
 
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
sort of explain because it looks
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is the same but there's
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
change between the adjusted and the
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
apparently you got equipment which you
 
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
won't get this year but
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
um benefits are you hiring people i
 
00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
guess just a little narrative around the
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
substance abuse enforcement
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
yeah sure so this is the accounting unit
 
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
where we have our mobile enforcement
 
00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:05.669 align:start position:0%
where we have our mobile enforcement
teams

00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
teams
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
um are paid out of so so those staff
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
and the related equipment to those for
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
those staff
 
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
the equipment numbers themselves have to
 
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
do with vehicle replacements
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
um and so those vary year by year and so
 
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
that's why you see some
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
some variation there and then obviously
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
salary and benefits
 
00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
um will vary as well as people are
 
00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
promoted into
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
those roles or hired into those roles so
 
00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:32.559 align:start position:0%
all in all it's it's relatively flat
 
00:33:32.559 --> 00:33:32.870 align:start position:0%
all in all it's it's relatively flat
with

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
fy um with fy21 budgeted amounts
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
yeah that that that's primarily that's
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
primarily it one of the key pieces here
 
00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:44.549 align:start position:0%
primarily it one of the key pieces here
too

00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
is that the um the granite shield
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
component of this
 
00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:52.640 align:start position:0%
which you can see there's some grants um
 
00:33:54.149 --> 00:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
some grant pieces that that's not
 
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
reflected in here so this is kind of a
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
companion component to the granite
 
00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
shield grants to locals
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
uh the granite shield grants to locals
 
00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
are not that's not a program that we
 
00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
fund within our operating budget
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
and so that's not reflected here thank
 
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
you uh
 
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
406 can you speak to the agency income
 
00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
this is new equipment that you're
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
getting and it looks like it's
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
is this did this not happen because of
 
00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
covid or
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
um nope this is so what you'll see what
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
you're probably seeing there's several
 
00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:23.750 align:start position:0%
you're probably seeing there's several
um

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
several grants where there's zero
 
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
budgeted in 2021.
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
um we we in the past
 
00:34:34.069 --> 00:34:34.079 align:start position:0%
if we were not 100 certain that we were
 
00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:35.599 align:start position:0%
receiving the federal money
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
we opted to not budget the grant and
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
come to fiscal
 
00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
based on comments from the committee um
 
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
we've shifted our focus
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
and we're budgeting estimated uh
 
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
receipts for these programs
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
so as not to have to come to fiscal
 
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
throughout the biennium
 
00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:51.919 align:start position:0%
and so that's the case here normally we
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
would go to fiscal to accept this money
 
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
in and the exact amount
 
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
we're now projecting what we expect to
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
receive in the next several years
 
00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:01.599 align:start position:0%
and yes this is this is agency income
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
money from the office of highway safety
 
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
that gets awarded to
 
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
the division of state police that agency
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
income 009
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
line the adjustment that we requested
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
and that the committee approved this
 
00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:16.550 align:start position:0%
and that the committee approved this
morning

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
we'll change that to reflected that
 
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me represent murray since we're
 
00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:27.829 align:start position:0%
excuse me represent murray since we're
right

00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
right here i have a question on the
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:38.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
i i guess that what my what my question
 
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
is is
 
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
what is the benefit of
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
the cold case unit and
 
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
how i know that over the years we've
 
00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
done it with volunteers we've done it
 
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
with people
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
we've done all corn all kinds of
 
00:35:59.589 --> 00:35:59.599 align:start position:0%
different things
 
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
but um what do we uh what are we looking
 
00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:04.150 align:start position:0%
but um what do we uh what are we looking
at

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
um for that has it accomplished anything
 
00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
so on yeah i'll take that one steve
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
so i'll tell you you know and i'm sure
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative lynn would understand
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
this from his years
 
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
as a judge you know there there comes a
 
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
time when
 
00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
um cases um are categorized as cold
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
a cold case and then there's cases that
 
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
are active so when a case is cold or
 
00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:31.829 align:start position:0%
are active so when a case is cold or
unsolved

00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:31.839 align:start position:0%
unsolved
 
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
you've still got victims you've got
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
families you've got evidence you've got
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
you've got books you've got you've got
 
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
hope you've got hope that new
 
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
evidence might arise you've got hope
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
that you know um
 
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
an informant may present him or herself
 
00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:48.079 align:start position:0%
to provide information
 
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
you've got a lot of work that can still
 
00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:51.829 align:start position:0%
you've got a lot of work that can still
be

00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
done and it takes uh it takes
 
00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.589 align:start position:0%
done and it takes uh it takes
investigators

00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:55.599 align:start position:0%
investigators
 
00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
there have been some um you know
 
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
volunteers that have gone in and looked
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
at books and
 
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
and analyzed uh reports uh but you've
 
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:04.390 align:start position:0%
and analyzed uh reports uh but you've
got

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
got
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
um you've got prosecute prosecutorial um
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh staff at the attorney general's
 
00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
office so it's a team
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
i think it's very important to continue
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
to work these cases
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
we have uh had some success um
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
it's it it's a lot of work though and
 
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
each case is different
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
but i think it's it's important to
 
00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
continue to
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
to have that to to have that um that
 
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
team there
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
um not only it's it's in the interest of
 
00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:32.950 align:start position:0%
um not only it's it's in the interest of
justice

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
justice
 
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
you know to continue to look and work at
 
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
these and every day we
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
you know we get letters we get new
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
information arrests are made
 
00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
and so um i think you know to answer
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
your question representative romberger i
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
think it's important to the uh
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
to the victims the victim's family um to
 
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
continue to seek
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
justice and find out who committed the
 
00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:53.430 align:start position:0%
justice and find out who committed the
most

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
most
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
you know egregious crimes in the state
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
and we've got a good team working on it
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
it just continues to
 
00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
be something that they go in every day
 
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
they're working
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative heath you have a question
 
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam to you that was one of
 
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
my questions
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
as well um because we see a a
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
an increase in that level of funding so
 
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
i guess i have a few questions
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
um in terms of um is this a match
 
00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:23.839 align:start position:0%
for federal dollars and would it be
 
00:38:23.839 --> 00:38:24.630 align:start position:0%
for federal dollars and would it be
possible

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
to just um
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
because of this the nature of this
 
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
budget this year what would
 
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
be the impact if these funds were to be
 
00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:40.550 align:start position:0%
be the impact if these funds were to be
reduced

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
well in what why
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
which just overall the funding for
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
salary and benefits class
 
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
general fund line yeah well i mean it
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
would impact the amount of hours that
 
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
could be put forward it could impact
 
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh could be result in you know loss of
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
investigators so
 
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
um yeah i i mean i i think this is an
 
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
area that
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
you know we wouldn't want to look to
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
reduce because
 
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
they're you know it's it's minimally
 
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
staffed at this point
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
and again you've got the major crime
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
unit that is working you know full-time
 
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
on the most
 
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
active in recent cases so i
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
i listen in the interest of the state i
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
i would uh
 
00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
not recommend reducing these funds
 
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
because we've had all we can do to keep
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
this this level of staffing
 
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
steve yeah no i
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
i think um i think it's a valid point i
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
think with the stat with the funding
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
levels that we have here
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
there's two full-time positions
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
dedicated to this
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
to this service um we reduce anything
 
00:39:45.599 --> 00:39:46.550 align:start position:0%
to this service um we reduce anything
and

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
essentially there's there's really going
 
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
to be a significant decline in any cold
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
case work
 
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
um so that that's that's it's
 
00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
if there were 50 individuals in this
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
unit we could talk about maybe scaling
 
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
back but it's too i think it's too small
 
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
to touch
 
00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%
madam chair if i may yes please
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
are there um a lot of people with whom
 
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
you contract with
 
00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:13.839 align:start position:0%
in this area contract well
 
00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
these are no they i mean these are
 
00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
active investigations you need
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
full-time sworn law enforcement i mean
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
they can get on a plane and travel
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
you know out of state to interview
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
somebody incarcerated in another state
 
00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:26.150 align:start position:0%
somebody incarcerated in another state
that's

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
wants to confess to crimes or has
 
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
information but
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
no they're full-time uh full-time
 
00:40:31.359 --> 00:40:32.390 align:start position:0%
no they're full-time uh full-time
employees

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
and there's always a attorney general um
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
who is uh embedded um with the cold case
 
00:40:39.359 --> 00:40:39.750 align:start position:0%
who is uh embedded um with the cold case
unit

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
unit
 
00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
and obviously you know they they are not
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
going out and making arrests they're
 
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
working hand in hand with the attorney
 
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
generals on this
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
just like any other homicide
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
investigation and and i will say they
 
00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
have done
 
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
they have had some some great success
 
00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.030 align:start position:0%
they have had some some great success
and

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
um it just you can never stop
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
persevering in these
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%

victims
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
are continuously asking what is being
 
00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.790 align:start position:0%
are continuously asking what is being
done

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
and providing information so it's a lot
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%

i was going to skip over to 4 30 to
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
circle back around the urine and codis

are there questions before that uh yes i
 
00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:39.750 align:start position:0%
are there questions before that uh yes i
did

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
i did have a question um
 
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
this is on page 408
 
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
well first of all i didn't understand
 
00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
the nhsp join the new hampshire
 
00:42:00.839 --> 00:42:04.550 align:start position:0%
the nhsp join the new hampshire
clique

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
so that is um that is a highway
 
00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
office of highway safety funded program
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
that funds additional um
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
additional um it's really encouraging
 
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
individuals to
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
use their seat belt so because we don't
 
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
have a seat belt law
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
that's funding to support promoting the
 
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
use of seat belts
 
00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:29.839 align:start position:0%
especially and also enforcing child
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
safety restraint laws
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh in the state so that's that's an
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
annual grant
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
that state police receives from the
 
00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and um your division of state
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
what does the state police do that the
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
in what regards representative umberger
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
the permits in licensing
 
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
commonly um referred at times to the gun
 
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
line licenses
 
00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:06.079 align:start position:0%
you know we do the backgrounds and the
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
permits for out-of-state pistol permits
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
new um sales for handguns
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
security guard licenses those types of
 
00:43:15.119 --> 00:43:17.270 align:start position:0%
security guard licenses those types of
um

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
apartments so really it's completely
 
00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
different from any dmv functions
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
okay so all right that those are the
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
people i visited
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
okay so this is um
 
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
primarily for uh gun licenses
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
yeah primarily gun licenses there's also
 
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:42.870 align:start position:0%
yeah primarily gun licenses there's also
um

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
licenses for private investigators and
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
security guards and those operations are
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
handled through here
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
um and then um also the
 
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
the gun line so when uh when an
 
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
individual is trying to
 
00:43:59.190 --> 00:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh wants to purchase uh a firearm
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
um the the federally licensed
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
reseller has to call the gun line for
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
the criminal check that's
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
that gets processed through here this
 
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
this is where we have three new
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
positions to help support that function
 
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we can meet the demand
 
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
for those services and reduce wait times
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
so were those new positions or shuffled
 
00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.790 align:start position:0%
so were those new positions or shuffled
positions

00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
those were new positions we had roughly
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative humber
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
i want to say 65
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
to 68 don't hold me to this percent
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
increase in the sales so
 
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
we've been extremely busy in there
 
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
working with the courts not only on the
 
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
purchases but return of the firearms
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
so we've looked at our internal
 
00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
processes and essentially we there was
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely no way we
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
could keep up with the statutory
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
requirements on um
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
sales on three business days return of
 
00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
the firearms
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
and that's why we had the attorney
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
general i i give
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
i give him credit for outlining a
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
process because there's nothing in
 
00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
statute that says what the extent of a
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
background check is
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
it just says we may be the point of
 
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
contact so
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
we were doing a lot more than
 
00:45:18.069 --> 00:45:18.079 align:start position:0%
we really you know could and we had to
 
00:45:18.079 --> 00:45:18.950 align:start position:0%
we really you know could and we had to
balance

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
balance
 
00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
the right of someone to purchase and
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
have their firearm returned
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
with the need to do a a safe background
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
check so we have
 
00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
something codified now which is a good
 
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
roadmap but even with that
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
when we looked at the numbers we said we
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely needed these positions to
 
00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
keep up with what we're required to do
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:44.309 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
so the what is that state law
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
or federal law well well it's
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
it's there's it's state law and there
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
are federal laws that we have to
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
adhere to on the background but there's
 
00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
you know there's requirements for 14
 
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
days on
 
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
you know we have to turn these permits
 
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
around we have to give these approvals
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
like the ffls within three business days
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
if we don't
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
approve it or deny it if it stays
 
00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:12.150 align:start position:0%
approve it or deny it if it stays
delayed

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
delayed
 
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
the purchase can go through so we just
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
were not
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
you know we weren't meeting the
 
00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.349 align:start position:0%
you know we weren't meeting the
requirements

00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
those and that's based by by the
 
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
business purchases the federal but we
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
we follow that
 
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh madam chair am i
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
correct commissioner i
 
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
i i my understanding is that there's
 
00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.030 align:start position:0%
i i my understanding is that there's
been

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
um some complaints um
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
from uh gun purchasers or maybe firearms
 
00:46:49.119 --> 00:46:50.230 align:start position:0%
from uh gun purchasers or maybe firearms
dealers

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
dealers
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
about the delays that you refer to and
 
00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:53.510 align:start position:0%
about the delays that you refer to and
there's

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
apparently there's even been some
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
suggestion i don't know if it actually
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
made it to legislation
 
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh proposal uh that uh as i understand
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
the way the system works now if it's a
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
handgun purchase
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
the the background check is done by the
 
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
state if it's a
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
long gun purchase it's done by the fbi
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
and that there was some suggestion that
 
00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
the state ought to get out of that
 
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
business and let the fbi do everything
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
um uh which in my to my way of thinking
 
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:30.079 align:start position:0%
very bad idea but apparently there is
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
there is at least some
 
00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
some suggestion uh
 
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
to that effect is that is that am i
 
00:47:38.549 --> 00:47:38.559 align:start position:0%
correct in that
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
you're you're accurate on both so the
 
00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:41.839 align:start position:0%
first um
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
complaints yes we have been um dealing
 
00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:45.270 align:start position:0%
complaints yes we have been um dealing
with

00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
many many complaints uh for our
 
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
backlogs and delays and so we've been
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
addressing that
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
with the um with the business businesses
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
so we've looked at our internal process
 
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
as i said we've
 
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
shifted people we've added people we put
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
temporary employees in there to keep up
 
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
you know this increase in sales and
 
00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:06.549 align:start position:0%
you know this increase in sales and
volume

00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:06.559 align:start position:0%
volume
 
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
in and with the courts addressing we
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
have to do the check
 
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
which goes back to the court so that
 
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
they can return the firearm back to the
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
person that it was taken from
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
but along the lines of discussion yes it
 
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
has been discussion on
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
sending this all to the fbi because the
 
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
statute 159 says we may
 
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
become the point of contact this goes
 
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
back to
 
00:48:31.589 --> 00:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
when brady initiated that the state was
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
the point of contact for just the
 
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
handgun so
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
what i have said um in my conversations
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
is i believe
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
we are going to do the best we can to
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
maintain it and keep it because i think
 
00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:42.549 align:start position:0%
maintain it and keep it because i think
our

00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
check gives a couple more layers of
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
safety than the fbi check
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
and that is we query against a list that
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
comes from the court
 
00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
of folks that aren't in ncic that have
 
00:48:53.359 --> 00:48:53.829 align:start position:0%
of folks that aren't in ncic that have
um

00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
that have restraining orders domestic
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
orders because they don't have all the
 
00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:58.630 align:start position:0%
orders because they don't have all the
information

00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
and we also do a more thorough check of
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire state record
 
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
because any conviction that isn't
 
00:49:06.549 --> 00:49:06.559 align:start position:0%
supported by fingerprints
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
might not be um queried or
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
are caught in the next check so um we're
 
00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:14.559 align:start position:0%
going to do the best we can with it i
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
think our check is
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
is uh offers uh more safety
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
and um but again you're correct um and i
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
don't know where that
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
is i know there's been discussion but um
 
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
as of now we
 
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:28.559 align:start position:0%
we have it and we're gonna continue to
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
just do the best we can with it
 
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
right follow up if i may yes please
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
and no i i appreciate your your response
 
00:49:36.559 --> 00:49:37.349 align:start position:0%
and no i i appreciate your your response
commissioner

00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
as i understand i i think uh based upon
 
00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
my discussions with uh
 
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
with uh the governor's council that the
 
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
governor strongly supports having the
 
00:49:49.109 --> 00:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
state retain
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
this check and for the reason for the
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
reasons that you stated and
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
placing more responsibility in
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
washington as opposed to leaving it
 
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
local is just
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
generally a bad idea um so i i
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
strongly support what what you propose
 
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
yeah and i think what i hear the biggest
 
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
you know this there's the check
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
itself but i think what um what the
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
what the citizens want is the ability to
 
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
talk to somebody if they have a problem
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
they are denied you know what
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
what what is the problem so it's that
 
00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
customer service it's the ability to
 
00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
pick up the phone and say why am i in a
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
delayed status and maybe you know
 
00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:30.559 align:start position:0%
resolve it so
 
00:50:33.109 --> 00:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
that's exactly exactly no you're exactly
 
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
right i think
 
00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative murray you
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um just for
 
00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
information do you happen to know how
 
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
many granite staters
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
own guns and what's the average number
 
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
of guns that a granite stater owns
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
i don't have that number
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
i can give you and i will provide
 
00:50:56.549 --> 00:50:56.559 align:start position:0%
through steve
 
00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:00.559 align:start position:0%
the number of um transactions that we've
 
00:51:00.559 --> 00:51:01.030 align:start position:0%
the number of um transactions that we've
done

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
that shows the increase but i can't
 
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
speak that would be impossible because
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
you don't know there's no registry on
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
that and you don't know
 
00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
what's we don't keep that data so i
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even begin to
 
00:51:16.309 --> 00:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
try and answer that i don't think i
 
00:51:18.549 --> 00:51:18.559 align:start position:0%
could and i don't think the data exists
 
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative heath you have
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
i do thank you madam chair um with
 
00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
regard to
 
00:51:29.589 --> 00:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
background checks that's a pretty
 
00:51:29.599 --> 00:51:30.390 align:start position:0%
background checks that's a pretty
complex

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
complex
 
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
area because every single one of our
 
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
um teacher uh preparation programs
 
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
there are huge demands on that
 
00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.069 align:start position:0%
there are huge demands on that
department

00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
because um people can't hire
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
a new teacher without a background round
 
00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:48.710 align:start position:0%
a new teacher without a background round
check

00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
check
 
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
we can't have send our student teachers
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
into schools without a background check
 
00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
so how
 
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
is your office handling
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
the demand and um
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
what suffers when you have to reduce
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
um staff in that area sure well
 
00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:11.839 align:start position:0%
so so this comes up a lot background
 
00:52:11.839 --> 00:52:12.309 align:start position:0%
so so this comes up a lot background
check

00:52:12.309 --> 00:52:12.319 align:start position:0%
check
 
00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
what does that mean that that means
 
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
different things to different people
 
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
so we do a background investigation for
 
00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:19.750 align:start position:0%
so we do a background investigation for
uh

00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
a new trooper so the background
 
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
investigation could include
 
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
going out and interviewing you know
 
00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
former employees and looking at school
 
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
records and looking at credit checks and
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
speaking to neighbors and you know not
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
just verifying information but
 
00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
going out and proactively looking at
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
somebody's background
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
what you are speaking to what we look at
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
with the um
 
00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
with the with the transactions is a
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
check of um
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
the next check so we do the ncic check
 
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
anything fingerprint fingerprint based
 
00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:52.549 align:start position:0%
anything fingerprint fingerprint based
supported

00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
supported
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
and we look at the state criminal
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
history now i will share this with you
 
00:53:00.069 --> 00:53:00.079 align:start position:0%
there could be a conviction in
 
00:53:02.549 --> 00:53:02.559 align:start position:0%
say the state of ohio where they didn't
 
00:53:02.559 --> 00:53:03.829 align:start position:0%
say the state of ohio where they didn't
fingerprint

00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
fingerprint
 
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't show up on the fbi check and
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
unless you check
 
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
all 50 individual states so what we have
 
00:53:11.589 --> 00:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
done is we look at
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
the state that they are born the state
 
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
that they reside in
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the state of new
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire and we do the next check
 
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
and we think that that is uh
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
comprehensive it's reasonable
 
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
and um you know but again
 
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
the fbi check what is going to come up
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
on that is going to be based on
 
00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:32.710 align:start position:0%
on that is going to be based on
fingerprints

00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
fingerprints
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
so if somebody was arrested and
 
00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
convicted but the fingerprints were not
 
00:53:36.319 --> 00:53:37.109 align:start position:0%
convicted but the fingerprints were not
taken

00:53:37.109 --> 00:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
taken
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
that would not show up unless you
 
00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
queried individually on
 
00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
state to state thank you so we handle it
 
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
it's automated and um so we have like a
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
federated check now when you put the
 
00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
name and date of birth in so that it
 
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
rolls through them
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
and uh if i may inquire a little bit
 
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:54.390 align:start position:0%
and uh if i may inquire a little bit
more

00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
madam care certainly um
 
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
with regard to the background checks
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
for weapons um it seems that there's an
 
00:54:04.079 --> 00:54:04.950 align:start position:0%
for weapons um it seems that there's an
increasing

00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
increasing
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
number of weapons across our state um
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
how deep and how how
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
just based on what you just said to me
 
00:54:18.309 --> 00:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
how do we know
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
that in an individual maybe who moved to
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire from another state
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
um is really a person who should be able
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
to be licensed to carry a weapon
 
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
well there's no requirement for a
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
a license so a background check rather
 
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so i guess it's two sep separate so
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
the state does not require that but if
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
they were going to purchase they would
 
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
go through the same
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
check that i just spoke of would check
 
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
the knicks would check the state
 
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
so we would do the standard um
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
we'd do the standard federal check so if
 
00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
you were to walk into
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
and purchase a long gun you know a rifle
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
that would go to the fbi so we have
 
00:55:05.109 --> 00:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
talked to the head of the sieges of
 
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
the fbi and i'm sorry just click my
 
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
mouse and we are doing
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
we're doing i would say i would say
 
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
we're doing two
 
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
but you know so i does that answer your
 
00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:24.549 align:start position:0%
but you know so i does that answer your
question

00:55:24.549 --> 00:55:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
my because my concern was that is
 
00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
somebody coming to our state
 
00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:32.559 align:start position:0%
um and because there isn't well i guess
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
the the federal
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
background check would cover every state
 
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
and that would be reported back to you
 
00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
just i was concerned that some things
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
aren't showing up
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
on the background check because of the
 
00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:46.839 align:start position:0%
nature of
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
based on somebody's background yeah and
 
00:55:56.069 --> 00:55:56.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of times what causes these delays
 
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
um you know and representative lin can
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
appreciate this
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
is our team sees a conviction
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
in it's it's not clear in the record
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
whether that conviction is a
 
00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:08.710 align:start position:0%
whether that conviction is a
disqualifier

00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
disqualifier
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
for example it could be a dwi
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
within the last 12 months is it alcohol
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
related or is it drug related if it's
 
00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
drugs it could be a potential
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
disqualifier they have to stop
 
00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
delay further investigate they see a
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
simple assault
 
00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
is it dv related just by looking at the
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
record they're unsure they stop
 
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
delay they have to make a call pull the
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
rope pull the file out
 
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
so what we are looking at now um in in
 
00:56:38.549 --> 00:56:38.559 align:start position:0%
you know our continuing talks with j1 is
 
00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
ensuring that
 
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
when the circuit courts have a
 
00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
conviction if it is a disqualifier it's
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
duly noted
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
so that it when it goes from the circuit
 
00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
court to our
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
criminal records unit and it's uploaded
 
00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
at night it can get
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
uploaded correctly to the nix index so
 
00:56:56.309 --> 00:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
it's all about making sure that what is
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
a disqualifier is is
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
is um categorized
 
00:57:06.069 --> 00:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions on this
 
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
okay uh seeing none um
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
representative murray what's your next
 
00:57:15.359 --> 00:57:16.789 align:start position:0%
representative murray what's your next
page

00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:16.799 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
um i was going to 431 and a little bit
 
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
and just if we can
 
00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit more about what
 
00:57:24.549 --> 00:57:24.559 align:start position:0%
they're going to need in the lab
 
00:57:25.829 --> 00:57:25.839 align:start position:0%
that seems to be such a critical
 
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
shortage so we've got the
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
um you know there's a a cut here
 
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
they spoke that they needed additional
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
people around the lab so i think
 
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
that's kind of scattered throughout i
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
wondered if we could just go back to
 
00:57:42.549 --> 00:57:42.559 align:start position:0%
their prioritized needs around that okay
 
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
before yep before we do that
 
00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
um i want to ask about um
 
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
operation safe commute
 
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
that is um
 
00:58:00.309 --> 00:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
oh i s okay is
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's another highway safety
 
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
grant um
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
okay that's all i need thank you yep
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
so 431 is one of three accounting units
 
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
that supports the lab so this is the
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
urine and codis
 
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
area so it's focusing on the dna
 
00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.750 align:start position:0%
area so it's focusing on the dna
database

00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
database
 
00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
processing and then also testing
 
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
urine for samples of alcohol and
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
controlled drugs
 
00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
in this specific accounting unit um
 
00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
there is one
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
of the of the unfunded positions in the
 
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
lab there's one unfunded position here
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
and these are in our top priorities to
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
have filled
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
because obviously this this falls under
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
the lab is really if you kind of think
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
of our
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
of our lab we have our forensics lab and
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
we have our toxicology lab
 
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
um and so the toxicology lab includes
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
this area this is a component thereof
 
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
um and so that's the lab that deals with
 
00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:06.549 align:start position:0%
um and so that's the lab that deals with
drugs

00:59:06.549 --> 00:59:06.559 align:start position:0%
drugs
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
um and and and testing drugs and those
 
00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
types of
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
of activities and that's clearly that
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
that's an area that's that's important
 
00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
maintain the the volume of of
 
00:59:20.549 --> 00:59:20.559 align:start position:0%
testing requests that we're receiving
 
00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
because backlogs there can have problems
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
especially if we
 
00:59:26.309 --> 00:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
move into um move into the court system
 
00:59:26.319 --> 00:59:26.789 align:start position:0%
move into um move into the court system
there

00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
so there's one of those unfunded
 
00:59:30.549 --> 00:59:30.559 align:start position:0%
positions here um
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
it's critical that we that we we get
 
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
that funded if there's funding available
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
to maintain the uh services in in this
 
00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
toxicology area
 
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
the other sections are later in the
 
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
budget book and that's where the rest of
 
00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:44.839 align:start position:0%
the lab positions are
 
00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
um but they're all they're all critical
 
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's difficult um
 
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
i guess you know i just want to make
 
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
sure we keep um
 
00:59:58.630 --> 00:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
those positions in our minds in terms of
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
how important it is to the work you do
 
01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
um can you speak to uh fourth
 
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh page 435 that declare disaster
 
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
federal funds sorry uh i believe
 
01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:12.839 align:start position:0%
representative heath had a question
 
01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
on uh the urine and codis
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
apology so
 
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
here i just um my question is
 
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
um what would be the lag time
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
based on the cuts um
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's i mean if you look at the positions
 
01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
i mean i think there was six
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
criminalists and three administrative
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
two intake and one i think an
 
01:00:42.309 --> 01:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
administrative assistant
 
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
it's hard to really quantify based on
 
01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
what's coming in but
 
01:00:50.069 --> 01:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
clearly there would cause delays in
 
01:00:50.079 --> 01:00:51.190 align:start position:0%
clearly there would cause delays in
those

01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
in those areas i mean we wouldn't be
 
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
budgeting we wouldn't
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
for these positions so the exact time
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
a week or it it's based on how much
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
what's coming in you know so
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
um it's hard to give an exact day but we
 
01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
can say that it would cause delays
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
a follow-up madam chair certainly
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
so we've seen a reduction um
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
in the number of overdose deaths
 
01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh from the pandemic well
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
the pandemic has reduced the the
 
01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.390 align:start position:0%
the pandemic has reduced the the
utilization

01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
utilization
 
01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
of of drugs it appears but
 
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
i don't know how long that's going to
 
01:01:30.319 --> 01:01:31.270 align:start position:0%
i don't know how long that's going to
last

01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
and i hear concerns that that come
 
01:01:37.829 --> 01:01:37.839 align:start position:0%
from our local police departments um
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
about the the amount of time for
 
01:01:40.559 --> 01:01:42.069 align:start position:0%
about the the amount of time for
processing

01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
processing
 
01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
when it comes to certain things and i
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
think the county has some of those
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
issues as well so are we just going to
 
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
exacerbate that problem
 
01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
further um as as we come out of the
 
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic and
 
01:01:58.230 --> 01:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
and we're seeing an increase again in
 
01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
those areas
 
01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
which i'd love to say we won't see it
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
increase but i i fear that we will
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
yeah so i'll i'll take that i mean
 
01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
clearly we want to fund these positions
 
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
i mean that's that's our priority uh as
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
steve said
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
you know we we are going to see a
 
01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799 align:start position:0%
reduction in the deaths this year i
 
01:02:16.799 --> 01:02:17.589 align:start position:0%
reduction in the deaths this year i
believe

01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
um i can't give the exact number but um
 
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.029 align:start position:0%
um i can't give the exact number but um
but

01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.039 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
by no way shape or form should we you
 
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.150 align:start position:0%
by no way shape or form should we you
know

01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
be raising a victory flag at this point
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
i mean we're dealing with
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
you know significant increases in
 
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
methamphetamine our narcan
 
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
administrations are up so we are seeing
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
the reductions in deaths but
 
01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
um again we are we are not uh
 
01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
in a position where we want to take our
 
01:02:42.789 --> 01:02:42.799 align:start position:0%
our our foot off the gas here
 
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
we've got we've got a lot of work to
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
continue to do here and
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
um you know i think this is uh a
 
01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:50.150 align:start position:0%
um you know i think this is uh a
relatively

01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
relatively
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
you know minor adjustments in the lab
 
01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
but if we can get those positions
 
01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
uh melissa staples and her crew will
 
01:02:59.029 --> 01:02:59.039 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of the local
 
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
law enforcement they also help the
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
federal agencies as you know
 
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
but again the critical areas for them is
 
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
making sure there's
 
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
lab you know analysis are done for grand
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
jury and they need them for court and
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
there's deadlines
 
01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
and they have a they know how to
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
prioritize uh
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
and and they will meet those those those
 
01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
demands you know what really gets them
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative heath is when they have a
 
01:03:21.359 --> 01:03:22.230 align:start position:0%
representative heath is when they have a
homicide

01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
homicide
 
01:03:25.109 --> 01:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
investigation and they can have you know
 
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
200 plus
 
01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
pieces of evidence exhibits i mean
 
01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
that's when it gets complicated and
 
01:03:30.799 --> 01:03:31.349 align:start position:0%
that's when it gets complicated and
complex

01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
complex
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
crime scenes that have you know multiple
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh multiple crime scenes with you know
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
various degrees of evidence that has to
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
be recovered but
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
but again we the lab is in good shape if
 
01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
we can
 
01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
get these positions where they need to
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
be and we're expanding to increase our
 
01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
capacity with uh with digital evidence
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
as we've talked about before but we have
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
a good we have a great lab director
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
melissa took over for tim pifer and
 
01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
we know the vision and the direction we
 
01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative murray if you would like
 
01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um so on 435
 
01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
is that coveted related money over the
 
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
next two years or what is it
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
declared disaster federal funds um it's
 
01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:19.039 align:start position:0%
a mixture
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
so um this is a mixture of cobit related
 
01:04:22.559 --> 01:04:22.789 align:start position:0%
so um this is a mixture of cobit related
and

01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:25.589 --> 01:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
any presidentially declared disasters so
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
when we
 
01:04:30.549 --> 01:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
have major flooding major snow events
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
that in a presidentially declared
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
disaster occurs this is where that
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
funding goes
 
01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
the the again this is an area where our
 
01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:39.349 align:start position:0%
the the again this is an area where our
past

01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
past
 
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
practice has been to not budget these
 
01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:42.789 align:start position:0%
practice has been to not budget these
accounts

01:04:42.789 --> 01:04:42.799 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
and bring those to fiscal because for a
 
01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
while the disasters were few and far
 
01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.549 align:start position:0%
while the disasters were few and far
between

01:04:48.549 --> 01:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
right now we have i believe it's five
 
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
open disasters that we're still
 
01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.069 align:start position:0%
open disasters that we're still
processing

01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
processing
 
01:04:58.390 --> 01:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
reimbursements on including the covet
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
disaster which is still ongoing
 
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
and so um we do expect funding here
 
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
this is this is again it's the the
 
01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
estimation is the challenging part
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
because we don't know when coveted will
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
end and we also don't know if
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
next week there is a there's a weather
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
disaster um that would
 
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
bring new funding into the state um but
 
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
this gives us a starting point
 
01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
and um and and it's just a slightly
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
different approach that we're taking to
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
budgeting these accounts
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
this go around around some of the
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
disasters and i'm thinking culvert is
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
probably a more appropriate
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
um potentially example of this
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
does this fund does these monies ease
 
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
the strain on you
 
01:05:41.829 --> 01:05:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
um you know i mean it's just
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
no uh i i don't think they do so
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
the the these funds are exclusively
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
for um response immediate response
 
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
to the disaster and then maybe some
 
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
um some um additional
 
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
additional costs associated with
 
01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
rebuilding um
 
01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
those in the infrastructure that was
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
damaged as a result of this
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
of the disaster so so they don't support
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
um the department of safety in any way
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
we're really the administrator of these
 
01:06:20.069 --> 01:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
funds and we work closely with the
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
locals and the municipalities
 
01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
and other state agencies also who would
 
01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
be eligible
 
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure that um they're getting um
 
01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
the most federal support that they
 
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
that they can that's eligible under the
 
01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
law so that money goes to like
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
for repairing a bridge possibly yeah
 
01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
repairing a bridge a culvert that washed
 
01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:39.190 align:start position:0%
repairing a bridge a culvert that washed
out

01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
out

talked about trying to advocate for one
position

01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
on the camera program you can only
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
imagine the amount of administrative
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
work that's ongoing
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
in hsem not only for these five but
 
01:06:59.349 --> 01:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
you know it will be years of uh
 
01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
administrative work in
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
billing and paying and processing all
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
the requests
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative petry you have a question
 
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you madam chair uh
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
i got a question about block grant
 
01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.190 align:start position:0%
i got a question about block grant
versus

01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
versus
 
01:07:19.349 --> 01:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
uh having to meet all these requirements
 
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
have you ever figured what the cost is
 
01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
of trying to meet those requirements to
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
from the federal government or other
 
01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.270 align:start position:0%
from the federal government or other
sources

01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
sources
 
01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
so um i'm i i'm not sure i think
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't administer any block
 
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
grants in particular i do know that
 
01:07:37.029 --> 01:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
those do have
 
01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
certain restrictions um these funds in
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
particular for the disasters are
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
relatively broad
 
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
so it starts with um it starts with an
 
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
estimate of what the costs were
 
01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
the damage done within a county by
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
county and if it exceeds a certain
 
01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
uh threshold set by the federal
 
01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
government then
 
01:07:58.950 --> 01:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
then the governor can request that the
 
01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
president declare a disaster and make
 
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
these funds available to us
 
01:08:05.109 --> 01:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
and then they just have to meet certain
 
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
requirements as far as was it the
 
01:08:09.029 --> 01:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
disaster that caused this
 
01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
this issue with the infrastructure so
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
it's treated a little bit differently
 
01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
than my understanding of the block
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
grants but but then again we don't
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
administer block brands so my
 
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
understanding is limited there
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
well what i what i meant to say if i
 
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
could follow up
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
is that uh how much of those strings
 
01:08:25.199 --> 01:08:26.470 align:start position:0%
is that uh how much of those strings
cost

01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
if they eat maybe block grant wasn't the
 
01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
best uh
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
best uh way to express it or the strings
 
01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
that the federal government puts on
 
01:08:35.669 --> 01:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
because there is a
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
there is a cost it's probably a very
 
01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
significant cost to try to meet
 
01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
all the matrix of the requirements
 
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
so um the first you know each project
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
has a 25 match so there is a real cost
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
to start
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
um and then it's that administrative
 
01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:54.309 align:start position:0%
um and then it's that administrative
burden

01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
burden
 
01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
um similar to what i was speaking about
 
01:08:58.390 --> 01:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
with the with the camera project
 
01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
it's the time spent administratively
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
reviewing the applications
 
01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
reviewing the projects comparing those
 
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
for allowability for
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
um that particular event um processing
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
the paperwork
 
01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
entering into the contracts um
 
01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
submitting the
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
the the payments through the system we
 
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
we don't have a
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
um i don't have a an
 
01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
estimate of of what that cost is because
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
it does vary by
 
01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
disaster but to your point there is an
 
01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
administrative burden
 
01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
um fema has continued to push that
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
burden down onto the states
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
and so the um division of homeland
 
01:09:36.719 --> 01:09:37.829 align:start position:0%
and so the um division of homeland
security

01:09:37.829 --> 01:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
security
 
01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
is really the one that bears the brunt
 
01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:43.759 align:start position:0%
we there are management costs that are
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
available to
 
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh to us to utilize to hire positions to
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
help us process those
 
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
so those go above and beyond the
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
disaster we can offer
 
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
we can hire some individuals we can use
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
those costs to to buy
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
computers and equipment and and we try
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
to maximize that as best as we can
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
but yes there is there's still going to
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
be some cost to
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
to the state and to the locals for for
 
01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
processing those funds and making sure
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:10:14.229 --> 01:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
remain in compliance um you know an
 
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
example might be
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
davis bacon law which requires that
 
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
certain contractors uh there's a minimum
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
pay amount
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
for certain projects um that might come
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
into play depending on the cost of the
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
project that they're working on
 
01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
so there there's a there's an example of
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
some of that compliance
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
piece that that we would need to
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
consider and the locals would need to
 
01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:34.870 align:start position:0%
consider and the locals would need to
consider

01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
what's the risk and what's the benefit
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
of requesting these funds
 
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
because all of this is voluntary the
 
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
funds are available
 
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
people can apply for them or they can
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
choose not to if they determine the
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
compliance requirements are too
 
01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:49.669 align:start position:0%
compliance requirements are too
stringent

01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
stringent
 
01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative heath i'm sorry thank
 
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
01:10:58.870 --> 01:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
just in in response to that isn't it
 
01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
true though that with the federal
 
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
dollars that come into the state of new
 
01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:02.950 align:start position:0%
dollars that come into the state of new
hampshire

01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
that normally it's the usual and
 
01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
customary practice
 
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
that administration fees can be
 
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
included usually they have some kind of
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
a percentage
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
um that you're allowed is that true it
 
01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.590 align:start position:0%
um that you're allowed is that true it
varies

01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
varies
 
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
by program to program but yes often
 
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
there is a there's an administrative cap
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
it's usually a percentage
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
5 10 whatever whatever that might be
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
program by program
 
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
the reality is that um that
 
01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
administrative cap is not
 
01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
typically sufficient uh to to to to
 
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
fully administer the program
 
01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
and so that's where additional costs
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
come in um
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
but to what extent that that's going to
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
vary also
 
01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
if i may madam chair absolutely
 
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
it is from just going through your
 
01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
budget as many times as i have
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
it would appear to me that
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
you have had to zero out so many lines
 
01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
in the general fund
 
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
and the um
 
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
the note that we see continuously is
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
to what extent would your department
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
your your agency would be devastated
 
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
if you were to deny the use of federal
 
01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.149 align:start position:0%
if you were to deny the use of federal
funds

01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
to your department that's
 
01:12:31.669 --> 01:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
that's a that that's a big question
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
certain areas
 
01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
would absolutely be devastated um
 
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh homeland security and emergency
 
01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:45.350 align:start position:0%
uh homeland security and emergency
management

01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
that division um our our operating costs
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
are funded by federal funds in there
 
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
that would we we would not be able to
 
01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:56.310 align:start position:0%
that would we we would not be able to
function

01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
function
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
homeland security would not exist
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
without those funds that that's probably
 
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
the biggest
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
biggest impact the second largest
 
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
impact would be um related to
 
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
traffic safety and and traffic
 
01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement and highway enforcement and
 
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
those types of activities
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
we have the office of highway safety
 
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
receives just under four million dollars
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
every year
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
from nitsa and that's for traffic safety
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
specific activities that's money that
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
goes to locals
 
01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
to increase traffic enforcement in the
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
towns that's money that goes to state
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
police to increase
 
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
traffic enforcement on on the
 
01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:35.270 align:start position:0%
traffic enforcement on on the
interstates

01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
interstates
 
01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
um that goes to support promotional
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
activities to
 
01:13:40.229 --> 01:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
to encourage people to wear their seat
 
01:13:42.630 --> 01:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
belt uh even though it's not required
 
01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
so there would there would be an impact
 
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
on highway safety if those funds weren't
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
available to us
 
01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's all of the fema money that
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
comes and supports the locals hazard
 
01:13:59.430 --> 01:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
mitigation so after a disaster
 
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
there's additional money that becomes
 
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
released for locals to apply for
 
01:14:05.669 --> 01:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
um for projects to prevent future
 
01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
disasters because if you prevent it from
 
01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:08.229 align:start position:0%
disasters because if you prevent it from
happening

01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
it saves you money um in in in in the
 
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
future because you're not worrying about
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
repairing things
 
01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
you're strengthening your infrastructure
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
that funding would go away
 
01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
so there are it's intertwined within our
 
01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
department but not operationally
 
01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
the operational pieces is homeland
 
01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:27.669 align:start position:0%
the operational pieces is homeland
security

01:14:27.669 --> 01:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
security
 
01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
all the other divisions would continue
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
to function operationally
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
it's just that the scale and level of um
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
activities would decline because a lot
 
01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
of those are federally funded
 
01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
thank you here
 
01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me just a second mary if you look
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
at uh
 
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
page 523 it shows that uh
 
01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
we're getting uh 30 million in federal
 
01:14:52.159 --> 01:14:53.669 align:start position:0%
we're getting uh 30 million in federal
funds

01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
so we would we would
 
01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
have to make that up
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh and uh you know that's
 
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
if we think we got problems now add
 
01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:08.550 align:start position:0%
if we think we got problems now add
another

01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
add another 30 million to uh to that
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
thank you chair i really agree and um as
 
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
as a person who worked extensively with
 
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
federal dollars in education
 
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
it was my experience that the federal
 
01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:24.149 align:start position:0%
it was my experience that the federal
dollars

01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
allowed um you could have but those
 
01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:27.590 align:start position:0%
allowed um you could have but those
funds

01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
and and and what i've seen that you've
 
01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:31.590 align:start position:0%
and and and what i've seen that you've
done

01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
in your budget so effectively is
 
01:15:33.679 --> 01:15:34.630 align:start position:0%
in your budget so effectively is
combining

01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:34.640 align:start position:0%
combining
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
local of the general funds along with
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
the federal funds
 
01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
to be make and i have to say to your
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
um to compliment you on the effective
 
01:15:44.719 --> 01:15:45.270 align:start position:0%
um to compliment you on the effective
use

01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
of really employing every single dollar
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
um from the highway fund revolving fund
 
01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:52.229 align:start position:0%
um from the highway fund revolving fund
and

01:15:52.229 --> 01:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:54.630 --> 01:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's quite extraordinary to see
 
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
what you have managed to do
 
01:15:58.630 --> 01:15:58.640 align:start position:0%
with the amount of general funds that
 
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
that are in this budget
 
01:16:03.189 --> 01:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
so just a comment thank you
 
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative petry you have a question
 
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
well it's more of a more more of a
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
comment uh
 
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
if we left those funds in new hampshire
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
instead of taxing uh the
 
01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
you know our businesses and whatever and
 
01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
send it to washington and
 
01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
paying for all that bureaucracy i would
 
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
leave it to steve and commissioner quinn
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
to make better decisions and easier
 
01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:24.950 align:start position:0%
to make better decisions and easier
decisions

01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you interest interesting
 
01:16:27.199 --> 01:16:28.229 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you interest interesting
comment

01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:16:32.149 --> 01:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
okay can i could i add one
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
one point um this is a follow-up from
 
01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
representative heath
 
01:16:37.990 --> 01:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
you had asked a question in our last
 
01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
meeting um
 
01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
and and you kind of caught me off guard
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
and you were asking about moe's
 
01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort and um and i and i
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
stated no we don't have any of those
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
um that's not accurate um
 
01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
i it's i so i want to clarify that i
 
01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason i was focused on
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
fema and i was thinking fema fema fema
 
01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine with covet and all
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
the money that's where my head has been
 
01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
but um thinking now talking about
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
office of highway safety office of
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
highway safety there is an moe
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
um we have mix app grants that support
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
commercial enforcement
 
01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
we have an moe there um and the other
 
01:17:18.630 --> 01:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
one i can think of
 
01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
is uh the recreational boater safety
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
grant from the coast guard
 
01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
for marine patrol there's one there as
 
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
well what my statement afterwards still
 
01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:29.510 align:start position:0%
well what my statement afterwards still
stands

01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
stands
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
we're not in any jeopardy based on the
 
01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
positions and
 
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
that aren't funded here of not meeting
 
01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
those but i wanted to clarify that as i
 
01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
as i thought about it just now and i
 
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
apologize for that confusion oh thank
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
you that was a big concern of mine
 
01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
so representative murray
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
all right um this is a simple question i
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
hope i'm on 4th
 
01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
38th what is rim c rim c
 
01:17:57.510 --> 01:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
is the radiological instrument
 
01:17:57.520 --> 01:17:58.709 align:start position:0%
is the radiological instrument
maintenance

01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
and and collabora uh collaboration um
 
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh calibration
 
01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry radiological instrument
 
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
maintenance and calibration unit
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
and so they literally um calibrate
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
radiation detecting devices that are
 
01:18:17.189 --> 01:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
used to
 
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
um provide the monitoring services in
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
and around the seabrook area
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
i've got a ways to move on if there are
 
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
other things that are
 
01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
no you're doing fine keep going um i
 
01:18:34.149 --> 01:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
think on page 443 we already talked
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
about the hazard mitigation program
 
01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
you mentioned you included the fema
 
01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:40.630 align:start position:0%
you mentioned you included the fema
there

01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
yep and and the one piece there is um
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:18:46.229 --> 01:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
again kind of talking about requirements
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
hazard mitigation funds
 
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
those are those become available after a
 
01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:51.430 align:start position:0%
those are those become available after a
disaster

01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
disaster
 
01:18:53.669 --> 01:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
and the local needs to have a plan in
 
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
place that's approved before they can
 
01:18:55.199 --> 01:18:56.229 align:start position:0%
place that's approved before they can
apply

01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
apply
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
so it's not money that can just be just
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
be spent without without a clear plan in
 
01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:05.430 align:start position:0%
be spent without without a clear plan in
place

01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to 471 unless someone has
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
something before 471 i think this is
 
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
an accounting issue but anything before
 
01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:15.350 align:start position:0%
an accounting issue but anything before
then

01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:17.189 --> 01:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
i don't have anything oh married uh
 
01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative i do
 
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
on page 427
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
um in terms of general fund um
 
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
amounts for the detective bureau i see
 
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
that there's a big
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
increase in that and my second question
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
is and i can't find the exact page
 
01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
but there's um a rather large
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
retirement amount and
 
01:19:45.910 --> 01:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
it was zeroed out of the general funds
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
my big question is where and how are you
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
replace those funds because that is
 
01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:54.149 align:start position:0%
replace those funds because that is
certainly

01:19:54.149 --> 01:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
an issue um so thank you sure
 
01:19:58.709 --> 01:19:58.719 align:start position:0%
um so the first question about the
 
01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:00.719 align:start position:0%
detective bureau um
 
01:20:03.990 --> 01:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
that um the the general fund
 
01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
component um increased there's there's
 
01:20:08.950 --> 01:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
two components to this account one is
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
and one is an agency income source that
 
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
agency income source is from
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
rsa 263 52 it's the driver training fund
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
and that allows that that gives the
 
01:20:23.189 --> 01:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner the authority to
 
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
um fund anything within safety up to 1.5
 
01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
and and that has been a source that
 
01:20:32.229 --> 01:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
we've utilized in this accounting unit
 
01:20:32.239 --> 01:20:32.550 align:start position:0%
we've utilized in this accounting unit
for

01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
for years the the the that means that
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
the general fund needs to bear
 
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
any increases because that's a cap and
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
so the costs the additional costs
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
associated with salary and benefits
 
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
um and the general you know they're not
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
significant but there are some increases
 
01:20:48.239 --> 01:20:48.709 align:start position:0%
significant but there are some increases
here

01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
they're all general fund impacts um
 
01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
the the retiree health question um
 
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's also
 
01:20:58.870 --> 01:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
a very good question uh retiree health
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
was one of the areas that we
 
01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
looked at um because the budget was so
 
01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:03.990 align:start position:0%
looked at um because the budget was so
tight

01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
tight
 
01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
um and that was one that we revisited to
 
01:21:08.629 --> 01:21:08.639 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
any dedicated funds that we had were
 
01:21:12.709 --> 01:21:12.719 align:start position:0%
paying their fair share
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
of those costs and so we we
 
01:21:17.189 --> 01:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
redistributed that
 
01:21:20.629 --> 01:21:20.639 align:start position:0%
funding across the entire budget
 
01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
based on the individuals who are
 
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
receiving retirement health benefits and
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
where they worked
 
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
when they were here and so that's what
 
01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
we've done is we've reduced the draw
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
on the general and the highway fund and
 
01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:32.470 align:start position:0%
on the general and the highway fund and
um

01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
and spread that out to um to the re to
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
the dedicated funds that we have
 
01:21:36.239 --> 01:21:37.910 align:start position:0%
the dedicated funds that we have
throughout

01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
throughout
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair may i have a follow-up
 
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
please absolutely
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
um thank you um i guess a couple of
 
01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.110 align:start position:0%
um thank you um i guess a couple of
questions

01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
um you've done a lot of work on this
 
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
budget to manage all that
 
01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
um i just want uh some clarification on
 
01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
what's included
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
in the revolving fund and then the
 
01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
has taken a huge hit and
 
01:22:05.189 --> 01:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
um you know every time you have to go to
 
01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
the highway fund it
 
01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
it um there's a lot of agencies that
 
01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
depend on highway fund
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
and and how is that impacted throughout
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
your budget
 
01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
sure um so so the dedicated funds
 
01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
that that i'm speaking about um
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
you know i i'll try to list off as many
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
as i can think of but
 
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
there are several but the biggest ones
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
the most the largest
 
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
the fire fund um which supports the fire
 
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
marshal's office and the fire academy
 
01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
um watercraft safety fund that's paid
 
01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:38.719 align:start position:0%
for with
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
if it's voter registration fees and that
 
01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:42.639 align:start position:0%
supports marine patrol
 
01:22:44.229 --> 01:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
the criminal records fund which is
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
criminal record fees which supports our
 
01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
criminal records operations
 
01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
not permits and licensing that's a
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
separate piece but criminal records
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
itself and updating the criminal history
 
01:22:54.790 --> 01:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
information database
 
01:22:58.229 --> 01:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
um the 911 fund um which supports
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
emergency services and communications
 
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
um and then there there are some smaller
 
01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:04.229 align:start position:0%
um and then there there are some smaller
funds

01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
scattered throughout but those are
 
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
really the big the big four
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
that we have that weren't essentially
 
01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:11.189 align:start position:0%
that we have that weren't essentially
weren't

01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
weren't
 
01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
fully paying in to the employees who
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
used to work for them that are now
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
receiving retiree health
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
so you'll see we we have increased
 
01:23:20.070 --> 01:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
retiree health costs and those
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
funds we did the analysis to make sure
 
01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
the fund could sustain it
 
01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't going to cause any any
 
01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
long-term concerns
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
if there were going to be long-term
 
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
concerns then this process wouldn't work
 
01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
for us but
 
01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
thankfully they were able to absorb it
 
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
the second question related to highway
 
01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:41.350 align:start position:0%
the second question related to highway
funds

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
so we we have always taken the approach
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
at safety at least since i've been here
 
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
um and i believe this was the case prior
 
01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:53.430 align:start position:0%
um and i believe this was the case prior
that

01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
when it comes to funding we're agnostic
 
01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:56.629 align:start position:0%
when it comes to funding we're agnostic
we

01:23:56.629 --> 01:23:56.639 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
um we understand and reflect the
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
importance of uh
 
01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:02.639 align:start position:0%
we understand and the the importance of
 
01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
all the different dedicated funding
 
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:04.550 align:start position:0%
all the different dedicated funding
sources

01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
sources
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
and the restrictions that are placed
 
01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
upon them but our
 
01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:10.639 align:start position:0%
our focus is always going to be to fund
 
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
our operations
 
01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
with whatever funds are available to us
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
decreases to the highway fund only
 
01:24:18.629 --> 01:24:18.639 align:start position:0%
impact us
 
01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
if there's no corresponding general
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
funds available to fill that gap
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
um in the past uh under normal
 
01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances there's typically some
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
general funds that
 
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
have been used to help prop up the
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
or provide us with the additional
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
services we need to maintain
 
01:24:38.790 --> 01:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
the same levels of service the
 
01:24:40.229 --> 01:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
additional funding we need to maintain
 
01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
the same levels of service
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
this budget we we we didn't have that
 
01:24:46.229 --> 01:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
so this this has been a challenge
 
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
um as you can see we've done everything
 
01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
that we can to
 
01:24:56.629 --> 01:24:56.639 align:start position:0%
reduce our draw but
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
it still resulted in us having to unfund
 
01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
50 positions
 
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
and and that's obviously a last resort
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
for us because as
 
01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
as i've said before and as a
 
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner said we're we're a
 
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
people-driven organization we're service
 
01:25:08.239 --> 01:25:08.870 align:start position:0%
people-driven organization we're service
based

01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
based
 
01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
every single division um it's the people
 
01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:12.070 align:start position:0%
every single division um it's the people
that

01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
execute on our mission and and we need
 
01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
all of those resources we need more
 
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
resources than we currently have if you
 
01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
know we're being honest but
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
the money's not there so we make do with
 
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
what we have as best as we can
 
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
so it's been a challenge
 
01:25:29.669 --> 01:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
but again if if the highway fund
 
01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
were to disappear and 35 million in
 
01:25:37.350 --> 01:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
as long as we fund safety that that's
 
01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
that's the key focus
 
01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
you know you know representative berger
 
01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:44.639 align:start position:0%
i mean steve i
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
i don't want to not emphasize how
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
important he's been but we're
 
01:25:50.550 --> 01:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
not only looking at this budget but
 
01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
we've got positions like we're able to
 
01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
fund in this biennium
 
01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
through grants and i can name a couple
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
prosecutor positions that are funded by
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
highway safety
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
but i know after this biennium we're
 
01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
going to have to look to
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
get those funded in our budget because
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
it's so we're looking
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
not only at this budget but we're
 
01:26:10.149 --> 01:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
looking you know three years down the
 
01:26:10.159 --> 01:26:11.030 align:start position:0%
looking you know three years down the
road

01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
road
 
01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
and you know keeping our eye on other
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
positions that are just you know they're
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
critical but
 
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know like the fire fund you know
 
01:26:19.669 --> 01:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
steve's done when we started this
 
01:26:19.679 --> 01:26:20.629 align:start position:0%
steve's done when we started this
exercise

01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
exercise
 
01:26:23.430 --> 01:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
he was i would say is innovative he's
 
01:26:24.629 --> 01:26:24.639 align:start position:0%
had to really look
 
01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
you know at dispersing these funds
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
whether it's the it costs retirement
 
01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
benefits but
 
01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
looking across this large agency in
 
01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
seven divisions and how to spread it out
 
01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
so that everyone was successful and
 
01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
again as steve said
 
01:26:39.669 --> 01:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
as long as we're funded that's and we
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
can go out and do the
 
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
do the job that everybody you know um
 
01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
depends on us to do that's that's all
 
01:26:48.149 --> 01:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
we're concerned with
 
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair may one more comment please
 
01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:53.270 align:start position:0%
madam chair may one more comment please
certainly

01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:26:56.229 --> 01:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
you realize that we have to work with
 
01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
the numbers that we have been provided
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
and because of what ways and means um
 
01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
has approved for us to use
 
01:27:07.510 --> 01:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
unless something significant happens
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
between now um and when we have to
 
01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
finalize this budget on march
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
26th our recommendations um
 
01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
there are going to be some disastrous
 
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
things that we're going to have to do
 
01:27:21.750 --> 01:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
and i just hope that once this budget
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
gets to the senate
 
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
you can recoup some of those laws and i
 
01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:26.709 align:start position:0%
you can recoup some of those laws and i
apologize

01:27:26.709 --> 01:27:26.719 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
01:27:29.669 --> 01:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
up front because you are so devastated
 
01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
that it it
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
just it's um it really bothers me
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
that actually we're making cuts in the
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
business taxes
 
01:27:40.629 --> 01:27:40.639 align:start position:0%
and i see the hits that you are taking
 
01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
um it just for me it's unconscionable
 
01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for that
 
01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:46.790 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for that
opportunity

01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:27:50.070 --> 01:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
no problem so uh representative murray
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
you have
 
01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh some other questions
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
sure enough um i think he already
 
01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
answered it i was
 
01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
asking about the retirees health
 
01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
insurance it's on page 471 and you
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
already explained that you
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
divisions is that right correct
 
01:28:14.149 --> 01:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
um in fact the the actual amounts are on
 
01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
the last page of our
 
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
original presentation if you wanted to
 
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
see where those ended up
 
01:28:23.110 --> 01:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
um it shows where where all those
 
01:28:24.870 --> 01:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
different costs
 
01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
uh landed from an accounting unit
 
01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:32.550 align:start position:0%
uh landed from an accounting unit
perspective

01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
all right you've spoken about the grants
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
management already
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know if there's anything you
 
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to add about that um
 
01:28:46.149 --> 01:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
well it's within my division so it's
 
01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
near and dear to me but
 
01:28:52.149 --> 01:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
that's an area that um we've been
 
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
focusing a lot of time to make sure that
 
01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
we're structured correctly in the
 
01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
division of administration
 
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
to maximize the use of our existing
 
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
resources because
 
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
if you look at the 30 million dollars in
 
01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:06.390 align:start position:0%
if you look at the 30 million dollars in
federal

01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
funds that come through we've got four
 
01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:10.470 align:start position:0%
funds that come through we've got four
full-timers

01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
full-timers
 
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
responsible for compliance with all of
 
01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
those different programs and there's
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
more there's more people in the program
 
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
specific level so highway safety has
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
their own program people but
 
01:29:23.189 --> 01:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a department-wide
 
01:29:23.199 --> 01:29:24.070 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a department-wide
standardized

01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
standardized
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
compliance program to make sure that
 
01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
there aren't any issues moving forward
 
01:29:30.070 --> 01:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
we certainly don't want to have to give
 
01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
any of that money back because something
 
01:29:33.189 --> 01:29:33.199 align:start position:0%
was missed along the way
 
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
so just it is a critical area that i
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
think sometimes gets gets overlooked
 
01:29:38.229 --> 01:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
that's all and
 
01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative umber giving credit to
 
01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
steve if you've heard about the amount
 
01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
of money that we push out in the grant
 
01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:44.390 align:start position:0%
of money that we push out in the grant
programs

01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
the process whether it's highway safety
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
or the you know the the the empg
 
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
whatever grant there is steve's looking
 
01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
at the process to ensure we have
 
01:29:58.470 --> 01:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
you know as efficient and um um
 
01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
and paperless as possible so the whole
 
01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
approval you know updating um
 
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
processing invoicing and steve's he's
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
looking at our whole business model
 
01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
to ensure that uh it's done as
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
seamlessly as possible which reduces the
 
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
01:30:16.470 --> 01:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
you know administrative staff that are
 
01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:19.270 align:start position:0%
you know administrative staff that are
needed

01:30:19.270 --> 01:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
by the way safety is not the only one
 
01:30:22.629 --> 01:30:22.639 align:start position:0%
that has
 
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
re-looked at all of their processes over
 
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
the last
 
01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh year and uh you know
 
01:30:31.990 --> 01:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
i i think i mentioned to someone the
 
01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
other day
 
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
that if there's any one good thing that
 
01:30:37.750 --> 01:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
came out
 
01:30:41.110 --> 01:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
of the covet epidemic is that it has
 
01:30:42.629 --> 01:30:42.639 align:start position:0%
caused us all
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
to rethink how we how we operate
 
01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
and um and i you know it's
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's great as to how the various
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
departments have
 
01:30:59.270 --> 01:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh have stepped up and made changes and
 
01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
so that's just my comment thank you very
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
much representative heath
 
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair i agree with you
 
01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly and um
 
01:31:09.110 --> 01:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
steve to your credit you have done a
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
remarkable job with working with all
 
01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
these funds
 
01:31:15.189 --> 01:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
now my follow-up question to that is um
 
01:31:16.149 --> 01:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
there you regularly are audited by the
 
01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
federal government um how is your uh
 
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:22.790 align:start position:0%
federal government um how is your uh
compliance

01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
have you had a number of compliance
 
01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
issues or are your audits usually clean
 
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
no we're usually clean um you know we
 
01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
get audited as part of the state
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
single audit um and obviously the
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
the disaster funds will get audited next
 
01:31:38.310 --> 01:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
time around because
 
01:31:40.149 --> 01:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
the it'll be a major program with the
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
money that's going out
 
01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
um but but yeah we're we're typically
 
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:44.470 align:start position:0%
um but but yeah we're we're typically
clean

01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
clean
 
01:31:47.189 --> 01:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
um you know i think the one outstanding
 
01:31:49.189 --> 01:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
comment that we have has to do with
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
um sub-recipient monitoring and
 
01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
and that there might not have been a um
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
a risk assessment that was
 
01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
formally documented before the award
 
01:31:59.750 --> 01:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
went out
 
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
um small from a risk perspective as far
 
01:32:04.950 --> 01:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
as i'm concerned something we can fix
 
01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
by reinforcing our existing procedures
 
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
but we don't see unquestioned uh we
 
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
don't see a question costs
 
01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
we don't see anything like that as on a
 
01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:20.229 --> 01:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
thank you okay uh
 
01:32:22.149 --> 01:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
representative murray where where to
 
01:32:24.149 --> 01:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
next um i
 
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
moved over to page 489 for just over an
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
overview question
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
of and i think mr lavoy this is your
 
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
area here
 
01:32:36.149 --> 01:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
um it's a five million dollar hit and
 
01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
just as you know sort of a
 
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
larger overview how is that impacting
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
the division of
 
01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:46.070 align:start position:0%
the division of
administration

01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
um it's yeah it's significant
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
and and we it's it's
 
01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
impacting us by causing delays
 
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh in service um we we're able to
 
01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
continue to offer the same quantities of
 
01:33:06.550 --> 01:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
service we haven't scaled anything back
 
01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
um but there are going to be increased
 
01:33:11.110 --> 01:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
delays in how we can support the loca
 
01:33:13.510 --> 01:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
the locals our our customers um the
 
01:33:15.669 --> 01:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
other divisions
 
01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
the the areas that are hit the hardest
 
01:33:17.679 --> 01:33:18.950 align:start position:0%
the the areas that are hit the hardest
are

01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
the asset and resource management bureau
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
which is where
 
01:33:25.750 --> 01:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
our our warehouse our inventory
 
01:33:28.790 --> 01:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
our supply distribution our mail
 
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
operations mail room operations we have
 
01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:32.229 align:start position:0%
operations mail room operations we have
some

01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
key positions that are unfunded in there
 
01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
but we we're trying to change our
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
processes and
 
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
um and and make the changes we need to
 
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
to make it work
 
01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
so um the the big
 
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
piece in this area that's missing is the
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
the deputy director of administration
 
01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:53.030 align:start position:0%
the deputy director of administration
position

01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
um out of all we have seven divisions in
 
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
the department of safety
 
01:33:59.430 --> 01:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
every division except for administration
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
has a number two
 
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
um and and in administration we really
 
01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:05.270 align:start position:0%
um and and in administration we really
have

01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
a two-faced mission if you will we we
 
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
have to provide services to the
 
01:34:11.430 --> 01:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
divisions and interact with them and
 
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
make sure they're getting what they need
 
01:34:13.189 --> 01:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
to be done
 
01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
but we also have to work on process
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
improvements internally
 
01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
for our own business and that's the
 
01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
piece where
 
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
i i can't do both um effectively
 
01:34:26.229 --> 01:34:26.239 align:start position:0%
um and and continue to move us forward
 
01:34:26.239 --> 01:34:27.350 align:start position:0%
um and and continue to move us forward
so

01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to it's going to decrease our
 
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
ability to respond
 
01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
timely to division requests but
 
01:34:36.550 --> 01:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
we will still be able to deliver all the
 
01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:37.590 align:start position:0%
we will still be able to deliver all the
resources

01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
and we'll just have to prioritize things
 
01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
more really kind of work
 
01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
triaging on a day-to-day basis not the
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
situation we want to be in long term
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
but we're going to do what we need to do
 
01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
to support the mission
 
01:34:52.709 --> 01:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
it's just not a sustainable model it's
 
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
going to cause a lot of additional
 
01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:55.590 align:start position:0%
going to cause a lot of additional
turnover

01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
turnover
 
01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
staff are already stressed and and
 
01:34:59.189 --> 01:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
they're having
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
trouble um you know i i'm the the best
 
01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
part about our staff
 
01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
is i have to tell talk to our employees
 
01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
and say listen
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
i'm the director i'm telling you it's
 
01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
okay that you're not going to get to
 
01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:11.030 align:start position:0%
okay that you're not going to get to
this

01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:35:13.830 --> 01:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
because our our our employees feel awful
 
01:35:15.669 --> 01:35:15.679 align:start position:0%
they really feel awful that they can't
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
they can't get this package delivered
 
01:35:18.629 --> 01:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
today because they just they're out of
 
01:35:18.639 --> 01:35:19.189 align:start position:0%
today because they just they're out of
time

01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
there's no one else to do it there's no
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
overtime it's gonna have to wait till
 
01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:22.790 align:start position:0%
overtime it's gonna have to wait till
tomorrow

01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
01:35:24.709 --> 01:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
and i'm telling them it's okay it's okay
 
01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
i understand just keep communicating
 
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
with me so i know and we'll we'll work
 
01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
through it as best as we can
 
01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
i was thank you for mentioning that i
 
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
was going to ask about the human toll
 
01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
all around on staff and that pressure
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
and then i forgot what else i was going
 
01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
to follow up with but it sounds
 
01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
i mean that's it's oh that is there a
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
breaking point
 
01:35:47.109 --> 01:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
i mean you said it's not sustainable i
 
01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
think we can see it's not sustainable
 
01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
um is there a breaking point
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
i'll take that i'll take you off the
 
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
hook steve
 
01:35:59.830 --> 01:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
so i mean um so here's
 
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
here's my best my best shot at this i
 
01:36:03.669 --> 01:36:03.679 align:start position:0%
think every
 
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
everybody's um everybody's different
 
01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
and it's the things that you can't see
 
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
you can quantify how many folks call in
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
sick you can quantify retirements you
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
can quantify
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
you know um absences but what you can't
 
01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:19.750 align:start position:0%
you know um absences but what you can't
is

01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
what's going on in people's minds at
 
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
times you know and
 
01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh so we've done a very i think a a
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
a good job i'm looking in the lower
 
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
right hand corner of my screen
 
01:36:33.030 --> 01:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
and march 10th to me um is the day that
 
01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
we really got
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
ramped up on on this whole culvert event
 
01:36:38.629 --> 01:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
i believe the eoc opened up
 
01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
um the 15th officially or the 16th but
 
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's been a year and it's been
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
um it's been a lot of work not only for
 
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
safety but for everybody
 
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
and i think the key is being able to
 
01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:52.310 align:start position:0%
and i think the key is being able to
listen

01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
listen
 
01:36:56.149 --> 01:36:56.159 align:start position:0%
um communicate let everybody understand
 
01:36:58.149 --> 01:36:58.159 align:start position:0%
um we've had a lot of people it's okay
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
that to get sick
 
01:37:01.510 --> 01:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
people get sick you've got a lot of
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
employees who've lost loved ones who've
 
01:37:06.149 --> 01:37:06.159 align:start position:0%
uh you know haven't been able to see
 
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
family and
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
you know i think the only way we got
 
01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
through it is we stuck together
 
01:37:13.189 --> 01:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
and seven directors uh talking to the
 
01:37:13.199 --> 01:37:13.910 align:start position:0%
and seven directors uh talking to the
employees

01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
and uh and i think the fact that we're
 
01:37:18.790 --> 01:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
here and we're operating and if you look
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
back representative murray
 
01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
to all that's been done all that's been
 
01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:23.830 align:start position:0%
to all that's been done all that's been
accomplished

01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
accomplished
 
01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
um i think uh i think we've managed as
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
best as we can but
 
01:37:30.310 --> 01:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
um the key to the breaking point is
 
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
something that we're about to
 
01:37:35.189 --> 01:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
unveil a as a wellness and resiliency
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
policy for the whole department
 
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
which is creating a culture that says
 
01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
it's okay to raise your hand and say
 
01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
i've had you know too much and it's okay
 
01:37:45.990 --> 01:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
to say that you're bothered or impacted
 
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
and uh but i think that uh i think steve
 
01:37:51.590 --> 01:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
what he's done pulling it together
 
01:37:52.709 --> 01:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
running this budget
 
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
dealing with his own you know employees
 
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
he's got a big operation
 
01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
you know just under 200 million dollar
 
01:37:59.910 --> 01:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
budget to manage
 
01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
without a number two and with many
 
01:38:03.590 --> 01:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
vacancies shows
 
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh um why new hampshire's such a great
 
01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:06.870 align:start position:0%
uh um why new hampshire's such a great
state

01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
i mean and so i think the key is
 
01:38:12.550 --> 01:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
and it's and we need your support i mean
 
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
you know what you said representative
 
01:38:15.669 --> 01:38:15.679 align:start position:0%
keith i understand it i think if we all
 
01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
stick together it's a process
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
we eventually get to where we need to be
 
01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
you've done an amazing job i mean kudos
 
01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
to you both and i think you know to
 
01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
follow up on that with the wellness
 
01:38:29.830 --> 01:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
and you know the human cost of it is
 
01:38:31.669 --> 01:38:31.679 align:start position:0%
it's remarkable i mean it's been a tough
 
01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
year and boyd's been hard on you all
 
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
you've borne the brunt of a lot of what
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
people have had to you know you're
 
01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:38.239 align:start position:0%
almost so sort of the public face of a
 
01:38:38.239 --> 01:38:39.590 align:start position:0%
almost so sort of the public face of a
disaster

01:38:39.590 --> 01:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
disaster
 
01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
well i get jen jenn hopper and uh
 
01:38:46.870 --> 01:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
and fallon um at hsem and perry plummer
 
01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
they worked all weekend i mean they have
 
01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
they've been working seven days a week
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
you know they you look at the
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
vaccination and it's it's a lot
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
and uh i've been watching and it really
 
01:38:58.149 --> 01:38:58.159 align:start position:0%
is impressive and i've been you know
 
01:38:59.910 --> 01:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
i've worked with representative umberger
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
in division two for
 
01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
you know since 2010 so i have faith in
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
division two
 
01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
we eventually get to where we need to be
 
01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
we will do our very very best for sure
 
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
um i was on a hop to 493 um
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
under the division of motor vehicles i
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
just what is financial responsibility as
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
it pertains to the department of motor
 
01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
vehicles it's a couple
 
01:39:23.830 --> 01:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars i just curious what is
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
what does that mean
 
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
so financial responsibility is that's
 
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
your driving records
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
and um anything if there's
 
01:39:35.189 --> 01:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
violations that need to be paid or or
 
01:39:35.199 --> 01:39:35.910 align:start position:0%
violations that need to be paid or or
fines

01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
fines
 
01:39:37.510 --> 01:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
that are processed that all happens
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
there your driving record gets updated
 
01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:40.709 align:start position:0%
there your driving record gets updated
accordingly

01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
accordingly
 
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
if there's a suspension that occurs that
 
01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
would get processed
 
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
if it's reinstated that's all processed
 
01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:48.870 align:start position:0%
if it's reinstated that's all processed
there

01:39:48.870 --> 01:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:39:56.229 --> 01:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:57.910 --> 01:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
i think i'm pretty near finished here if
 
01:39:59.430 --> 01:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
other people want to pop in i'm just
 
01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
going to check a few other things
 
01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
i'm just i'm just flipping through my my
 
01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:09.750 align:start position:0%
i'm just i'm just flipping through my my
book

01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
book
 
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
01:40:21.109 --> 01:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
it shows on a
 
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
and is this where the shortage
 
01:40:40.629 --> 01:40:40.639 align:start position:0%
of troopers or the unfunded position for
 
01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
so troopers are
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
funded throughout the budget they're not
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
all within one accounting unit
 
01:40:54.629 --> 01:40:54.639 align:start position:0%
so there are some that are that are in
 
01:40:54.639 --> 01:40:55.430 align:start position:0%
so there are some that are that are in
here

01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:40:58.709 --> 01:40:58.719 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
just to be clear we did we do have all
 
01:41:03.830 --> 01:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
of our previously funded troopers so
 
01:41:05.350 --> 01:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
troopers that were funded over the last
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
several biennium
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
are funded in this budget it's those
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
additional 23 that haven't been funded
 
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
for several biennium that are not and
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
and those are those are in various
 
01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
accounting units some are here
 
01:41:21.669 --> 01:41:21.679 align:start position:0%
summer um summer in 40 10 a few pages
 
01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
yeah that's fine i just i was just
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
curious about that and these
 
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
um auxiliary police what do we
 
01:41:36.629 --> 01:41:36.639 align:start position:0%
are those part-time hires or
 
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
how what is that yep those are those are
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
part-time troopers
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
um and so they are um
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
they really help the state police to
 
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
continue to provide all the services
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
they need some of them are helping out
 
01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:52.629 align:start position:0%
they need some of them are helping out
with

01:41:52.629 --> 01:41:52.639 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:41:55.270 --> 01:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
um with with traffic control some are
 
01:41:57.270 --> 01:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
helping out with investigations some are
 
01:41:58.870 --> 01:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
helping out with um you know
 
01:42:01.030 --> 01:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
peer-to-peer support activities
 
01:42:03.590 --> 01:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
so they're really utilized in a broad
 
01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:04.629 align:start position:0%
so they're really utilized in a broad
capacity

01:42:04.629 --> 01:42:04.639 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
01:42:08.470 --> 01:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
um to help provide services um that that
 
01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
our full-time complement of troopers
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
just aren't aren't able to do
 
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
so representative ember in the past you
 
01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
know several years with these vacancies
 
01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
the auxiliaries have been critical um
 
01:42:21.990 --> 01:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
handling background investigations not
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
they're not out there making arrests or
 
01:42:26.229 --> 01:42:26.239 align:start position:0%
you know we've had some assigned to cold
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
case we've had some assigned to
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
you know uh uh the uh the niacc the
 
01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
intelligence and analysis center
 
01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
um the sex offender registry they've
 
01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
gone in and
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
they've really kind of filled some gaps
 
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
we've had from having vacancies but i
 
01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
look at the
 
01:42:44.629 --> 01:42:44.639 align:start position:0%
you know we have a retired major that's
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
on the peer-to-peer unit
 
01:42:49.030 --> 01:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
and you know and he has been extremely
 
01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:49.830 align:start position:0%
and you know and he has been extremely
busy

01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
busy
 
01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
um you know helping and assisting and
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
managing um
 
01:42:55.990 --> 01:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
the the health and well-being and the
 
01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:56.709 align:start position:0%
the the health and well-being and the
training

01:42:56.709 --> 01:42:56.719 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:42:58.709 --> 01:42:58.719 align:start position:0%
that we're having all of the training
 
01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
the cit training critical incident the
 
01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
de-escalation training so
 
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:10.709 --> 01:43:10.719 align:start position:0%
okay i wasn't arguing that i just wanted
 
01:43:11.830 --> 01:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
no i know
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
i just sometimes people say auxiliary
 
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
like what do they do right
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
and i just supposed to show the
 
01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
importance of every single position
 
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
i mean but if one of those was to be
 
01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
removed there'd be
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
you know duties that nobody could do
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
because they're doing
 
01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
their own jobs you make me want to find
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
a way to volunteer
 
01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:35.109 align:start position:0%
a way to volunteer
so

01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
yeah uh president murray you could go in
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
and help with the fingerprinting
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
okay um i'm on page 509
 
01:43:54.310 --> 01:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
and this is the um
 
01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:57.510 align:start position:0%
and this is the um
enforcement

01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
and um we're showing
 
01:44:04.629 --> 01:44:04.639 align:start position:0%
the majority of this coming from the
 
01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:09.669 align:start position:0%
general funds
so

01:44:09.669 --> 01:44:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:12.070 --> 01:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm just when i think of
 
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement i think about
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
traffic tickets but obviously that's not
 
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
what this is all about
 
01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
so um so this is
 
01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
there are two primary accounting units
 
01:44:25.109 --> 01:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
for state police
 
01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:28.719 align:start position:0%
one is 4003 um and and the other is this
 
01:44:30.149 --> 01:44:30.159 align:start position:0%
one 4010
 
01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
and we split them up because um this
 
01:44:34.709 --> 01:44:34.719 align:start position:0%
accounting unit funds
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
state police activities associated with
 
01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:38.719 align:start position:0%
troop stations
 
01:44:41.430 --> 01:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
in keene in tamworth and in twin
 
01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:42.310 align:start position:0%
in keene in tamworth and in twin
mountain

01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
mountain
 
01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
and because of those locations the
 
01:44:46.870 --> 01:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
patrol coverage area does not hit the
 
01:44:49.189 --> 01:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
turnpikes any of the turnpikes
 
01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
the 4003 account covers the other
 
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
troop stations which have turnpike
 
01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:56.709 align:start position:0%
troop stations which have turnpike
patrols

01:44:56.709 --> 01:44:56.719 align:start position:0%
patrols
 
01:44:58.709 --> 01:44:58.719 align:start position:0%
and therefore we can utilize turnpike
 
01:45:00.709 --> 01:45:00.719 align:start position:0%
funds to support those operations
 
01:45:02.310 --> 01:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
so that the reason why we've split them
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
this way is just for funding purposes
 
01:45:07.109 --> 01:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
um and because of this is a perfect
 
01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
example of what i was mentioning before
 
01:45:11.189 --> 01:45:11.199 align:start position:0%
about how we're not really concerned
 
01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
about the funding source
 
01:45:14.950 --> 01:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
um this is the accounting unit that we
 
01:45:16.470 --> 01:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
can shift
 
01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
highway and general funds based on
 
01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
availability as long as there's no
 
01:45:21.990 --> 01:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
turnpike involved because turnpike would
 
01:45:23.669 --> 01:45:23.679 align:start position:0%
not be appropriate to use for these
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
for these services okay so this
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
this is keene tamworth twin mountain
 
01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
yes okay all right they probably have a
 
01:45:37.109 --> 01:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
lot of dirt roads
 
01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
they've got they've got a lot it's it's
 
01:45:41.910 --> 01:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
the largest geographical
 
01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
area in the city i know that that's out
 
01:45:46.149 --> 01:45:46.159 align:start position:0%
here and so yeah there's a lot of
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
territory to cover
 
01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
um it's just not uh we can't use the
 
01:45:52.149 --> 01:45:52.159 align:start position:0%
turnpike money to do so
 
01:45:56.070 --> 01:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
right well it makes sense i'm not
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
i was just trying to uh understand that
 
01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:12.390 --> 01:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
i think whoops what's this
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
oh yes this is on page
 
01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:22.070 align:start position:0%
oh yes this is on page
514.

01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:27.270 --> 01:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
it's the state police forensic lab
 
01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
now is this the same forensic lab
 
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
or is this an additional forensic lab
 
01:46:37.590 --> 01:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
or am i not reading this right
 
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
well this is the same lab um again
 
01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
because of funding and
 
01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
um all those wonderful things the the
 
01:46:48.790 --> 01:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
the costs of the entire state police lab
 
01:46:50.149 --> 01:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
are broken into three different
 
01:46:52.229 --> 01:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
accounting units um you've got
 
01:46:54.310 --> 01:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
and this is the primary accounting unit
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
with most of your
 
01:46:59.189 --> 01:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
non-drug related activities so pattern
 
01:46:59.199 --> 01:47:00.470 align:start position:0%
non-drug related activities so pattern
analysis

01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
um tool analysis those those markings
 
01:47:08.950 --> 01:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
your toxicology lab and the urine codis
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
those all fall under kind of what we
 
01:47:14.070 --> 01:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
what the lab considers the toxicology
 
01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:15.270 align:start position:0%
what the lab considers the toxicology
section

01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
and that's dealing primarily with the
 
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
chemistry stuff and the drug
 
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
and the drug testing we could combine
 
01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
everything together at some point but um
 
01:47:28.870 --> 01:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
i have i have no problem with that as
 
01:47:30.070 --> 01:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
long as i can
 
01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh understand what it is yep so in this
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
particular area
 
01:47:37.030 --> 01:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
um we we looked at the urine cotus
 
01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
accounting unit at the beginning
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
there was one unfunded position here
 
01:47:42.709 --> 01:47:42.719 align:start position:0%
there's 31
 
01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
positions and seven of the unfundeds are
 
01:47:48.830 --> 01:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:52.870 --> 01:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
okay i'm i'm flipping
 
01:47:58.070 --> 01:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
through here and i'm at the end
 
01:48:01.189 --> 01:48:01.199 align:start position:0%
with no more questions all right are
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
there any
 
01:48:06.070 --> 01:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh i see right sorry
 
01:48:08.709 --> 01:48:08.719 align:start position:0%
you have a question yes it is basically
 
01:48:09.189 --> 01:48:09.199 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
a general question um in terms of
 
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh there you've had to do a lot of um
 
01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:16.149 align:start position:0%
uh there you've had to do a lot of um
reductions

01:48:16.149 --> 01:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
reductions
 
01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
across the board uh will there be any
 
01:48:22.189 --> 01:48:22.199 align:start position:0%
costs that have to be downshifted to
 
01:48:22.199 --> 01:48:23.830 align:start position:0%
costs that have to be downshifted to
municipalities

01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
um with respect to what you've had to do
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
in your budget this year for this
 
01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:34.229 align:start position:0%
in your budget this year for this
biennium

01:48:34.229 --> 01:48:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
no no i can't i can't think of any
 
01:48:42.310 --> 01:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:44.550 --> 01:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
as i said before i mean this is and i'm
 
01:48:46.470 --> 01:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
sure and i know that you understand
 
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
this isn't something you do with a um
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
this is something that that you have to
 
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of time thinking about and
 
01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
looking at and
 
01:48:56.229 --> 01:48:56.239 align:start position:0%
and we really took a risk-based approach
 
01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure that
 
01:49:00.149 --> 01:49:00.159 align:start position:0%
we could do as much as we could with
 
01:49:01.590 --> 01:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
what was provided
 
01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
and um i can't think of any areas
 
01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
that would that would downshift any
 
01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:08.550 align:start position:0%
that would that would downshift any
costs

01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:12.639 align:start position:0%
um to the locals there's no new fees in
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
here um
 
01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
that the locals would be asked for you
 
01:49:17.589 --> 01:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
know the lab services that we
 
01:49:18.950 --> 01:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
talked about the lab a lot i mean it's
 
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
not the lab is funded by the state
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
um and the locals utilize that lab we're
 
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
not looking to change that model
 
01:49:28.229 --> 01:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
you know we're not looking to push those
 
01:49:30.149 --> 01:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
costs down um
 
01:49:32.709 --> 01:49:32.719 align:start position:0%
but we're struggling to to fully fund
 
01:49:33.589 --> 01:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
those areas
 
01:49:38.470 --> 01:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
also so um i i don't see any any areas i
 
01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
can't think of any areas where we've
 
01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:40.229 align:start position:0%
can't think of any areas where we've
done

01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
anything like that thank you and steve i
 
01:49:45.430 --> 01:49:45.440 align:start position:0%

you are a commissioner's dream
 
01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of being able to do what you
 
01:49:53.669 --> 01:49:53.679 align:start position:0%
have done
 
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh in a manner which you have done i i
 
01:49:57.910 --> 01:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
guess it's thank god for excel but
 
01:50:00.149 --> 01:50:00.159 align:start position:0%
it is a remarkable feat what you have
 
01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
managed to do with this budget
 
01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
as hard and difficult it is as it is
 
01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much and and um it's
 
01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
really it's a team effort over here
 
01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
so i cannot take all the credit um and
 
01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh we work really well together and it's
 
01:50:17.669 --> 01:50:17.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's great working uh working on
 
01:50:17.679 --> 01:50:17.990 align:start position:0%
it's it's great working uh working on
this

01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
with uh with this team and that's how we
 
01:50:21.030 --> 01:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
get these things done
 
01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
but thank you uh representative heath
 
01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
what he doesn't tell you is he has a
 
01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
dart board
 
01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
in his office and so each
 
01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
each morning he picks up a dart
 
01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
and wherever it lands that's the answer
 
01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:37.270 align:start position:0%
and wherever it lands that's the answer
okay

01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm just kidding steve as you know
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh mickey do we have any uh hb2
 
01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
items that we need to uh look at today
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh we we visited them once with the
 
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
department last week we can go through
 
01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
them again
 
01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
i know we had some discussion on the
 
01:50:58.550 --> 01:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
body warrant camera the dashboard camera
 
01:50:59.990 --> 01:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
fund earlier
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
the department also has some transfer
 
01:51:03.669 --> 01:51:03.679 align:start position:0%
authority that came up
 
01:51:05.189 --> 01:51:05.199 align:start position:0%
as well as a discussion about adding
 
01:51:07.510 --> 01:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
authority to fill unfunded positions so
 
01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
if we want to get into house bill 2 and
 
01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:10.639 align:start position:0%
revisit those sections again
 
01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
with the department it's up to you um
 
01:51:16.950 --> 01:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
does anybody feel a need to do that i
 
01:51:18.390 --> 01:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
think i'm pretty clear
 
01:51:22.790 --> 01:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
on on what what those issues are
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
and we're not going to decide them today
 
01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
so i think the only other one was the
 
01:51:30.310 --> 01:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
the radio
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
infrastructure equipment standards that
 
01:51:33.669 --> 01:51:33.679 align:start position:0%
came up last time
 
01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
to the department i don't want to have
 
01:51:37.510 --> 01:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
any follow-up questions or need any
 
01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
information on that
 
01:51:40.709 --> 01:51:40.719 align:start position:0%
i think those are that's it right steve
 
01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
for house bill 2.
 
01:51:45.270 --> 01:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
yeah that's it for house bill 2. i i
 
01:51:47.669 --> 01:51:47.679 align:start position:0%
think we're okay on those
 
01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%

01:55:42.390 --> 01:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
more fun than i can stand uh the last
 
01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:43.430 align:start position:0%
more fun than i can stand uh the last
time

01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
that the ups driver brought me the stuff

okay i'm not sure exactly what those are
 
01:56:20.550 --> 01:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
but we'll we'll go through them and
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
and the things that we agree on we will
 
01:56:27.589 --> 01:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh get rid of so to speak uh we'll vote
 
01:56:28.629 --> 01:56:28.639 align:start position:0%
on them
 
01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
and the um the other things we'll
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
put off till later in the week or early
 
01:56:36.870 --> 01:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
the following
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
week other than monday the following
 
01:56:40.629 --> 01:56:40.639 align:start position:0%
week so
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative heath just a question
 
01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:43.830 align:start position:0%
uh representative heath just a question
about

01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:56:46.070 --> 01:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
um i know in our last session we had a
 
01:56:48.310 --> 01:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
number of bills that are coming our way
 
01:56:51.430 --> 01:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
and um they're uh designated i think for
 
01:56:52.709 --> 01:56:52.719 align:start position:0%
division two
 
01:56:54.229 --> 01:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea when we're gonna
 
01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
start looking at those yes
 
01:56:59.669 --> 01:56:59.679 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact i do mickey did we
 
01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
decide that was on tuesday
 
01:57:05.030 --> 01:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
i think so i think tuesday we were going
 
01:57:06.229 --> 01:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
to do um
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
the the numbers escape me it's like
 
01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
house bill 6 13 and 5 21 there's two of
 
01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:10.709 align:start position:0%
house bill 6 13 and 5 21 there's two of
them

01:57:10.709 --> 01:57:10.719 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:57:13.030 --> 01:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
i think you are going to allow for some
 
01:57:14.070 --> 01:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
public input
 
01:57:16.070 --> 01:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
public hearing for both and then we can
 
01:57:17.830 --> 01:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
have a work session
 
01:57:20.229 --> 01:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
uh following were you also planning on
 
01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
doing a
 
01:57:24.310 --> 01:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
budget work session wednesday yes
 
01:57:27.669 --> 01:57:27.679 align:start position:0%
okay yeah wednesday and thursday

01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
so that's next week um i have
 
01:57:35.669 --> 01:57:35.679 align:start position:0%
i have a little bit of a hard time with
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
janet not reminding me
 
01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
oh by the way you need to get your
 
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:40.790 align:start position:0%
oh by the way you need to get your
schedule

schedule
 
01:57:43.830 --> 01:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
in for the calendar so i
 
01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh i try i try to remember to do that
 
01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:48.229 align:start position:0%
uh i try i try to remember to do that
but

01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:57:51.270 --> 01:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
that's one of those things that um you
 
01:57:52.470 --> 01:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
know when you're when you're in the
 
01:57:54.470 --> 01:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
state house it's easy for janet to run
 
01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:54.709 align:start position:0%
state house it's easy for janet to run
in

01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:57:57.350 --> 01:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
and say oh by the way are you scheduling
 
01:57:59.350 --> 01:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
anything for next week
 
01:58:02.790 --> 01:58:02.800 align:start position:0%

that i have is there anything that
 
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
i'll just add that we've heard from all
 
01:58:13.589 --> 01:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
the agencies now if any of the members
 
01:58:15.270 --> 01:58:15.280 align:start position:0%

because as we get really into it next
week

01:58:23.990 --> 01:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
you know time's going to be of the
 
01:58:27.669 --> 01:58:27.679 align:start position:0%
essence so if we can put some of those
 
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
thoughts down now so you're prepared to
 
01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
have those discussions for the work
 
01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
sessions in the next two weeks i think
 
01:58:36.550 --> 01:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:39.189 --> 01:58:39.199 align:start position:0%
yeah that's uh that's very true i know
 
01:58:39.199 --> 01:58:39.910 align:start position:0%
yeah that's uh that's very true i know
uh

01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
mickey has some uh i call them a little
 
01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
housekeeping amendments that uh
 
01:58:50.070 --> 01:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
that he's put together and uh you know
 
01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:51.270 align:start position:0%
that he's put together and uh you know
it's

01:58:51.270 --> 01:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
no big deal at this point we do have
 
01:58:57.669 --> 01:58:57.679 align:start position:0%
well they'll be we'll see what happens
 
01:58:57.679 --> 01:58:58.950 align:start position:0%
well they'll be we'll see what happens
okay

01:58:58.950 --> 01:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:59:02.790 --> 01:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
and um we'll also
 
01:59:05.910 --> 01:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
see what happens on the uh general fund
 
01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:07.990 align:start position:0%
see what happens on the uh general fund
money

01:59:07.990 --> 01:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:59:11.430 --> 01:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
because we've got some uh we've got some
 
01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:12.149 align:start position:0%
because we've got some uh we've got some
decisions

01:59:12.149 --> 01:59:12.159 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:59:16.229 --> 01:59:16.239 align:start position:0%
to make and uh as we know
 
01:59:18.790 --> 01:59:18.800 align:start position:0%
we don't none of us although looking at
 
01:59:20.310 --> 01:59:20.320 align:start position:0%
mary's backyard
 
01:59:22.229 --> 01:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
i think there must be a money tree
 
01:59:25.990 --> 01:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:28.149 --> 01:59:28.159 align:start position:0%
have we heard from ways and means about
 
01:59:29.350 --> 01:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
you know specifically
 
01:59:33.270 --> 01:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
what we're going to be dealing with uh
 
01:59:35.830 --> 01:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
yeah they're not giving us any more
 
01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:38.470 align:start position:0%
yeah they're not giving us any more
money

01:59:38.470 --> 01:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
other than what we all voted on whenever
 
01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:59:46.390 --> 01:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
but that's it so
 
01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
um we're still
 
01:59:53.589 --> 01:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
you know we're still maneuvering
 
01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
through this and we we as a group need
 
01:59:57.990 --> 01:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
to come to a decision
 
02:00:01.430 --> 02:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
about some things so
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
but that'll be next week and
 
02:00:08.149 --> 02:00:08.159 align:start position:0%
early the following week uh yes
 
02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:09.679 align:start position:0%
representative heath
 
02:00:11.669 --> 02:00:11.679 align:start position:0%
thank you um along with that have you
 
02:00:13.990 --> 02:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
been given an amount
 
02:00:17.350 --> 02:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
for our division that we have to
 
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
reduce no thank you
 
02:00:25.270 --> 02:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you that doesn't mean no
 
02:00:27.589 --> 02:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
reductions it just means
 
02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:35.990 --> 02:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
hey if nothing else representative lynn
 
02:00:40.310 --> 02:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
i missed your hand
 
02:00:42.390 --> 02:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
thank you i i have a question just as
 
02:00:44.390 --> 02:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
sort of the newcomer on the block
 
02:00:47.910 --> 02:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
um i want to i want to just ask if if uh
 
02:00:51.189 --> 02:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
if if if this division sort of follows
 
02:00:51.199 --> 02:00:51.990 align:start position:0%
if if if this division sort of follows
what

02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
what had been my experience from
 
02:00:56.229 --> 02:00:56.239 align:start position:0%
division one when i was at the court
 
02:00:59.830 --> 02:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
um that if that let's assume that we
 
02:01:01.030 --> 02:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
have to make that we
 
02:01:02.470 --> 02:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
you know we conclude that we have to
 
02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
make some cuts then i'll just use safety
 
02:01:05.990 --> 02:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
as an example because they're here
 
02:01:09.109 --> 02:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
um from from what they've proposed
 
02:01:12.229 --> 02:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
and assuming that it's not that
 
02:01:15.270 --> 02:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
you know let's assume that we
 
02:01:17.589 --> 02:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
as a member of division two were not
 
02:01:18.709 --> 02:01:18.719 align:start position:0%
were not
 
02:01:20.870 --> 02:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
we didn't have a particular acts to
 
02:01:22.629 --> 02:01:22.639 align:start position:0%
grind that we thought you know the cut
 
02:01:24.149 --> 02:01:24.159 align:start position:0%
should come from here or the cut should
 
02:01:27.270 --> 02:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
come from there but we just kind of felt
 
02:01:29.589 --> 02:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
uh that that there needed to be a there
 
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
needed to be a reduction
 
02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
it was my experience in dealing with
 
02:01:34.790 --> 02:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
division one when i was on the court
 
02:01:36.149 --> 02:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
that they would normally
 
02:01:38.629 --> 02:01:38.639 align:start position:0%
come back to us and say look we're going
 
02:01:42.070 --> 02:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:45.510 --> 02:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
but you know you kind of choose
 
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
where it's going to come from and as
 
02:01:48.550 --> 02:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
long and again as long as it wasn't
 
02:01:49.510 --> 02:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
something that the
 
02:01:50.950 --> 02:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
division one thought you know this is
 
02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
outrageous um
 
02:01:55.910 --> 02:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
we would uh division one generally would
 
02:01:59.030 --> 02:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
would defer to our choice and is it is
 
02:01:59.040 --> 02:01:59.669 align:start position:0%
would defer to our choice and is it is
that

02:01:59.669 --> 02:01:59.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:02:02.790 --> 02:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
do we sort of follow the same general
 
02:02:04.390 --> 02:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
idea here
 
02:02:08.229 --> 02:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
well the the difference between division
 
02:02:12.470 --> 02:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
one and three and division two
 
02:02:16.229 --> 02:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
is that we have the education trust fund
 
02:02:20.950 --> 02:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
the highway fund and fish and game fund
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
which is obviously all
 
02:02:28.149 --> 02:02:28.159 align:start position:0%
outside of the um
 
02:02:32.870 --> 02:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
the general fund and so
 
02:02:36.070 --> 02:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
we do have general funded things
 
02:02:39.270 --> 02:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
in each of those divisions
 
02:02:42.070 --> 02:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
for each of those departments but
 
02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
compared to
 
02:02:46.629 --> 02:02:46.639 align:start position:0%
division one or to division three
 
02:02:50.870 --> 02:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's pretty minuscule and so
 
02:02:55.669 --> 02:02:55.679 align:start position:0%
it's we have to balance all of that out
 
02:02:59.510 --> 02:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
and um it you know
 
02:03:03.430 --> 02:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
for example um you know for fish and
 
02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:03.910 align:start position:0%
for example um you know for fish and
game

02:03:03.910 --> 02:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
game
 
02:03:06.149 --> 02:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
i'll use that one because it's easy to
 
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
cut the hundred thousand dollars that
 
02:03:08.870 --> 02:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
we've given them
 
02:03:11.270 --> 02:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
in jennifer that's out there in general
 
02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:12.550 align:start position:0%
in jennifer that's out there in general
funds

02:03:12.550 --> 02:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:03:15.990 --> 02:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
um that's a requirement you know
 
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
for the uh wildlife match
 
02:03:21.669 --> 02:03:21.679 align:start position:0%
or i think it's wildlife it's something
 
02:03:23.589 --> 02:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
maybe it's wild flowers
 
02:03:27.510 --> 02:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
but you know that's a match so we can't
 
02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
we can't eliminate that
 
02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
100 000 match and many of the
 
02:03:38.550 --> 02:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
items that go on in education
 
02:03:41.750 --> 02:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
in safety are also
 
02:03:44.790 --> 02:03:44.800 align:start position:0%
required matches in order for us to
 
02:03:47.830 --> 02:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
obtain federal funds and
 
02:03:51.270 --> 02:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
that's just not true necessarily
 
02:03:53.030 --> 02:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
obviously in health and human services
 
02:03:55.109 --> 02:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
it is true to some degree
 
02:03:58.550 --> 02:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
but in division one um
 
02:04:01.589 --> 02:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that that they have a lot
 
02:04:01.599 --> 02:04:01.910 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that that they have a lot
of

02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:04:06.709 --> 02:04:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:08.790 --> 02:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
sure no i understand thank you thank you
 
02:04:11.270 --> 02:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
for the clarification
 
02:04:15.669 --> 02:04:15.679 align:start position:0%
okay we'll see you tomorrow morning
