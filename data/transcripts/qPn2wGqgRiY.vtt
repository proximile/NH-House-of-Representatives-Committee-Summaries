00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
good morning morning everyone um I hope
 
00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 align:start position:0%
you have your winter coats here it was
 
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
57 degrees in this room when I arrived
 
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
and um if you want to talk in order to
 
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
raise the temperature that would be okay
 
00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 align:start position:0%
with me um I'd like to call to order um
 
00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary subcommittee that's
 
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
looking at Senate Bill 255 and House
 
00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
Bill 34
 
00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.470 align:start position:0%
Bill 34
14

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
14
 
00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 align:start position:0%
um the bills are of the two bills and
 
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
I'm going to begin with the house bill
 
00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
314 um relative to the expectation of
 
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
privacy in the collection and use of
 
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.110 align:start position:0%
privacy in the collection and use of
personal

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 align:start position:0%
personal
 
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
information um my plan unless my uh
 
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
colleagues disagree would be to be Begin
 
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
by taking stock from the members of
 
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
where we are and then with everyone's um
 
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 align:start position:0%
agreement I would uh like to turn to
 
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
some of the people who have uh done us
 
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
the courtesy of of coming to share their
 
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
views with us to help us um figure out
 
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
where we're going to go from here so if
 
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
that approach is okay I'd like like to
 
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
begin um and
 
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
uh I guess I would begin by asking
 
00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
um chairman Lynn if he would like to
 
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
share with us where he is at the moment
 
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
issue thank you madam chair
 
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 align:start position:0%
um so I I guess what I would say where I
 
00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
am is I'm
 
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
conflicted um
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
as as I I think I've mentioned before I
 
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
um and I know we want to focus on 314
 
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
for now but I I guess what I would say
 
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
is because I think it has some
 
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
implications for that I do support
 
00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 align:start position:0%
255 with the with the a couple of
 
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
amendments that that I think I propose
 
00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 align:start position:0%
and maybe some others proposed and and
 
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 align:start position:0%
and the importance of that is I think
 
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
that it's kind of important to make sure
 
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
that 34 if 255 were to pass to make sure
 
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
that 14 kind of gels with it and so um I
 
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
had proposed an
 
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
amendment to
 
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
314 um which I I think I sent to
 
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
everyone on this
 
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um that
 
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
basically um did away with with what I
 
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
thought was one of the points of
 
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
contention um about the language in in
 
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
314 that purports to create a reasonable
 
00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
expectation of
 
00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
privacy um in certain
 
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
information um and as I think I said I
 
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 align:start position:0%
my basic thought
 
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
was if we're just going to limit this to
 
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
if the
 
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
only if the reach of this statute is
 
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
going to be limited to the
 
00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 align:start position:0%
government we can simply we could simply
 
00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
say the government shall not do what the
 
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
what the what 314 says they can't do um
 
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
and if they do there would be um some
 
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
liability um so that was kind of my
 
00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
Approach I have to say that that
 
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
representative Earth and and former
 
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.230 align:start position:0%
representative Earth and and former
representative

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
Kirk uh presented an alternative
 
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
proposal which um
 
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh moved the ball I think on to address
 
00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns that I had for
 
00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
example one thing that it did which I
 
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
think was really important is it
 
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
although it would allow a private right
 
00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:04.749 align:start position:0%
although it would allow a private right
of

00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:04.759 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
action um both
 
00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
against the government a government
 
00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
actor and a private actor that is
 
00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:14.199 align:start position:0%
subject to
 
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
314 it it um limits the private action
 
00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:20.759 align:start position:0%
only to actual damage as as opposed to a
 
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
sort of penalty that would apply if
 
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
there was a violation whether there were
 
00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
any actual damages or not um that's a I
 
00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:32.199 align:start position:0%
think that's a big step that you know
 
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
that makes a difference to me I'm
 
00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:40.919 align:start position:0%
still I'm still not convinced that we
 
00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:44.879 align:start position:0%
should have a private action
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
against against um entities other than
 
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
government entities um so that that's
 
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
kind of where where I am representative
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you madam chair um
 
00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:00.950 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you madam chair um
representative

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
Lynn in your um vast experience how
 
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
would you measure so I know
 
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
that how would you measure actual
 
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
damages com of like sharing somebody's
 
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
information like how would how would you
 
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
consider calculating that if you were
 
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
awarding a penalty sure well you know
 
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
that I mean that's a very good question
 
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
I mean I think one of the reasons that I
 
00:08:25.309 --> 00:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
think it should be limited to actual
 
00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:29.319 align:start position:0%
damages is my sense is that in the V
 
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:32.200 align:start position:0%
vast majority of cases even if there's
 
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
been some violation of you know of the
 
00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:37.479 align:start position:0%
right to privacy as created by
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
34 there probably would not be any real
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
damages in other words you know would
 
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.790 align:start position:0%
damages in other words you know would
somebody

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
say Okay so the so uh uh one of the
 
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:49.160 align:start position:0%
people one of the entities that's
 
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
covered by
 
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
314 um and is not supposed to sell
 
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
information let's say to a third party
 
00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
so they sell the information and you get
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
in your email you know uh uh buy you
 
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
know buy a BMW or buy some some kind of
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
car okay you may be annoyed I'm not in
 
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
the market for BMW but have you really
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
been harmed in some way um so I I guess
 
00:09:15.949 --> 00:09:15.959 align:start position:0%
I say that I think in most cases there
 
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
isn't likely to be much harm but I also
 
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
concede that there could be some cases
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
in which there would be you know real
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
tremendous harm and uh somebody and I
 
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
suppose somebody you know somebody was
 
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
injured or even killed bu because some
 
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:32.200 align:start position:0%
information that was disclosed that
 
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:34.360 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have been and there of course
 
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
I you know the person should be able to
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
recover damages I don't have any problem
 
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
with that and and I'm I'm inclined to
 
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
agree with you in that way that getting
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
rid of the penalty and putting in actual
 
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
damages I think will go a long way and
 
00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
um limiting it to government actors is
 
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
in my opinion what we should be doing so
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
L uh representative Devine
 
00:10:01.949 --> 00:10:01.959 align:start position:0%
I tend to think a little bit otherwise I
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
think other like maybe corporations or
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
small small even smaller companies might
 
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
be taking your information say images
 
00:10:13.069 --> 00:10:13.079 align:start position:0%
video images and then using them without
 
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
your express permission because you
 
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
signed off unwi unwittingly signed off
 
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:23.320 align:start position:0%
and accepted some sort of terms and
 
00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:24.839 align:start position:0%
agreements that you didn't realize that
 
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
they could in the future use your image
 
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
for something and I I don't think think
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
that's necessarily right if people are
 
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
unaware of that when they um accept any
 
00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
sort of terms and conditions I think
 
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
their privacy is violated and then could
 
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
be used in another another way and
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's not just government that's small
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
businesses corporations all that so that
 
00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
concern representative
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
T yeah and and I will say you know I
 
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
know there was a couple of different
 
00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
versions of amendments floating around
 
00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
so hope
 
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
there there was one uh Mr chairman uh
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
from you and and and representative
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
Earth I think was the the last version
 
00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
that that I received so hopefully I'm
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
speaking to the one that you sort of
 
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
were were most
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
uh proposing um I like the idea that we
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
took out the the private the the the
 
00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
individual you know that limited it to
 
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
government only because I think there
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
was some sentiment that those two things
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
were sort of mismatched in the first
 
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
bill and and 255 seems to cover some of
 
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
that some of some of that ground um and
 
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
I I did go through and look at all the
 
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
exclusions that sort of have been added
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
to that version and it seemed like we
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
covered most of the concerns that I
 
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
think I heard raised during during the
 
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
original testimony um on the bill I have
 
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
a couple of uh specific thoughts about
 
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
that language um but I I know that we're
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
not really into that meat of it yet I
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
just in general I thought that was that
 
00:11:57.629 --> 00:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
was a proposal that I thought moved it
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
Forward um
 
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
if I'm referencing the right the right
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
version which I think was sent a couple
 
00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:04.910 align:start position:0%
version which I think was sent a couple
days

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
ago yeah that was that was
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
representative uh uh F's and and uh rep
 
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
repres former representative Kirk's uh
 
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment that's the one that would
 
00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
allow an action against both the private
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
private entities and um uh and
 
00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:22.949 align:start position:0%
private entities and um uh and
government

00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
entities I have a
 
00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:31.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:33.030 align:start position:0%
 
I

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
thought that the
 
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.470 align:start position:0%
thought that the
main

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.670 align:start position:0%
 
focus

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:42.680 align:start position:0%
focus
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
was to be the private
 
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.030 align:start position:0%
was to be the private
sector

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
sector
 
00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:57.160 align:start position:0%
not the
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
government buy and
 
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
large in the
 
00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:06.990 align:start position:0%
large in the
Hampshire

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
um the Hampshire does pretty well in
 
00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:10.750 align:start position:0%
um the Hampshire does pretty well in
terms

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
terms
 
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
government recognizing the importance of
 
00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
privacy they're always outliers we know
 
00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:23.150 align:start position:0%
privacy they're always outliers we know
that

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
but it's bad business to shape
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
legislation around around an
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
outlier um or an
 
00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
exception and I think the problem is not
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
the government and although I have
 
00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:42.519 align:start position:0%
trouble understanding it all and I'm
 
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
very clear about that that that I have
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
trouble um there are exceptions
 
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
exemptions I guess is a better word
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
already in the the legislation that I
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
believe a lot of the government agencies
 
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
have agreed to so I I see the
 
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.949 align:start position:0%
have agreed to so I I see the
problem

00:14:01.949 --> 00:14:01.959 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
as focusing on the private sector not
 
00:14:09.389 --> 00:14:09.399 align:start position:0%
the government sector so tell me where
 
00:14:09.399 --> 00:14:10.829 align:start position:0%
the government sector so tell me where
I'm

00:14:10.829 --> 00:14:10.839 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
wrong well you know one I mean one thing
 
00:14:15.069 --> 00:14:15.079 align:start position:0%
that I and I guess maybe I'd like to
 
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
hear from if if either representative F
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
or representative Kirk could address
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
this but one of the things that went
 
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
went that um that I think is would be an
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
issue is 255
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
as it's currently drafted does not allow
 
00:14:33.069 --> 00:14:33.079 align:start position:0%
for a private right of action but it
 
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
does allow for the Attorney General to
 
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
bring an action and my my understanding
 
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
is that if 255 were to
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
pass the I think this is true and that's
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
is what I asked to correct me if I'm
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
wrong I think that it would
 
00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
cover all of the entities that are
 
00:14:59.470 --> 00:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
covered in 314 it ALS also covers more
 
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:01.160 align:start position:0%
entities than that but it but it
 
00:15:04.269 --> 00:15:04.279 align:start position:0%
encompasses I think all of the entities
 
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
that are covered by
 
00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.310 align:start position:0%
that are covered by
314

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
314
 
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.430 align:start position:0%
314
so

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
there I guess what I'm saying is there
 
00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
would be a remedy under 255 for privacy
 
00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
violations in the by Private Industry it
 
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
would Lim it would be limited to the
 
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
attorney general bringing bringing the
 
00:15:28.749 --> 00:15:28.759 align:start position:0%
remedy but there would be a remedy I I
 
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
hear you Mr chair but these are two
 
00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.110 align:start position:0%
hear you Mr chair but these are two
separate

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
separate
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
bills and we
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
cannot pass or support one bill with the
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
expectation that the other bill is also
 
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
going to pass in exactly the form that
 
00:15:51.309 --> 00:15:51.319 align:start position:0%
we would like it to because I know this
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
will come as a surprise but sometimes
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
things don't actually happen exactly as
 
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
we would like them to not all always but
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes if everyone else is
 
00:16:06.309 --> 00:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
comfortable um uh chairman Lynn has
 
00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
mention the names of Representative F
 
00:16:13.309 --> 00:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
and former representative Kirk is it
 
00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
okay with the committee if we hear from
 
00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
them at this point or would you like us
 
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.230 align:start position:0%
them at this point or would you like us
to

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:23.240 align:start position:0%
continue I think that if you two would
 
00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:27.079 align:start position:0%
mind well I would I'm asking both of you
 
00:16:29.949 --> 00:16:29.959 align:start position:0%
if you would like one or the other
 
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
um I I know that I need help frequently
 
00:16:37.309 --> 00:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
in dealing with uh former representative
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
Kirk which is why I thought that perhaps
 
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
come so would you
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
would thank you very much you know would
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
would you make sure
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
that that he treats me
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.309 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
fortunately representative Kirk knew I
 
00:17:05.309 --> 00:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
was joking so I don't have to
 
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:07.640 align:start position:0%
apologize uh good morning Madam chairman
 
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
good morning to members of the committee
 
00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm Neil Kirk former
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
representative I live in we and I'm
 
00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:15.400 align:start position:0%
representing myself uh
 
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.870 align:start position:0%
representing myself uh
today

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:20.959 align:start position:0%
um there is a relationship between
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
255 and U
 
00:17:24.559 --> 00:17:27.390 align:start position:0%
255 and U
314

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
314
 
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.830 align:start position:0%
314
um

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
314 is designed primarily to cover the
 
00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.590 align:start position:0%
314 is designed primarily to cover the
private

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
private
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
sector there is very little evidence as
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
the chairman suggested that we have a
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
problem with New Hampshire state
 
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
government abusing the opportunities
 
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
available to it to invade people's
 
00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
privacy with regulatory agencies seeking
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
information about individuals that they
 
00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have that's unnecessary to
 
00:17:59.149 --> 00:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
their function
 
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:02.200 align:start position:0%
indeed uh representative F and I worked
 
00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
extensively with various agencies to
 
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
carve out for them in
 
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
314 the ability to continue business as
 
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
usual so if you take away the private
 
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
sector from
 
00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
314 as a practical matter the only
 
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
impact of 314 will be on the state
 
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:25.720 align:start position:0%
police law enforcement law enforcement
 
00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
would have to get in the original B
 
00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:32.200 align:start position:0%
a Judicial Court warrant based on
 
00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
probable cause but in various amendments
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
simply an administrative subpoena from
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
the local County attorney or somebody
 
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
like that to get information from the
 
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
telephone company or the utility or the
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
internet service provider that they want
 
00:18:48.909 --> 00:18:48.919 align:start position:0%
in a particular case all of the other
 
00:18:50.909 --> 00:18:50.919 align:start position:0%
actions of state government would
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
continue as before because as I say
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative and F and I met with them
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
and we we created exemption so that they
 
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
could continue work because there was
 
00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:03.320 align:start position:0%
basically no point in having this bill
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
since they were not violating its
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
Provisions so the main thrust of
 
00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
314 is on the private sector and it's
 
00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.190 align:start position:0%
314 is on the private sector and it's
significantly

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
different from um 255 255 covers the
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
Waterfront in terms of the types of
 
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
businesses involved but 314 only applies
 
00:19:29.149 --> 00:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
to a small subset of the private sector
 
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
internet service providers um provider
 
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
telephone companies Utilities in other
 
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
words providers of goods and
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
services information Goods I'm sorry
 
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
information not Goods information not
 
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
Goods so to the extent that 255 covers
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
companies that sell Goods like Amazon
 
00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
Amazon is not covered by
 
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
314 because it doesn't sell a service it
 
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.190 align:start position:0%
314 because it doesn't sell a service it
sells

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:56.200 align:start position:0%
sells
 
00:19:59.870 --> 00:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
Goods so 3 14 was designed to deal with
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
the United States Supreme Court decision
 
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
of some years ago saying that you have
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
no expectation of privacy when you
 
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
provide personal information to a
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
third-party provider of information and
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
services and I thought for the people of
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that didn't make
 
00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:20.039 align:start position:0%
sense we expect that when we give
 
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
information to a telephone company or an
 
00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:23.720 align:start position:0%
internet service provider to get that
 
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
service that the reason for giving them
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
the information is to give us the
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
service not to give them an opportunity
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
to use that information for other
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
purposes or to take the information they
 
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
get from their our use of their service
 
00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
and use it for their purposes so for
 
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
example I don't want the telephone
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
company to be able to tell anyone that
 
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
I've made calls to certain let's say
 
00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.029 align:start position:0%
I've made calls to certain let's say
psychological

00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
psychological
 
00:20:51.789 --> 00:20:51.799 align:start position:0%
providers I don't want the my internet
 
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
service provider to detail my use of the
 
00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
internet and the various sites that I
 
00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
visit and sell that or give that or use
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
that for some other purpose that's not
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
why I signed up for those services and
 
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
so 314 is designed to say to these
 
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
Internet to the service providers to the
 
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
providers third party providers of
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
information and services that the only
 
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
thing they can do with our information
 
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:19.400 align:start position:0%
is to give it is to use it to provide
 
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
the service they're contracted for and
 
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
for no other purpose unless we give them
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
consent and that's one of the um that
 
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
impetus that drove uh 314 and I think is
 
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
reflected in all of the other amendments
 
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
that you've seen with the exception of
 
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment from that you have seen
 
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
from techet and perhaps some others that
 
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
that have been floating around um
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
frankly if you take the private sector
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
out of 314 if that's your opinion that
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
you don't want to do anything and and
 
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
and allow the private service providers
 
00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
and information providers to continue
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
using their information information a
 
00:22:00.669 --> 00:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
personal information in the way they
 
00:22:03.269 --> 00:22:03.279 align:start position:0%
have then you should kill the bill I
 
00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
hate to say that about one of my babies
 
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
but there's no point in subjecting um
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
government agencies who are not misusing
 
00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:11.830 align:start position:0%
government agencies who are not misusing
this

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
information um to any strictures when
 
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:19.720 align:start position:0%
it's unnecessary so
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
um it's it's not often that I come in
 
00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
and say if you're going to amend the
 
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
bill kill it but in this case I don't
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
want to impose restrictions on law
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement which I have no evidence to
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
think is abusing it but if you don't if
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
you pass the bill with taking out the
 
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559 align:start position:0%
private sector that's the only part of
 
00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:39.640 align:start position:0%
state government and local governments
 
00:22:41.269 --> 00:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
that will be affected by the
 
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
bill as a practical
 
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
matter um thank you could I ask you a
 
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
question I can ask will you answer a
 
00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.029 align:start position:0%
question I can ask will you answer a
question

00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
um should any
 
00:22:59.230 --> 00:22:59.240 align:start position:0%
state be in the business is doing this
 
00:23:07.269 --> 00:23:07.279 align:start position:0%
is this not better handled um in um at
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
the national level if we actually happen
 
00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
to have a n a functioning National
 
00:23:17.789 --> 00:23:17.799 align:start position:0%
Congress uh it would be very nice if
 
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
Congress were to deal with these privacy
 
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
issues and indeed on 255 Microsoft has
 
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
said they've tried
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
unsuccessfully to have a national Bill
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
and they've been they they can't do it
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
all of us would prefer a good solid
 
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
National bill as opposed to individual
 
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:35.480 align:start position:0%
State efforts but the federal government
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
even when it's functioning cannot come
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
to grips with this in a way that results
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
in legislation and so various States
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
from California to Connecticut and New
 
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on their own are trying to
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
deal with this and obviously the
 
00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
industry all Industries have a problem
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
with this approach because now they have
 
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
to deal with 50 different sets of rules
 
00:24:00.029 --> 00:24:00.039 align:start position:0%
rather than than one set and so as
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
techet and others are doing they're
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
trying and Microsoft is doing in 255
 
00:24:06.029 --> 00:24:06.039 align:start position:0%
they're trying to get uniformity at the
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
state level and oppose anything that
 
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
does not promote
 
00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
uniformity um I hope that answers your
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
question there's one other comment that
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
I wanted to make that I forgot to
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn said before that 255
 
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
would cover uh a lot of the ground for
 
00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
the private sector I'd point out that
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
255 only applies to large companies you
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
have to have a 100,000 users in New
 
00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:32.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so all small businesses that
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
might be covered smaller businesses that
 
00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:37.640 align:start position:0%
might be covered by 314 are not
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
covered by 255 there's a huge group of
 
00:24:43.389 --> 00:24:43.399 align:start position:0%
people that would be covered by the one
 
00:24:45.549 --> 00:24:45.559 align:start position:0%
bill private sector folks that would be
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
covered by the one bill but not by the
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative deine has a
 
00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.789 align:start position:0%
questions representative deine has a
question

00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:03.640 align:start position:0%
no okay now I'm on okay I was wondering
 
00:25:07.149 --> 00:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
if you could give um an example of how
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
this bill might
 
00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
affect um a company that was you know
 
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
maybe doing the wrong things with your
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
information just another example so we
 
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
as a panel can really understand a live
 
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
example of how that might happen is that
 
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
could you do that um let's say that uh
 
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:31.640 align:start position:0%
um you're an internet service
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
provider and um you notice that I'm
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
visiting all sorts of Hemlock type
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
sites because I'm planning on committing
 
00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:42.559 align:start position:0%
suicide presumably or at least that's
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
one and by the way I am not uh that's
 
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
one inference that you could draw you
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
don't have to say that representative
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
privacy thank you madam chairman I
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
so the um the internet service provider
 
00:26:08.909 --> 00:26:08.919 align:start position:0%
could use this information for example
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
um by contacting a psychologists or
 
00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists and giving them my name as
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
well as other people these are a group
 
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
of people who have visited various sites
 
00:26:22.389 --> 00:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
you might be interested in contacting
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
them unlikely that they would but that
 
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
kind of thing can happen um if I were to
 
00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
visit sites that indicated I was uh
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
trying to find some explosives that kind
 
00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:36.200 align:start position:0%
of information uh could be used by the
 
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:39.640 align:start position:0%
internet service provider
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully ways that don't harm me
 
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
um there are situations where um a
 
00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:49.559 align:start position:0%
telephone company for
 
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
example might know where my phone is at
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
all times and presumably where my phone
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
is I am but that's not always the case
 
00:26:59.389 --> 00:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
um and they could take that information
 
00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:02.559 align:start position:0%
and they could um provide that
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
to anybody who was interested in
 
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:07.240 align:start position:0%
learning locations usually companies
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
that are selling goods and services so
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
if I for example were went from Lowe's
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
to Home Depot and to Tractor Supply um
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
that information might be very important
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
to companies that sell the kinds of
 
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
goods those companies sell and they
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
might then solicit me with advertising
 
00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
or things like that I'm not trying to
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
take extreme examples here because we we
 
00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:33.919 align:start position:0%
know that they could anyone can abuse
 
00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
the system um but the question is for me
 
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
again um if I run my personal life by
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
using the internet and the telephone and
 
00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
utility electricity which tells where I
 
00:27:50.509 --> 00:27:50.519 align:start position:0%
am by the bases by uh some of these new
 
00:27:52.269 --> 00:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
smart meters which can tell how much
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
electricity used by the hour then
 
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
um I I feel less comfortable knowing
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
that so much of information about me is
 
00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:04.360 align:start position:0%
is is in the hands of other people and I
 
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
don't know what they're using
 
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
for um perhaps representative Earth has
 
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:11.320 align:start position:0%
some examples that would better answer
 
00:28:13.509 --> 00:28:13.519 align:start position:0%
your question I didn't think I did a
 
00:28:17.389 --> 00:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
particularly um helpful job
 
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
but I'll I'll just add to that I my my
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
concern is um you know where the say the
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
internet we have all this information
 
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
that is live on our phones and we have
 
00:28:34.509 --> 00:28:34.519 align:start position:0%
um we have a generation of people that
 
00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:37.039 align:start position:0%
know the difference between before we
 
00:28:39.549 --> 00:28:39.559 align:start position:0%
had phones and the computers the way we
 
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:41.480 align:start position:0%
do and then we have the
 
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
generation now that is moving forward
 
00:28:46.269 --> 00:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
that doesn't that are moving forward
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
that don't understand the differences of
 
00:28:53.389 --> 00:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
maybe ethical um practices in business
 
00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:56.200 align:start position:0%
and my concern is when you're on your
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
phone and and you're opting in or you're
 
00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:01.799 align:start position:0%
accepting any sort of terms and
 
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
conditions and you're you're letting
 
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
them take your information and you don't
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
really know what that is until maybe you
 
00:29:11.389 --> 00:29:11.399 align:start position:0%
get home and you can actually read the
 
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:14.200 align:start position:0%
40 pages of terms and conditions that
 
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
maybe some small company might have or a
 
00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
private um company might have and to me
 
00:29:24.029 --> 00:29:24.039 align:start position:0%
that there's a problem there because
 
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes there are companies that will
 
00:29:27.389 --> 00:29:27.399 align:start position:0%
be ethical about it and then there
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
there's other ones that won't and
 
00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
they'll just scrape that information
 
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
save it they might go back they might
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
find something else about I just think
 
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
there could be a longterm
 
00:29:39.789 --> 00:29:39.799 align:start position:0%
effect if we don't do anything now so
 
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
I'm my wondering is what kind of
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
examples that can give the panel to get
 
00:29:46.669 --> 00:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
maybe a bill like this passed so you can
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
see the long-term ramifications of what
 
00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
having nothing in place for citizens of
 
00:29:57.509 --> 00:29:57.519 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can um have some sort sort
 
00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:01.039 align:start position:0%
of action taken against companies small
 
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
smaller businesses not even just um say
 
00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:05.919 align:start position:0%
a phone company I'm I'm just thinking
 
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
there's all these apps that are just
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
they're they're collecting so much
 
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
information from just from the phone and
 
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
and younger people are are kind of
 
00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
unaware I think of the ramifications of
 
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
that and I think it's important to have
 
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
something like this thank you for that
 
00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.630 align:start position:0%
something like this thank you for that
question

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
um let me first say that that an
 
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
amendment that I've drawn up uh dated
 
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.750 align:start position:0%
amendment that I've drawn up uh dated
August

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
August
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
29th um deals with the problem that you
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned about this kind of usage
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
buried in a conditions kind of thing
 
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
that nobody reads and we all accept
 
00:30:48.029 --> 00:30:48.039 align:start position:0%
because it would preclude companies from
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh allowing from um doing that it would
 
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
ban the company from having me wave the
 
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
provisions of this protection so this
 
00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
protection would be
 
00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:05.230 align:start position:0%
protection would be
guaranteed

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:07.480 align:start position:0%
um when you grow up and you're used to
 
00:31:09.389 --> 00:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
something it's hard to change you have
 
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
the before and after your children and
 
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
my children probably may do depending on
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
our ages but they're but our
 
00:31:18.269 --> 00:31:18.279 align:start position:0%
grandchildren certainly do not and will
 
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
not um and it's up to us I think to make
 
00:31:24.389 --> 00:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
the decision that they should have that
 
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
choice that it is
 
00:31:28.269 --> 00:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
important um and we should do something
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
about it which is the reason for passing
 
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
um well let me leave it
 
00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.669 align:start position:0%
um well let me leave it
that

00:31:42.669 --> 00:31:42.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
um uh representative Kirk Could you
 
00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
um help the um subcommittee by pointing
 
00:31:56.029 --> 00:31:56.039 align:start position:0%
have you distributed this amendment
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
dated August 29th to everyone I have not
 
00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
but I have copies if if could you could
 
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
you share those now and then um point
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
um I mean as long as long as
 
00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:15.919 align:start position:0%
you're up now this would be a good time
 
00:32:15.919 --> 00:32:16.590 align:start position:0%
you're up now this would be a good time
I

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:26.200 align:start position:0%
um to highlight those particular points
 
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
that you and and and uh representative F
 
00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:32.799 align:start position:0%
would like us to be aware of and do you
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
have copies for people I have a few
 
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
extra copies which I've left there
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:49.679 --> 00:32:51.830 align:start position:0%
 
your

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:55.519 align:start position:0%
um are you asking me to explain yes I'm
 
00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
asking you to explain the change es that
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
you are proposing to this
 
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that address the concerns
 
00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
that we've been talking
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
about I'd be glad to do
 
00:33:12.509 --> 00:33:12.519 align:start position:0%
that I thought you might
 
00:33:12.519 --> 00:33:14.310 align:start position:0%
that I thought you might
be

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
um this amendment continues the original
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
U coverage of the bill it covers both
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
the private sector you put the
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
microphone closer to you thank you this
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
bill covers as the original bill does
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
both the private and the public sector
 
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
so that is is U perhaps the most
 
00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
significant thing that folks need to
 
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
know um it retains the car outs for
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
state agencies that was in the original
 
00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
bill in other words this bill will allow
 
00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
state agencies to continue to function
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
as they did before and as I said um they
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
know they're aware of this language
 
00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:54.440 align:start position:0%
we've met with them and they have no
 
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
problems with it at least they didn't
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
as recently as
 
00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
June um this bill adopts um the position
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
that representative Lynn uh wanted with
 
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:09.919 align:start position:0%
respect to law enforcement subpoenas
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
instead of judicial subpoenas they are
 
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh administrative subpoenas and that
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
makes it much easier for law enforcement
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
to get access to this this information
 
00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:22.130 align:start position:0%
and where do we find that oh
 
00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:23.790 align:start position:0%
and where do we find that oh
[Music]

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
um that
 
00:34:25.879 --> 00:34:40.990 align:start position:0%
um that
is

00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:45.069 --> 00:34:45.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
10 on sorry line 11 yeah okay I see
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
thank you signed by a judge and based on
 
00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
probable cause and that's been deleted
 
00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:02.200 align:start position:0%
thirdly it adds a def a definition of
 
00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
available to the public which was
 
00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
intended to satisfy the municipal
 
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
association's um
 
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:13.079 align:start position:0%
concerns and that would be on page one L
 
00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
page one lines 6 through n right
 
00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:19.190 align:start position:0%
page one lines 6 through n right
okay

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
um fourthly it deals with House Bill
 
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
255 on page two lines 1 and two you mean
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
Senate bill Senate sorry Senate Bill
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
255 um unless such providers are
 
00:35:38.349 --> 00:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
specifically Exempted from this chapter
 
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
they are not and
 
00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.750 align:start position:0%
they are not and
therefore

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
255 the the private sector companies
 
00:35:51.069 --> 00:35:51.079 align:start position:0%
would be covered by both 255 and
 
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
314 and the stricter of those two would
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
obviously apply so
 
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
um this still would cover all of the
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
smaller businesses that are not covered
 
00:36:03.359 --> 00:36:04.589 align:start position:0%
smaller businesses that are not covered
by

00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:04.599 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
255 and the larger businesses that are
 
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
covered by 255 would have to meet both
 
00:36:14.349 --> 00:36:14.359 align:start position:0%
the provisions of 255 and 314 to the
 
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
extent there's any conflict um and they
 
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:25.599 align:start position:0%
them fifth this protects
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
consumers uh um by precluding
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
third-party providers of information and
 
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:32.440 align:start position:0%
services from waving the Bill's
 
00:36:34.309 --> 00:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
Provisions as a condition of doing
 
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
business with them page this is on page
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
two lines 32 and
 
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
33 no third- party provider of
 
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
information and services may require a
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
waiver from the provisions of this
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
chapter as a condition for an individual
 
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
to do business with it this doesn't mean
 
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
that they can't ask for a waiver they
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
can and an individual could do it but
 
00:36:58.430 --> 00:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
but if an individual
 
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
declined the business could not say
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
sorry we're not going to serve
 
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.309 align:start position:0%
sorry we're not going to serve
you

00:37:06.309 --> 00:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:37:06.319 --> 00:37:07.910 align:start position:0%
you
and

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
fifthly it adopts representative Lynn's
 
00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
position with respect to damages and you
 
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
heard him talk about that before that's
 
00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:18.839 align:start position:0%
on page three lines 1 through
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
three which basically say uh you can sue
 
00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
and collect damages but only if you can
 
00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
demonstrate there are damages there's no
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
$1,000 penalty or $100 penalty for
 
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
violation of the bill um I share
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
representative Lyn's concern that we
 
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
don't want to create a situation where
 
00:37:41.309 --> 00:37:41.319 align:start position:0%
we have unnecessary class action
 
00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:44.680 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and this provision um goes a
 
00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
long way to prevent that those are the
 
00:37:49.069 --> 00:37:49.079 align:start position:0%
changes that this amendment makes from
 
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
the original
 
00:37:52.589 --> 00:37:52.599 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you do you have anything you
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
representative yeah yes not specifically
 
00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
to the individual changes but more
 
00:38:01.359 --> 00:38:03.270 align:start position:0%
to the individual changes but more
broadly

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
broadly
 
00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
so I want to emphasize that this is
 
00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
about informational
 
00:38:11.069 --> 00:38:11.079 align:start position:0%
privacy and in our lifetimes certainly
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
in mine um information has
 
00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.430 align:start position:0%
in mine um information has
become

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
become
 
00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
data and it's very easily propagated at
 
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
no cost or very low cost um it's very
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
easy to spread it around the world and
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
communicate it with at very low or no
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
cost we as you're all aware asked a
 
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment a few years ago
 
00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:39.400 align:start position:0%
by overwhelming majorities and I think U
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
we've been working uh representative
 
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
Kirk and I have been working on this
 
00:38:44.109 --> 00:38:44.119 align:start position:0%
bill for five years now and I think in
 
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
that time one of the things I've learned
 
00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079 align:start position:0%
and probably this committee has as well
 
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
since they've seen the bill so many
 
00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
times is it's not clear exactly what
 
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
that constitutional right entails
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
and I would argue that one of the
 
00:39:02.589 --> 00:39:02.599 align:start position:0%
reasons it passed with such an
 
00:39:05.309 --> 00:39:05.319 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority by our voters keep
 
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
that in mind these are the people that
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
put us here is that there is a concern
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
about this kind of privacy to um
 
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
Representatives point about the the the
 
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
U all the data that's collected by
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
Facebook and that sort of thing but
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
remember that this doesn't protect you
 
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
from things you publish so if you're
 
00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
putting it out there on Facebook or
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
whatever then that's on you you're
 
00:39:28.109 --> 00:39:28.119 align:start position:0%
giving it away it's that it's that
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
information that you don't really even
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
think about that you're giving away when
 
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
you work with big
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
corporations and with the government and
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
i' also point out that there's there's
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
been concern on the part of the
 
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
government about what they can do
 
00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:41.839 align:start position:0%
there's obviously concern from industry
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
about what they um can do but both of
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
those entities can afford to defend
 
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
themselves most people are not in a
 
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
situation where they can afford to
 
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
defend themselves and it's those those
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
people it's the vote our voters that's
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
who we're looking to protect here from
 
00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
informational privacy which is
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
essentially invisible to all of us it
 
00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
just flies around as little bits on
 
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
wires and we have no clue um about it
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
and this really just starts to delineate
 
00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
where businesses and government need to
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
be careful about what they do with
 
00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:21.640 align:start position:0%
information that they collect as a
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
byproduct of the services that they're
 
00:40:25.359 --> 00:40:28.390 align:start position:0%
byproduct of the services that they're
providing

00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
um it's my am I correct that you are
 
00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.470 align:start position:0%
um it's my am I correct that you are
clearly

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
separating the whole area of social
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
media because there it is the
 
00:40:50.589 --> 00:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
principal who
 
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
information yes with the exclusion that
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
the representative pointed out here that
 
00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
companies can't hide a waver to give
 
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
away information that is personal not
 
00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
not not that you've publicly put out
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
there but you've given to them as a
 
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
result or just in order to get the
 
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
service so to the extent that they're
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
not allowed to force you to wave that if
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
you're posting on Facebook or on Twitter
 
00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:23.240 align:start position:0%
or all the other places you can post
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
stuff then you're putting that
 
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
information out there and this is very
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
clear the information that you put into
 
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
the public domain and that's very well
 
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
defined um you know that that's on you
 
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
you're you're making that available to
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
anybody who wants to see
 
00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
it and use it for M purposes
 
00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander has a question
 
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
hopefully taking my question um the the
 
00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
coercion of the waiver is where my
 
00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
question is so um say I open up the Uber
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
app and I want a Uber downtown
 
00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester from gtown I want to go to
 
00:41:58.520 --> 00:41:59.430 align:start position:0%
Manchester from gtown I want to go to
the

00:41:59.430 --> 00:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
bars my location is is available to Uber
 
00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
and I might say in that situation no I
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to share my information but
 
00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:11.480 align:start position:0%
what's stopping a company from every
 
00:42:13.109 --> 00:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
single time I opening up the Uber app
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
for them to ask like I see there's no
 
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
language in here for them to
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
say it like once I say no once like
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
there's nothing saying they can't put
 
00:42:25.829 --> 00:42:25.839 align:start position:0%
the waiver pop it up on my phone again
 
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
so every single time I'm using Uber
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
every single time I'm using Facebook
 
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
Twitter like they're going to ask and
 
00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
once I say yes once then my information
 
00:42:37.109 --> 00:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
sharable so I guess how do how does this
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
address that well I would hope you'd
 
00:42:42.549 --> 00:42:42.559 align:start position:0%
have your width well enough about you at
 
00:42:45.309 --> 00:42:45.319 align:start position:0%
any given time that you'd always say no
 
00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:47.000 align:start position:0%
I mean I I guess there's really no way
 
00:42:50.349 --> 00:42:50.359 align:start position:0%
to I'm just I'm just thinking I'm not
 
00:42:52.109 --> 00:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
part of the Gen Z generation but I'm
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
very very close and I will tell you that
 
00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
they will accept it once just to get it
 
00:42:59.470 --> 00:42:59.480 align:start position:0%
out of the way and then the information
 
00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
is public so that's that's my only
 
00:43:03.309 --> 00:43:03.319 align:start position:0%
concern with that sort of language there
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
well I guess they leave it to the
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
Judgment of the committee I mean
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
certainly you could change the wording
 
00:43:09.549 --> 00:43:09.559 align:start position:0%
there to say that once you said no no
 
00:43:09.559 --> 00:43:12.390 align:start position:0%
there to say that once you said no no
means

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
concept thank you for that
 
00:43:19.839 --> 00:43:22.190 align:start position:0%
concept thank you for that
representative

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
um are you satisfied with
 
00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
that any other
 
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
questions so you know I guess
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn has a question thank
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
you so with regard to
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
um section H3 of your proposed amendment
 
00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
on page three this chapter shall not be
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
construed to create a cause of action
 
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
against a non-governmental a
 
00:43:48.109 --> 00:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
non-government entity for providing
 
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
information to a government entity and I
 
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
guess my question there is so
 
00:43:59.630 --> 00:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
if I mean does that mean that if if the
 
00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.510 align:start position:0%
if I mean does that mean that if if the
phone

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
phone
 
00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
company um gets information that it
 
00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.349 align:start position:0%
company um gets information that it
shouldn't

00:44:08.349 --> 00:44:08.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:11.720 align:start position:0%
have and it provides
 
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
it if it provides it to anybody any any
 
00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
other third party presumably the phone
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
company would be liable under this but
 
00:44:22.549 --> 00:44:22.559 align:start position:0%
if it provides it to the
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
government even if it obtained it
 
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
illegally that the it's it's
 
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
somehow it it's shielded from liability
 
00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
for that which might be the where did
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
could you tell me understand you know
 
00:44:38.549 --> 00:44:38.559 align:start position:0%
you're the lawyer I'm not and you're the
 
00:44:42.589 --> 00:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
judge I'm not um you say acquire
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
illegally really
 
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
um problem I guess I'm concerned about
 
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
what they're acquiring legally right
 
00:44:53.309 --> 00:44:53.319 align:start position:0%
right am I missing the point no but
 
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
words I think I should say Judge Lynn
 
00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
for that question yeah no I'm what I'm
 
00:44:59.150 --> 00:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
really just saying is have we
 
00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:01.230 align:start position:0%
really just saying is have we
created

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:01.240 align:start position:0%
created
 
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
if if they acquire some information in
 
00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
violation of the other provisions of the
 
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
statute of the
 
00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:12.839 align:start position:0%
bill and then provide that to the
 
00:45:16.349 --> 00:45:16.359 align:start position:0%
government they are sort of this seems
 
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
to say they're exempt from liability and
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
I'm guess I'm wondering why why is that
 
00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
if it's if it falls within one of the
 
00:45:24.549 --> 00:45:24.559 align:start position:0%
exceptions I can completely understand
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
then because it's then not illegal but
 
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
if it's if it
 
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't so first of all this presumes
 
00:45:33.309 --> 00:45:33.319 align:start position:0%
all the information that the companies
 
00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
have is acquired legally that that's
 
00:45:38.109 --> 00:45:38.119 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about illegally
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
obtained information this is what
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
they've what they've obtained in the
 
00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:44.200 align:start position:0%
course of doing their business so it's
 
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's legal so we got to start
 
00:45:51.069 --> 00:45:51.079 align:start position:0%
there the second point is the this was
 
00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
put in for businesses because they're
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
very concerned that the government who
 
00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
has the right
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
to demand information with warrants or
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
whatever that they might corporations
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
might get themselves in trouble by
 
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
providing information legally that they
 
00:46:13.549 --> 00:46:13.559 align:start position:0%
control that the government is legally
 
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
requesting but they would be somehow
 
00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:18.280 align:start position:0%
subject to something for doing that and
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
the point of this is to say no the
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
government is legally requesting
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
information that the companies legally
 
00:46:27.549 --> 00:46:27.559 align:start position:0%
hold then they are not going to be
 
00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
subject to the company is not going to
 
00:46:34.349 --> 00:46:34.359 align:start position:0%
be subject to penalty for that okay I I
 
00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
I guess I I understand your explanation
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
I guess the only thing you in you've
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
added the word legally a couple of times
 
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
in your and it and my concern is that H3
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that the word legally is not
 
00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
in there well so that's let's go back to
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
I mean it change the wording to suit you
 
00:46:54.589 --> 00:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
of course because you know better than I
 
00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
do that outside of things but going back
 
00:46:57.549 --> 00:46:57.559 align:start position:0%
to the very beginning with the
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
definitions about what things are in
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
there I mean it's pretty clear what kind
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
of information we're talking about right
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
this this is
 
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
not you know if the corporations hold
 
00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
information illegally isn't Don't They
 
00:47:14.829 --> 00:47:14.839 align:start position:0%
isn't that already a crime putting
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
inside this
 
00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
bill oh no no I mean it may be depending
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
depending on what what what kind of
 
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:26.079 align:start position:0%
be thank you for the question question
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative Lind um the
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
concern expressed by some of the
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
companies was that the government May
 
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
overreach in its request in violation of
 
00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:42.680 align:start position:0%
the provisions of this bill but the
 
00:47:44.829 --> 00:47:44.839 align:start position:0%
companies not knowing that still
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
provided them with the
 
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
information they felt in that case they
 
00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
should not be held liable and that's
 
00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
what this provision is designed to do
 
00:47:57.309 --> 00:47:57.319 align:start position:0%
um it I don't think it's particularly
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
significant because I don't expect New
 
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um Regulatory Agencies to
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
violate the law that's not their want
 
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
that's not the way they do business so I
 
00:48:10.549 --> 00:48:10.559 align:start position:0%
don't think this is going to have much
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
of an impact but if somebody sues an
 
00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:16.280 align:start position:0%
agency for improperly obtaining
 
00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
information and it could happen um it
 
00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
should be the agency that held
 
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
responsible not the company that
 
00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:25.480 align:start position:0%
provided it at the agency's request and
 
00:48:28.589 --> 00:48:28.599 align:start position:0%
that what this section is designed to to
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
deal with does it work this way the
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
legally and then the concern is are they
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
using that
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
information illegally the fact that they
 
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
have the information
 
00:48:58.109 --> 00:48:58.119 align:start position:0%
you know name address phone number
 
00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:01.240 align:start position:0%
Social Security whatever else they have
 
00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:03.640 align:start position:0%
um they're entitled to have that
 
00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:06.920 align:start position:0%
information the problem is if they use
 
00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:09.069 align:start position:0%
information the problem is if they use
it

00:49:09.069 --> 00:49:09.079 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
illegally okay okay first of all in
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
today's world without this bill we're
 
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
not talking about them using anything
 
00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
illegally it's basically using it for
 
00:49:20.069 --> 00:49:20.079 align:start position:0%
outside their business purposes that's
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
really what we're trying to capture here
 
00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:24.680 align:start position:0%
is that when you go when you sign up for
 
00:49:26.349 --> 00:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
phone service or internet service you
 
00:49:27.549 --> 00:49:27.559 align:start position:0%
provide all kinds of personal
 
00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
information which has nothing to do with
 
00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
anything other than the business that
 
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
wants to be able to bill you and collect
 
00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
from you and that sort of thing and that
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
information they've legally obtained and
 
00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
they control it but that's the
 
00:49:42.309 --> 00:49:42.319 align:start position:0%
information that they cannot be
 
00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
dispersing for money or even not for
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
money for any reason now if a government
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
entity is asking for that information
 
00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
and they have the legal right to do so
 
00:49:55.309 --> 00:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
and I guess even if it's not legal but
 
00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
the the company doesn't know it's not
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
legal that's on the government not on
 
00:49:59.599 --> 00:50:00.510 align:start position:0%
legal that's on the government not on
the

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
company thank you for
 
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
that anything
 
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
else representative Andrew do you have
 
00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:12.950 align:start position:0%
else representative Andrew do you have
anything

00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
else not
 
00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
really listening to everything on this
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
bill and when we have we're going to
 
00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.190 align:start position:0%
bill and when we have we're going to
have

00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
255 I don't understand why we ar trying
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
one now that is a loaded question
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative Andress and I was
 
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
figuring you'd come up with the tough
 
00:50:46.829 --> 00:50:46.839 align:start position:0%
one um representative Kirk do you want
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
to take that one on you don't have to
 
00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:49.829 align:start position:0%
to take that one on you don't have to
you

00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:49.839 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
know I think it yes I do I think it's
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:59.870 --> 00:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes in order to understand things
 
00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
you have to break them into smaller
 
00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:05.240 align:start position:0%
pieces if these two were to be combined
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
because they deal differently they they
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
deal with the same subject of privacy
 
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
but they cover different entities and
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
they treat the different entities
 
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
differently it would be exceptionally
 
00:51:21.549 --> 00:51:21.559 align:start position:0%
difficult to combine them moreover from
 
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the sponsors of
 
00:51:26.789 --> 00:51:26.799 align:start position:0%
255 they're trying trying to get a
 
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
universal bill passed in 50 states that
 
00:51:31.789 --> 00:51:31.799 align:start position:0%
is essentially what they would like to
 
00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
see done at the federal level but they
 
00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:35.839 align:start position:0%
can't get Congress to do if New
 
00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire were to combine the two that
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
would defeat their purpose and they
 
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
would very much object to that so that's
 
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
one practical problem um remember that
 
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
255 deals with only with
 
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
information it doesn't deal with good
 
00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:55.720 align:start position:0%
sorry 314 Deals Only with information it
 
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't deal with
 
00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:01.240 align:start position:0%
Goods um 255 deals with Goods
 
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
information but only with large
 
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
companies 314 deals with everyone
 
00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:09.640 align:start position:0%
regardless of size so trying to merge
 
00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:10.829 align:start position:0%
regardless of size so trying to merge
those

00:52:10.829 --> 00:52:10.839 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:52:13.549 --> 00:52:13.559 align:start position:0%
two I can't think of a good analogy but
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
it would be very difficult apples and
 
00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
different thank you anything else for
 
00:52:24.319 --> 00:52:27.349 align:start position:0%
different thank you anything else for
our

00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:27.359 --> 00:52:32.630 align:start position:0%
 
distinguished

00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
Witnesses I don't see anything
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
to move on at this point following
 
00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:49.870 align:start position:0%
to move on at this point following
representative

00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
Anderson's lead to take a look at 255
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
five or or is there more that we want to
 
00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
314 representative lint no well the only
 
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
the only thing that I would say is that
 
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
um and it I think it's it it kind of is
 
00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
related to both I mean
 
00:53:18.789 --> 00:53:18.799 align:start position:0%
one one thing that it seems to me that
 
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
might be an appropriate way to proceed
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
is sort of incrementally and
 
00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:26.510 align:start position:0%
is sort of incrementally and
I

00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:53:29.309 --> 00:53:29.319 align:start position:0%
guess what you know what one of the
 
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
things I'm thinking as I've said before
 
00:53:35.109 --> 00:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
I I tend to support 255 but I what if we
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
were to pass 255 but not pass
 
00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:42.200 align:start position:0%
314 what that would mean is we would be
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
create we would be
 
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
creating privacy rights with respect not
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive it would as representative
 
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
Kirk points out it it would be limited
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
to large large
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
corporations um but it would also go
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
beyond just the providers of services
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
but assuming that they are large
 
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
corporations it would not allow
 
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
individual cause of action but if we
 
00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:13.400 align:start position:0%
were to pass that that it seems to
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
me I mean one approach that the
 
00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
legislature might take is to say let's
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
do this which a number of other states
 
00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
have done and let's see how this works
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
if it's not completely comprehensive
 
00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
let's see how this works for you know a
 
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
year or two years or whatever and then
 
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
if there's if it makes sense to capture
 
00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
smaller corporations or smaller
 
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
businesses and if it makes sense to
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
allow an individual cause of action um
 
00:54:47.349 --> 00:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
we can deal with it after we've after
 
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
we've had that experience so that that's
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
that's what I was sort of gon to say
 
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
that that's an interesting approach can
 
00:54:59.390 --> 00:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
you tell me me how that fits in with New
 
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's long and valued
 
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
tradition reflected now in the
 
00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:11.240 align:start position:0%
constitution of a respect for privacy
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
different different from or different
 
00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
than different from
 
00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
what we see in other
 
00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:25.160 align:start position:0%
states well one you know one of the
 
00:55:27.549 --> 00:55:27.559 align:start position:0%
things that I think is really an open
 
00:55:27.559 --> 00:55:29.589 align:start position:0%
things that I think is really an open
question

00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
is does the does the the recently
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
adopted Constitutional Amendment apply
 
00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:39.640 align:start position:0%
to actions other than actions by the
 
00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
government normally a constitution
 
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:44.559 align:start position:0%
restrains the government it doesn't
 
00:55:48.069 --> 00:55:48.079 align:start position:0%
restrain private individuals so now we
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
the the Supreme Court New Hampshire
 
00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:51.640 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has not construed this I
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
suppose they could construe it to say no
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
it does this does
 
00:55:57.630 --> 00:55:57.640 align:start position:0%
capture individual
 
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
action I I that would be I think at
 
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
least somewhat unusual for them to
 
00:56:08.829 --> 00:56:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
the I guess what I I guess what I'm
 
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:13.720 align:start position:0%
saying is that the the
 
00:56:17.069 --> 00:56:17.079 align:start position:0%
Privacy interest created by that recent
 
00:56:17.079 --> 00:56:20.190 align:start position:0%
Privacy interest created by that recent
amendment

00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:20.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
is is probably limited only to the
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
government as opposed to
 
00:56:28.829 --> 00:56:28.839 align:start position:0%
individual um as opposed to uh
 
00:56:28.839 --> 00:56:32.150 align:start position:0%
individual um as opposed to uh
non-governmental

00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
entities and I guess that's why we have
 
00:56:38.029 --> 00:56:38.039 align:start position:0%
three separate branches of government
 
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
and a judicial
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
branch to make those determinations and
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
you're right that there has not to my
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:55.549 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:56:55.549 --> 00:56:55.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:59.109 --> 00:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
well how could I possibly question the
 
00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
Judgment of a an attorney and a Supreme
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
Court Justice so I'm going to let that
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
one go for a while I may be completely
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
wrong I have no forecasting as to what
 
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
the you what the New Hampshire Supreme
 
00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
Court would do I would like to argue
 
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
that but I would not argue it with you
 
00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
um is there anything else that we want
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
to discuss
 
00:57:26.349 --> 00:57:26.359 align:start position:0%
about the first the house bill before we
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:32.150 align:start position:0%
 
Bill

00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
representative I I just wanted to
 
00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
clarify my opening statement um I I was
 
00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
reacting to a a separate um set of
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
amendments on that particular statement
 
00:57:42.829 --> 00:57:42.839 align:start position:0%
that you had sent after and
 
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
misattributed it to representative um um
 
00:57:49.069 --> 00:57:49.079 align:start position:0%
f and Kirk so I just wanted to clarify
 
00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
that and and and the discussion that
 
00:57:54.109 --> 00:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
ensued makes much more sense in terms of
 
00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:55.640 align:start position:0%
where I thought the discussion was going
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:07.069 --> 00:58:07.079 align:start position:0%
um is there anyone in the audience who
 
00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
we should hear from before we move on D
 
00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:15.309 align:start position:0%
we should hear from before we move on D
they

00:58:15.309 --> 00:58:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:19.240 align:start position:0%
just okay this is a work session we are
 
00:58:22.829 --> 00:58:22.839 align:start position:0%
we do not have uh pin cards we don't
 
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
but we are struggling to do the best
 
00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
that we can
 
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
do in our role on this subcommittee and
 
00:58:38.829 --> 00:58:38.839 align:start position:0%
therefore we don't want to cut ourselves
 
00:58:38.839 --> 00:58:39.870 align:start position:0%
therefore we don't want to cut ourselves
off

00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
off
 
00:58:43.589 --> 00:58:43.599 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily from other views that might
 
00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
help inform our
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
decision so we're not getting into
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
debates or anything like that right now
 
00:58:55.870 --> 00:58:55.880 align:start position:0%
but is there anyone else here who would
 
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
like to
 
00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:59.190 align:start position:0%
like to
add

00:58:59.190 --> 00:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
add
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
substantively to what we have uh been
 
00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
314 press the red button speak close to
 
00:59:22.349 --> 00:59:22.359 align:start position:0%
the microphone and tell us who you are
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
can you hear me okay absolutely uh my
 
00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
name is Andrew Kingman I represent the
 
00:59:29.069 --> 00:59:29.079 align:start position:0%
state privacy and security Coalition so
 
00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:31.799 align:start position:0%
we represent about 30 uh over 30
 
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
companies and six trade associations and
 
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
we work on privacy issues across all 50
 
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
states um and across uh any number of
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
sectors uh of the economy and where are
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
you based uh just North of Boston oh oh
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
oh up here okay so you're used to this
 
00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:55.150 --> 00:59:55.160 align:start position:0%
side um
 
00:59:57.069 --> 00:59:57.079 align:start position:0%
yeah and and thank you very much for for
 
00:59:58.510 --> 00:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak and I'm happy to
 
01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
chat about 314 as as it interplays with
 
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
255 as well I think a couple points that
 
01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to add you know I think
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
our preference is to would would be to
 
01:00:15.309 --> 01:00:15.319 align:start position:0%
um sort of keep that divide that we've
 
01:00:18.349 --> 01:00:18.359 align:start position:0%
talked about today where if we're going
 
01:00:22.029 --> 01:00:22.039 align:start position:0%
to look at uh public sector uses of
 
01:00:25.029 --> 01:00:25.039 align:start position:0%
personal information that 314 would be
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
the appropriate vehicle for that and
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
that if we're going to talk about
 
01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:30.920 align:start position:0%
private sector uses of information that
 
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
255 would be the appropriate vehicle for
 
01:00:38.190 --> 01:00:38.200 align:start position:0%
that but that to try and uh take a bill
 
01:00:41.309 --> 01:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
in 314 that you know really looks to
 
01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
regulate the public sector and then add
 
01:00:47.029 --> 01:00:47.039 align:start position:0%
in a private right of action for
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
unrelated uses of personal information
 
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
um probably isn't the right approach um
 
01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
couple reasons for that um we've seen in
 
01:00:57.549 --> 01:00:57.559 align:start position:0%
other states where there are private
 
01:01:01.390 --> 01:01:01.400 align:start position:0%
rights of action um that uh it becomes
 
01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
Feeding Frenzy and while the language
 
01:01:07.549 --> 01:01:07.559 align:start position:0%
may attempt to limit it to actual
 
01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
damages that's not really the
 
01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
calculation that's made um uh by either
 
01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
side the calculation that's made is
 
01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:18.559 align:start position:0%
really Discovery costs and the cost even
 
01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:21.880 align:start position:0%
to um try to get a motion to dismiss off
 
01:01:24.789 --> 01:01:24.799 align:start position:0%
of a lawsuit um is well into the six
 
01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
figures regardless of whether you're a
 
01:01:29.069 --> 01:01:29.079 align:start position:0%
small business or a large business the
 
01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
other thing that I I didn't hear
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
discussed and and uh former Chief
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
Justice may have an opinion on this as
 
01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:39.039 align:start position:0%
well or some uh can shed some light and
 
01:01:40.589 --> 01:01:40.599 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert but I do believe that
 
01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a sovereign immunity
 
01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:45.640 align:start position:0%
statute that does not allow for suits
 
01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:49.559 align:start position:0%
against government entities um unless
 
01:01:51.549 --> 01:01:51.559 align:start position:0%
something is intentional or there's a
 
01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
failure of a duty of care and so if
 
01:01:56.349 --> 01:01:56.359 align:start position:0%
we're setting up a private right of
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
action against both government entities
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
and service providers to those
 
01:02:04.349 --> 01:02:04.359 align:start position:0%
government entities I think we know
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
where the litigation activity is going
 
01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
to be directed um and so I think that's
 
01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:13.160 align:start position:0%
that's another piece of our concern here
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
so you know I think um our sense is that
 
01:02:21.269 --> 01:02:21.279 align:start position:0%
314 is an appropriate vehicle to
 
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
regulate government uses of personal
 
01:02:26.589 --> 01:02:26.599 align:start position:0%
information we've offered some language
 
01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
that uses some standardized definitions
 
01:02:31.870 --> 01:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
across various State privacy laws like
 
01:02:35.109 --> 01:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
personal uh information uh like publicly
 
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
available information and then uh have
 
01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh would would would look to um there's
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
a California statute that regulates
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
government duties of care to minimize
 
01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
the data collected from its individuals
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
and I think you know generally speaking
 
01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about public sector
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
uses that's um a fair a fair vehicle for
 
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
that and then you know happy to chat
 
01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:06.200 align:start position:0%
about um SB 255 but you know I do think
 
01:03:09.069 --> 01:03:09.079 align:start position:0%
IT addresses a number of the issues uh
 
01:03:10.589 --> 01:03:10.599 align:start position:0%
that folks have raised in this room
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
about private sector uses of of
 
01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:15.640 align:start position:0%
information um I think whether it
 
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
applies only to large companies or not
 
01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:21.400 align:start position:0%
is a little bit of a Up For
 
01:03:25.309 --> 01:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
Debate thank you any
 
01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
anybody um could you please make sure
 
01:03:32.589 --> 01:03:32.599 align:start position:0%
that our uh committee researcher has
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely has all the contact
 
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
information for you absolutely do and if
 
01:03:39.029 --> 01:03:39.039 align:start position:0%
you would like to
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
um submit a a summary of your comments
 
01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:43.269 align:start position:0%
um submit a a summary of your comments
in

01:03:43.269 --> 01:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
writing um happy to do so yeah we all of
 
01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
us learn in different ways and that
 
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
would be be very helpful thank you any
 
01:03:57.549 --> 01:03:57.559 align:start position:0%
other is there anyone else who can add
 
01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:04.109 --> 01:04:04.119 align:start position:0%
conversation thank you I appreciate it
 
01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
let's then now let's move on
 
01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
specifically to 255 do you do you want
 
01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
to talk about 255 while you're sitting
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
there sure um you might as well yeah I
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
might as well um you know this is the
 
01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
product not just of uh the New Hampshire
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
legislative process but of a number of
 
01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
legislative processes that have taken
 
01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
place across the country now um while
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
it's true that I think a lot of us uh
 
01:04:38.309 --> 01:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
don't have large degrees of hope that
 
01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
we'll see a federal privacy Bill we are
 
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
starting to see a de facto National
 
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
Standard emerge because we've got 11
 
01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:49.240 align:start position:0%
states now that have passed a version of
 
01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
this bill uh this bill 255 sort of falls
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
on the stronger end of that for a couple
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
reasons we can get into um but again
 
01:04:59.910 --> 01:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about nearly 30% of the
 
01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
population uh is covered by this
 
01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
framework at this point um the benefits
 
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
of this and I guess one other point
 
01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
um these bills have been passed on a
 
01:05:16.029 --> 01:05:16.039 align:start position:0%
bipartisan basis they've been the
 
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
product of uh the Oregon attorney
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
general's task force they've been the
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
product of um a task force in
 
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
Connecticut um and they've also been
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
adopted in States like Tennessee Texas
 
01:05:32.349 --> 01:05:32.359 align:start position:0%
Montana Etc so this is a
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
bipartisan issue and and a framework
 
01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
that has gotten bipartisan approval
 
01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
those task forces have had not only
 
01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:41.720 align:start position:0%
representatives from business but also
 
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocates on those task forces
 
01:05:48.309 --> 01:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
that have been able to um support these
 
01:05:52.269 --> 01:05:52.279 align:start position:0%
these uh bills um some of the issues
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
that have been brought up today around
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
consent and opting in um in the way that
 
01:06:00.109 --> 01:06:00.119 align:start position:0%
personal data is treated so to the
 
01:06:02.190 --> 01:06:02.200 align:start position:0%
representative's question about you know
 
01:06:06.029 --> 01:06:06.039 align:start position:0%
repeatedly asking uh for consent um the
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
way that the bill is set up uh there are
 
01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:12.640 align:start position:0%
three situations in which uh an indivi a
 
01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
business is required to obtain consent
 
01:06:18.269 --> 01:06:18.279 align:start position:0%
from uh from an individual the first is
 
01:06:20.589 --> 01:06:20.599 align:start position:0%
that uh if the business wants to collect
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
sensitive data so data like biometric
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
data PR geolocation information Health
 
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
Data um thing children's data things
 
01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:31.640 align:start position:0%
along those lines you have to obtain
 
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
consent from the individual the second
 
01:06:38.269 --> 01:06:38.279 align:start position:0%
is that when you uh when you first start
 
01:06:39.789 --> 01:06:39.799 align:start position:0%
collecting information you have to
 
01:06:42.309 --> 01:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
disclose to the consumer the types of
 
01:06:43.789 --> 01:06:43.799 align:start position:0%
information that you're going to be
 
01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
collecting from them and if you then
 
01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:48.200 align:start position:0%
start if you want to then collect
 
01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
additional types of information you have
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
to go back and obtain consent from the
 
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
consumer as well the third situation is
 
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
that if you want to collect uh if you
 
01:06:59.549 --> 01:06:59.559 align:start position:0%
are collecting the same amount of data
 
01:07:01.109 --> 01:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
but you want to use it for a different
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
purpose than you originally told the
 
01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
consumer that you were using that
 
01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
purpose for you have to go back and
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
obtain consent from the uh from the
 
01:07:12.589 --> 01:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
individual um and those last two apply
 
01:07:14.269 --> 01:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether that's sensitive
 
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
data or
 
01:07:18.589 --> 01:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
not there also could you repeat that yes
 
01:07:20.829 --> 01:07:20.839 align:start position:0%
I said those last two obligations so the
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
idea that uh if you're purpose for
 
01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:27.640 align:start position:0%
processing data changes or if the types
 
01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
of data uh change that you're collecting
 
01:07:33.870 --> 01:07:33.880 align:start position:0%
that you have to obtain consent from the
 
01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
individual there also there's also a
 
01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
data minimization provision that says
 
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
you aren't permitted to collect more
 
01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
data um than is reasonable to accomplish
 
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
the purposes that you're collecting data
 
01:07:49.950 --> 01:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
for um so the idea of collecting data
 
01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
and then figuring out what you'll do
 
01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:54.559 align:start position:0%
with it later that's not really
 
01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
something that would be permitted under
 
01:07:59.870 --> 01:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
under this act um there are also
 
01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
significant business obligations as well
 
01:08:05.789 --> 01:08:05.799 align:start position:0%
the most significant of which is the um
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
data protection impact assessment so
 
01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:12.279 align:start position:0%
this is a documented process that EV
 
01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:14.799 align:start position:0%
that a business would have to do um if
 
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
it's collecting sensitive data if it's
 
01:08:19.789 --> 01:08:19.799 align:start position:0%
selling data if it's using data for
 
01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
profiling um or any other type of uh
 
01:08:27.709 --> 01:08:27.719 align:start position:0%
processing activity that could present
 
01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
an unreasonably High heightened risk of
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
harm or excuse me a heightened risk of
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
harm to a
 
01:08:36.269 --> 01:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
consumer and that requires the business
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
to go through a process where it
 
01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
documents the risks of that processing
 
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
activity and weighs the benefits of that
 
01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
and uh has to discuss ways to mitigate
 
01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
that those risks that it's identified
 
01:08:53.070 --> 01:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
through that processing and so you know
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
there are significant requirements on
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
businesses I think you know
 
01:09:01.149 --> 01:09:01.159 align:start position:0%
certainly uh some people have the
 
01:09:03.669 --> 01:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
question well then why does business
 
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
sort of give the okay to this or or why
 
01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
is business able to to be okay with this
 
01:09:11.309 --> 01:09:11.319 align:start position:0%
um I think a few reasons again that
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
interoperability the fact that it's in
 
01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
so many states now businesses are
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
generally complying um with these types
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
of bills uh in those States and so you
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
know again we've kind of got a a
 
01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
framework to work within um and then
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
again the the lack of a private right of
 
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
action means that businesses uh are
 
01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
insulated from that privil litigation
 
01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
that we know will will come in uh if
 
01:09:36.030 --> 01:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
there is a private right of action
 
01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
because again we've seen it in other
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
states um this has mechanisms to help
 
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
consumers attain redress very quickly in
 
01:09:45.309 --> 01:09:45.319 align:start position:0%
the right to cure and so you know I
 
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
think um it's a very carefully balanced
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
framework that looks at a lot of
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
different inputs and outputs and tries
 
01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
to achieve the right balance and again
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know so 11 states it's now gone
 
01:09:59.350 --> 01:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
through 22 State Chambers you know again
 
01:10:01.870 --> 01:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
countless work groups countless hearings
 
01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
um and is a framework that I think you
 
01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
know at the hearing uh earlier this
 
01:10:08.590 --> 01:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
spring you heard many many different
 
01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
stakeholders come up and say you know
 
01:10:12.189 --> 01:10:12.199 align:start position:0%
this is this is sort of the right way to
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
go so I think our feeling is uh if we
 
01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
are going to move forward with private
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
sector privacy legislation that HB 255
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
is the right
 
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
approach uh thank you our uh committee
 
01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
researcher uh gave us two very valuable
 
01:10:32.430 --> 01:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
documents dated the end of June and I
 
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
don't know what if anything has changed
 
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
since then one of them was the US state
 
01:10:39.870 --> 01:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
privacy legislation
 
01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
tracker um and then um one is comparing
 
01:10:49.229 --> 01:10:49.239 align:start position:0%
255 to the Connecticut Law um I don't
 
01:10:53.310 --> 01:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
know if you've seen either of of of
 
01:10:57.870 --> 01:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
these but are there have there been
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
changes since the end of
 
01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
June uh that's been happening across the
 
01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
country that we should know about I
 
01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
guess that's one question and the second
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
is did I hear you correctly when you
 
01:11:19.149 --> 01:11:19.159 align:start position:0%
indicated that you thought um uh Senate
 
01:11:19.159 --> 01:11:20.630 align:start position:0%
indicated that you thought um uh Senate
Bill

01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
255 was more
 
01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
um well how would you compare Senate
 
01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.030 align:start position:0%
um well how would you compare Senate
Phil

01:11:30.030 --> 01:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
Phil
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
255 to the national uh the efforts to
 
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
create a national model sure um and I uh
 
01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
so the the to answer your first question
 
01:11:43.229 --> 01:11:43.239 align:start position:0%
about changes since June I don't
 
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
know uh when precisely that was uh
 
01:11:50.669 --> 01:11:50.679 align:start position:0%
initiated but two states uh both Oregon
 
01:11:53.229 --> 01:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
and Delaware um enacted and had their
 
01:11:56.629 --> 01:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
governor sign the same framework uh into
 
01:11:59.310 --> 01:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
law since then so that's how we got to
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
11 um 11 states with this framework and
 
01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
then California sort of on its own own
 
01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
Island uh in terms of yes no no other
 
01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
state has passed that that framework
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
what a surprise I'm sorry I said what a
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
surprise I know I know um and so uh
 
01:12:19.229 --> 01:12:19.239 align:start position:0%
that's so you said Oregon and what was
 
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
the other one uh Delaware okay so on
 
01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
this chart we do have Oregon as active
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
bills but you're saying it's moved along
 
01:12:31.229 --> 01:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
uh that that yeah that that passed the
 
01:12:33.149 --> 01:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
legislature and signed by the governor
 
01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
as as to Delaware and oh and Delaware
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
too okay so those okay so last last
 
01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
session you know between January and
 
01:12:45.070 --> 01:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
June of this year January and July seven
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
states passed a version of this of this
 
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
framework and then to answer your second
 
01:12:53.149 --> 01:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
question about how this uh you know the
 
01:12:53.159 --> 01:12:53.950 align:start position:0%
question about how this uh you know the
the

01:12:53.950 --> 01:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh piece that this bill has um that some
 
01:13:01.629 --> 01:13:01.639 align:start position:0%
of the other bills do not have uh is the
 
01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
global opin or excuse me Global opt out
 
01:13:05.199 --> 01:13:06.030 align:start position:0%
global opin or excuse me Global opt out
uh

01:13:06.030 --> 01:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
provision this is a provision that would
 
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
have a delayed implementation date
 
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
because much of that technology does not
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
yet totally exist it's coming online but
 
01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
this would be a browser extension or uh
 
01:13:24.430 --> 01:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
some type of technology that a consumer
 
01:13:29.189 --> 01:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
could download that would send a signal
 
01:13:32.990 --> 01:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
to websites to opt that individual
 
01:13:36.149 --> 01:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
automatically out of the sale and the
 
01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
targeted advertising of their data and
 
01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
so um that is a you know some states
 
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
have that provision some states do not
 
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
but H SP 255 does have that provision um
 
01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
again it would I think it would go into
 
01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
effect a year after the effective date
 
01:13:58.510 --> 01:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
of the bill to give companies time to uh
 
01:14:01.629 --> 01:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
to sort of implement and determine that
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
you know how they would recognize that
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
signal there are some issues that have
 
01:14:08.629 --> 01:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
not been resolved as to as to that
 
01:14:10.709 --> 01:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
technology but again that's that's the
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
reason for the delayed implementation
 
01:14:15.149 --> 01:14:15.159 align:start position:0%
date um in terms of the small business
 
01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
versus large business so the uh
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative Kirk is correct that the
 
01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
bill has a threshold of 100,000
 
01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
consumers in terms of uh collecting
 
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
personal data whether that is only large
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
businesses or not I I think is a little
 
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
bit of a matter of debate only because
 
01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
you know that works out to like less
 
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
than 300 unique website visits a day to
 
01:14:42.030 --> 01:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
a to a a business so if a business has
 
01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
you know 300 visits a day to its website
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire consumers that's
 
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
probably that business is probably going
 
01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
to be within the scope of this bill what
 
01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
300 versus 100,000 explain that to no so
 
01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
just if you take a
 
01:15:00.669 --> 01:15:00.679 align:start position:0%
100,000 uh data on 100,000 unique
 
01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
consumers uh and just divide that by
 
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
365 right it it works out to about
 
01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
270 unique consumers a day that you
 
01:15:12.629 --> 01:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
might be obtaining personal information
 
01:15:15.870 --> 01:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
on so again that would be a unique visit
 
01:15:19.629 --> 01:15:19.639 align:start position:0%
to a website that might be a coffee shop
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
that does 300 uh you know transaction a
 
01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
day with unique customers etc etc the
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
other way that this would
 
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
apply sorry I interrupted go right ahead
 
01:15:38.350 --> 01:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
um I just don't understand the math but
 
01:15:39.709 --> 01:15:39.719 align:start position:0%
that's all right I don't understand a
 
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
lot of math um so a b do you it seems to
 
01:15:46.110 --> 01:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
me I understand what you're saying but
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
you're assuming then that each one of
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
those is someone
 
01:15:53.629 --> 01:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
different yeah that's and that is is
 
01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
seems to me not to be the point when you
 
01:15:59.790 --> 01:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
have a state with 1.3 million people
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
sure um 100,000 is a very big number and
 
01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
do you mean a 100,000 different people
 
01:16:10.189 --> 01:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
or do you mean 27 people who are
 
01:16:12.510 --> 01:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
spending a lot of time there pressing
 
01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
the buttons no so it the the threshold
 
01:16:18.189 --> 01:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
now is the data of 100,000 different
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
people so that's that's the that's the
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
threshold and or that's one different
 
01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
people in a state with 1.3 million and
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
significant number of whom are either
 
01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
too young or too old to be doing this
 
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
I'm in the latter category of course
 
01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
um you know that's a pretty big
 
01:16:42.910 --> 01:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
number yeah and and different states
 
01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
have taken different approaches to that
 
01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
are you know so the 100,000 number you
 
01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:51.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be concerned if we were to take
 
01:16:53.669 --> 01:16:53.679 align:start position:0%
a look at that in terms of one of the
 
01:16:55.870 --> 01:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
smaller States in I think we would defer
 
01:16:58.350 --> 01:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
to the instate business Community to
 
01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:00.159 align:start position:0%
determine what their thoughts were on
 
01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
that you see we would defer to the
 
01:17:05.149 --> 01:17:05.159 align:start position:0%
legislature that passes the laws and we
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
would consult as we always do with the
 
01:17:11.229 --> 01:17:11.239 align:start position:0%
business Community but in the end the
 
01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
buck stops here of course I just meant
 
01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't speak presume to speak for
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
the local businesses okay okay I
 
01:17:20.430 --> 01:17:20.440 align:start position:0%
understand that then thank you very much
 
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
um so the other thing is there are some
 
01:17:26.590 --> 01:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
differences between the Connecticut Law
 
01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
and that seems to be a model that people
 
01:17:35.470 --> 01:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
are are advocating um one example that
 
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
our researcher brought to our attention
 
01:17:40.270 --> 01:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
was the definition of trade
 
01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:43.750 align:start position:0%
was the definition of trade
secret

01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:47.709 --> 01:17:47.719 align:start position:0%
um is that something that we should be
 
01:17:51.790 --> 01:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
worried about or should we yield to
 
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
Connecticut language in in order to try
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
to have uniformity or respect
 
01:17:57.950 --> 01:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
differences so I haven't seen the
 
01:18:00.990 --> 01:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
researchers memo on that generally the
 
01:18:03.229 --> 01:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
definition in these bills of trade
 
01:18:06.629 --> 01:18:06.639 align:start position:0%
secret is taken from the state's version
 
01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
of the uniform Trade Secrets protection
 
01:18:11.149 --> 01:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
act um and so I would have to double
 
01:18:12.629 --> 01:18:12.639 align:start position:0%
check what the state what New
 
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's definition is to determine
 
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
how different it is the point of the
 
01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
trade secret uh piece is to ensure that
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
for things like uh the ACC ACC right or
 
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
the portability right uh that consumers
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
have so consumers have the ability to
 
01:18:31.390 --> 01:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
request all of the information that a
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
business has collected on them or to
 
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
provide that information in a form
 
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
whereby they can then take that to
 
01:18:43.149 --> 01:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
another company right so if I'm changing
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
uh sell carriers and I want to ask them
 
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
to provide me the information so that I
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
can Port that information over to
 
01:18:53.950 --> 01:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
another carrier the point of the trade
 
01:18:55.950 --> 01:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
secret protections there are to make
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
sure that businesses aren't put in the
 
01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
position of saying do we have to provide
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
proprietary information um or violate
 
01:19:06.430 --> 01:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
the law by not providing all of the
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
information back to the consumer so
 
01:19:11.149 --> 01:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
that's the function of the trade secret
 
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
piece here um and trade secrets are
 
01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
typically in state law a term of art so
 
01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
it's not something that businesses can
 
01:19:21.870 --> 01:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
just decide uh you know oh well this is
 
01:19:23.790 --> 01:19:23.800 align:start position:0%
a trade secret or this trade secret it's
 
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
it's generally a term of art I'm not an
 
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
IP lawyer so I've now said all of the
 
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
things that I know about uh Trade
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
Secrets but um that's the intent of that
 
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
of that protection there is to protect
 
01:19:39.709 --> 01:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
the proprietary information um that a
 
01:19:41.709 --> 01:19:41.719 align:start position:0%
business would not generally be required
 
01:19:44.229 --> 01:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
to provide anyway we understand the
 
01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
value of uniformity and and the help
 
01:19:50.229 --> 01:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
that we could get to push this along so
 
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
that maybe at some point in the
 
01:19:53.669 --> 01:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
foreseeable future future the federal
 
01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
government would step up to the plate on
 
01:19:59.910 --> 01:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
this um but by the same token this is a
 
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
state that Prides itself on its
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
individuality and on places where it
 
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
differs yes I mean for example you know
 
01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:10.830 align:start position:0%
differs yes I mean for example you know
the

01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
uniform a lot of the uniform laws take a
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
long time before we're willing to sign
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
on in this state sure because of among
 
01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
other things we do respect
 
01:20:26.510 --> 01:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
privacy and and we always have or
 
01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
historically we always have as a state
 
01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
um but we don't want to arbitrarily
 
01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
differ um just for the sake of differing
 
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
and that's why I'm trying to you know to
 
01:20:45.669 --> 01:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
see what in the language of um sure of
 
01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
255 um could be improved or not I I
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
think our sense um is that
 
01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
you know this is substantially similar
 
01:20:59.229 --> 01:20:59.239 align:start position:0%
to Connecticut um I would also note in
 
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
the you know I I understand New
 
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's uh you know deep roots of
 
01:21:05.669 --> 01:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
individuality and that it may not look
 
01:21:08.709 --> 01:21:08.719 align:start position:0%
to what Oregon or Montana or Texas is
 
01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
doing and find a pattern there but I
 
01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
would also note that in addition to
 
01:21:17.590 --> 01:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
Connecticut um you know Maine is
 
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
considering a version of this framework
 
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island is very getting very close
 
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
to moving forward with a version of this
 
01:21:27.070 --> 01:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
framework and I do think that there's so
 
01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
many consumers and businesses who work
 
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
within the New England region that
 
01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
Regional alignment um you know is
 
01:21:36.910 --> 01:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
important and you know should be uh you
 
01:21:39.229 --> 01:21:39.239 align:start position:0%
know sort of at the top of our thinking
 
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
around what what would work we have
 
01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
people who you know travel in between
 
01:21:45.310 --> 01:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
states every day and we have businesses
 
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
who work within the region so their
 
01:21:49.550 --> 01:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
ability to have common expectations
 
01:21:52.030 --> 01:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
about what works and what doesn't work I
 
01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
think um makes a lot of sense for for
 
01:21:56.510 --> 01:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I think one of the reasons
 
01:21:59.590 --> 01:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
that you heard um so much support for
 
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
this bill in the spring um is that you
 
01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
know everyone felt like okay we're at a
 
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
we're at a place where we can move
 
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
forward with this and you know it's
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
moved through the Senate and sort of
 
01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
last stop here before the house floor um
 
01:22:15.709 --> 01:22:15.719 align:start position:0%
and just trying to you know get it over
 
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
that that hump there could I ask one one
 
01:22:24.629 --> 01:22:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:24.639 --> 01:22:26.990 align:start position:0%
 
misremember

01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
misremember
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
um did I understand you when you began
 
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
by talking about the house bill and then
 
01:22:35.709 --> 01:22:35.719 align:start position:0%
we've now gone to the Senate bill that
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
you recognized the acknowledge the
 
01:22:40.990 --> 01:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
differences between the two and the
 
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
value of each of those bills sure rather
 
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
than seeing one as a substitute for
 
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
another correct I think they're
 
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
addressing two different pieces that
 
01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:53.480 align:start position:0%
that HB 314 would would primarily
 
01:22:56.110 --> 01:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
address public sector uses of personal
 
01:22:59.950 --> 01:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
information sp sp 255 certainly is
 
01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
private sector uses of information I did
 
01:23:04.709 --> 01:23:04.719 align:start position:0%
what a chair should not do I immediately
 
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
began asking you questions and did not
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
look to my colleagues who probably have
 
01:23:12.990 --> 01:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
much better questions I'm very sorry I
 
01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:14.639 align:start position:0%
apologize for
 
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
that represent V your light is on is
 
01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:20.440 align:start position:0%
that just yeah I had a question I want
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
to go back to um the number
 
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
um of I think um if uh you had mentioned
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
100,000 are any of the other states that
 
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
have passed this into legislation um
 
01:23:37.229 --> 01:23:37.239 align:start position:0%
have they decreased the number to maybe
 
01:23:42.189 --> 01:23:42.199 align:start position:0%
50,000 35,000 25,000 one um
 
01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
Delaware uh I
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
believe I've got to do this off the top
 
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
of my head so I believe
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
Delaware is 50,000 it maybe 35,000
 
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.830 align:start position:0%
Delaware is 50,000 it maybe 35,000
um

01:23:56.830 --> 01:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
and just trying
 
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
to go across the different
 
01:24:05.790 --> 01:24:05.800 align:start position:0%
states yeah yeah so I'm sorry what was
 
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
that Montana I believe is
 
01:24:12.510 --> 01:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
50,000 um and then uh I believe it was
 
01:24:16.189 --> 01:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
Tennessee that actually raised it uh to
 
01:24:20.350 --> 01:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
one to 175,000 so that is a number that
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
different states have moved depending
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
on whether their feeling is they want
 
01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
every you know they want more businesses
 
01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
to be included or they only want the
 
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
largest businesses to be included thank
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
you for that um yes representative yeah
 
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
just just one clarification it's kind of
 
01:24:40.189 --> 01:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
a followup on on the question I think
 
01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
that you asked about the the interplay
 
01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
between the two bills um am I right in
 
01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
understanding that your thought the your
 
01:24:50.350 --> 01:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
thought is that the the need for both
 
01:24:54.030 --> 01:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
bills stems from the idea idea that 314
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
the previous bill that we talked about
 
01:24:58.709 --> 01:24:58.719 align:start position:0%
would be solely focused on government
 
01:25:01.229 --> 01:25:01.239 align:start position:0%
entities um because I believe the
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
conversation had kind of gone the
 
01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
opposite direction of that and I just
 
01:25:06.189 --> 01:25:06.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to understand it may have been
 
01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
your your version that I had looked at
 
01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
or I confused yeah the language that
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
we'll make sure the the uh this
 
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
committee gets would a would uh add a
 
01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
definition of service provider into
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
hb314 to make sure that um
 
01:25:26.030 --> 01:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
the that bill deals with but
 
01:25:27.390 --> 01:25:27.400 align:start position:0%
appropriately segregates
 
01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for the government
 
01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
agencies which are in that situation the
 
01:25:35.149 --> 01:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
consumer facing entity um the one that
 
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
the consumer is dealing with and the one
 
01:25:38.430 --> 01:25:38.440 align:start position:0%
that would be collecting information
 
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
directly from the consumer and then the
 
01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
service provider which similar to SP 255
 
01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
is the business that the government
 
01:25:49.950 --> 01:25:49.960 align:start position:0%
entity would have engaged to do
 
01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
particular um processes on their their
 
01:25:55.709 --> 01:25:55.719 align:start position:0%
behalf um that might be collecting
 
01:25:57.390 --> 01:25:57.400 align:start position:0%
information on the government entities's
 
01:25:59.629 --> 01:25:59.639 align:start position:0%
behalf it might be analyzing information
 
01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
on their behalf or collating information
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
somehow but um you know our point you
 
01:26:06.390 --> 01:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
know the the point that I just wanted to
 
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
make is that if if we add a private
 
01:26:11.390 --> 01:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
right of action that applies to those
 
01:26:13.870 --> 01:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
service providers who are performing
 
01:26:16.390 --> 01:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
tasks at the direction of the government
 
01:26:19.109 --> 01:26:19.119 align:start position:0%
entities that it will be those service
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
providers and not the entity itself
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
who's you know coming up with what they
 
01:26:27.109 --> 01:26:27.119 align:start position:0%
want to do with the information Etc um
 
01:26:28.669 --> 01:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
that will end up bearing the brunt of
 
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
the litigation um both because that's
 
01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
where the financial resources will be
 
01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
and because I think and again I could be
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
wrong but I believe that there's
 
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
signific some significant sovereign
 
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
immunity issues about whether
 
01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
individuals can sue the state for
 
01:26:49.709 --> 01:26:49.719 align:start position:0%
anything other than an intentional tort
 
01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I
 
01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
think Divine looks a little
 
01:27:04.629 --> 01:27:04.639 align:start position:0%
troubled what about representative Devon
 
01:27:07.229 --> 01:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
just quickly so you're what you guys are
 
01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
talking about I just want to get this
 
01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
straight on 314 adding like Goods
 
01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:14.719 align:start position:0%
because goods and goods and services
 
01:27:16.270 --> 01:27:16.280 align:start position:0%
isn't a part
 
01:27:20.830 --> 01:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 314 yeah our Goods part is
 
01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
our edits would just would not
 
01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
distinguish between goods and services
 
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
it would just cover personal
 
01:27:29.189 --> 01:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
information um which would be any
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
information linked or reasonably
 
01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:35.560 align:start position:0%
linkable to a consumer so anything that
 
01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
could even be reasonably linked to a
 
01:27:39.109 --> 01:27:39.119 align:start position:0%
consumer would count as personal
 
01:27:42.149 --> 01:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
information and it would it would just
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
establish that business that the
 
01:27:45.629 --> 01:27:45.639 align:start position:0%
government has a duty to minimize the
 
01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
collection of that in a couple different
 
01:27:50.229 --> 01:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
circumstances again that you know that's
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
patterned after a lot that that
 
01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
California had has had for some time and
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
we think seems to get at the intent of
 
01:28:01.950 --> 01:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
what hb314 was was sort of looking for
 
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay I just wanted to add to that just
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm thinking right about certain
 
01:28:08.350 --> 01:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
types of businesses so say Amazon where
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
they sell Goods they would be included
 
01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
in that kind of it it would cover any
 
01:28:17.149 --> 01:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
entity that contracts with the state
 
01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
with the state okay but it would cover
 
01:28:22.830 --> 01:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
them in their capacity as a State
 
01:28:27.109 --> 01:28:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
okay can can I also
 
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
sorry just sort of a followup on my
 
01:28:33.709 --> 01:28:33.719 align:start position:0%
previous I I just wanted to clarify
 
01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
because I from our previous discussion
 
01:28:37.709 --> 01:28:37.719 align:start position:0%
in 314 it was kind of my understanding
 
01:28:39.229 --> 01:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
that the point of it was to broaden it
 
01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
beyond the
 
01:28:43.870 --> 01:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
government um and I guess this question
 
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
is to our other members of the committee
 
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
was I miss understanding that or or or
 
01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
was or or was it sort of that 314 should
 
01:28:53.790 --> 01:28:53.800 align:start position:0%
focus on government entities
 
01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
representative Blinn wants to comment I
 
01:28:57.310 --> 01:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
think yeah no I think in answer to your
 
01:29:00.910 --> 01:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
question my my proposed amendment to 314
 
01:29:04.629 --> 01:29:04.639 align:start position:0%
would limit it to the government um
 
01:29:06.750 --> 01:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
representative F and rep and former
 
01:29:08.669 --> 01:29:08.679 align:start position:0%
representative Kirk's Amendment would
 
01:29:11.390 --> 01:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
would not do that it would be it would
 
01:29:20.669 --> 01:29:20.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
also I believe the point of
 
01:29:26.350 --> 01:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
Representative F's
 
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
proposal is the private sector and not
 
01:29:32.990 --> 01:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
the government in that among other
 
01:29:35.669 --> 01:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
things in this
 
01:29:39.189 --> 01:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
state we have a high level of confidence
 
01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
in the ability of the
 
01:29:47.350 --> 01:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
government to behave um
 
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
appropriately and so we want to
 
01:29:52.590 --> 01:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
encourage everyone to follow that model
 
01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
and that means we want to focus sure on
 
01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
private and I think our sense is if
 
01:29:59.590 --> 01:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about the private
 
01:30:01.709 --> 01:30:01.719 align:start position:0%
sector that sp sp 255 would be a much
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive and sort of balanced
 
01:30:09.870 --> 01:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
case Okay anything
 
01:30:18.030 --> 01:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
else anything else okay um thank you
 
01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
very much if you would give us you know
 
01:30:22.830 --> 01:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
make sure our research has the
 
01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
information that we need and she will
 
01:30:29.310 --> 01:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
make sure it gets to us um is there
 
01:30:33.709 --> 01:30:33.719 align:start position:0%
anyone else here who would like to add
 
01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
sir press the microphone so the red
 
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
buttons on and speak quite closely to it
 
01:30:58.109 --> 01:30:58.119 align:start position:0%
because um it's not just the people in
 
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
this room this is all being recorded and
 
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
people will be listening aply very good
 
01:31:08.109 --> 01:31:08.119 align:start position:0%
thank you to the chair um my name is
 
01:31:10.830 --> 01:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
David Miller uh you may but probably
 
01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
don't remember me from could you speak
 
01:31:15.950 --> 01:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
into the M please oh um I was here for
 
01:31:17.790 --> 01:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
the hearing earlier this year in the
 
01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
capacity of an individual employed in
 
01:31:22.149 --> 01:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
privacy and security engineering as a
 
01:31:23.629 --> 01:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
private citizen but I'm now a resident
 
01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
of the state so I come before you not as
 
01:31:28.830 --> 01:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
a lobbyist but as someone hopefully
 
01:31:30.030 --> 01:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
bringing both some professional
 
01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
experience and as a
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
constituent by the way almost all the
 
01:31:37.149 --> 01:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
lobbyists in this room are also
 
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
constituents I just want you to
 
01:31:41.390 --> 01:31:41.400 align:start position:0%
excellent very good to
 
01:31:44.430 --> 01:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
hear um I have a few uh primary points
 
01:31:47.390 --> 01:31:47.400 align:start position:0%
to bring up and I thank the chair and
 
01:31:48.910 --> 01:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
several other members of the committee
 
01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
for uh being particularly concerned with
 
01:31:55.550 --> 01:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
the threshold of 100,000 persons uh in
 
01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:56.350 align:start position:0%
the threshold of 100,000 persons uh in
the

01:31:56.350 --> 01:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:32:00.750 --> 01:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
bill the history of the state
 
01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
bills in the US is roughly as follows um
 
01:32:08.030 --> 01:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
a real estate agent in San
 
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
Francisco parlayed with some
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
brinksmanship with Facebook lawyers uh
 
01:32:16.950 --> 01:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
and instead of a referendum got CCPA
 
01:32:20.510 --> 01:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
passed no bill since has been a copycat
 
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
of the California bill in instead there
 
01:32:24.270 --> 01:32:24.280 align:start position:0%
are roughly two lineages of where the
 
01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
texts come
 
01:32:28.669 --> 01:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
from there's the Virginia bill which was
 
01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
the second one to pass and had a
 
01:32:34.669 --> 01:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
stronger uh right to opt in to the
 
01:32:36.270 --> 01:32:36.280 align:start position:0%
collection of sensitive information so
 
01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
it included data minimization more
 
01:32:41.390 --> 01:32:41.400 align:start position:0%
similarly to say Canada and the EU and
 
01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
then there was adpa which was a federal
 
01:32:47.709 --> 01:32:47.719 align:start position:0%
bill that uh Nancy Pelosi defeated
 
01:32:49.390 --> 01:32:49.400 align:start position:0%
because it would have preempted uh some
 
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
stronger Provisions in the California
 
01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
bill this week and next week there are
 
01:32:56.189 --> 01:32:56.199 align:start position:0%
hearings in three states in New England
 
01:32:59.149 --> 01:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
about bills similar to
 
01:33:04.430 --> 01:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
s255 Maine actually has two bills being
 
01:33:08.669 --> 01:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
considered LD 1977 and LD
 
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
1973 1973 which was mentioned by one of
 
01:33:15.109 --> 01:33:15.119 align:start position:0%
the prior speakers uh is actually based
 
01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
on the Virginia template just like ours
 
01:33:22.149 --> 01:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
is but LD 1977 is based on ad
 
01:33:22.159 --> 01:33:23.709 align:start position:0%
is but LD 1977 is based on ad
PPA

01:33:23.709 --> 01:33:23.719 align:start position:0%
PPA
 
01:33:25.870 --> 01:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is having hearings next
 
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
week on a bill based on
 
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
adpa and of course we have this one
 
01:33:33.310 --> 01:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
here now different states have taken
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
different approaches to the threshold
 
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
that they have chosen it's true that
 
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
Tennessee increased the number to
 
01:33:42.189 --> 01:33:42.199 align:start position:0%
175,000 but Tennessee has a population
 
01:33:44.229 --> 01:33:44.239 align:start position:0%
of 6.9
 
01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
million Delaware so far is the state
 
01:33:49.870 --> 01:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
Delaware and Montana are the states with
 
01:33:51.310 --> 01:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
the most similar populations to New
 
01:33:55.790 --> 01:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sure that have passed uh bills
 
01:33:58.870 --> 01:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
like this and uh as mentioned by the
 
01:34:00.990 --> 01:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
prior speaker Delaware has chosen a
 
01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
threshold of
 
01:34:04.510 --> 01:34:04.520 align:start position:0%
35,000 and Montana has chosen a
 
01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
50,000 New Hampshire has a population
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
pyramid that skews uh towards people
 
01:34:17.070 --> 01:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
under 18 for whom there are some
 
01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
existing Protections in federal law um
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
although perhaps inadequate um and to
 
01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
the elderly there are a lot of young
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
people who move to the rest of the
 
01:34:27.669 --> 01:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
country and return to New Hampshire
 
01:34:30.310 --> 01:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
later because of that population
 
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
skew a threshold of
 
01:34:35.070 --> 01:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
100,000 would
 
01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
exclude um let's say phone apps or tech
 
01:34:41.149 --> 01:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
companies or any data collector and
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
processor from
 
01:34:46.590 --> 01:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
consideration whose Target demographic
 
01:34:49.070 --> 01:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
is a minority of any kind and it
 
01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a partisan issue because
 
01:34:54.109 --> 01:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
that could be people of color who
 
01:34:56.510 --> 01:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
represent a small minority of the state
 
01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
it could be people with an alternate
 
01:34:58.480 --> 01:34:59.669 align:start position:0%
it could be people with an alternate
sexual

01:34:59.669 --> 01:34:59.679 align:start position:0%
sexual
 
01:35:01.870 --> 01:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
orientation um where the protection of
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
the data is quite important but even if
 
01:35:06.750 --> 01:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
sensitive data were collected it
 
01:35:08.830 --> 01:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't matter because 100,000
 
01:35:13.470 --> 01:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
threshold as 5% of one gender and
 
01:35:14.990 --> 01:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
usually only people in a certain age
 
01:35:17.070 --> 01:35:17.080 align:start position:0%
demographic would quickly fall below the
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
threshold or it could be a religious
 
01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
community or people of a particular
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh political persuasion and consequently
 
01:35:27.189 --> 01:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
I would recommend lowering the threshold
 
01:35:29.870 --> 01:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
to something similar to the Delaware
 
01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:31.390 align:start position:0%
to something similar to the Delaware
Montana

01:35:31.390 --> 01:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
Montana
 
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
number another point I'd like to bring
 
01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
following other than redefining individ
 
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh oh so sorry one more point about the
 
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
numbers the numbers in ADP were Federal
 
01:35:55.830 --> 01:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
the 100,000 Criterion remember comes
 
01:35:59.709 --> 01:35:59.719 align:start position:0%
vaguely from the California bill which
 
01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
was about a much much larger State now
 
01:36:04.629 --> 01:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
the threshold of a couple hundred
 
01:36:05.790 --> 01:36:05.800 align:start position:0%
thousand in
 
01:36:09.390 --> 01:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
adpa makes sense for a federal Bill and
 
01:36:11.109 --> 01:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
Maine has done something interesting the
 
01:36:12.669 --> 01:36:12.679 align:start position:0%
bill hasn't passed yet the hearings are
 
01:36:16.830 --> 01:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
next week but Maine has adopted adpa and
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
not redefined the term individuals or
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
consumers to meet only residents of the
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
state the bills that have passed so far
 
01:36:28.629 --> 01:36:28.639 align:start position:0%
have all done that Massachusetts
 
01:36:30.590 --> 01:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
actually says resident or person
 
01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
physically present in
 
01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts possibly because they're
 
01:36:36.430 --> 01:36:36.440 align:start position:0%
trying to protect persons who come from
 
01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
other states in order to receive
 
01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:39.229 align:start position:0%
other states in order to receive
abortion

01:36:39.229 --> 01:36:39.239 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
01:36:39.239 --> 01:36:40.910 align:start position:0%
abortion
care

01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
but most of the
 
01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
states require that the person is
 
01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
somehow connected to the state and so
 
01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:49.109 align:start position:0%
somehow connected to the state and so
does

01:36:49.109 --> 01:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:36:52.109 --> 01:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
s255 Maine doesn't and they keep the
 
01:36:54.910 --> 01:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
200,000 threshold so there's various
 
01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
things that you can do with
 
01:36:59.470 --> 01:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
s255 to make the threshold make sense
 
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
but the current one is too big and I
 
01:37:03.310 --> 01:37:03.320 align:start position:0%
recommend looking at the other states
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
for inspiration I'll be happy to provide
 
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
written testimony to assist with that
 
01:37:09.550 --> 01:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
with links to the relevant bills to your
 
01:37:12.070 --> 01:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
researcher the other thing is that it
 
01:37:13.950 --> 01:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
might be interesting to look at
 
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
mechanisms that aren't uh arbitrary uh
 
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
private right of action for all the
 
01:37:22.030 --> 01:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
provisions of the
 
01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:23.679 align:start position:0%
um because of course that could burden
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
the business Community um but to look at
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
things like injunctive relief or private
 
01:37:29.950 --> 01:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
right of action preemptable by the
 
01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:30.910 align:start position:0%
right of action preemptable by the
Attorney

01:37:30.910 --> 01:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
Attorney
 
01:37:36.270 --> 01:37:36.280 align:start position:0%
General only for certain clearly
 
01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
articulated violations of the Privacy
 
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
rights of individuals such as a
 
01:37:44.189 --> 01:37:44.199 align:start position:0%
reportable data breach of course there's
 
01:37:47.589 --> 01:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
a lot of things to be determined about
 
01:37:49.310 --> 01:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
how the law will be interpreted that
 
01:37:50.910 --> 01:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
would make a general right of private
 
01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:52.350 align:start position:0%
would make a general right of private
action

01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:52.360 align:start position:0%
action
 
01:37:54.430 --> 01:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
likely raise the eye the business
 
01:37:56.109 --> 01:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
Community but I would encourage the
 
01:37:57.270 --> 01:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
consider other limited ways for
 
01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
consumers to exercise their rights
 
01:38:04.990 --> 01:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
especially if a significant number of
 
01:38:07.390 --> 01:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents are impacted by
 
01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:08.830 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents are impacted by
a

01:38:08.830 --> 01:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
violation um data minimization is a
 
01:38:17.589 --> 01:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
common feature of uh Stronger data
 
01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
privacy laws in our largest trading
 
01:38:21.790 --> 01:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
partners including ENC counted in the
 
01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:22.950 align:start position:0%
partners including ENC counted in the
European

01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
European
 
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
Union and um it's arguable that uh the
 
01:38:29.310 --> 01:38:29.320 align:start position:0%
Virginia and Connecticut template on
 
01:38:33.629 --> 01:38:33.639 align:start position:0%
which nh25 is based uh introduces data
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
minimization only for the most sensitive
 
01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
data and that these protections could be
 
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
made stronger that being said that would
 
01:38:42.910 --> 01:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
be a major change to the bill so I won't
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
go off on it too long and there's one
 
01:38:47.709 --> 01:38:47.719 align:start position:0%
very small additional recommendation I
 
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
would make there is an exemption in this
 
01:38:53.629 --> 01:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
text that does not exist in some of the
 
01:38:55.870 --> 01:38:55.880 align:start position:0%
other state laws with exactly the same
 
01:38:57.870 --> 01:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
wording and that is the exemption
 
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
related to FC the last time that Fally
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
the Federal Credit Reporting Act of
 
01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
1974 a lot of brokering of data in this
 
01:39:12.589 --> 01:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
country comes from the fact that other
 
01:39:14.550 --> 01:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
than now the Social Security
 
01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
Administration uh We've chosen as a
 
01:39:19.149 --> 01:39:19.159 align:start position:0%
country to actually have the private
 
01:39:21.550 --> 01:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
sector handle the data base of our
 
01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
population many countries have
 
01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
population registers the United States
 
01:39:26.229 --> 01:39:26.239 align:start position:0%
has the credit
 
01:39:29.550 --> 01:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
bureaus and a lot of information is
 
01:39:31.229 --> 01:39:31.239 align:start position:0%
exchange for the purposes of
 
01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
establishing creditworthiness now
 
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
subsequent to the civil rights movement
 
01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
and also to the church committee
 
01:39:40.229 --> 01:39:40.239 align:start position:0%
investigation and realizations about the
 
01:39:42.550 --> 01:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
FBI and its stance on anti-war
 
01:39:45.070 --> 01:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
protesters in the 60s the last time that
 
01:39:47.589 --> 01:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
Federal Congress considered a slew of
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
privacy legislation that is still in
 
01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
effect was in the early 7s and the
 
01:39:54.350 --> 01:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
Federal Credit Reporting Act is one of
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
the pieces of legislation that came out
 
01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:56.870 align:start position:0%
the pieces of legislation that came out
of

01:39:56.870 --> 01:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
that but the exemption in
 
01:40:03.550 --> 01:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
s255 for federal Credit Reporting Act
 
01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that you are Exempted from
 
01:40:07.589 --> 01:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
coverage if you are supplying the data
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
directly to a credit bureau it can be
 
01:40:12.750 --> 01:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
interpreted and I'm not the lawyer it
 
01:40:16.030 --> 01:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
can be interpreted as meaning that if
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
any data that you provide to an external
 
01:40:22.270 --> 01:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
that you transfer to an external entity
 
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
is used for FC related purposes then all
 
01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
of your activities fall out of coverage
 
01:40:31.070 --> 01:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
of the law and I would recommend that a
 
01:40:33.950 --> 01:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
word like primarily or principally or
 
01:40:36.750 --> 01:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
significantly or some clearer standard
 
01:40:38.709 --> 01:40:38.719 align:start position:0%
be introduced to that Clause to ensure
 
01:40:39.910 --> 01:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
that it is not an
 
01:40:45.390 --> 01:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
invitation for uh companies to get out
 
01:40:47.430 --> 01:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
of coverage of the law wholesale by
 
01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
transferring token amounts of
 
01:40:54.270 --> 01:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
information to uh secondary FC related
 
01:40:57.709 --> 01:40:57.719 align:start position:0%
entities thank you thank you very much
 
01:40:57.719 --> 01:41:00.470 align:start position:0%
entities thank you thank you very much
any

01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for that and would
 
01:41:04.669 --> 01:41:04.679 align:start position:0%
you please again make sure that our
 
01:41:07.790 --> 01:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
researcher um knows how to get in touch
 
01:41:09.790 --> 01:41:09.800 align:start position:0%
with you and if you were going to submit
 
01:41:11.870 --> 01:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
anything in writing that you do that
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:26.310 align:start position:0%
 
else

01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:27.750 --> 01:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the subcommittee
 
01:41:30.790 --> 01:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
thanks for allowing me to speak today um
 
01:41:33.390 --> 01:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not gonna go very long my name is my
 
01:41:35.629 --> 01:41:35.639 align:start position:0%
name is Matthew Schwarz I'm a policy
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
Analyst at Consumer
 
01:41:40.189 --> 01:41:40.199 align:start position:0%
Reports um I'm not GNA go very long
 
01:41:41.669 --> 01:41:41.679 align:start position:0%
David and I have been working together
 
01:41:43.350 --> 01:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
and he covered a lot of the the same
 
01:41:46.510 --> 01:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
points that I was going to bring up uh
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
and I believe representative tur has um
 
01:41:51.790 --> 01:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
some points that cover
 
01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh those issues so I'm going to
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
just let maybe him bring those up and
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
and available for for any questions
 
01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
about that so you don't have anything
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
else to say now um we're very glad
 
01:42:07.790 --> 01:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
you're here welcome to the Hampshire
 
01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you thank you make sure you
 
01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
see the leaves
 
01:42:12.950 --> 01:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
changing um maybe I'll go a little bit
 
01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
off script and and just say you know
 
01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
David brought up the fcra exemption I
 
01:42:21.950 --> 01:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
have similar concerns about about the
 
01:42:25.790 --> 01:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
entity level exemptions for please use
 
01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
um the English language uh I have
 
01:42:30.589 --> 01:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
concerns about the exemptions for for
 
01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
financial institutions under the gram
 
01:42:38.030 --> 01:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
leech blly act so this bill as it's
 
01:42:44.109 --> 01:42:44.119 align:start position:0%
drafted says that if uh the the the
 
01:42:46.189 --> 01:42:46.199 align:start position:0%
financial institution has any data
 
01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's covered by glba Graham leech Bly
 
01:42:52.830 --> 01:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
than the entire uh institutions Exempted
 
01:42:54.990 --> 01:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
but we're quickly kind of moving into a
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
world where tech companies could be
 
01:43:01.830 --> 01:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
cover covered by Gram Le flyy and these
 
01:43:04.070 --> 01:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
are the the very companies that we you
 
01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
know have the data abuses that we're
 
01:43:08.709 --> 01:43:08.719 align:start position:0%
we're worried about here I'd be
 
01:43:12.109 --> 01:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
concerned that if you know a small part
 
01:43:14.950 --> 01:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
of that business is covered by grle
 
01:43:17.470 --> 01:43:17.480 align:start position:0%
biley then we're just gonna exempt the
 
01:43:19.229 --> 01:43:19.239 align:start position:0%
entire business and that's that's pretty
 
01:43:21.629 --> 01:43:21.639 align:start position:0%
problematic now it is that in the
 
01:43:23.910 --> 01:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
original bill or is that in an amendment
 
01:43:25.589 --> 01:43:25.599 align:start position:0%
that's been proposed that's in the
 
01:43:25.599 --> 01:43:26.910 align:start position:0%
that's been proposed that's in the
original

01:43:26.910 --> 01:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
original
 
01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
bill um oh okay so I
 
01:43:34.589 --> 01:43:34.599 align:start position:0%
can quickly navigate to the section I'm
 
01:43:37.550 --> 01:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
sure you can find it more quickly than
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.679 --> 01:43:53.149 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:43:53.149 --> 01:43:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:56.350 --> 01:43:56.360 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank
 
01:43:59.149 --> 01:43:59.159 align:start position:0%
you right and thank you and there's a
 
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
similar exemption
 
01:44:04.870 --> 01:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
for uh uh companies that are covered
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
under Hippa so medical providers
 
01:44:11.310 --> 01:44:11.320 align:start position:0%
hospitals insurance companies if you
 
01:44:13.070 --> 01:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
have any information that's covered by
 
01:44:18.109 --> 01:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
hippo the entire entity is Exempted um
 
01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
again Amazon Facebook
 
01:44:24.870 --> 01:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
Apple all moving to provide you know
 
01:44:28.189 --> 01:44:28.199 align:start position:0%
health care products uh and if they
 
01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
eventually come under you know coverage
 
01:44:34.510 --> 01:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
of HIPPA I'd be concerned that you know
 
01:44:36.310 --> 01:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
the entire company would then then be
 
01:44:39.629 --> 01:44:39.639 align:start position:0%
Exempted from this bill
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
um and so I would argue that at the very
 
01:44:46.350 --> 01:44:46.360 align:start position:0%
least we should be only exempting them
 
01:44:48.189 --> 01:44:48.199 align:start position:0%
to the extent that they're covered by
 
01:44:50.270 --> 01:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
these these other laws and in areas
 
01:44:52.229 --> 01:44:52.239 align:start position:0%
where they're or not uh they should
 
01:44:54.669 --> 01:44:54.679 align:start position:0%
still be subject to S SP
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
255 thank you very much for that any
 
01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:01.030 align:start position:0%
255 thank you very much for that any
questions

01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
comments in general I will say that that
 
01:45:06.589 --> 01:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
my top three concerns are the threshold
 
01:45:08.790 --> 01:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
the enforcement uh and the data
 
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
minimization but we've talked about all
 
01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
of that already thank
 
01:45:16.830 --> 01:45:16.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you go on the
 
01:45:19.030 --> 01:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
bike we have
 
01:45:22.270 --> 01:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
gotten it works want get thing we canel
 
01:45:24.109 --> 01:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
but we haven't gotten a final word yet
 
01:45:25.470 --> 01:45:25.480 align:start position:0%
about what is
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%

01:45:43.709 --> 01:45:43.719 align:start position:0%

being here uh today um and
 
01:45:54.589 --> 01:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
helping the committee deal with two
 
01:45:57.189 --> 01:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
important but very complicated
 
01:46:02.350 --> 01:46:02.360 align:start position:0%
bills what I would like to suggest
 
01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
um provisionally this might have to be
 
01:46:07.510 --> 01:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
changed for other reasons but what I
 
01:46:09.589 --> 01:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
would like to suggest
 
01:46:13.350 --> 01:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
provisionally is that we
 
01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:15.679 align:start position:0%
reconvene this
 
01:46:19.229 --> 01:46:19.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um on Tuesday the
 
01:46:23.149 --> 01:46:23.159 align:start position:0%
24th of of um October that might have to
 
01:46:27.270 --> 01:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
be changed um but so pencil it in for
 
01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:29.159 align:start position:0%
those of us who write in pencil and
 
01:46:31.709 --> 01:46:31.719 align:start position:0%
don't just put it into an electronic
 
01:46:31.719 --> 01:46:33.629 align:start position:0%
don't just put it into an electronic
Gizmo

01:46:33.629 --> 01:46:33.639 align:start position:0%
Gizmo
 
01:46:37.950 --> 01:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
um and we will confirm shortly and what
 
01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
I would like to do on the 24th which
 
01:46:46.510 --> 01:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
might not be possible is to ask that we
 
01:46:48.510 --> 01:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
have before
 
01:46:52.189 --> 01:46:52.199 align:start position:0%
us a proposed proposed amendments on the
 
01:46:52.199 --> 01:46:53.790 align:start position:0%
us a proposed proposed amendments on the
two

01:46:53.790 --> 01:46:53.800 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:46:58.430 --> 01:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
bills separate amendments separate bills
 
01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:00.350 align:start position:0%
bills separate amendments separate bills
um

01:47:00.350 --> 01:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
that would make it possible for the
 
01:47:08.830 --> 01:47:08.840 align:start position:0%
committee perhaps to actually reach a
 
01:47:10.990 --> 01:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
point of recommendation where we could
 
01:47:15.629 --> 01:47:15.639 align:start position:0%
say to the full committee we are
 
01:47:18.189 --> 01:47:18.199 align:start position:0%
recommending Amendment
 
01:47:22.030 --> 01:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
X for 314 and Amendment
 
01:47:23.790 --> 01:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
y for
 
01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
255 and then um it would come those
 
01:47:30.189 --> 01:47:30.199 align:start position:0%
would come to the full committee for
 
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
discussion on the 8th of
 
01:47:35.470 --> 01:47:35.480 align:start position:0%
November um the reason I'm suggesting
 
01:47:39.669 --> 01:47:39.679 align:start position:0%
the 24th is that gives us two weeks to
 
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
um really think about what the amendment
 
01:47:46.830 --> 01:47:46.840 align:start position:0%
what amendment we would like to have and
 
01:47:49.470 --> 01:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
it gives us another two weeks before we
 
01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
go to the
 
01:47:53.950 --> 01:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
full committee so that we're not rushing
 
01:47:56.189 --> 01:47:56.199 align:start position:0%
this we're not we're not meeting at 9
 
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the
 
01:47:59.870 --> 01:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
morning to then vote on something at 10
 
01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning does that make
 
01:48:06.589 --> 01:48:06.599 align:start position:0%
sense to everybody yes okay so I will
 
01:48:10.629 --> 01:48:10.639 align:start position:0%
thank everyone for being here um I will
 
01:48:15.149 --> 01:48:15.159 align:start position:0%
adjourn this session and we confirm as
 
01:48:18.350 --> 01:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
soon as possible that we will be meeting
 
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
again as a subcommittee
 
01:48:22.470 --> 01:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:48:24.510 --> 01:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
24th at
 
01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:26.189 align:start position:0%
24th at
10:00

01:48:26.189 --> 01:48:26.199 align:start position:0%
10:00
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:49.199 --> 01:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
again
