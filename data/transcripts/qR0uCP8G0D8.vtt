morning's hearing i was much more
 
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
confused than i was before oh you think
 
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 align:start position:0%
on 409
 
00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 align:start position:0%
the active language here is the governor
 
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
declares a state of emergency and the
 
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.949 align:start position:0%
declares a state of emergency and the
municipality

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.630 align:start position:0%
municipality
um

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
has applied for assistance
 
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
the governor with the approval of the
 
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
executive council may approve a
 
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
non-interest loan
 
00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
up to the amount of assistance from fema
 
00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 align:start position:0%
funds not otherwise appropriated
 
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
that's 409
 
00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 align:start position:0%
in 402
 
00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
the languages
 
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
the governor declares a state of
 
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
emergency and municipality has applied
 
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
then the governor with the approval of
 
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee and the executive
 
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.390 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee and the executive
council

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
may approve disbursements
 
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
of financial assistance to the
 
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.030 align:start position:0%
of financial assistance to the
municipalities

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
what is
 
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
what is what with both of these are
 
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
no not quite one has a non-interest loan
 
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.469 align:start position:0%
no not quite one has a non-interest loan
which

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
we consider a grant i guess
 
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
or whatever it's a non it says
 
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
non-interest loan
 
00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
and 402 is just a disbursement of
 
00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
general fonts apparently
 
00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.350 align:start position:0%
general fonts apparently
yes

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.710 align:start position:0%
yes
afterwards

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
kicked in right okay
 
00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
wait is this language straightforward
 
00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
enough that
 
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
that it
 
00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
it does what the intended intent was
 
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.950 align:start position:0%
it does what the intended intent was
well

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
yes i think
 
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
the language is
 
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.390 align:start position:0%
the language is
clear

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
or do we need them both
 
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
oh yeah and my question is
 
00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
do we need them both
 
00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
she just no that's i don't think i don't
 
00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:20.950 align:start position:0%
she just no that's i don't think i don't
i

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
from my perspective it's going to be one
 
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
okay we have two amendments here
 
00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
yeah to 409.
 
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
representative turcott why don't you
 
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
tell us what you've done
 
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
sure um in the original hearing i just
 
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 align:start position:0%
had some questions on uh
 
00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759 align:start position:0%
when it talked about anticipated
 
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
assistance and i wanted a little more
 
00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
clarity on on that so um
 
00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
mickey drew drew up this so it would
 
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
instead of saying that it would say
 
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh anticipate anticipated assistance
 
00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 align:start position:0%
from fema and then the changes as agreed
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
upon by the division of homeland
 
00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199 align:start position:0%
security emergency management and the
 
00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
municipality which is what i was going
 
00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:17.270 align:start position:0%
municipality which is what i was going
for

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
okay so that that just
 
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
yeah that was already there
 
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.830 align:start position:0%
yeah that was already there
yeah

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.469 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
and then what my amendment does
 
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
is says that uh
 
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
you have to apply for uh hazard
 
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
mitigation grant funding in other words
 
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
i'm if you know we've heard the horror
 
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
stories down along uh
 
00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
the gulf coast where
 
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
flood after flood after flood and nobody
 
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
does anything to mitigate it so that was
 
00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759 align:start position:0%
that was what what this one
 
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
now when i s
 
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
when we left on whenever our last
 
00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
we basically had no disagreement with
 
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.110 align:start position:0%
 
bill

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:35.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
so that takes
 
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
are they going to have to um we're not
 
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
is it going to be both
 
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
um executive council and
 
00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
and and fiscal or one or just
 
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
this one just is just one of them i
 
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:56.469 align:start position:0%
this one just is just one of them i
guess

00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
approval of the executive council
 
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
that's two cuts
 
00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
it's just the executive yeah it doesn't
 
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't need the bill as it stands
 
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.589 align:start position:0%
it doesn't need the bill as it stands
says

00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
gen uh executive fiscal fiscal committee
 
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
and executive council
 
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
where do you see that
 
00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
that's what's in the bill now
 
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
in line seven
 
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
well that's 402. yeah
 
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
that's 402. 409 doesn't
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
it's just because it's a disaster it
 
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't come to fiscal
 
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
okay 409 just has executive council
 
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.630 align:start position:0%
thank you

00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:35.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
i mean we'll go back and
 
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
i probably shouldn't have said that this
 
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.750 align:start position:0%
i probably shouldn't have said that this
is

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
okay yep that's all right we're having
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
fun and that's
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
and that's what uh that's what that's
 
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
what division two is all about
 
00:09:43.829 --> 00:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
so are you talking about 402 right now
 
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
yeah we're only 409. we're not going to
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
talk about burning back because
 
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.350 align:start position:0%
talk about burning back because
yeah

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
unless unless you have something you
 
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
want to say
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
about 409 that's going to change my mind
 
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte's amendment
 
00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.870 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte's amendment
totally

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
totally
 
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.750 align:start position:0%
totally
weren't

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
weren't
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
on board with that
 
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.069 align:start position:0%
on board with that
okay

00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
but just your amendment just a couple of
 
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
things um
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
about it
 
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.630 align:start position:0%
about it
um

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
do you want to do you want to take a
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
stab at it we've already kind of talked
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
about it so we're not the expert
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
okay just let you know a couple of
 
00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:30.870 align:start position:0%
okay just let you know a couple of
things

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
if there are a couple of things wrong i
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
want mickey to get it right yeah how's
 
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
um okay so yes we took a look at this
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
amendment this morning and um in looking
 
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
at it there
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
might be some so the goal i think is
 
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
well understood um it's the goal is to
 
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
promote hazard mitigation funding
 
00:10:58.949 --> 00:10:58.959 align:start position:0%
and for our agency in particular you
 
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
know we are aware of the hazard
 
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
mitigation assistance funding grant
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
programs and that includes things like
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
pdm uh brick hazard mitigation grant
 
00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
program things you might have heard of
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
in the past right um that being said the
 
00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:11.839 align:start position:0%
way the language is currently written
 
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
where it says
 
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
shall apply to all available hazard
 
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
mitigation grant funding opportunities
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
there might be funding opportunities
 
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
that exist outside of what our agency
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
tracks and administers that we will not
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
be able to confirm
 
00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
and so i bring that up in part as well
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
knowing that there is a potential
 
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
penalty for not meeting that requirement
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
so what you're saying
 
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
is you would eliminate it to all
 
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
available and maybe progress shall apply
 
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.590 align:start position:0%
available and maybe progress shall apply
for

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
well that was my first question
 
00:12:02.959 --> 00:12:03.990 align:start position:0%
well that was my first question
do

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
i'm going to use the word we we want the
 
00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
word shall versus should
 
00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:11.590 align:start position:0%
word shall versus should
okay

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
yeah what line are we on
 
00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
line four line four so shall is a
 
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
mandate so
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
oh you know why i can't find this it's
 
00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:22.839 align:start position:0%
because i'm reading your amendment as
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
not like
 
00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.269 align:start position:0%
not like
[Laughter]

00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
so okay okay so where it says the
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
municipalities shall apply to all
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
available hazard mitigation grant
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%
funding available to reduce the impact
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
of a disaster reoccurrence so let's stop
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
there and just kind of dissect this
 
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
first sentence
 
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
our question was
 
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.470 align:start position:0%
our question was
shall

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
shall
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
the second part was
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
all available hazard mitigation grant
 
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
funding we only know what we
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
what we know
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
administer at hsem okay we don't know if
 
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
there are other programs in other places
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
so what we're saying in municipalities
 
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
shall apply for
 
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.629 align:start position:0%
shall apply for
all

00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
hazard mitigation grants
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
funding from fema
 
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:33.509 align:start position:0%
funding from fema
dance

00:13:33.509 --> 00:13:33.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
hazard mitigation grant funding
 
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.350 align:start position:0%
hazard mitigation grant funding
available

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
this this um this seems to be going off
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
on a different direction
 
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
almost a penalty for not doing it it is
 
00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
a penalty for not doing it tom that's
 
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
the point
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
well it's it's not it's i mean it's not
 
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
the intent of the build it's to
 
00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:55.829 align:start position:0%
the intent of the build it's to
but

00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
the set the intent of the bill is to is
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
to provide money to the communities
 
00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.389 align:start position:0%
to provide money to the communities
however

00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
if next
 
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.590 align:start position:0%
if next
year

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
they have another flood event
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
and they haven't
 
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
done anything to mitigate the flood
 
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
danger then they should not be able to
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
get the money
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
that's that's what what this mitigation
 
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
is all about
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
okay so why don't we just put put your
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
amendment on onto 409 and
 
00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:28.839 align:start position:0%
and cause i'm not sure i'm ready for
 
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
409. um both of these bills say
 
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
amendment to 409 by the way
 
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:34.790 align:start position:0%
amendment to 409 by the way
no

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
we're on 409. yeah
 
00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
yeah jennifer just just give us the
 
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
language you want us to use please
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:47.199 --> 00:14:48.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
we can give you some suggested language
 
00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
for that first sentence about that but i
 
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
guess we need to talk about the second
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
sentence where it talks about the
 
00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.110 align:start position:0%
sentence where it talks about the
penalty

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
penalty
 
00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.189 align:start position:0%
penalty
um

00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
do you want to take a stab at that
 
00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
please sure
 
00:15:05.199 --> 00:15:06.230 align:start position:0%
please sure
um

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
so i think um i know my primary question
 
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
was similar to um yours rep bucco did i
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
pronounce your last name correctly yes
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:17.350 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
stating you know what was the what was
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill um and so in
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
diving into that and also looking at
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
what this requirement might put in place
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
for municipalities is keeping in mind
 
00:15:28.959 --> 00:15:29.670 align:start position:0%
for municipalities is keeping in mind
that

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of
 
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
potential impacts of requiring something
 
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
like this from a community so when they
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
submit an application to fema for hazard
 
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
mitigation assistance programs they're
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
often required to
 
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
do a com you know a complete application
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
and this often requires engineering um
 
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
and additional i wrote some stuff down
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
additional studies um on the technical
 
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
feasibility of multiple different
 
00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.509 align:start position:0%
feasibility of multiple different
potential

00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
outcomes in different projects because
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
fema will often not just accept one idea
 
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
they want to see multiple in order to
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
choose the best one putting it in simple
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
terms so
 
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
there might be um a monetary
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
you know cost associated with a
 
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
community applying to hma and we wanted
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
to make you all aware of that as part of
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
this okay can i do that
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
yes you may is there a is there a
 
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
match for the mitigation funding also
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
there is a federal and non-federal share
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
it's typically a 75 federal 25
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
non-federal except now it's up to 90 10.
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
just for those two disasters from july
 
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
and august of 2021 that's correct i
 
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
thought mitigation funds were also
 
00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
92. that's correct for the hazard
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
mitigation uh grant program but not the
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
other programs right fema runs
 
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
hazard mitigation is at 90 10.
 
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
just for these two just for the july
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
disasters not all are disasters i
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
thought it was mitiga i'm talking about
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
mitigation correct okay it's 75 25
 
00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
except for these two disasters for
 
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
cheshire okay and if they apply for
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
mitigation funds than it will be at 90
 
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
so i think that this bill could
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
potentially impact all future funding
 
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
not just these two disasters that are
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
currently at a 90 10 cost share right so
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
in thinking long term okay yeah here's
 
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
my problem
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
okay i don't care how we word it
 
00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter to me i don't want to
 
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
mess somebody up
 
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.029 align:start position:0%
mess somebody up
but

00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
i want communities that have events
 
00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:33.039 align:start position:0%
disaster events
 
00:17:33.039 --> 00:17:34.390 align:start position:0%
disaster events
okay

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
if they are going to get money
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
either in a
 
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
no-cost loan
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
or if we support 402
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
that they have to do something to
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
mitigate the problem
 
00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.190 align:start position:0%
mitigate the problem
now

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
if you know
 
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
obviously if uh
 
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
if we have a snowstorm
 
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
you can get fema money for that but that
 
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
normally comes from the state
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
you know that's a
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
it's not an individual community
 
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
it's a right it's a statewide thing if
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
00:18:09.039 --> 00:18:10.549 align:start position:0%
you have a
huge

00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
huge
 
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
so fema reimburses for snow disasters i
 
00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:14.799 align:start position:0%
think you have to meet a certain
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
threshold of branches of snow and
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
provides money for that
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
i mean so you can't mitigate snow
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
you know so obviously to me
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
that doesn't fall into this category
 
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.590 align:start position:0%
that doesn't fall into this category
because

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
if it's something that you can't
 
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.230 align:start position:0%
if it's something that you can't
mitigate

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
mitigate
 
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.190 align:start position:0%
mitigate
then

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
you know you can't mitigate it but i i
 
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
just am
 
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
concerned that
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
i don't want
 
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
communities to think
 
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
that they can just
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
let things go
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
and come back five years from now
 
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.870 align:start position:0%
and come back five years from now
and

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
you know ask for the money again okay
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
so that would
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
be it would have to be some language to
 
00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.150 align:start position:0%
be it would have to be some language to
say

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to rebuild to
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's not rebuilt tom it's mitigate
 
00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:14.799 align:start position:0%
it's like
 
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
the reason that the flood occurred yeah
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
is because the river overflowed
 
00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
okay i mean right
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
so the culverts and the bridges were not
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
able to handle the amount of rain they
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
came down
 
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.750 align:start position:0%
came down
right

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.549 align:start position:0%
right
right

00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
the mitigation
 
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.510 align:start position:0%
the mitigation
maybe

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.470 align:start position:0%
maybe
because

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think fema will pay for
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
upgrading the uh
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
maybe they will upgrading the culverts
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
they will pay for it
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
that could be a mitigation but that but
 
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:50.799 align:start position:0%
that could be a mitigation project
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
to increase the size of the call for if
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
that's you know if that's what it takes
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
but fema doesn't on their disaster loans
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
only puts it back to what it was
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
um so there are without going into too
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
nitty gritty detail there are two ways
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
that you can get mitigation funding from
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
fema one is through the disaster process
 
00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
itself so fema public assistance
 
00:20:16.159 --> 00:20:17.270 align:start position:0%
itself so fema public assistance
projects

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
um some of them have two parts to bring
 
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
it back to pre-disaster condition but
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
then what would it cost to mitigate it
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
to make the facility better so that's
 
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
all wrapped into public assistance then
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
there's the hazard mitigation grant
 
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
program hmgp which is a separate
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
so if some so with back to 409 so is
 
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
i have two questions
 
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
so the intent of 409 is not just for
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
sullivan and cheshire county it's for
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
all disasters moving forward okay so i
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
just needed to make sure that we're on
 
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
the same page there well obviously you
 
00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919 align:start position:0%
are but we want to make sure we're well
 
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
this bill was not just for so okay so
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that we're she
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
and i are with you guys
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative sorry
 
00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.190 align:start position:0%
representative sorry
um

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
the next piece would be
 
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
i totally lost my train of thought i'm
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.190 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
i think that paragraph is actually very
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
close to what we want to me it would be
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
something like the municipality shall
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
apply for available hazard mitigation
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
grant funding
 
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
the rest of that sentence is good
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities that do not apply for
 
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
such funding shall be in it
 
00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.070 align:start position:0%
such funding shall be in it
ineligible

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
ineligible
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
and what it goes on to say i i think
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's exactly what we want
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
so i don't
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
both of these bills say and
 
00:21:57.669 --> 00:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
and the municipality has applied for
 
00:21:59.830 --> 00:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
emergency assistance they
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
they have to apply for it
 
00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.669 align:start position:0%
they have to apply for it
already

00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
so how about this
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
so how about this
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
the municipality
 
00:22:12.149 --> 00:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
should consider applying for available
 
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
hazard mitigation grant funding
 
00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.070 align:start position:0%
hazard mitigation grant funding
okay

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
the municipality shall consider
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
applying for available hazard mitigation
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
grant funding that would reduce the
 
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
impact of future disasters for
 
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
facilities that were repaired using
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
so if they get a
 
00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
no interest loan from the state
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
and they fix main street
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
they sh
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
shall consider applying for hazard
 
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
mitigation i don't think they should
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
consider it i think they need to
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
so the only thing there as vanessa was
 
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
saying there could be a cost to the
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
community to
 
00:22:59.669 --> 00:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
but there's a cost to the state if they
 
00:22:59.679 --> 00:23:00.789 align:start position:0%
but there's a cost to the state if they
don't

00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
somebody's got to do the engineering
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so there's engineering work and
 
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
then there's the
 
00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.870 align:start position:0%
then there's the
match

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
match
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
i got it and is the state going to go to
 
00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:15.919 align:start position:0%
402 is the state going to if 402 passes
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
pick up the
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
match i'll leave it at whether it's 25
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
or 10 because we don't know if we'll get
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
what match will get moving forward
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
is the state going to pick up the
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
mitigation match in addition to the
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry it's not easy it's not easy
 
00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
we're making it more complex than it
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
already was no
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
i think that yeah go go ahead
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um i think we all are kind of
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
in agreement about the first shall apply
 
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
to all available hazard mitigation
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
grants and i i would be comfortable
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
adding as administered by fema since
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
there are grants perhaps in italy that
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
we don't know about
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
i was wondering for the second sentence
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
i hear the concern you have
 
00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.390 align:start position:0%
i hear the concern you have
and

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
i don't know logistically if this would
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
become a nightmare but municipalities
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
that do not seek funding may not be
 
00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
eligible for future assistance loans
 
00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:17.919 align:start position:0%
because there may be a good reason that
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
they don't apply
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
so is it a possibility to say they may
 
00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:23.919 align:start position:0%
not be eligible and have that evaluated
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.549 align:start position:0%
at the time
given

00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
given
 
00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh which made it
 
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
oh okay so i i guess i'm a little bit
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
concerned about i mean if the
 
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
we're saying that
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
particularly particularly given the
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
circumstances that it may cost the
 
00:24:50.159 --> 00:24:51.750 align:start position:0%
circumstances that it may cost the
municipality

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:52.950 align:start position:0%
municipality
money

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
to make the application for the
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
mitigation grant so we're saying that
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
the municipality must choose to spend
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
the money
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
must choose to
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
expend money for that cost
 
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
as opposed to
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
you know suppose that suppose a minute
 
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
it's a poor municipality and they say
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
listen you know we have a we yeah we we
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
should do this but we also have a crime
 
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
problem and we need another police
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
officer so we decide it's more important
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
for us to get a police officer than
 
00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:24.799 align:start position:0%
that are they that ineligible because
 
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
they made that decision yeah i'm not
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
sure that that really is fair to do
 
00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
never mind fair
 
00:25:30.159 --> 00:25:31.029 align:start position:0%
never mind fair
well

00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:31.039 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:25:33.269 --> 00:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
well i i mean i guess i i sort of think
 
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
that doing doing what's fair is
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
generally a good idea
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
well it's the question that you have to
 
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
ask yourself in my opinion
 
00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:44.070 align:start position:0%
ask yourself in my opinion
is

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
if a community does nothing to solve
 
00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:47.860 align:start position:0%
their problem
 
00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.269 align:start position:0%
their problem
[Music]

00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
why should the state
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
solve their problem for them
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
okay you have to i agree you all we have
 
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
to make choices
 
00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
okay we have to make choices
 
00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
as a small community
 
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
or a large community i mean it doesn't
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
but you know um it doesn't say that you
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
have to apply for the
 
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
mitigation funds the day after the um
 
00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.669 align:start position:0%
mitigation funds the day after the um
event

00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
event
 
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.549 align:start position:0%
you know
so

00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
if i could ask um the director
 
00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.750 align:start position:0%
if i could ask um the director
um

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
when you're approving the initial
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
emergency funding
 
00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
what kind how much engineering do you
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
have to do
 
00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
how do you tell them what to what
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
what the hell what shape to put it back
 
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
into it's it's very project dependent a
 
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
simple example would be a culvert often
 
00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
requires something like a hydraulic
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
study to determine what size the new
 
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
culvert should be it could be something
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
like that so um so
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
that language could be incorporated with
 
00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
the approval of the the emergency
 
00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.230 align:start position:0%
the approval of the the emergency
funding

00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
to say here's a range of
 
00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:03.039 align:start position:0%
of the mitigation things that need to be
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
done and and at the top of the list
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
would be you know
 
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think i i
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think i mean that would be a way
 
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
for the for for that engineering to be
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
done without the town having to pay for
 
00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
it after the separately
 
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
to pay for it out of the female money
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
well the female okay
 
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
can i make a suggestion
 
00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559 align:start position:0%
let's let
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:41.919 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
okay i just wanted to point out
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
that probably
 
00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
one of the things that you might want to
 
00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.669 align:start position:0%
one of the things that you might want to
require

00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
is the town have a hazard mitigation
 
00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.909 align:start position:0%
is the town have a hazard mitigation
plan

00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
because not every town has one
 
00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:57.510 align:start position:0%
because not every town has one
and

00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
maybe what you want to be saying is that
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
they should have
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
a hazard mitigation plan
 
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
and that they should demonstrate how
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.789 align:start position:0%
 
or

00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:28:12.789 --> 00:28:12.799 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
but first you have to have a hazard
 
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
mitigation plan in hand
 
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
is required by by the state to have a
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
hazard mitigation pro plan sorry
 
00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
so they do so every town has a hazard
 
00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:33.039 align:start position:0%
mitigation plan that's approved by my
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
office as well as fema in boston
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
they have those plans because they
 
00:28:40.389 --> 00:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
cannot get disaster funds without that
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
plan in place right they cannot get
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
they cannot receive hazard mitigation
 
00:28:47.669 --> 00:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
funding without that so
 
00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
right technically
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
a community could opt out and not have
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
that plan but it would be at an extreme
 
00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:56.799 align:start position:0%
disadvantage and additionally this state
 
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
through fema fema provides funding for
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
these plans to be updated and we
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
coordinate that through our office
 
00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
and the plans additionally outline
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
mitigation strategies that each
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
community comes up with and basically
 
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
those are their
 
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
priorities for funding so that might
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
be an option because they're already
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
defining where they think their issues
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
are within the community that need to be
 
00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
addressed if funding becomes available
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
but we don't thank you judy but we don't
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
know if peop if the towns are doing
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.590 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
have a mitigation plan
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
if it's on the shelf and it's not making
 
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
any progress then it's going to be the
 
00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
same it's going to be on the shelf not
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
making any progress i think we should
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
consider the use of the word consider as
 
00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
you guys brought up and here's why the
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
municipality shall consider applying for
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
the available blah blah blah
 
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
because the second sentences say well
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
the first one says you must and then the
 
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
second one says if you don't so if you
 
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
put the shall consider it makes it
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
stronger but it still gives you the
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
option of not
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
but at your own peril if you don't apply
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
for it you're not getting any of this so
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:27.039 --> 00:30:27.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
the municipality shall consider applying
 
00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:36.559 align:start position:0%
for available hazard mitigation grant
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
funding administered by hsem
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
that would reduce the impact of future
 
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
disasters for facilities that were
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
repaired using exceptional disaster
 
00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
i like that better then what bothers me
 
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
is the shell
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
do not seek funding shall be ineligible
 
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
for future assistance because you know
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
it's just too
 
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
that it's too capricious it's too wonder
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
if if somebody who's making the judgment
 
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't know all the facts
 
00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.590 align:start position:0%
doesn't know all the facts
if

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
if someone can tell me why i why the
 
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
state should reward a community
 
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
for failure
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
to carry out their hazard mitigation
 
00:31:29.509 --> 00:31:29.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
what about if we said and this is uh
 
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
it seems to me this gives a little more
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
room the municipality should apply to
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
all to all
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
should apply for we've got the first
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph all done
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
the municipality should apply for all
 
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
available hazard mitigation grant
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
funding available to reduce the impact
 
00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:50.559 align:start position:0%
of a disaster reoccurrence
 
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
the governor and council and the fiscal
 
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
committee may consider whether a
 
00:31:57.669 --> 00:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
municipality has such such funding in
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
considering whether to grant a loan
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
under paragraph 2a in other words that
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
what that says is it's a factor the
 
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
governor and council can consider they
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
might say you know women you work this
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
municipality was just completely you
 
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
know irresponsible and that's and we're
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
not there they don't get another one but
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
in in circumstance a but maybe there's
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
another circumstance in which
 
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
the governor and council and the fiscal
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
committee say all right
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
you know this is not this is not uh the
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%
municipality didn't act irresponsibly in
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
these circumstances and therefore they
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
can get the loan i did you know was it
 
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
like it allows it to it's not a hard and
 
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
fast rule it's let the let the people at
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
the time make the decision as to whether
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
the municipality acted irresponsibly and
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
not in not getting the
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.430 align:start position:0%
the uh
the

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh the loan
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
not applying for the mitigation funding
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
and all the people in the town suffer
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
okay so lynn what did you say
 
00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:09.669 --> 00:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
i think whatever we do we just have to
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.389 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
the municipality shall consider applying
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
for available hazard mitigation grant
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
funding administered by hsem
 
00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
that would reduce the impact of future
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
disasters for facilities that were
 
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
repaired using exceptional disaster
 
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
relief loan funding that's perfect can
 
00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
you keep the second sentence just as it
 
00:33:43.039 --> 00:33:43.710 align:start position:0%
you keep the second sentence just as it
is

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:43.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities that do not apply for or
 
00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559 align:start position:0%
seek or whatever you want
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
funding shall be
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
guys i have two questions
 
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
um go ahead
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities that do not seek
 
00:34:10.399 --> 00:34:11.829 align:start position:0%
municipalities that do not seek
um

00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
what constitutes seeking i guess i would
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
have one question on that and they might
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
not get it you know they may try they
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is that because it
 
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
i can just imagine
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
i you know i i can't imagine some of the
 
00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:29.599 align:start position:0%
consequences that might come from it so
 
00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:31.839 align:start position:0%
i still would be more comfortable with
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
municipalities that do not see sex
 
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
funding may not be eligible
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
and have the opportunity for them to
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
explain why they didn't apropos
 
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
representative lynn if they needed to
 
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
hire a policeman which is probably
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
not going to happen
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
but just to give a little bit of space
 
00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
um for something that we can't
 
00:34:53.669 --> 00:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
anticipate here i certainly agree with
 
00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
the intent of this that they really
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
bloody well ought to be doing the best
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
mitigation they can
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
but there may be a situation where it's
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
not possible or you know something else
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
happens so i kind of like a little bit
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:35:09.599 --> 00:35:12.790 align:start position:0%
go ahead
so

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
we were just talking about the word seek
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
as well because you
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
we use the word shell in the first
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
sentence and then we use the word seek
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
in the second sentence
 
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:23.910 align:start position:0%
in the second sentence
um

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
but then there's
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
do you want to go sure just a fact to
 
00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
consider is that fema's mitigation
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
programs are fairly limited there's kind
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
of a short list of types of projects
 
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
that they will accept so using the
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
example we've been running with main
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
street for example they may use an
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
exceptional disaster relief loan to
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
repair that facility and then turn
 
00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
around and seek mitigation funding only
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
to find there are no viable options that
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
fema mitigation will fund just because
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
of the type of facility
 
00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
in which case they could submit an
 
00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
application and they know from the
 
00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
beginning that it will not be eligible
 
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
so historically and vanessa can add more
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
details but 60 thousand foot
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
historically we've worked with
 
00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
communities that have put in for
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
mitigation projects
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
that we try for a number of years
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
different ways to get them funding
 
00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.670 align:start position:0%
different ways to get them funding
and

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
has not allowed us to be successful many
 
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.190 align:start position:0%
has not allowed us to be successful many
times

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
so they go through lots of expense lots
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
of time actually a couple years with a
 
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
couple of towns
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
to come back to say yep sorry no there's
 
00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
it's not allowable but the way it's
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
worded it doesn't say
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
i shall apply and receive it just says
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
you shall apply so if they apply and
 
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
then they're not given that
 
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
money that second sentence becomes
 
00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.790 align:start position:0%
money that second sentence becomes
meaningless

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
meaningless
 
00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
the use of the word seek in the second
 
00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.710 align:start position:0%
the use of the word seek in the second
sentence

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
are we are we exchanging that
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
okay i was i was going to say seek does
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
provide flexibility to the community to
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
reach out to our agency and have a
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
conversation about the viability of a
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
project before spending money so they're
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
still exploring the opportunity without
 
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
potentially incurring the expense of
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
engineering costs etc we can give a
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
community a pretty good idea of how
 
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
viable a project might be before they
 
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
ever have to take money out of their
 
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
bank account to pay for it so i think
 
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
seek would provide that flexibility
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
potentially but the word apply
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
may not
 
00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:28.630 align:start position:0%
may not
right

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
good point
 
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
so can i just make one other this is
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
this is why i'm not sure i like these
 
00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.829 align:start position:0%
this is why i'm not sure i like these
things

00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
to the extent yes to the extent the
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
concern was you know if you like if you
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
leave this discretionary
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's going to become political i mean i
 
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
would remind you that in paragraph 2a
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
this is it's described the governor that
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
says the governor may with the approval
 
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
may approve this isn't the required
 
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
thing the governor the governor has
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
discretion and so does the fiscal
 
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
committee and the guy the council so
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
it's you know to the extent that makes
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:17.109 --> 00:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
can i just down a point so we hse so we
 
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
had to create a rule
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
when the exceptional disaster relief
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
loan bill was first introduced by
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
senator gaida after the flooding up in
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
grafton county
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
we had to create a rule about how the
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
exceptional disaster relief
 
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
fund is administered through my office
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
one page application
 
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
i'll throw myself under the bus
 
00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:44.829 align:start position:0%
i'll throw myself under the bus
we

00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079 align:start position:0%
could within the rule
 
00:38:48.079 --> 00:38:49.510 align:start position:0%
could within the rule
address

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:38:53.349 --> 00:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
the second piece of this within the rule
 
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
potentially potentially
 
00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.349 align:start position:0%
potentially potentially
um

00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:59.359 --> 00:39:01.510 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:08.230 align:start position:0%
yep
yep

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
so if this passes we have to go to jail
 
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
par anyways to change it to meet the
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
no interest and the governor declares a
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
state of emergency so we have to change
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
the ruling
 
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
likely that we'll have to change the
 
00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:28.230 align:start position:0%
likely that we'll have to change the
rule

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
no we're not
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
i say you go with your rewritten first
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
sentence and just leave the second
 
00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:44.079 align:start position:0%
sentence alone
 
00:39:44.079 --> 00:39:45.109 align:start position:0%
sentence alone
right

00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
that gives you your seek
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
still gets the it still mandates or
 
00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:51.670 align:start position:0%
still gets the it still mandates or
still

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:54.079 align:start position:0%
basically says what i think rip umberger
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
is getting at and that's what i would
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
agree on that if you're not making any
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
effort to mitigate you're not going to
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
get paid
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
funds in the future it says shall be out
 
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.069 align:start position:0%
funds in the future it says shall be out
ineligible

00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%
ineligible
 
00:40:06.079 --> 00:40:07.109 align:start position:0%
ineligible
right

00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
that's right and that's that's what it's
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
supposed to be
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
if they don't seek
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
available hazard mitigation they shall
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
not they shall be ineligible that's i
 
00:40:19.589 --> 00:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
think that's the whole intent
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
but can't you envision a situation where
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be their fault and you're
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
penalizing them beyond something that
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
they couldn't control and so i'm just
 
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
asking a little bit but what i don't
 
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
know about logistically who all's going
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
to make that decision but it seems
 
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
just prudent to have a little bit of
 
00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
wiggle room for what we cannot
 
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
anticipate here
 
00:40:43.349 --> 00:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean what so what are you gonna
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
what are you gonna do if they don't
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
do you gotta
 
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
if then if what are you gonna do if they
 
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
don't do that and they get wiped out
 
00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:52.870 align:start position:0%
don't do that and they get wiped out
again

00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
yeah oh well oh well
 
00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
i can't how long's all the well last and
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
the roads and you can't float down you
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
can't get any emergency vehicles or
 
00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't mean i'm not going to
 
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
support the second sentence here
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
i have to say i think i think it's too
 
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
harsh also so what do you want to put in
 
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
there you want me to use the term may
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
just be happy
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
well just just the first sentence that
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
says you shall um apply for the
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
hazard mitigation although
 
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
it sounds like they already are getting
 
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
advice on that
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
through fema
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
well they may or may not
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't know when the last time
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
this flood in
 
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
sullivan and cheshire county took place
 
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
do you know this july 2021
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
before that before that
 
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
it's as far as a declared disaster goes
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
it's been a while but there are many
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
instances of flooding that don't rise to
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
the level of a federal declaration it
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
but we don't know when those were
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
our office doesn't track that doesn't
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
track them
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
can can i
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
can i get
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
my hard-line friends like me to
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:19.349 align:start position:0%
 
six

00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
um funding may not be eligible or maybe
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
ineligible i like may not be eligible i
 
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
support the the the idea i think it's a
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
really good idea i think you ought to do
 
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
mitigation i'm just thinking god there
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
might be that situation where it doesn't
 
00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:33.990 align:start position:0%
might be that situation where it doesn't
work

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
but um that they may not be eligible for
 
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
future assistance and to me that kind of
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
gets their if i can say this but that's
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
their attention you guess their things
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
that's better than button gear yeah that
 
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
gets their attention and there are
 
00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
consequences and i think you know the
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
consequences are real they should be
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
there should be consequences i just like
 
00:42:52.309 --> 00:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
a little
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
teensy weensy little pillow and
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities do sometimes i mean they
 
00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
have contracts they have to pay
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes there are emergencies that
 
00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
come up that they better take care of
 
00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.750 align:start position:0%
come up that they better take care of
first

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
so we're going to say in the i mean if
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
this if
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
this i mean let me just say this okay
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
by the time they get their fema money
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
they get the work done
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
they get their
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:43:20.069 --> 00:43:20.079 align:start position:0%
fema doesn't
 
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
work very quickly
 
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
and it could be four or five years
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
i mean it's not like
 
00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
it's not like it's gonna happen tomorrow
 
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
but during that time
 
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
in my opinion
 
00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
they should be planning for how they're
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
going to mitigate this from happening
 
00:43:39.119 --> 00:43:47.190 align:start position:0%
going to mitigate this from happening
again

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
that's fine i don't care maybe not so if
 
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
you leave if so if you but if you leave
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
shell in the first sentence right that
 
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
says that's the command you shall do
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
this and all i think i think all all uh
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative murray is saying and i
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
agree with her on this is if you if you
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
change shell to may on line six then you
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
are giving you've told them you have to
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
do this but in the in the sort of
 
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
penalty provision you've said
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
and if you don't we may not give it to
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
you we're not saying for sure we won't
 
00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
but we may not
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
may may on the seconds
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
may not be um
 
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
may not be eligible i think is
 
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
clearer to understand if you put may
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
rather than shall who's going to make
 
00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
i guess that was my concern of logistics
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
here but in the rest of the the bill
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
you've got the governor and approved the
 
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
executive council and that seems to be
 
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
built into the
 
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
other part of the bill
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
yep because they may or may not get that
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
from the executive council
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
and the governor
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
right and they could contain and the
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
governor and council and the fiscal
 
00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
committee could all consider
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
so the fact that they haven't they
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
didn't do that yeah fiscal committee
 
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be in on that okay all
 
00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:07.510 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be in on that okay all
right

00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
and they can make a recommendation they
 
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation to the governor
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
and council
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
because i think there's got to be
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
somebody who knows really what they do
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
don't have my michael
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
somebody else has to approve it anyway
 
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
somebody's got to approve it
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
it's usually them isn't it
 
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
i mean the municipality applies for it
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
may can contribute something and then
 
00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
femur is going to be the final approval
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
but to that point it ought to be pretty
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
obvious whether or not they've done any
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
work you know i'm not sure it takes an
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
engineer to say that you know oh you've
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
just not done anything and we're not
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
going to give you more money you know
 
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
these are
 
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
this is bricks and mortar yeah it is
 
00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
and they've been working together okay
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.839 --> 00:46:15.670 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
so chris you have all this down
 
00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
so that you can uh
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
create a new amendment for us
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
so i'd like you to go through it one
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
more time so that we have all the
 
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
language correct because it's been
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
pretty much all over the map
 
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
so the first sentence if i could just
 
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
have somebody go through what's agreed
 
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
to with that
 
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
he may consider
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
shall consider jennifer will read that
 
00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:38.309 align:start position:0%
shall consider jennifer will read that
so

00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
what we had was the municipality shall
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
consider applying for available hazard
 
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
mitigation grant funding administered by
 
00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.950 align:start position:0%
mitigation grant funding administered by
hsem

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
hsem
 
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
that would reduce the impact of future
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
disasters for facilities that were
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
repaired using exceptional disaster
 
00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:00.210 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:01.430 align:start position:0%

00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
reduce the impact of future disasters
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
for facilities that were repaired
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
using exceptional disaster relief loan
 
00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:22.470 align:start position:0%
using exceptional disaster relief loan
funding

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
and then in the second sentence all you
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
were changing was funding may not be
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
eligible on line six so you are striking
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
yeah funding may not be eligible
 
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%
can i also
 
00:47:40.559 --> 00:47:50.309 align:start position:0%
can i also
seek

00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
i don't think it does to completely
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
defeat it what it's simply because it
 
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
says to whoever's going to make this
 
00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:30.079 align:start position:0%
decision the governor and council that
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
this is a factor if you haven't that you
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
know that they they could say they could
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
say in any particular case we're not
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
awarding this we're not going to award
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
this loan because you didn't
 
00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
you didn't do this and then you're back
 
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
to a political decision
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's two different activities it's
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
that makes sense to me because i mean if
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
those things if we're saying those
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
things are important
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
that people should be updating them
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
and this is going to be tied to
 
00:49:08.549 --> 00:49:08.559 align:start position:0%
something you need to turn on your mic i
 
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
know but
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise people can't hear you i just
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
feel if we're going to make this
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
high risk
 
00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:18.079 align:start position:0%
because if they're not applying it
 
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
becomes high risk
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
because they will not get money
 
00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
um by being able to demonstrate progress
 
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
they have made toward meeting the
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
goals or areas cited in their hazard
 
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
mitigation plan i mean that would be
 
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
whether they're showing progress or not
 
00:49:41.589 --> 00:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
i just i just hate to have a place
 
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
that's gone through a horrible disaster
 
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
to all of a sudden
 
00:49:49.109 --> 00:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
be told well sorry but you didn't apply
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
for these grants so you can't get any
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
money again i mean god forbid the same
 
00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
place should have the same kind of a
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
disaster three or four times
 
00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.510 align:start position:0%
disaster three or four times
and

00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:01.589 --> 00:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
that area that's what i'm trying to
 
00:50:01.599 --> 00:50:02.630 align:start position:0%
that area that's what i'm trying to
prevent

00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
okay because obviously
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
we haven't done a good job of that but
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
some some natural disasters aren't
 
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
always avoidable
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
and i mean some things you can't always
 
00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:19.270 align:start position:0%
and i mean some things you can't always
fix

00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
suggestion what about if you had just
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
one sentence that said something like
 
00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:24.829 align:start position:0%
one sentence that said something like
this

00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:50:24.839 --> 00:50:26.710 align:start position:0%
this
municipality

00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
that has
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
already received
 
00:50:29.839 --> 00:50:30.870 align:start position:0%
already received
a

00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:50:34.549 --> 00:50:34.559 align:start position:0%
a non-interest loan under subsection a
 
00:50:38.549 --> 00:50:38.559 align:start position:0%
shall not be eligible for another loan
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
for the same for a dessert for a
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
disaster in the same area unless it
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
demonstrates that it has made
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
substantial progress on a disaster
 
00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.349 align:start position:0%
substantial progress on a disaster
mitigation

00:50:49.349 --> 00:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
mitigation
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh program or however you want to seize
 
00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
it i mean is that that that doesn't set
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
says that they have to they have to have
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
made progress and that you know
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:03.119 --> 00:51:04.309 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
i think maybe we can do fewer words i
 
00:51:07.589 --> 00:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
can see where you're going
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities must demonstrate progress
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
on their mitigation plan or they will
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:20.110 align:start position:0%
that's fine with me
 
00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:21.990 align:start position:0%
that's fine with me
[Laughter]

00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
define progress or substantial progress
 
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
well again i guess um apropos we had
 
00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
said before um this is bricks and mortar
 
00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
it was the road under construction do
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
do they have a contract with the road
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
builder so i think
 
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
so that's not what mitigation is all
 
00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:41.990 align:start position:0%
so that's not what mitigation is all
about

00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's the actual disaster
 
00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
the mitigation is fixing the culvert on
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
the side road to divert the water from
 
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.790 align:start position:0%
the side road to divert the water from
downtown

00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
downtown
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
we're moving the road that was down at
 
00:51:58.870 --> 00:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
river level
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
well they may not be but
 
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
right but i mean the other thing i i
 
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
think representative uh uh is
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
correct on this i mean suppose suppose
 
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
that there are several problems in a
 
00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:25.990 align:start position:0%
that there are several problems in a
town

00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
and what they've done
 
00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
is after the first loan
 
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
they've developed a sort of you know
 
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
capital improvement program or whatever
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
you want to you ever want to call it to
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
deal with areas in the town where are
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
they are susceptible to flooding but the
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
ones that they decided to work on first
 
00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:43.270 align:start position:0%
ones that they decided to work on first
were

00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
something other than this particular
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
area i mean how would we then say well
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
because you chose to fix you know elm
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
street as a as opposed to main street
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be eligible for
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
another loan i i would tend to say
 
00:52:58.470 --> 00:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
maybe if there's some you know if that
 
00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
in a particular case was a really
 
00:53:02.549 --> 00:53:02.559 align:start position:0%
unreasonable decision but maybe it isn't
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
a unreasonable decision all right so if
 
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
i'm understanding this correctly
 
00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:13.359 --> 00:53:14.470 align:start position:0%
 
if

00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
kate could you repeat witches
 
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
or was it murray could you repeat right
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities must demonstrate progress
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
on their mitigation plan
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
in order to be eligible for
 
00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
future assistance or future loans under
 
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
whatever the rest of it
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities must be a must they must
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
demonstrate progress
 
00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
on their mitigation plan
 
00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:42.559 align:start position:0%
but there's some words missing there
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted to also provide a
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
little bit more context for the local
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
hazard mitigation plans so each plan is
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
required to
 
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
put into their local hazard mitigation
 
00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:53.190 align:start position:0%
put into their local hazard mitigation
plan

00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
mitigation strategies for high risk
 
00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
hazards that they identify so for
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
example majority if not all of our
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
communities identify flooding as a high
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
risk because it's statewide
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
there are typically 15 to 30 mitigation
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
strategies that any one community can
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
put into their plan there's no federal
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
requirement that they attack all of
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
these at any one given time is just
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a priority for funding
 
00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:18.559 align:start position:0%
opportunities so when you say make
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
progress on their hazard mitigation plan
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
i am confirming are you looking for them
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
to make progress on their identified
 
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
mitigation strategies within their plan
 
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
now i think we're looking for strategies
 
00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
on the ground actual projects that are
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
undergoing sorry let me clarify those 15
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
to 30 mitigation strategies typically
 
00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:37.270 align:start position:0%
to 30 mitigation strategies typically
include

00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
facilities on the ground as well but
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
they might also include planning efforts
 
00:54:44.309 --> 00:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
in addition to that but for example
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
it's likely that they're identifying
 
00:54:47.829 --> 00:54:47.839 align:start position:0%
facilities that are undersized like
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
culverts or bridges that are in
 
00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:50.829 align:start position:0%
culverts or bridges that are in
disrepair

00:54:50.829 --> 00:54:50.839 align:start position:0%
disrepair
 
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
etc i'm
 
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh i understand the planning is
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
important i think i'm leaning towards
 
00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
and i think we all some of us other here
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
are leaning towards actual work being
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
done beyond the planning
 
00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:10.309 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:13.829 --> 00:55:13.839 align:start position:0%
so municipalities must demonstrate
 
00:55:13.839 --> 00:55:15.030 align:start position:0%
so municipalities must demonstrate
implement

00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
implement
 
00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:17.030 align:start position:0%
implement
implementation

00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
implementation
 
00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
are we trying to make this apply though
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
to it the town's mitigation plan or
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
ruined in the previous
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh event such as in acworth i i think
 
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
that's the intent of this it's
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
we know this happened here what are you
 
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
doing to fix you're going to apply
 
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
to fix this
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
and if you don't it happens again
 
00:55:58.789 --> 00:55:58.799 align:start position:0%
because it talks about that area or that
 
00:55:58.799 --> 00:56:00.069 align:start position:0%
because it talks about that area or that
specific

00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
so one of the words that causes us just
 
00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
whatever is the word location because we
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
didn't know if that meant
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
i.e the town of vanessa
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
or main street in the town of vanessa
 
00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
is the locat when you say location do
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
you mean the entire community or do you
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
mean the facility our word facility that
 
00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
we use in that first sentence
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
means a road a bridge a culvert
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:42.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:42.950 align:start position:0%
okay
but

00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
i can agree
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
two municipalities
 
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
must demonstrate progress
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
on implementation
 
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
within that no it would be the facility
 
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
main street in vanessa town
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
not the mitigation plan because you all
 
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
said that's a town wide
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
on one thing right
 
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
could there be a situation though where
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
you know this bridge was washed away so
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
they've repaired the bridge with their
 
00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
emergency and
 
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
you know there's a wide range of
 
00:57:37.349 --> 00:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
mitigation possibilities and this bridge
 
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
is going to be okay for another seven
 
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
years but this one's gonna only last two
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
weeks if they're working on this bridge
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's gonna go down in two weeks i'd be
 
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
okay with that
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
with regards to this i wouldn't think
 
00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
let's you know not let's ignore this
 
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
bridge and get this one in order to get
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
this funds i just assumed they fixed the
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
other bridge too
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
so in that sense it wouldn't necessarily
 
00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:56.630 align:start position:0%
so in that sense it wouldn't necessarily
be

00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
i think the intent
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
is that you're making attempts
 
00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
that was caused in the last
 
00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:23.670 align:start position:0%
that was caused in the last
event

00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
event
 
00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
that's the way i understand it and
 
00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:26.309 align:start position:0%
that's the way i understand it and
that's

00:58:26.309 --> 00:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:58:28.789 --> 00:58:28.799 align:start position:0%
as an example like the example i gave is
 
00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
every 10 years the mississippi and the
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
missouri river flood
 
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
and the fema and the feds go in and give
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
people all kinds of money and ever
 
00:58:38.549 --> 00:58:38.559 align:start position:0%
another 10 years the exact same thing
 
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
happens over and over and over
 
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
this what we want to do is fix that
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
scenario so the culvert under the bridge
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
in acworth it was too small when you put
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
it back it needs to be bigger
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
i think that's what we're getting so
 
00:58:55.829 --> 00:58:55.839 align:start position:0%
that i think you're using the word
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
facility it's not the town's plan but
 
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
i think that's what you read the first
 
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
time so
 
00:59:14.069 --> 00:59:14.079 align:start position:0%
so if you say municipalities
 
00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
must demonstrate progress on the
 
00:59:16.079 --> 00:59:21.990 align:start position:0%
must demonstrate progress on the
implementation

00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities must demonstrate progress
 
00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
on the implementation of their hazard
 
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
mitigation plan
 
00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
in order to be eligible for future
 
00:59:32.319 --> 00:59:33.750 align:start position:0%
in order to be eligible for future
assistance

00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
under this section
 
00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
for disasters affecting facilities
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
i hope somebody got it because i was
 
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
you had the magic words and it wasn't
 
00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:52.390 align:start position:0%
you had the magic words and it wasn't
recorded

00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
recorded
 
00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
ah come on chris
 
00:59:58.230 --> 00:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
did you get them on the phone and ask
 
01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:06.630 align:start position:0%
did you get them on the phone and ask
them

01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:08.549 --> 01:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
how about this municipalities must
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
demonstrate progress
 
01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:12.839 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
implementation of their hazard
 
01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
in order to be
 
01:00:24.069 --> 01:00:24.079 align:start position:0%
eligible for future assistance and then
 
01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:25.270 align:start position:0%
eligible for future assistance and then
continue

01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
the rest of your
 
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.670 align:start position:0%
the rest of your
um

01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
amendment in the second sentence where
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
it says for future assistance blah blah
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
did we get that do you need me one more
 
01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities must demonstrate progress
 
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
on the implementation
 
01:00:50.549 --> 01:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
of their
 
01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
hazard mitigation plan
 
01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:54.839 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
be eligible
 
01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
for future assistance loans under this
 
01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
section for disasters affecting
 
01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.589 align:start position:0%
section for disasters affecting
facilities

01:01:05.589 --> 01:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
where an exceptional disaster relief
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
loan was previously granted
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:19.589 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
does somebody have that exact language
 
01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
uh so chris we'll have to um
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
why do we even need it
 
01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
why don't we um
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
why don't we combine these two
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
into one
 
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
burger into one amendment yeah yep
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.630 align:start position:0%
i mean
that

01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:04.150 align:start position:0%
that
okay

01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
and that will replace that replace all
 
01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
all of 402
 
01:02:09.039 --> 01:02:12.870 align:start position:0%
all of 402
no

01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
we're just
 
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll have an amendment yeah but
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
it's combining these two pieces of paper
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
into one
 
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
with the changes that we made that makes
 
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
okay so represent home burger is the
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
intention that the committee's gonna the
 
01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
division's gonna come back to look at
 
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
this amendment one more time before it
 
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
goes to the executive yeah we're gonna
 
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
have to okay
 
01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:41.910 align:start position:0%
have to okay
okay

01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:44.390 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.430 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:49.039 align:start position:0%
we're not going back to the other one
 
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
what do we need them both
 
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
well can we look at 402
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
but then 402
 
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.510 align:start position:0%
but then 402
um

01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
what it's doing relative to financial
 
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
assistance for municipalities affected
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
by the disaster and this is giving
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
authority to the governor isn't
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
this the same thing
 
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
oh that
 
01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:13.430 align:start position:0%
oh that
um

01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:14.230 align:start position:0%
um
yes

01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
mickey gave us this title one
 
01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
i feel like we're we're just kind of
 
01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
repeating ourselves
 
01:03:29.119 --> 01:03:31.670 align:start position:0%
repeating ourselves
yeah

01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:32.390 align:start position:0%
yeah
or

01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
creating another bill on top of what we
 
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
which is probably not necessary no
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
where do i have that i know i have it
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
i know i know
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
9 13 d
 
01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.990 align:start position:0%
9 13 d
yeah

01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
so upset umberger if i might um i think
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
the difference might be 402 requires
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
that doesn't require a civil emergency
 
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
be declared and that's the difference
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
between what mickey provided you
 
01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
um okay in the language
 
01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.150 align:start position:0%
um okay in the language
yeah

01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:04:13.029 --> 01:04:13.039 align:start position:0%
this gives the governor authority to
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
take necessary steps
 
01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
in the event that there hasn't been
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
an emergency declaration
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
and specific
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:30.549 --> 01:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
it's been a long time since i've been in
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
especially i don't think you've ever
 
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
been in two
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
i didn't think so
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
that's because we have so much fun that
 
01:04:43.599 --> 01:04:44.710 align:start position:0%
that's because we have so much fun that
uh

01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
okay i don't know that we need um they
 
01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
they are different the major difference
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
and i'm opposed to this one i i don't
 
01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
think we need it also but the main
 
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
difference is
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
this is a grant the other one's alone i
 
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
mean when you
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
get right down to it that's the major
 
01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
difference one's like one's a grant
 
01:05:15.270 --> 01:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
one's alone and i'm personally not in
 
01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
favor of a all-out grant
 
01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
i i wasn't so
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
40409 that we just did was a
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
non-interest loan
 
01:05:26.549 --> 01:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
this one here is just general funds that
 
01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
the governor can disperse
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
as it doesn't say anything about paying
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
it back
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
representative murray
 
01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
can someone i think i have this right
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
now but can i we just confirm this when
 
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
i read this
 
01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
um you know the governor with approval
 
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal no no may approve disbursements
 
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
of financial assistance to affected
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
communities when i was first reading
 
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
this my understanding was that it was
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
pertaining to the
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
amount that the state of the
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
municipality has to pay back to fema
 
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
that you know let's just say the 90
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
percent you know the 10 percent that has
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
to get paid back but the way this is
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
written and what i'm hearing now is that
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
the governor could potentially give you
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
know 300 million dollars to some little
 
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
town that had a disaster there's nothing
 
01:06:18.069 --> 01:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
here that focuses it on that 10 so am i
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
misreading this or did this get changed
 
01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
significantly and i'm uncomfortable with
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
if i'm if i might this is i think you're
 
01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
reading i think the way you're reading
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
it is exactly right i mean that could
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
happen that's not maybe what was
 
01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:32.799 align:start position:0%
intended but that's what the language
 
01:06:32.799 --> 01:06:35.829 align:start position:0%
intended but that's what the language
says

01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
this this language is from
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
an amendment by senator mawson in uh
 
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
march 29th
 
01:06:43.829 --> 01:06:43.839 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
brought it's just a just a wide open so
 
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead so
 
01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
that was one of the questions that so i
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
have a little list of things that
 
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
you know this is open-ended
 
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative it doesn't
 
01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
say july 2021 flooding
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
so i wasn't sure if the intent was to
 
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
have this bill in place for every
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
disaster moving forward
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't talk about the match
 
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:18.789 align:start position:0%
it doesn't talk about the match
which

01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
could be
 
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
25 or 10 percent
 
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
right this is the first time i've been
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
here for 30 years
 
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
and it's the first time that i've seen a
 
01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
10 match it's always been 25
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
and then there was the time that the
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
state picked up the
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
so it is a it is a grant but if you want
 
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
to put the word match in there
 
01:07:48.789 --> 01:07:48.799 align:start position:0%
use the word match but don't put a
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
percentage in case we get another 10
 
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
percent but we might not get
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:02.549 --> 01:08:02.559 align:start position:0%
but in senator khan's testimony he
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
talked about that
 
01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
so he inferred it but it's not written
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
in the text
 
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
so if it's not the text
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
the other thing this doesn't talk about
 
01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
mitigation efforts either when you give
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
a grant there's going to be less of a
 
01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
impetus for the community to
 
01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
work on their mitigation efforts on the
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
on the whatever the issue was if you're
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
just being granted the money
 
01:08:37.349 --> 01:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
with no
 
01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
no requirement to pay it back like a
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
loan would do
 
01:08:43.349 --> 01:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
the mitigation part may might not be so
 
01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
important to the time
 
01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.269 align:start position:0%
important to the time
so

01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
i could i just make a comment
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
certainly if we i it it seemed to me
 
01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
that that the main
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
purpose of of this whole area of having
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
some uh
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
state have some ability to provide funds
 
01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
was to be able if i understood
 
01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:08.070 align:start position:0%
was to be able if i understood
uh

01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
uh the representative aaron's 409 and if
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
even if 402 was limited and i think it
 
01:09:17.669 --> 01:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
would have to be because for the reasons
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
that representative murray stated but
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
even if it was limited to simply
 
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
you know what happens
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
to the can the state sort of forgive
 
01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:27.669 align:start position:0%
to the can the state sort of forgive
um

01:09:27.669 --> 01:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:27.679 --> 01:09:28.950 align:start position:0%
um
uh

01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
some of the money that
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
some of the uh
 
01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:33.590 align:start position:0%
some of the uh
the

01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
money that isn't the money for a
 
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
disbursement that's not that that's made
 
01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
under 409 that is not covered by the
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
federal reimbursement can the state
 
01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:45.590 align:start position:0%
federal reimbursement can the state
forgive

01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
forgive
 
01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
some part of that loan if even if 402
 
01:09:50.309 --> 01:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
was limited to that purpose that's not
 
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
something that's going to happen right
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
away it's going to you're talking about
 
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
something that happens way after the
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
fact a year or two later so
 
01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
i guess my suggestion is
 
01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
why don't we do this sort of
 
01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
incrementally 409 let's do 409 and sort
 
01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:07.189 align:start position:0%
incrementally 409 let's do 409 and sort
of

01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:10:10.149 --> 01:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
see how it you know how it how it works
 
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
for over a few years and then uh if
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
there if that turns out to be not
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
satisfactory and the legislature needs
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
to do something else we'll have some
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
experience with how 409 has worked and
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
now my understanding
 
01:10:31.199 --> 01:10:32.870 align:start position:0%
now my understanding
402

01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
402
 
01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
based on
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
the testimony
 
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
was that
 
01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
402 would come into play
 
01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.790 align:start position:0%
402 would come into play
when

01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
the fema has already identified
 
01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:46.790 align:start position:0%
the fema has already identified
eligibility

01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
um they've determined
 
01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
100 of the funds that would be eligible
 
01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
and 402 would be directed toward
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
that ten percent of the funds
 
01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:01.510 align:start position:0%
that ten percent of the funds
that

01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
they don't pay because it's 90 10 or 75
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
25 whatever
 
01:11:10.709 --> 01:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
and so if the state so chill chose
 
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
they could make
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
a grant
 
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
to a municipality
 
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
that's what we think the intent is
 
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
as well as you you
 
01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:39.590 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
projects on their own
 
01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:43.350 align:start position:0%
projects on their own
then

01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
this would help them do that
 
01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:47.990 align:start position:0%
this would help them do that
no

01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
that's not that's not what this says
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
what this says is
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
when it comes time to pay fema the 25
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
then you can request this grant
 
01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
you've already laid out all your money
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:06.790 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
you know i don't care what percent
 
01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:09.990 align:start position:0%
you know i don't care what percent
okay

01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
my clarification was just regarding the
 
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
fema process um
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
that you don't have to pay fema money
 
01:12:17.189 --> 01:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
for the 25
 
01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
the town
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
expenses the full 100 and fema just
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
reimburses whatever percentage is
 
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
applicable to that disaster right right
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
i uh yeah i'm sorry i got that i know i
 
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
know that so 402 is the after the fact
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
so fema's paid the
 
01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
90 or 75 whatever and then a community
 
01:12:40.229 --> 01:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
can ask
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.030 align:start position:0%
the state
for

01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
the state makes a determination whether
 
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
they want to
 
01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
provide a community that grant or not
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
oops the community's already paid the
 
01:12:58.719 --> 01:13:02.229 align:start position:0%
oops the community's already paid the
money

01:13:02.229 --> 01:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
they've done the work they've been
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursed 90
 
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
so we fixed a bridge we got paid 900
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
there's a hundred thousand dollars that
 
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
was the the
 
01:13:15.189 --> 01:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
piece that fema was not paying we want
 
01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
to come to the state and say hey but
 
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
they've already expensed it
 
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
correct what they're asking for they're
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
asking the state to give them a grant so
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
that they become whole reimburse some of
 
01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.229 align:start position:0%
that they become whole reimburse some of
it

01:13:26.229 --> 01:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
this is where i think the mitigation
 
01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:29.270 align:start position:0%
this is where i think the mitigation
goes

01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
goes
 
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
no no
 
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
you know i'm fine with them you know
 
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:13:40.630 --> 01:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
as the match this is just way open-ended
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
this is goes way beyond so i don't even
 
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
can't even i don't even know why this is
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
here um
 
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
i'm comfortable with the match and i'm
 
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
can go either way if it's a grant or if
 
01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
it's a loan but
 
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
i think especially when you're having
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
small communities that are suffering you
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
know quite a dreadful tragedy or a
 
01:14:02.950 --> 01:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
disaster that they can come to the state
 
01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
to ask for help um you know 50 you know
 
01:14:09.669 --> 01:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
to fill in that the 10 or 25 whatever it
 
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
is so i like that idea i don't like how
 
01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
this has been expanded to um to pretty
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
much everything it seems
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
just so can i ask can i just
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
raise a question by sort of an example
 
01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:23.830 align:start position:0%
raise a question by sort of an example
so

01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
let's if i'm understanding correctly
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
what what 402 is designed to to
 
01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
address is this situation let's say that
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
the that municipality suffers a disaster
 
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
and just you know making a number up it
 
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost a million dollars to
 
01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
refi to uh
 
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
to fix it so the municipality applies to
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
fema and they say yep you're you know
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry the municipality
 
01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
applies for a loan under 409
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
for a million dollars from the from the
 
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
state and in anticipation of getting
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
getting money from fema and the state
 
01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
gives the municipality a million dollars
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
now the municipality applies to fema
 
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
fema says yes you're qualified we're
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
going to give you let's assume it's a 90
 
01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
10 we're going to give you 900 000
 
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
so they have nine hundred thousand
 
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
dollars now the municipality uses that
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
nine hundred thousand dollars to repay
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
nine hundred thousand dollars of the
 
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
loan but they still owe another hundred
 
01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:19.990 align:start position:0%
loan but they still owe another hundred
thousand

01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
and if i understand what 402 is designed
 
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
to accomplish it's designed to say
 
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
that in effect
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
the govern the the feds i mean the the
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
state can forgive some or all of that
 
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
other hundred thousand is that basically
 
01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:35.830 align:start position:0%
other hundred thousand is that basically
what

01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
is happening
 
01:15:39.189 --> 01:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
by turning it in from old by turning it
 
01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
from a loan into a grant that's one such
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
scenario i guess in order for a
 
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
community to utilize 402 they don't
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
technically have to have a loan from the
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
state so they could have just expended
 
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
the amount out of pocket and then come
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
to the state and say we need assistance
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
so two different potential scenarios
 
01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
yes uh from someone we've not heard from
 
01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
not much
 
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
right uh is there anything in law right
 
01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
now that has a forgiveness feature like
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:21.669 --> 01:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
all step that was the 25 match that the
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
state picked up no that was wasn't that
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
90 was that the 90 10 no to the south
 
01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
this july this past july is the 9010.
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
is there anything in law that says that
 
01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:34.470 align:start position:0%
is there anything in law that says that
uh

01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
there's no law right now for anything
 
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
for matchmaking no no forgiveness in
 
01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
other words you you owe the 25
 
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
was the
 
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
match match only
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
that the state would pick up half of the
 
01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.510 align:start position:0%
that the state would pick up half of the
match

01:16:57.510 --> 01:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
match
 
01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:58.310 align:start position:0%
match
so

01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
when we first got it it was 25 so the
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
original bill was to be like
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
12 and a half percent this town would
 
01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
pay 12 and a half percent the state
 
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
would pay and it's morphed
 
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
also on these mitigation plans how
 
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
how well do these towns
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
follow through with their mitigation
 
01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:23.750 align:start position:0%
follow through with their mitigation
plans

01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
plans
 
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
it varies in in follow through you mean
 
01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
well they they do so i mean they make
 
01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
progress right they address some of the
 
01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
issues that the plan identified it
 
01:17:34.630 --> 01:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
varies and i think a lot of it has to do
 
01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
with how much funding the town actually
 
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
has to accomplish those goals because
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
some things might be simple like
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
you know a small culvert to a slightly
 
01:17:44.229 --> 01:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
larger culvert some issues might include
 
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
a large bridge
 
01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
it depends
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
what the town's need is and what their
 
01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
assets are to put towards that their
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
capital improvement projects
 
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:01.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:02.630 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
do we need to think about this or
 
01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
do we
 
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh because we're gonna have to come back
 
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
on the other one anyhow
 
01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
could we get a copy of the original bill
 
01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
before it was amended to be so
 
01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:17.270 align:start position:0%
before it was amended to be so
open-ended

01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
open-ended
 
01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:18.870 align:start position:0%
open-ended
yeah

01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
if you go to the legislative website and
 
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
go to the bill search
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
and you go to the doctor i don't why
 
01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
don't you just do that and have janet
 
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
bring it to us
 
01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:34.870 align:start position:0%
bring it to us
okay

01:18:34.870 --> 01:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
i've never been able to go backwards on
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
well we'll have janet run it
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
because i had to have a lesson in how to
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
it's listed it's listed as
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
introduced or amended so janet will
 
01:18:58.229 --> 01:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
janet will run that off for us
 
01:18:58.239 --> 01:18:59.510 align:start position:0%
janet will run that off for us
um

01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
so i guess that
 
01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:02.390 align:start position:0%
so i guess that
um

01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
what i would suggest is that we will um
 
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
um hearing on both bills
 
01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to re retest recess
 
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
oh recessions when do you have when do
 
01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:33.350 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
these bills have are um they have to be
 
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
done by the 28th
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to hold some sort of a
 
01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:46.790 align:start position:0%
executive session
um

01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
before then to clear up the ones that
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
that we can
 
01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:55.910 align:start position:0%
and um
then

01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:57.910 align:start position:0%
then
whatever

01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:19:59.910 --> 01:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
i guess we're these are the only two we
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:06.629 --> 01:20:06.639 align:start position:0%
yeah no i'm talking about that are due
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
the 28th
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
these are the only ones we have
 
01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:12.110 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:17.030 align:start position:0%
so um
[Music]

01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:20.470 align:start position:0%
 
next

01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
and reps of home burger i think it's 4
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
26 is your exact session
 
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
oh don't don't pay any attention to what
 
01:20:28.629 --> 01:20:28.639 align:start position:0%
that said okay i'll ignore that thank
 
01:20:28.639 --> 01:20:41.590 align:start position:0%
that said okay i'll ignore that thank
you

01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
yeah that's fine why don't you come up
 
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:47.990 align:start position:0%
and uh
then

01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
well good afternoon and thank you for
 
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
inviting me by the way you don't have to
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
sit back there so shy
 
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
no not in not in division two well thank
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
you very much okay i appreciate that but
 
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
i wasn't going to make any comments as
 
01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
we had supported both pieces of
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
legislation they seem to be companion
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation however both doing
 
01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
something very different one providing
 
01:21:24.149 --> 01:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
the grant type funds and one of course
 
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
ensuring that
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
communities can apply for the loan
 
01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:30.070 align:start position:0%
communities can apply for the loan
situation

01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
we are not fema experts
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
we certainly leave that to fema to come
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
into our communities we know that towns
 
01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
develop hazardous mitigation plans
 
01:21:40.239 --> 01:21:41.189 align:start position:0%
develop hazardous mitigation plans
however

01:21:41.189 --> 01:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
in many cases
 
01:21:44.629 --> 01:21:44.639 align:start position:0%
it's the unforeseen especially that
 
01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
first time around that unforeseen
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
situation that tends to occur
 
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
it's somewhat like the pandemic we all
 
01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
planned and had those plans and um they
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
didn't work
 
01:21:55.199 --> 01:21:56.229 align:start position:0%
didn't work
and

01:21:56.229 --> 01:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
i think the language you're proposing
 
01:21:59.830 --> 01:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
seems reasonable
 
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
as long as it
 
01:22:04.149 --> 01:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
still allows a municipality some grace
 
01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
should there be some extenuating
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
circumstance that is unforeseen and that
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
we couldn't consider
 
01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
on sb 409 and of course we support sb
 
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
402 so we would not like to see that
 
01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:17.750 align:start position:0%
402 so we would not like to see that
bill

01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:20.070 align:start position:0%
bill
bitl

01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
bitl
 
01:22:22.149 --> 01:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
because there could be a situation in
 
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:35.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
don't don't move this could be to the
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
committee as well but could we put some
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:55.990 --> 01:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
the size of the community you know you
 
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
have a little town yeah but
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
little towns don't i mean in this
 
01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
particular case it doesn't matter it's a
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
disaster that makes a difference
 
01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:08.149 align:start position:0%
disaster that makes a difference
so

01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
well wasn't it that it was going to be
 
01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
hard to predict what a disaster costs
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
i guess the percentage is the best we
 
01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
came because if you're looking for
 
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
to try to make it equitable for a larger
 
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
community as opposed to a smaller
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
community i mean the larger communities
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
are going to have greater resources they
 
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
have a tax base that's larger than a
 
01:23:34.229 --> 01:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
town of 900. um
 
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
i guess i would like just to see it go
 
01:23:38.229 --> 01:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
back to the match and not be
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:48.870 --> 01:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
i i tend to agree but in a city like
 
01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:49.750 align:start position:0%
i i tend to agree but in a city like
mine

01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
mine
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
um and i use my tornado
 
01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
some horrible event that wipes out half
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
our city
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
um or even a portion of our city i mean
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
that would be millions and millions of
 
01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:02.470 align:start position:0%
that would be millions and millions of
dollars

01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:04.070 align:start position:0%
dollars
to

01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
to address
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
and would
 
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
we have reserves but we don't have those
 
01:24:27.189 --> 01:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:24:30.149 --> 01:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
i think we're getting distracted here by
 
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
by including the grants and the and the
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
percentages and all that i don't think
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
there's any of that in here i think this
 
01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
this language just gives the governor
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
authority to act right away
 
01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
right well it's open-ended i mean it's
 
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
but that's what it's that's what it is
 
01:24:46.629 --> 01:24:46.639 align:start position:0%
that was one of the things that why we
 
01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
got to this version of 402 was because
 
01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
in the original version
 
01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
somebody asked
 
01:24:57.430 --> 01:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
well how much do we budget and i was
 
01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
somebody this morning how we're you know
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
working on the 24-25 budget how much do
 
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
you put it into budgets and i said i
 
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
can't project that because i don't know
 
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
what the disaster and costs are going to
 
01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:15.189 align:start position:0%
what the disaster and costs are going to
be

01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i i understand that and i'm saying
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
and even in even in the hearing senator
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
morsi ex
 
01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
asked how much
 
01:25:24.229 --> 01:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
how much
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
is the total
 
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
and he was looking for
 
01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
total money but this is his amendment
 
01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
and he meant he amended the whole bill
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
to just say well just give the governor
 
01:25:36.629 --> 01:25:36.639 align:start position:0%
the authority to act quickly
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
and then the funds have to be available
 
01:25:41.189 --> 01:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
to do so well well if you appropriate
 
01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
them in the budget they're there i mean
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
it's just going to draw no no but not
 
01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
now but that's the amount to put in i
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
mean what do you put in you don't put it
 
01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
in the budget or it could be surplus i
 
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
mean a trust
 
01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:56.790 align:start position:0%
mean a trust
nope

01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
because that was tried this morning
 
01:26:00.149 --> 01:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
right there's nothing in here that says
 
01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
the state pays anything
 
01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
you know there's the option of helping
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
out the communities or at least going
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
back to the match of saying well you
 
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
know the state will put in 5 000 and
 
01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:10.639 align:start position:0%
we'll cover your 5 000 too but there's
 
01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
really nothing here that requires the
 
01:26:15.910 --> 01:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
state to actually do anything
 
01:26:18.390 --> 01:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
so i guess i i i have a question and i'm
 
01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
not sure that i still understand this
 
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
and maybe the people from from
 
01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
you maybe you can explain it to us to me
 
01:26:29.110 --> 01:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
supposed under the under 402 is it's
 
01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
worded right now
 
01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
if there was a disaster
 
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
and they and you know you
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
it was it was declared by the governor
 
01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
or the or for the president declared
 
01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:41.830 align:start position:0%
or the or for the president declared
whatever

01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:26:44.629 --> 01:26:44.639 align:start position:0%
if if the governor decided with the all
 
01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
the appropriate approvals to make a
 
01:26:47.199 --> 01:26:48.709 align:start position:0%
the appropriate approvals to make a
grant

01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
grant
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
right at the beginning to a municipality
 
01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
to pay some or all of the expenses of
 
01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
the disaster
 
01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:55.669 align:start position:0%
the disaster
would

01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
if i'm understanding correctly then you
 
01:26:59.590 --> 01:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong fema would say
 
01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
well wait a minute you've gotten this
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
money whatever it is five you've gotten
 
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand dollars as a grant
 
01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
from the state
 
01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:07.350 align:start position:0%
from the state
so

01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
that five hundred thousand dollars is
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
now is you've got another source for
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
that it's no longer eligible is that
 
01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:16.470 align:start position:0%
that it's no longer eligible is that
right

01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:17.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:27:17.350 --> 01:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
that was part of the discussion in the
 
01:27:21.189 --> 01:27:21.199 align:start position:0%
session this morning actually um
 
01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
regarding potential duplication of
 
01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
benefits and so i think that one of the
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
recommendations that came out of that
 
01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
meeting was
 
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
putting something in here with language
 
01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
specifying that this money would only be
 
01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
used for
 
01:27:35.590 --> 01:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
non-federal match which is not
 
01:27:37.510 --> 01:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursable by the federal government
 
01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:38.390 align:start position:0%
reimbursable by the federal government
um

01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
and then potentially things that are not
 
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
eligible under fema's public assistance
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
program are eligible for federal funding
 
01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
in general so because this bill changed
 
01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
from the original
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
one that was introduced to the amended
 
01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:52.629 align:start position:0%
one that was introduced to the amended
one

01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
the types of things that could be funded
 
01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
also changed originally it was just the
 
01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
match for these two disasters and then
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
it looks like it has changed to
 
01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
potentially include match for any
 
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
disasters moving forward or in the past
 
01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
and also things that are not fema
 
01:28:09.669 --> 01:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
eligible so the option is i guess to
 
01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
determine what is the goal of the bill
 
01:28:14.709 --> 01:28:14.719 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:28:17.110 --> 01:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
from there shift the language to achieve
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
that goal
 
01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
right so in other words
 
01:28:21.669 --> 01:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
i this really
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
sort of goes along with what
 
01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative murray was saying earlier
 
01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:25.830 align:start position:0%
representative murray was saying earlier
we

01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
we can't pass this bill
 
01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
just the way it is because it's not
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
limited to either a match or
 
01:28:31.679 --> 01:28:33.910 align:start position:0%
limited to either a match or
non-eligible

01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
non-eligible
 
01:28:36.149 --> 01:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
it's for anything so
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
we need i mean unless if we don't do if
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
we didn't make those kind of changes
 
01:28:43.110 --> 01:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
we would there would be
 
01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
we would there would be running a risk
 
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
that by having this law there's some
 
01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:48.470 align:start position:0%
that by having this law there's some
the

01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
fema would say it's not
 
01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
the money is not of the the money
 
01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
it's duplication of you have sort of
 
01:28:57.510 --> 01:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
money from another source
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
correct there could be a potential
 
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
duplication of benefits however if it
 
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
were structured to include language such
 
01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:04.470 align:start position:0%
were structured to include language such
as

01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:29:06.149 --> 01:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
this funding may only be used for
 
01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
non-federal match for disasters then we
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
if representative murray thank you if i
 
01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
may representative walt's passed me
 
01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
language in this
 
01:29:23.189 --> 01:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
to add to the end of line eight i'm just
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%

the general court and executive council
 
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
may approve disbursements of financial
 
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
assistance to affected municipalities to
 
01:29:34.709 --> 01:29:34.719 align:start position:0%

well

01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.990 align:start position:0%
all right
um

01:30:31.990 --> 01:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
give that to chris for
 
01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:41.669 align:start position:0%
an amendment
um

01:30:41.669 --> 01:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
i'm still not sure that
 
01:30:47.189 --> 01:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
i like this bill at all
 
01:30:49.590 --> 01:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
um but um
 
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to we're gonna have to
 
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
get together anyhow can't we just make
 
01:30:56.709 --> 01:30:56.719 align:start position:0%
one bill and and i mean this does have
 
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
potential i think the the uh possibility
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
let me just say i don't want to end one
 
01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
bill because i can support the other but
 
01:31:06.149 --> 01:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
not this
 
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
okay that way
 
01:31:09.669 --> 01:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
i don't want to be in a situation where
 
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
i can't support
 
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:16.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:17.830 align:start position:0%
so
okay

01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:31:20.310 --> 01:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
so you'll give that to chris
 
01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
we'll get an amendment
 
01:31:22.639 --> 01:31:28.629 align:start position:0%
we'll get an amendment
um

01:31:28.629 --> 01:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:28.639 --> 01:31:31.830 align:start position:0%

01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:07.189 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%

01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
i think you saw the problem that we had
 
01:32:58.159 --> 01:32:59.669 align:start position:0%
i think you saw the problem that we had
originally

01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
originally
 
01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
which is get money to the towns to fix
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
the problem
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
yeah alone and that's it that's what
 
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
i mean well this other bill is
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
grant it's a grant
 
01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:15.990 align:start position:0%
grant it's a grant

and and grants are
 
01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
money because you got to take money from
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:28.629 --> 01:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
the treasury yeah the treasury it comes
 
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
federal funds no
