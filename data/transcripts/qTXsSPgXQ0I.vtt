education um and we only have five bills

today uh so it's a light day for
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
us um and uh the first bill we will take
 
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
up is Senate Bill 217 establishing a
 
00:17:06.669 --> 00:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
rural and underserved Area Educator and
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
sentive program for higher education and
 
00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
making an appropriation therefore and uh
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
Senator uh Donovan is all ready to go
 
00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
ready to go well good morning everyone
 
00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:19.959 align:start position:0%
uh good morning Mr chair and members of
 
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record I am
 
00:17:23.789 --> 00:17:23.799 align:start position:0%
Senator Donovan Fenton I represent
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
district 10 and I am here to introduce
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 217 which establishes a
 
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:31.160 align:start position:0%
Rural and underserved Area Educator
 
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:32.799 align:start position:0%
incentive program for higher education
 
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
and making an appropriation therefore
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
currently there are around 104 rural
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
school districts in New Hampshire with
 
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
many rural schools finding it hard to
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
attract and retain teachers Senate Bill
 
00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
2117 aims to address this issue by
 
00:17:48.029 --> 00:17:48.039 align:start position:0%
establishing an incentive program for
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
educators to teach in Rural and
 
00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:51.559 align:start position:0%
underserved areas similar to a program
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
for healthcare workers uh to work in the
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
same areas this idea originated from the
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
commission to study the teacher shortage
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
uh which I was on and we can all agree
 
00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
we have a problem and that is we need
 
00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
more teachers this program is very
 
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
similar to what was passed in Idaho um
 
00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
where they are also feeling the teacher
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
shortage and Nationwide for that matter
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
the incentive would include repayment of
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
all or part of the Educators outstanding
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
educational loans if they stay employed
 
00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
with the same school or School District
 
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:21.039 align:start position:0%
uh this could not only help fill the
 
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
much needed positions in these Rural and
 
00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:24.200 align:start position:0%
underserved areas but also help our
 
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
state mitigate the current teacher
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
shortage we are experiencing we all have
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
an obligation to ensure that any child
 
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
no matter the school district they
 
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
attend receives an adequate and
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
fulfilling education and Senate Bill 2
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
217 takes the necessary steps to provide
 
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
the school districts who need the help
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
the most with a tool to attract and
 
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
retain teachers I hope you will join me
 
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
in finding new ways to provide the
 
00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:47.559 align:start position:0%
youngest granted sers with the structure
 
00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:49.400 align:start position:0%
and stability we all know they need by
 
00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:53.480 align:start position:0%
supporting 217 and we studied this for a
 
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
long time over this summer with the
 
00:18:56.149 --> 00:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
teacher shortage commission and one of
 
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
the main things that came up when we
 
00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
heard from educators uh superintendence
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
was uh loan repayment and you know the
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
Richer the the better off school
 
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
districts can afford to do this the
 
00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
whole problem is that these underserved
 
00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:10.919 align:start position:0%
and Rural school districts can't afford
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
to do this and the state needs to help
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
them and I'm with that I'm happy to take
 
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you Senator uh
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
questions from committee
 
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
members yes representative Belcher thank
 
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you uh Mr senator
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
for being here I I just can you talk a
 
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
little bit to um is there any sort of of
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
block that would prevent us from going
 
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
and actually just putting money directly
 
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
in the teachers paycheck or or some sort
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
of a bonus instead of going going to the
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
loan repayment that way they could use
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
it for housing if they need to buy a
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
house or anything like that or is there
 
00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
anything preventing that no
 
00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for the
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
question it's a great question I think
 
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
um the problem is it comes down to uh
 
00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:53.559 align:start position:0%
the school boards how they pay their
 
00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
teachers and local control on how they
 
00:19:57.549 --> 00:19:57.559 align:start position:0%
pay their teachers and housing was
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
another issue that came up for the
 
00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
teacher shortage commission we we're
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
looking at that as well um you
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
know paying is a sort of incentive your
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
paycheck is an incentive and this would
 
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
y yes representative
 
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question being here um was
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
there any thought given to a teacher who
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
let's say was working in an underserved
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
District or school and they get Rift so
 
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
they have to go to another District so
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
they go to another underserved school
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
not through no fault of their own they
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
could be a great teacher with any
 
00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
thought so according to this they would
 
00:20:40.669 --> 00:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
not be eligible in year two correct you
 
00:20:42.549 --> 00:20:42.559 align:start position:0%
know I don't know that answer if they
 
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
would be eligible or not I think they
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
could reapply for the program um and you
 
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
might want to ask that question for
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
someone behind me as well um but I don't
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
see why they wouldn't still be uh be
 
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
able to apply for the program and and
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
just for the record folks um this has a
 
00:21:03.789 --> 00:21:03.799 align:start position:0%
whopping $1 in it right now so um you
 
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:06.200 align:start position:0%
know the whole purpose of this is we
 
00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
have the mechanism to fund this uh in
 
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
the coming budget we've created the
 
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
avenue to do that this is really the the
 
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
car to get us to the gas station have a
 
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
followup just so if they reapplied would
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
they be back at step one no they
 
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they wouldn't receive more than
 
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
their than they necessarily could they
 
00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:25.559 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be eligible for to double their
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
loan repayment if that's what you're
 
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
asking no I'm just thinking if they're
 
00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:32.039 align:start position:0%
sorry followup so if they're at step one
 
00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
the first year and then they reapply
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
because they've gone to another school
 
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
are they at b or they at a this lines 24
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
and 25 you know when we're talking about
 
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
first year second year would that be
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
their second year even though they've
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
reapplied if if they if they completed a
 
00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:50.919 align:start position:0%
full year they'd be their second year
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
okay even if it's a different school yes
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
questions uh see none thank you very
 
00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
much thank you all so much appreciate
 
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
it s around for a little bit
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:53.710 align:start position:0%
 
lad

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
good morning representative cordelli and
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
members of the education committee for
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Rick glad I come
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
from havil and I'm here today to speak
 
00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.750 align:start position:0%
from havil and I'm here today to speak
to

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:07.480 align:start position:0%
217 Senate Bill 217 in support of this
 
00:23:10.269 --> 00:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
bill uh I was one of the members of the
 
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
teacher shortage committee along with
 
00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
some others which are sitting on the
 
00:23:16.909 --> 00:23:16.919 align:start position:0%
committee right now and those behind me
 
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:19.799 align:start position:0%
and we put a lot of time into this and
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
we do know it's been documented there is
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
a teacher shortage throughout this
 
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
country there is a teacher shortage in a
 
00:23:31.149 --> 00:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
lot of those areas like math the science
 
00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
and special education in this state and
 
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
there are shortages of elementary
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
teachers in this state in those areas
 
00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
you can't attract them for various
 
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
reasons and I'll get into that a a
 
00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:46.039 align:start position:0%
little bit later here in my presentation
 
00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
I've handed out to you a article which I
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
extracted took out of the Wall Street
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
Journal dated March 5
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
2024 so this is just within several
 
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
weeks and speaks to school struggle with
 
00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.549 align:start position:0%
weeks and speaks to school struggle with
teacher

00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:01.559 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
turnover and as you read that they're
 
00:24:05.789 --> 00:24:05.799 align:start position:0%
looking at 10 different states not New
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but they're looking at 10
 
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
other states which kind of you know
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
typify what we're talking about here and
 
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
one of the Prime reasons why people
 
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
leave districts is the
 
00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:19.480 align:start position:0%
salary and the debt that they're
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
carrying and so I'd like to address that
 
00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
because we do have a nationwide issue
 
00:24:27.389 --> 00:24:27.399 align:start position:0%
here and we're seeing a decline in
 
00:24:29.549 --> 00:24:29.559 align:start position:0%
graduates that are coming out at teacher
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
prep programs throughout this this
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
country and with that we're seeing the
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh number of programs which are teacher
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
prep programs at higher education
 
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
shrinking schools are divesting their
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
their dollars their funding and they're
 
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
putting it into other programs which
 
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
they see there's a high demand for there
 
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
is a high demand out in the schools for
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
teachers however there's not a high
 
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
demand from those choosing to pursue a
 
00:25:03.149 --> 00:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree in college is simply
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
because when you come out like my
 
00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
daughter and my son and their sons and
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
daughters now are coming out and saying
 
00:25:14.269 --> 00:25:14.279 align:start position:0%
I don't want to get into teaching I'd be
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
a wonderful teacher but I can't sustain
 
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
a young family with what I'm getting
 
00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
paid and that's a fact when you're
 
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
coming out and you're getting paid
 
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 32 to $45,000 as a
 
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
first year teacher in the state
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
you can't sustain and we've heard the
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
issue of Workforce housing already
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
that's one issue but then we're also
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
dealing with the cost of just a young
 
00:25:39.269 --> 00:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
family and and and the mortgage on the
 
00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:41.240 align:start position:0%
house and the cost of the car and the
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
cost of the food and medical it it just
 
00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
compounds to the point where people are
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
saying no I'm going to find a job which
 
00:25:50.909 --> 00:25:50.919 align:start position:0%
pays for what I'm able to
 
00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:54.440 align:start position:0%
offer so we see that we also see a
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
number of challenges that we've had to
 
00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
address in dealing with this teacher
 
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
shortage and over the last four years
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
ago there were 400 Educators in
 
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
alternative Pathways to trying to get
 
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:09.640 align:start position:0%
certification we now have
 
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
1,200 in just four years that's tripled
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
and why is that because of some of this
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
debt the cost of going to school Etc um
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
we've also looked at last several weeks
 
00:26:23.789 --> 00:26:23.799 align:start position:0%
ago a parttime teacher bill for those
 
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:25.720 align:start position:0%
teacher shortage areas this was a
 
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
recommendation that came out of the the
 
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
study group which we had which dealt
 
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
with this for the last summer and prior
 
00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
to that in in the
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
spring and there were a number of
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
recommendations that came out we also
 
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
looked at this issue of what's going on
 
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
in our rural school districts in this
 
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
state what's going on on in these
 
00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:49.159 align:start position:0%
districts were not not rural but they're
 
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
you know really hurting in terms of the
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
dollar availability and and that speaks
 
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
to it right here when we're talking
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
about those underserved areas which
 
00:26:59.310 --> 00:26:59.320 align:start position:0%
might be a
 
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester and how do we attract people
 
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
to these districts and the way we're
 
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
going to try to look at it and what I'm
 
00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
looking at it as we we looked at the
 
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
state of Idaho and this is just a
 
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
duplicate of what Idaho is doing so this
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
is not a political bill this is a bill
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
which deals with a real issue which we
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
have in my school district we have
 
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
wonderful teachers that
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
come and several years later because of
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
their debt that they're carrying and you
 
00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
got to know that University of New
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire debt is one of the highest
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
debts in this in this country but we'
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
glorify it by saying well our students
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
pay it back yeah and and they sacrificed
 
00:27:42.029 --> 00:27:42.039 align:start position:0%
an awful lot in doing that but when we
 
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
have a good teacher arrive up in havil
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
you can bet two years from now if
 
00:27:48.509 --> 00:27:48.519 align:start position:0%
they're great in the area of art or
 
00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:49.720 align:start position:0%
special education they're going to be
 
00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
teaching down in Hanover or Lebanon or
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to go farther south where
 
00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
they're going to get the income that
 
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
they need to survive with and so and
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
where they're appreciated they're
 
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
appreciated in havil but you know the it
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't reflect that in what we're
 
00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.669 align:start position:0%
doesn't reflect that in what we're
paying

00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
paying
 
00:28:09.389 --> 00:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
them so um there were several questions
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
which came up in this uh there was the
 
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
issue of uh should we rather than
 
00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
putting the money as we have on page two
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
there where it's incrementally handed
 
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
out over four years should it be our all
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
awarded at one time part of the purpose
 
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:26.200 align:start position:0%
I see it from the rural districts we
 
00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
want to retain people in the rural
 
00:28:30.269 --> 00:28:30.279 align:start position:0%
districts we don't want to see them
 
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:31.799 align:start position:0%
getting in their cars and driving out a
 
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
Dodge and getting the job 30 mil South
 
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
we want to see them stay in these
 
00:28:39.789 --> 00:28:39.799 align:start position:0%
districts there is a parallel between
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
those school districts which have uh a
 
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
loss of teachers and and it's more
 
00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
frequent we're also seeing achievement
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
related to that you don't have the
 
00:28:51.549 --> 00:28:51.559 align:start position:0%
sustainability the constant factor of
 
00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
the teacher in the classroom you see
 
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
movement and where there's a lot of stop
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
and go stop and go in terms of you know
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
delivery of services the other issue is
 
00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
what happens if they decide not to stay
 
00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
in that school well if they're in a
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
school district like a Manchester they
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
get rifted they can this will follow
 
00:29:12.029 --> 00:29:12.039 align:start position:0%
them any school in that school district
 
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
so you're going to this program follows
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
you in that
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
regard so um I I think this is a a
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
program which is absolutely needed in
 
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
this state and it's but in talking this
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
morning with director applebe over at
 
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
doe driving down the highway on
 
00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
93 he said he absolutely supports this
 
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:37.720 align:start position:0%
program but in order to implement it
 
00:29:39.909 --> 00:29:39.919 align:start position:0%
from his perspective you know yeah
 
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
there's $1 doll in this bill but he's
 
00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:44.799 align:start position:0%
going to need as we heard just the other
 
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
day when we had uh Miss Davis in here uh
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
testifying on the bill dealing with
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
accountability we had put in legislation
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
from the policy perspective an analyst
 
00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
to assist in getting that job done that
 
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
was struck it's no longer there Steve
 
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
applebe needs that help um several of us
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
in this room right now are working in
 
00:30:06.789 --> 00:30:06.799 align:start position:0%
the education task force for higher
 
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
education the executive order of the
 
00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
governor and and do and and Steve
 
00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
applebe is the chair of that particular
 
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
commission which involves a a number of
 
00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:19.240 align:start position:0%
people and I think we're coming out with
 
00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
a fine report which we'll know more
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
about a little at noon
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
today but it took a lot of time on the
 
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
part of Mr applebe over at Doe and his
 
00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:31.559 align:start position:0%
staff it sucked out about 35% of his
 
00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:34.919 align:start position:0%
assistant time and they have all the
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
other tasks they normally have to attend
 
00:30:39.789 --> 00:30:39.799 align:start position:0%
to certification dealing with people
 
00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
trying to get into the business of this
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
he's also in charge of the higher
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
education and a number task they are too
 
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
skinny over there at the department we
 
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
really need to be thinking about funding
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
him the support to make this happen and
 
00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:55.559 align:start position:0%
that would probably be if we look at the
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
cost of an additional person over there
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
anywhere between 140,000 and
 
00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
$160,000 that's what we often times see
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
as that that factor um or the amount put
 
00:31:08.029 --> 00:31:08.039 align:start position:0%
in by uh Miss Davis from Finance over
 
00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
there so in conclusion I absolutely
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
support the need for this it's really
 
00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:15.559 align:start position:0%
needed um we're addressing some of those
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
issues done it through the part-time
 
00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
teacher we've done it through other
 
00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:23.919 align:start position:0%
areas uh too but this is really a a a
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
good U way to attract and keep them in
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
our State and once they're here then you
 
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
get them for one two 3 four years in
 
00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:35.720 align:start position:0%
those rural districts and that is in my
 
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
district that's important we have other
 
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
areas which are really short too
 
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
superintendent in my district the
 
00:31:45.149 --> 00:31:45.159 align:start position:0%
superintendent is rotating out this year
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
she's gone and we had an excellent
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
superintendent But there again too
 
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
there's reasons why they're retiring and
 
00:31:56.389 --> 00:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
one of them is you know uh there are a
 
00:31:57.509 --> 00:31:57.519 align:start position:0%
lot of issues I don't want to go into
 
00:31:59.230 --> 00:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
those right now but we have a shortage
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
there as well and shortage in a number
 
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
of trained people so let's start right
 
00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
now and and if we want to see our
 
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
achievement scores really grow in some
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
of these rural areas where there's a
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
need we need to maintain consistency
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
with our teachers we need to attract
 
00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:18.039 align:start position:0%
teachers highly qualified teachers a lot
 
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
of these people are just like the ones I
 
00:32:21.549 --> 00:32:21.559 align:start position:0%
employed when I was up in Alaska I get a
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
good science teacher and four or five
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
years later that person with that
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
chemistry degree or that science degree
 
00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
is working on a platform out in the on
 
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
the on the bay working for British
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
Petroleum or Arco or Sono or golf or
 
00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
some of these oil companies which could
 
00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
afford to Triple their salary just like
 
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
that so it's a competitive
 
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
market and if kids are what's important
 
00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:50.200 align:start position:0%
and they are we need to attract the best
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
and the best qualified for the job this
 
00:32:55.149 --> 00:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
will help us do that thank
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you um representative KC thank
 
00:33:02.629 --> 00:33:02.639 align:start position:0%

00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
of which communities would meet the
 
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
criteria for this I don't have that but
 
00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
I know that Mr applebe does and he
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%

question about the number of specific
 
00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
communities El when you said that um
 
00:33:58.990 --> 00:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
that they have doe is it possible to get

that document it's already done yeah and
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
looking at these rural districts and
 
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
where there's teacher shortage areas he
 
00:34:08.349 --> 00:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
has that information right he has that
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
information in terms of special
 
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
education The Sciences the mathematics
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
Career Technical education another area
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
in that Arena so he can just for that to
 
00:34:20.109 --> 00:34:20.119 align:start position:0%
us we can have that I I can't tell you
 
00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
when that would be available I'm not
 
00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
going to speak on his behalf I know that
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
we have discussed this
 
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
information and it it it can it is
 
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
available okay and then just to follow
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
up on follow up oh thank you yeah on
 
00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:34.919 align:start position:0%
representative Hall's question um under
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
that line 1920 here about if the teacher
 
00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
Rifts out um to another school district
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
uh it it says is is there any way to
 
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
correct add that into this so it's there
 
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
in the law do we be willing to alter
 
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
that or be like it is if they're rifted
 
00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:55.030 align:start position:0%
that or be like it is if they're rifted
out

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
um in in my district I I've been in
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
districts where people have been rifted
 
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
you know and and U you
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
can when you write your job descriptions
 
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
you can fill a vacancy with the people
 
00:35:11.589 --> 00:35:11.599 align:start position:0%
you want if you write it so it's I want
 
00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
a Spanish teacher that's fluent in
 
00:35:16.349 --> 00:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
Spanish while that takes care of but uh
 
00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of the rifting business I I I'm
 
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
not quite sure as far as would this
 
00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
count and go outside I don't think the
 
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
way it's written right now it would if
 
00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
they're leaving the school district
 
00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
right uh but my intent is that they stay
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
in that school district they stay in
 
00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
that school uh so that's an issue which
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
is imperative for these rural districts
 
00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
okay um and I don't think the rural
 
00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
districts are really
 
00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
rifting um the way they may be doing in
 
00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:49.599 align:start position:0%
larger districts just CL I was using
 
00:35:51.069 --> 00:35:51.079 align:start position:0%
thing as a term because that's what you
 
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
use rather if they choose to go to
 
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
another rural District they'd be
 
00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
eligible under this grant it doesn't
 
00:35:58.309 --> 00:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
carry with them that's just a concern
 
00:36:00.109 --> 00:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
that's all cuz they're still they're
 
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
still an issue okay we want them we want
 
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
them to stay in New Hampshire we don't
 
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
want them crossing the line to
 
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts which is that's what's
 
00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:12.079 align:start position:0%
going on okay thank you
 
00:36:14.829 --> 00:36:14.839 align:start position:0%
yeah yes representative
 
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
bone thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question my question has
 
00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
to do with um because there are so
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
little well there it's a placeholder and
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
there will be funds distributed into the
 
00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
fund eventually um what if there are
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
more uh teachers that are eligible and
 
00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
who would for this program than money
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
available are is there a priority
 
00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
system I I think you're talking about
 
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that are going on in
 
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
division two and finance and on the
 
00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:48.440 align:start position:0%
Senate side in terms of Finance
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
um I believe the money is there to do
 
00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
this job it's just matter where are the
 
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
priorities you know uh
 
00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.270 align:start position:0%
priorities you know uh
so

00:36:58.270 --> 00:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:59.910 --> 00:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
from a policy perspective I'll be there
 
00:37:03.309 --> 00:37:03.319 align:start position:0%
voting for this bill um what goes on in
 
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
finance that's where we've always had
 
00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
the issues the analyst was knock knocked
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
down and and
 
00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
uh and of course we have the senator
 
00:37:12.829 --> 00:37:12.839 align:start position:0%
right here he can tell you what's happen
 
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
on the other side it's some people are
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
projecting different amounts of money in
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund than on one
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
side of the wall to the other
 
00:37:21.359 --> 00:37:23.270 align:start position:0%
side of the wall to the other
side

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.790 align:start position:0%
side
yeah

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
followup um so basically what you're
 
00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
saying is the intent of the bill is
 
00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
where any educator that qualifies should
 
00:37:34.309 --> 00:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
be able to receive the funds
 
00:37:37.309 --> 00:37:37.319 align:start position:0%
correct yes anybody that's coming these
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
new teachers coming out of a cert with
 
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
certification they would qualify for
 
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
these funds should that money be
 
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
available and then $1 is not going to
 
00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.550 align:start position:0%
available and then $1 is not going to
make

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.109 align:start position:0%
make
it

00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
represent you I I you know I applaud the
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're trying to help get
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
to feachers in these Rural and
 
00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
underserved areas and certainly the
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
federal government used to used to do
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
this on uh Federal loans um for teachers
 
00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering about the Ed eligible
 
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
education expenses not everybody comes
 
00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
out with uh student loans obviously
 
00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
there are people that that don't that
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
make the ends meet but um you've got the
 
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
student loan or the eligible educational
 
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
expenses and then up in the definition
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
section it's the says means any
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
outstanding loan payments made during
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
the school year does that mean like if
 
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
they have a mortgage and they have a
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
loan payment on that I mean what you're
 
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
digging down and asking me a question I
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
haven't given any thought to and and I
 
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
don't know if I have an answer but I do
 
00:38:44.349 --> 00:38:44.359 align:start position:0%
know that I had a similar program up in
 
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
Alaska where I was where a person went
 
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
to a rural district and stayed there for
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
a year their master's program was
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
totally paid for by the state with with
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
their housing as well so so they came
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
out one year with it all and then they
 
00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:02.440 align:start position:0%
had to stay in the state a short time
 
00:39:04.829 --> 00:39:04.839 align:start position:0%
thereafter I I'd also just like to
 
00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:07.240 align:start position:0%
mention that um it might be good to
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
apply this money to the tuition costs in
 
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
the beginning to have a less tuition
 
00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
cost in the teacher prep program uh to
 
00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
encourage more people to go into the the
 
00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
profession to begin with but but when
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
you put it up front then they use it
 
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
they trip out to Rhode Island they're
 
00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
saying goodbye and then you're having to
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
chase this down I think you get into an
 
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
accounting nightmare trying to retrieve
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
those dollars you may never well I know
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
that follow
 
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
up yes I know that uh you know Plymouth
 
00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
and Keane used to be primarily teacher
 
00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:41.240 align:start position:0%
prep schools as they had in many of the
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
states and and once you were went
 
00:39:45.309 --> 00:39:45.319 align:start position:0%
through that program you were certified
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
in that state so anyway just as a
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
comment further questions comments for
 
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:55.640 align:start position:0%

Hawkins uh thank you Mr chairman uh

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
row um and very pleased to uh be here to
 
00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
support Senate Bill 2117 um want to
 
00:40:25.309 --> 00:40:25.319 align:start position:0%
thank Senator uh Fenton for um
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
sponsoring the bill um we started this
 
00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
journey back in the beginning of
 
00:40:36.589 --> 00:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
2023 um and so and here we are and uh
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
you know as uh representative lad uh and
 
00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
Senator fenon indicated this was one of
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
the recommendations made by the uh
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
teacher shortage committee and um we are
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
hoping that um we can have this uh
 
00:40:52.829 --> 00:40:52.839 align:start position:0%
policy in place so that uh when the
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
funding is ready whether that's this
 
00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
year or in the in in upcoming budget uh
 
00:41:02.349 --> 00:41:02.359 align:start position:0%
that uh the program is ready to go and
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh has what it needs in place um to help
 
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
uh address uh the educator shortage um
 
00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
most of my testimony I think has been
 
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
covered by um the previous two speakers
 
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:18.200 align:start position:0%
I would just add um this is not the only
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
program related to loan repayment that I
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
think would take a similar Journey so uh
 
00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
some of you may know that the Department
 
00:41:28.829 --> 00:41:28.839 align:start position:0%
of Health and Services uh
 
00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
administratively created a uh State loan
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
repayment program to help specifically
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
with um rural hospitals healthcare
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
workers um and to do so by uh creating
 
00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
this loan repayment incentive um that
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
program um was
 
00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh provides uh for those who work for
 
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
a minimum of three years in those
 
00:41:59.230 --> 00:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
particular areas is um you'll notice one
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
of the rural definitions in the bill
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
references back to how they Define rural
 
00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
um and um that was uh uh in from a
 
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
subsequent conversation with the former
 
00:42:19.309 --> 00:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
director of that program who uh as I
 
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
said sort of had a similar story they
 
00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:25.240 align:start position:0%
created the program uh there was very
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
little money in it but once they were
 
00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:30.079 align:start position:0%
are able to have an infusion of dollars
 
00:42:32.109 --> 00:42:32.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's become quite a robust program
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
in fact the Senate just passed I think
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
last week a program uh excuse me a bill
 
00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
to um further appropriate money uh to
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
that program to expand the eligibility
 
00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
um because they are seeing a success
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
with that program in in in helping um uh
 
00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
rural Healthcare and so um as we've
 
00:42:59.150 --> 00:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
talked about or you know the educator
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
shortage is real uh and we hope that
 
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
this will be um sort of a a major step
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
um toward addressing that and uh I'm
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions um that I
 
00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:14.440 align:start position:0%
can about the
 
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
bill uh thank you questions yes
 
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock thank you good
 
00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
morning uh just a question uh going back
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
on your your uh comment about the
 
00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
success of the rural Healthcare program
 
00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:31.720 align:start position:0%
you happen to have any uh information
 
00:43:34.109 --> 00:43:34.119 align:start position:0%
from that background of what the
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
starting salary is for nurse of the
 
00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:37.240 align:start position:0%
rural Healthcare has compared the
 
00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
teachers um I I have information about
 
00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
um uh educator starting salary I'm not
 
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
as familiar with um Healthcare uh I it's
 
00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
definitely higher thank
 
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
you further
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Cornell
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
Thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:43:58.109 --> 00:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
question Brian
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
there the healthc care um rule is is
 
00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
being successful they finding that
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
people are are staying or is it too soon
 
00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
to say that they're staying after the
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
incentives end uh my understanding in my
 
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
conversation with the the the former
 
00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
director uh is that they were having
 
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
success with people staying um I I I
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
kind of hearken back to um I'm not sure
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
if it was here or in the teacher
 
00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
shortage committee but you heard from
 
00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
the superintendent in uh the Newport
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
School District where they are really
 
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
struggling to find and retain um
 
00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
qualified teachers they have I think she
 
00:44:40.589 --> 00:44:40.599 align:start position:0%
said half of their teaching staff is on
 
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:44.680 align:start position:0%
site based licenses um sadly their
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
contract that was before the voters I
 
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
think it's one of the few ones that did
 
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
not pass this year uh in in March and so
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
they they so there is a is a real
 
00:44:58.750 --> 00:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
struggle there um and so you know I
 
00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:01.160 align:start position:0%
think of communities like that where you
 
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
know something like this um uh could
 
00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
could be helpful one one thing um and
 
00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
not related to that but I think there
 
00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
was a question earlier uh regarding the
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
appropriation and the ability to live
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
within um uh the amount that that
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully is greater than a dollar um on
 
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
the on page two of the bill lines 28
 
00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
through 30 um does allow through the
 
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
rulle making process the ability to
 
00:45:34.349 --> 00:45:34.359 align:start position:0%
establish protocols for determining the
 
00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
number of awards uh based on on the
 
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
appropriation and um representative lad
 
00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:44.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned um the Idaho program so they
 
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
they had a very similar framework to the
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
guidance that was given to U their
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
Education and you know living within the
 
00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:56.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation and what was passed in the
 
00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.470 align:start position:0%
appropriation and what was passed in the
bill

00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:45:59.670 --> 00:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
they established a rubric for how they
 
00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
would prioritize underserved and um
 
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
rural districts sort of like a point
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
system I brought some copies of that
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
with me today um the other thing I'll
 
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
leave the committee is states are being
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
have been aggressive in the last few
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
years uh in how in uh trying to address
 
00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
this issue and in this particular area
 
00:46:27.069 --> 00:46:27.079 align:start position:0%
um I brought some examples from from
 
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:30.079 align:start position:0%
other states of what it is uh they have
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
done um in in this particular area I
 
00:46:37.549 --> 00:46:37.559 align:start position:0%
will say some of them have gone beyond
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
just the loan repayment issue um but
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
many of them have adopted
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
programs um that take some you know
 
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
portion of um
 
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
the uh pipeline of Educators to help
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
support them in those early years so
 
00:46:58.470 --> 00:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
more more than you asked about but I
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure I mentioned that
 
00:47:02.829 --> 00:47:02.839 align:start position:0%

10:45 we're looking at 5:21 this is
 
01:16:09.790 --> 01:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
relative to the educational credentials
 
01:16:12.669 --> 01:16:12.679 align:start position:0%
for master teacher and I'd like
 
01:16:16.750 --> 01:16:16.760 align:start position:0%
to welcome Senator
 
01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:20.120 align:start position:0%

Assistant Grant
 
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
bosy uh good morning uh chairman lad
 
01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
it's always a pleasure to be back before
 
01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
the house education committee my name is
 
01:16:30.149 --> 01:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
Grant bossy Deputy Chief of Staff of the
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Senate and I am here to
 
01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
introduce Senate Bill 521 on behalf of
 
01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
Senator Dan Enis the Bill's Prime
 
01:16:38.430 --> 01:16:38.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor New Hampshire's had a master
 
01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
teacher certification on the book since
 
01:16:43.470 --> 01:16:43.480 align:start position:0%
1998 as a way for experienced teachers
 
01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
to continue their professional
 
01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
development master teachers could help
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
their schools develop their curricula
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
and serve as mentors and supervisors to
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
younger faculty the problem is that
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
nobody gets one there are literally no
 
01:16:57.790 --> 01:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
master teachers currently certified in
 
01:16:59.550 --> 01:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so the Professional
 
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
Standards Board is recommending a change
 
01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
to a competency based portfolio another
 
01:17:07.629 --> 01:17:07.639 align:start position:0%
problem identified by the Senate
 
01:17:09.550 --> 01:17:09.560 align:start position:0%
education committee was the fee attached
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
to the master teacher application $800
 
01:17:14.629 --> 01:17:14.639 align:start position:0%
is simply too high a barrier for
 
01:17:17.470 --> 01:17:17.480 align:start position:0%
teachers seeking this path the bill is
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
amended would set the fee at $100 for
 
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
the initial application and $25 for
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
annual renewal the department has had
 
01:17:27.390 --> 01:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
set the much higher $800 fee based on
 
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
the hours it estimated would be needed
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
under the current arduous process
 
01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
Senator inis would ask you to consider
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
three things one this estimate is based
 
01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
on the hours needed to complete the
 
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
review but the marginal cost is actually
 
01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
zero unless the department needs to
 
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
bring in more staff the uh two the new
 
01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
Competency Based criteria should greatly
 
01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
uh reduce the time required for review
 
01:17:52.030 --> 01:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
and three we don't actually know how
 
01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
many man hours are needed since no one
 
01:17:56.590 --> 01:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
seeks the certific ation now let's get
 
01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
some Master Teachers certified and if
 
01:17:59.950 --> 01:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
the department needs to adjust the fee
 
01:18:02.189 --> 01:18:02.199 align:start position:0%
to meet the actual costs Senator inis
 
01:18:03.790 --> 01:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
would certainly be open to amending the
 
01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
law for more than a quarter Century the
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
master teacher C certificate has been a
 
01:18:10.990 --> 01:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
road not taken for New Hampshire
 
01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
teachers Senator inis would like to
 
01:18:14.830 --> 01:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
clear the road so we can recognize and
 
01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
reward experienced teachers who serve as
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
leaders in their schools if you have any
 
01:18:20.629 --> 01:18:20.639 align:start position:0%
questions for Senator inis I will be
 
01:18:22.270 --> 01:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
sure to get you an answer thank you for
 
01:18:23.790 --> 01:18:23.800 align:start position:0%
your consideration and support of Senate
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
Bill 521
 
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you grant are there any questions
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
from the committee on this Bill yes
 
01:18:31.870 --> 01:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
representa Ry thank you thank you for
 
01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh what's the benefit
 
01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
to a teacher for pursuing this uh it's
 
01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
professional development it's it's a way
 
01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
that they can demonstrate not only
 
01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
Mastery of their subject area but that
 
01:18:47.149 --> 01:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
they are uh leaders within the school
 
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
they can help uh craft the curricula for
 
01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
that district for that department they
 
01:18:52.990 --> 01:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
can mentor younger
 
01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
faculty um and and demonstrate that
 
01:18:57.149 --> 01:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
there's leadership perhaps it's a path
 
01:18:58.669 --> 01:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
to Administration if they want to move
 
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
up to be a vice principal they want to
 
01:19:03.550 --> 01:19:03.560 align:start position:0%
be a department head uh it's hard to
 
01:19:05.229 --> 01:19:05.239 align:start position:0%
know exactly what teachers are going to
 
01:19:06.629 --> 01:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
be getting out of this because the
 
01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
process has been so arduous that none
 
01:19:10.669 --> 01:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
have tried so Senator inis would say
 
01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
we've had this on the books let's see if
 
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
we can get some people doing it and
 
01:19:17.470 --> 01:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
determine if it's a benefit or
 
01:19:21.629 --> 01:19:21.639 align:start position:0%
not represent Woodcock thank you chair
 
01:19:23.790 --> 01:19:23.800 align:start position:0%
good morning uh a followup to
 
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
representative D's question question if
 
01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
um reward or incentive for this those
 
01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:33.800 align:start position:0%
characteristics of a master teacher you
 
01:19:36.629 --> 01:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
just spoke about are already in play in
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
most schools by teachers that step up
 
01:19:43.030 --> 01:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
and do the work so why would I don't
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
understand the value of this um they're
 
01:19:46.709 --> 01:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
already doing the professional
 
01:19:47.709 --> 01:19:47.719 align:start position:0%
development they're already leading
 
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
they're already helping with curricular
 
01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
development and take administrative
 
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
roles through their degree work and
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
through their uh years in the school
 
01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
system so just I don't
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
understand if there's nothing of extra
 
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
value for this well there there could be
 
01:20:03.229 --> 01:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
something of extra value if a local
 
01:20:05.149 --> 01:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
school district wanted to
 
01:20:08.950 --> 01:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
provide uh say salary bump or or extra
 
01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
benefits for it that would obviously be
 
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
up to the local school district to do
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
this would be something the teacher
 
01:20:17.910 --> 01:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
could have on their resume uh to show
 
01:20:20.270 --> 01:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
leadership to another District uh the
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
benefits are really for the teachers to
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
decide and for the local school boards
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
to to decide if this is something they
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
want want to reward the state doesn't
 
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
pay teachers so we couldn't say oh if
 
01:20:31.870 --> 01:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
you get a master teacher you get a
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
Fiverr uh or I'm sorry the state of New
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a political entity does not
 
01:20:38.669 --> 01:20:38.679 align:start position:0%
pay teachers uh or determine their
 
01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits so if um um you
 
01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
couldn't simply say well you get a 5%
 
01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
pay bump you get a $3,000 pay bump that
 
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
that would be up for the the local
 
01:20:49.709 --> 01:20:49.719 align:start position:0%
school districts to decide okay thank
 
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you CH representative Miler
 
01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:20:56.590 --> 01:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
being here here I'm not sure you're the
 
01:20:59.229 --> 01:20:59.239 align:start position:0%
one that answer this question but there
 
01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
already is a national board of
 
01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
certification of teachers that's very
 
01:21:06.510 --> 01:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
rigorous I'm wondering if you know of uh
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
if we have
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
any teachers in our state right now that
 
01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
are nationally board
 
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
certified I do not know I can check for
 
01:21:17.709 --> 01:21:17.719 align:start position:0%
you okay thank
 
01:21:19.950 --> 01:21:19.960 align:start position:0%

thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
question again may be more for the
 
01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
department but uh do you know what the
 
01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
process right now is to become a master
 
01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
teacher I have the current law uh it's
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh RSA 1891
 
01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:40.719 align:start position:0%
14f uh and among the many requirements
 
01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
are a master's level or degree or
 
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
graduate coursework in curriculum
 
01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
development teaching experience
 
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
including at least seven years with a
 
01:21:51.310 --> 01:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
teaching certificate demonstrated
 
01:21:53.189 --> 01:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
quality teaching to be satisfied by
 
01:21:55.070 --> 01:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
meeting professional criteria developed
 
01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
by the Professional Standards Board
 
01:21:58.750 --> 01:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
quantitative evaluations of teaching
 
01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
quality from students parents peers and
 
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
administrators at least three classroom
 
01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
observations of the candidate by an
 
01:22:07.550 --> 01:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
independent Observer from outside the
 
01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:09.560 align:start position:0%
candidate school district and at least
 
01:22:12.030 --> 01:22:12.040 align:start position:0%
four significant and rigorous written
 
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
tasks and exercises as you can see
 
01:22:17.790 --> 01:22:17.800 align:start position:0%
that's quite a uh challenging obstacle
 
01:22:19.229 --> 01:22:19.239 align:start position:0%
course I can leave this with the clerk
 
01:22:22.189 --> 01:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
it's just a copy of the RSA um and the
 
01:22:23.629 --> 01:22:23.639 align:start position:0%
Professional Standards Board is
 
01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
recommending a
 
01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
less arduous Competency Based uh model
 
01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
to a base portfolio uh rather than this
 
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
rather extensive list of
 
01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
requirements represent
 
01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
leus thank you for taking my question do
 
01:22:46.910 --> 01:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
you know if there are any rules or laws
 
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
on the book at the moment that would
 
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
keep a school district from paying these
 
01:22:53.950 --> 01:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
license fees rather than the teacher
 
01:22:55.510 --> 01:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me like it's the
 
01:22:57.629 --> 01:22:57.639 align:start position:0%
school district who's going to benefit
 
01:22:59.390 --> 01:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
the teacher is going to be working
 
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
harder so why should the teacher pay
 
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
money to work harder I do not know I
 
01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
think the department could probably tell
 
01:23:07.470 --> 01:23:07.480 align:start position:0%
you I don't know of anything that
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
prohibits the district from paying the
 
01:23:12.629 --> 01:23:12.639 align:start position:0%
licensing fee for for instance the
 
01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
educator credential is an annual I think
 
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
it's every three years that a teacher
 
01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
would pay uh those are generally out of
 
01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
pocket but I don't think there's
 
01:23:21.189 --> 01:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
anything on the books preventing the
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
school district from writing the check
 
01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
themselves if if they so desire desire
 
01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Hall thank you Mr
 
01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
question do you think there's any is
 
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
there any incentive for the state to say
 
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
oh I have so many Master Teachers in my
 
01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
state I mean is is that part of the plan
 
01:23:41.310 --> 01:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
here because I I also feel like first of
 
01:23:43.189 --> 01:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
all I never even knew the certification
 
01:23:44.709 --> 01:23:44.719 align:start position:0%
existed maybe I should have but I taught
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
for 40 years and never even thought
 
01:23:48.830 --> 01:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
about this but or didn't know about it
 
01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
um but is
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
there you the end game you know yay we
 
01:23:55.070 --> 01:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
have so many Master Teachers in New
 
01:23:57.669 --> 01:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
is that I think that would be a benefit
 
01:23:59.629 --> 01:23:59.639 align:start position:0%
I think as representative Woodcock
 
01:24:02.350 --> 01:24:02.360 align:start position:0%
pointed out an $800 fee for something
 
01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
with no immediate tangible benefit
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
nobody's nobody's bothered doing it and
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
I think if we lower that threshold we
 
01:24:10.590 --> 01:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
can get some more people in and maybe
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
demonstrate you know all the experienced
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
competent teachers we have in the state
 
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
like followup yes quick I I'll say would
 
01:24:20.350 --> 01:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
you believe I think we have a lot of
 
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
Master Teachers in this state but
 
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
they're not master teachers would
 
01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
believe that so thank you represent
 
01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:24:31.629 --> 01:24:31.639 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
question could you inform us about
 
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
master teacher programs in other states
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
if they exist and what kind of criteria
 
01:24:44.030 --> 01:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
do they have and also what purpose does
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
it serve I could not at the moment but I
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
can look into it if the department
 
01:24:50.629 --> 01:24:50.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't know off the top of their
 
01:24:53.229 --> 01:24:53.239 align:start position:0%
heads are there further representative
 
01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
Cornell Thank thank you chair lad and
 
01:24:58.350 --> 01:24:58.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I I
 
01:25:00.189 --> 01:25:00.199 align:start position:0%
know that there are districts that have
 
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
people in positions just like this that
 
01:25:04.629 --> 01:25:04.639 align:start position:0%
in Manchester it's called building level
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
instructional coordinator that do all of
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
this job that don't have to go through
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
this to be a master teacher so I I don't
 
01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
know what the benefit of having to go
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
through all that to do the the job
 
01:25:20.990 --> 01:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
that's already being done by someone who
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to do this yeah as I said
 
01:25:26.189 --> 01:25:26.199 align:start position:0%
this is an existing state program for
 
01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:28.639 align:start position:0%
Now 26 years ago this legislature
 
01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
decided to set this up uh and it just
 
01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
set the um the the obstacle course a
 
01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
little too rough for people to go
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
through it so I think yeah a lot of
 
01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
local districts are doing their own
 
01:25:41.310 --> 01:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
version of this this would create a
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
Statewide version of it and use the
 
01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:45.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to to certify
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
yes you meet the criteria as a as a
 
01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
master teacher thank you just is a
 
01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
little bit of a history on this uh going
 
01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
back to the previous administration over
 
01:25:58.510 --> 01:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
doe when we were looking at when we went
 
01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
from No Child Left Behind into our
 
01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
current uh Elementary secondary
 
01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
Education Act we had Master teacher as
 
01:26:07.709 --> 01:26:07.719 align:start position:0%
one of the indicators of the delivery of
 
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
an adequate education of of the of the
 
01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
of the school districts but it was
 
01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:15.719 align:start position:0%
eliminated seeing that the hurdles to
 
01:26:18.430 --> 01:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
get master teacher were so high that we
 
01:26:20.830 --> 01:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
had no master teacher so it was you know
 
01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
it was it was uh deleted as a
 
01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
requirement or one of those indicators
 
01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
of we're delivering an opportunity for
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
an adequate
 
01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
education which we've looked at those
 
01:26:33.070 --> 01:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
indicators just the other day further
 
01:26:35.950 --> 01:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent Tanner um
 
01:26:38.070 --> 01:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
actually just a question on a followup
 
01:26:41.070 --> 01:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
on yours I I just noted in here that the
 
01:26:43.870 --> 01:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
that the master teacher rules that were
 
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
so strict and so stringent came through
 
01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
in 1998 and and as representative Hall
 
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
said I taught for 35 years I knew a
 
01:26:54.669 --> 01:26:54.679 align:start position:0%
couple people who had gotten Master
 
01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
teacher but basically it was having a
 
01:27:00.109 --> 01:27:00.119 align:start position:0%
master's degree and teaching a number of
 
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
years and and applying for it it really
 
01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
wasn't as as rigorous as that was in in
 
01:27:09.669 --> 01:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
1998 and I'm just wondering if you know
 
01:27:11.790 --> 01:27:11.800 align:start position:0%
how that happened and why it happened
 
01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
then so I'll I don't date back to 1998
 
01:27:16.229 --> 01:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
but I can say when Jenny Barry was
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner and when Heather Gage was
 
01:27:20.189 --> 01:27:20.199 align:start position:0%
working in curriculum all that's when we
 
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
took it out of the
 
01:27:23.870 --> 01:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
indicators because there was nobody here
 
01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
yeah I I happened to come to work for
 
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire house back in 19 uh
 
01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
fall of 1998 so I this had passed just
 
01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
before I came
 
01:27:35.910 --> 01:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
over further
 
01:27:38.030 --> 01:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much Grant

01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
University for six years I had the
 
01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
privilege of serving on the Professional

Standards Board here in New Hampshire
 
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
and while on the board I chaired the
 
01:28:32.669 --> 01:28:32.679 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that worked to update the
 
01:28:34.510 --> 01:28:34.520 align:start position:0%

01:28:44.950 --> 01:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
through 2021 and we presented our
 
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the PSB in November
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
of 2021 the committee's recommendations
 
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
were unanimously
 
01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
approved our committee began our work
 
01:28:59.830 --> 01:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
reviewing RSA 18914 F that created the
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
master teacher certificate in
 
01:29:05.629 --> 01:29:05.639 align:start position:0%
1998 the committee noted that the RSA as
 
01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
Grant pointed out was very restrictive
 
01:29:09.950 --> 01:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
about who could apply for the license
 
01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
and the requirements for earning it the
 
01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
RSA also gave the master teacher the
 
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
ability to evaluate other teachers which
 
01:29:19.990 --> 01:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
we worried might contradict state law
 
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
within a bargaining unit as well as
 
01:29:25.149 --> 01:29:25.159 align:start position:0%
negatively affect School culture
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
the committee did feel it was important
 
01:29:29.109 --> 01:29:29.119 align:start position:0%
to recognize outstanding teacher leaders
 
01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
for their leadership in their schools
 
01:29:32.990 --> 01:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
their districts and the work they do
 
01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
across the state when we began our work
 
01:29:37.750 --> 01:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
we felt there were three options for the
 
01:29:40.669 --> 01:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
irsa keep it as written and change the
 
01:29:42.590 --> 01:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
regulations recommend that it be
 
01:29:44.430 --> 01:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
eliminated and we don't need a master
 
01:29:47.189 --> 01:29:47.199 align:start position:0%
teacher license or amend it and the
 
01:29:47.199 --> 01:29:49.229 align:start position:0%
teacher license or amend it and the
accompanying

01:29:49.229 --> 01:29:49.239 align:start position:0%
accompanying
 
01:29:51.629 --> 01:29:51.639 align:start position:0%
regulations to ensure and you already
 
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
know this but to ensure that we wouldn't
 
01:29:55.149 --> 01:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
negatively affect anyone who held the
 
01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
certificate we reached out to the
 
01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
department and said okay geographically
 
01:30:01.270 --> 01:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
where are they are there certain subject
 
01:30:03.149 --> 01:30:03.159 align:start position:0%
areas and they're like this is easy no
 
01:30:06.350 --> 01:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
one's ever held it since no one had ever
 
01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
held it this led our committee to
 
01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
recommend that the RSA be revised if
 
01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
we've had it for 20 plus years and no
 
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
one's ever wanted it maybe there's
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
something wrong with the
 
01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
requirements once it is revised which
 
01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
this legislation will do if passed new
 
01:30:27.229 --> 01:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
regulations could be developed that
 
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
would hopefully encourage more teachers
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
to apply for the license the legislation
 
01:30:35.629 --> 01:30:35.639 align:start position:0%
that Senator inis Ward Waters Fenton and
 
01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
representatives cascaden lad Miler and
 
01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
patrino have sponsored aligns with the
 
01:30:43.470 --> 01:30:43.480 align:start position:0%
revisions that the master teacher
 
01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
regulations were recommended to and
 
01:30:48.750 --> 01:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
accepted by New Hampshire's Professional
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
Standards Board the proposed legislation
 
01:30:53.470 --> 01:30:53.480 align:start position:0%
would allow for the development of a
 
01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
competency based portfolio which would
 
01:30:58.590 --> 01:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
include reliable scoring that would help
 
01:31:00.990 --> 01:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
ensure that the master teacher license
 
01:31:03.030 --> 01:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
would be held by Educators who had
 
01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
already demonstrated their teaching
 
01:31:07.629 --> 01:31:07.639 align:start position:0%
abilities in the classroom and their
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
leadership skills in New Hampshire
 
01:31:10.709 --> 01:31:10.719 align:start position:0%
schools and
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
districts there are several reasons why
 
01:31:15.189 --> 01:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
supporting the creation of a viable
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
Master teacher license will help
 
01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
education in New Hampshire research
 
01:31:21.870 --> 01:31:21.880 align:start position:0%
consistently shows that when leadership
 
01:31:24.109 --> 01:31:24.119 align:start position:0%
is distributed throughout a school in
 
01:31:27.149 --> 01:31:27.159 align:start position:0%
District student achievement increases
 
01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
from my personal experience I think the
 
01:31:31.629 --> 01:31:31.639 align:start position:0%
research shows this because the job of
 
01:31:33.790 --> 01:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
being a principal requires being an
 
01:31:35.709 --> 01:31:35.719 align:start position:0%
instruction leader being a facilities
 
01:31:38.350 --> 01:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
manager working with parents Guardians
 
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
and other community members as well as
 
01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
developing relationships with the staff
 
01:31:46.590 --> 01:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
and students in the school it's
 
01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
difficult for one person to accomplish
 
01:31:51.390 --> 01:31:51.400 align:start position:0%
all these tasks well in a given day week
 
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
month or even a school year Distributing
 
01:31:56.830 --> 01:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
leadership for the tasks like overseeing
 
01:31:58.910 --> 01:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
the school's mentoring program
 
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
developing performance assessments that
 
01:32:03.390 --> 01:32:03.400 align:start position:0%
will work in the classroom and being a
 
01:32:05.149 --> 01:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
head teacher for a Content area
 
01:32:07.070 --> 01:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
Department frees up time for
 
01:32:09.189 --> 01:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
administrators to focus on other
 
01:32:12.109 --> 01:32:12.119 align:start position:0%
priorities for the school the idea of
 
01:32:13.870 --> 01:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
Distributing leadership to Master
 
01:32:16.350 --> 01:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
Teachers has been done successfully in
 
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
several other states and I can speak to
 
01:32:22.990 --> 01:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
those um because we did use their work
 
01:32:26.030 --> 01:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
to inform our on the subcommittee it's
 
01:32:27.790 --> 01:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
also been done here in New Hampshire
 
01:32:29.629 --> 01:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
with districts like Jaffrey ringe and
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
conell who have partnered with Keen
 
01:32:33.950 --> 01:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
state to implement successful teacher
 
01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:35.310 align:start position:0%
state to implement successful teacher
leader

01:32:35.310 --> 01:32:35.320 align:start position:0%
leader
 
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
programs I also believe that when a
 
01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
master teacher teaches in the classroom
 
01:32:41.310 --> 01:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
and then steps outside of their
 
01:32:43.470 --> 01:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
classroom to add their expertise to a
 
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
school district or state project it
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
opens up what I would call a career
 
01:32:50.990 --> 01:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
lattice for them I say lattice instead
 
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
of ladder because being a master teacher
 
01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
allows an educator to gain skills to
 
01:33:00.270 --> 01:33:00.280 align:start position:0%
become an administrator if they choose
 
01:33:03.390 --> 01:33:03.400 align:start position:0%
to but it also has them expand the
 
01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
impact that they have on students
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
without having to leave the classroom
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
and there was some interesting research
 
01:33:12.590 --> 01:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
that was done by the Met Foundation
 
01:33:15.550 --> 01:33:15.560 align:start position:0%
metti Foundation where they asked a
 
01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
thousand teachers would you want to have
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
combined classroom teaching requirements
 
01:33:24.590 --> 01:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
and Leadership responsibility
 
01:33:27.709 --> 01:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
51% said yes and then they said how many
 
01:33:29.629 --> 01:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
of you are really interested in becoming
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
6% um when we testified before to a
 
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee my colleague Emily Sherman
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
who's a stem teacher in Portsmouth
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
testified in support of this bill and
 
01:33:48.910 --> 01:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
she couldn't be here today but I
 
01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
promised her I would forward some of her
 
01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
thoughts and she testified that many
 
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
many teachers have the desire to
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
continue to teach and also assume
 
01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
leadership positions in a school or a
 
01:34:03.310 --> 01:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
district as Department chairs mentors
 
01:34:05.109 --> 01:34:05.119 align:start position:0%
and by working on other District
 
01:34:07.229 --> 01:34:07.239 align:start position:0%
initiatives and in New Hampshire's
 
01:34:10.030 --> 01:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
competency model that should not always
 
01:34:13.470 --> 01:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
involve Advanced degree work if passed
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
sb521 will recognize teachers for the
 
01:34:18.030 --> 01:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
leadership work they've already done in
 
01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
their schools and districts it requires
 
01:34:23.470 --> 01:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
teachers and CTE Personnel interested in
 
01:34:26.709 --> 01:34:26.719 align:start position:0%
obain aing this license to document that
 
01:34:28.990 --> 01:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
leadership contributions they have made
 
01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
by creating a portfolio of teaching and
 
01:34:33.950 --> 01:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
Leadership that will be objectively
 
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
scored both Emily and I urged the
 
01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
committee to recommend that SB 521 ought
 
01:34:41.709 --> 01:34:41.719 align:start position:0%
to pass and I would be glad to answer
 
01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
any questions that you might have thank
 
01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
you very much our uh represent Hall
 
01:34:48.109 --> 01:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:34:51.229 --> 01:34:51.239 align:start position:0%
being here Mr Richardson uh so I'm still
 
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
asking myself what's in it for the
 
01:34:55.950 --> 01:34:55.960 align:start position:0%
teacher what's in it because innately if
 
01:34:57.310 --> 01:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
you are a leader you're probably going
 
01:34:59.950 --> 01:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
to lead in your school so so that part
 
01:35:02.790 --> 01:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
one and part two would be um how does
 
01:35:05.229 --> 01:35:05.239 align:start position:0%
this tie into the mentorship programs do
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
you see a master teacher being selected
 
01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
to be the mentor in a mentoring program
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
that that would be a well choose me I'm
 
01:35:15.030 --> 01:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
a master teacher so I would see that as
 
01:35:17.109 --> 01:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
a possibility representative Hall but
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
not necessarily a requirement there are
 
01:35:22.229 --> 01:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
people who are serving as mentors as you
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
know and by the way I think think you
 
01:35:27.629 --> 01:35:27.639 align:start position:0%
were a master teacher um but there are
 
01:35:29.550 --> 01:35:29.560 align:start position:0%
also people working on performance
 
01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
assessments people who are working on
 
01:35:34.750 --> 01:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
different District's initiatives so
 
01:35:37.950 --> 01:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
there are three contracts that
 
01:35:40.149 --> 01:35:40.159 align:start position:0%
currently give you additional
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
compensation if you are a master teacher
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
or have national board and to answer
 
01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
your question there last time we looked
 
01:35:50.470 --> 01:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
with 29 national board certified
 
01:35:52.750 --> 01:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
teachers in New Hampshire many of those
 
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
came from other States and got certified
 
01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
in other
 
01:36:00.189 --> 01:36:00.199 align:start position:0%
states but if this certificate and
 
01:36:04.229 --> 01:36:04.239 align:start position:0%
license existed and if it was a viable
 
01:36:06.910 --> 01:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
then there could be ways that compensate
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
the people who choose to hold this and I
 
01:36:10.950 --> 01:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
in talking with the Department we
 
01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
thought maybe 1 to 2% of the eligible
 
01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
people in the state would apply for it
 
01:36:20.030 --> 01:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
which would be 2 to 400 Educators total
 
01:36:22.669 --> 01:36:22.679 align:start position:0%
and what could come out of that would be
 
01:36:24.270 --> 01:36:24.280 align:start position:0%
I'm applying for work in another
 
01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
District or I'm applying to graduate
 
01:36:28.229 --> 01:36:28.239 align:start position:0%
school so not only am I certified as a
 
01:36:30.149 --> 01:36:30.159 align:start position:0%
teacher and principal but I also hold a
 
01:36:32.310 --> 01:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
master teacher
 
01:36:34.350 --> 01:36:34.360 align:start position:0%
certificate fur further questions
 
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
represent Miler thank you Mr chair and
 
01:36:39.870 --> 01:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Dr Rich Dr Richardson for
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
being here your rep your rep
 
01:36:47.790 --> 01:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
your your rep U nationally precedes you
 
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
into this position thank you um Dr
 
01:36:54.590 --> 01:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
Richardson has been um noted for his
 
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
work nationally with uh professional
 
01:36:59.550 --> 01:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
standard boards Etc so I have a series
 
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
of questions I'd like to have you
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
clarify you clarified one that we have
 
01:37:08.350 --> 01:37:08.360 align:start position:0%
29 national uh board could you out could
 
01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
you outline for the committee what it
 
01:37:14.790 --> 01:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
means to be a nationally board certified
 
01:37:19.270 --> 01:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
teacher and the rigor that it takes uh
 
01:37:21.149 --> 01:37:21.159 align:start position:0%
to become one of those because I think
 
01:37:23.149 --> 01:37:23.159 align:start position:0%
it is relevant to what we're trying to
 
01:37:25.189 --> 01:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
talk about out here that's my first
 
01:37:28.189 --> 01:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
question yep thank you and I should have
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
pointed out that Emily is a national
 
01:37:32.750 --> 01:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
board certified teacher from her work in
 
01:37:35.629 --> 01:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
Maine and now she's teaching here in our
 
01:37:37.790 --> 01:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
state the committee thought there were
 
01:37:40.109 --> 01:37:40.119 align:start position:0%
two things that we wanted to recognize
 
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
so national board is a national process
 
01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
there's the national board for
 
01:37:46.750 --> 01:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
professional Teaching Standards it's
 
01:37:49.470 --> 01:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
probably about 500 hours worth of work
 
01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
and about several thousand dolls to
 
01:37:55.390 --> 01:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
apply for that certific if ification it
 
01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
recognizes a teacher for his or her work
 
01:38:00.669 --> 01:38:00.679 align:start position:0%
in the classroom in that subject area so
 
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
I would like to have national board
 
01:38:05.669 --> 01:38:05.679 align:start position:0%
certification for my high school math
 
01:38:09.070 --> 01:38:09.080 align:start position:0%
teaching most of the application deals
 
01:38:10.830 --> 01:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
with what I do with students in the
 
01:38:13.589 --> 01:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
classroom and so we felt on the
 
01:38:15.790 --> 01:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that if you want national
 
01:38:17.390 --> 01:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
board to be recognized for your
 
01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
classroom work there certainly should be
 
01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
a viable Pathway to do that although
 
01:38:26.109 --> 01:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
this state doesn't um reward it as other
 
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
states do but if you said no I my
 
01:38:32.350 --> 01:38:32.360 align:start position:0%
contribution is not only to my classroom
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
but I also work on assessment or I work
 
01:38:36.830 --> 01:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
on the mentoring program or I'm a head
 
01:38:39.310 --> 01:38:39.320 align:start position:0%
teacher for science at the high school
 
01:38:41.950 --> 01:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to offer a pathway for
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
people to be recognized for their
 
01:38:47.629 --> 01:38:47.639 align:start position:0%
leadership outside of the classroom so
 
01:38:49.629 --> 01:38:49.639 align:start position:0%
we wanted a pathway which is national
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
board for people who want to stay in
 
01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
their classroom and be recognized for
 
01:38:56.350 --> 01:38:56.360 align:start position:0%
that work and a pathway for people who
 
01:38:58.589 --> 01:38:58.599 align:start position:0%
choose to step outside and be recognized
 
01:39:00.510 --> 01:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
for that does that answer your yes thank
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
you second second question second
 
01:39:04.189 --> 01:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
question is uh it's more of a statement
 
01:39:07.390 --> 01:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
I guess isn't it true that in some
 
01:39:11.189 --> 01:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
states they basically provide funding
 
01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:14.159 align:start position:0%
for teachers who want to pursue the
 
01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
State Board the national board
 
01:39:19.390 --> 01:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
certification one and two isn't it true
 
01:39:21.070 --> 01:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
that in some collective bargaining
 
01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
agreements there is a negotiated section
 
01:39:26.830 --> 01:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
within that agreement that recognizes
 
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
that kind of achievement uh to provide
 
01:39:31.950 --> 01:39:31.960 align:start position:0%
some at least some Financial incentive
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
for people to pursue those issues is
 
01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
that true that is true in some states
 
01:39:39.310 --> 01:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
like North Carolina if you had national
 
01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:41.719 align:start position:0%
board whenever you were making it's plus
 
01:39:44.109 --> 01:39:44.119 align:start position:0%
$55,000 they've since backed off from
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
that but there are states that if you
 
01:39:50.109 --> 01:39:50.119 align:start position:0%
choose to seek that certification we
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
will support you
 
01:39:55.109 --> 01:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
financially and should we go that route
 
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
I think there are ways that it might be
 
01:39:59.790 --> 01:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
wrapped into graduate credits or
 
01:40:02.149 --> 01:40:02.159 align:start position:0%
something like that through universities
 
01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
which would help their enrollment and
 
01:40:06.430 --> 01:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
would make it easier for someone to
 
01:40:09.629 --> 01:40:09.639 align:start position:0%
pursue national board and finally um
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that to become nationally
 
01:40:14.990 --> 01:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
certified I said as I said earlier is a
 
01:40:17.870 --> 01:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
very rigorous process yes but in the
 
01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
rigor of that there's also a lot of
 
01:40:24.510 --> 01:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
professional development for that
 
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
candidate for that certificate and they
 
01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
learn a lot and they actually improve
 
01:40:32.709 --> 01:40:32.719 align:start position:0%
their own teaching as a result of the
 
01:40:35.709 --> 01:40:35.719 align:start position:0%
portfolios Etc that they have to provide
 
01:40:37.589 --> 01:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
yes that's built the reflection is built
 
01:40:40.109 --> 01:40:40.119 align:start position:0%
into the process submitting a video tape
 
01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
that's scored it's not just I fill out
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
the paperwork it's someone looks at it
 
01:40:47.390 --> 01:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
and says yes this candidate it qualifies
 
01:40:49.870 --> 01:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
for national board so my hope would be
 
01:40:52.470 --> 01:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
that uh obviously I'm a co-sponsor of
 
01:40:56.470 --> 01:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
this that the passage of this might be a
 
01:40:59.149 --> 01:40:59.159 align:start position:0%
precursor to a more rigorous process
 
01:41:01.709 --> 01:41:01.719 align:start position:0%
that the state might ultimately do to
 
01:41:04.589 --> 01:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
really try to pump up the issue of
 
01:41:08.589 --> 01:41:08.599 align:start position:0%
creating more Master Teachers recognized
 
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
by both from a certification standpoint
 
01:41:14.510 --> 01:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
and also from a financial standpoint and
 
01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
the issue of leadership within a school
 
01:41:18.669 --> 01:41:18.679 align:start position:0%
as a result of that yeah I think you're
 
01:41:21.229 --> 01:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
right you know since graduating from
 
01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth in 78 in teacher rep one of
 
01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
seven people who did that um I think
 
01:41:29.070 --> 01:41:29.080 align:start position:0%
that there was this notion that there
 
01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
was a pipeline where you drop in a
 
01:41:33.870 --> 01:41:33.880 align:start position:0%
teacher and it spits her out as an
 
01:41:36.030 --> 01:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
administrator on the other end I think
 
01:41:38.149 --> 01:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
it's more like cascading pools there are
 
01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
some people who really choose to stay in
 
01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
the classroom and build their skills and
 
01:41:44.669 --> 01:41:44.679 align:start position:0%
want to share those while working with
 
01:41:46.830 --> 01:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
students thank you thank you very much
 
01:41:49.229 --> 01:41:49.239 align:start position:0%
further questions represent
 
01:41:52.709 --> 01:41:52.719 align:start position:0%
leus I don't know it seems to me like
 
01:41:56.350 --> 01:41:56.360 align:start position:0%
we're going about this the wrong way and
 
01:42:01.070 --> 01:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
saying teacher you apply and and get
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
your master teachers instead of saying
 
01:42:06.589 --> 01:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
the school recognizes that we have this
 
01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
person who in effect is a master teacher
 
01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
and the te and the school does the stuff
 
01:42:17.149 --> 01:42:17.159 align:start position:0%
to you know and might say we'd like you
 
01:42:20.910 --> 01:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
to submit a a portfolio or whatever you
 
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
know can ask but it seems like it should
 
01:42:26.350 --> 01:42:26.360 align:start position:0%
be motivated by the school and the state
 
01:42:29.109 --> 01:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
especially if as the state wants more
 
01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
Master Teachers it doesn't seem like a
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
person who's already working more should
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
be working more to get acknowledged for
 
01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
the work that they're doing it that
 
01:42:40.510 --> 01:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
seems backwards to me and based on the
 
01:42:41.790 --> 01:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
things that you
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
heard when you were working on this
 
01:42:46.589 --> 01:42:46.599 align:start position:0%
committee does that make sense or seem
 
01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
feasible to have it
 
01:42:50.830 --> 01:42:50.840 align:start position:0%
be the opposite because I know in a lot
 
01:42:53.709 --> 01:42:53.719 align:start position:0%
of industry it's the industry that
 
01:42:57.310 --> 01:42:57.320 align:start position:0%
grants the certification reward the
 
01:43:00.589 --> 01:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
whatever that says you're a super
 
01:43:03.550 --> 01:43:03.560 align:start position:0%
employee right of of whatever thing and
 
01:43:06.109 --> 01:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
so this seems like a backwards way to go
 
01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
what do you think um I think that's a
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
great point and we did come up with some
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
possible regulations but we didn't want
 
01:43:16.350 --> 01:43:16.360 align:start position:0%
to get too far ahead of ourselves like
 
01:43:18.589 --> 01:43:18.599 align:start position:0%
oh and this is how this could work if
 
01:43:20.790 --> 01:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
the law wasn't changed then we couldn't
 
01:43:23.589 --> 01:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
really put that into place but should
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
the law
 
01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
change um we actually thought that it
 
01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
should be scored by the local
 
01:43:32.189 --> 01:43:32.199 align:start position:0%
professional evelopment committee
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
because you would know my work as a
 
01:43:36.950 --> 01:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
leader in this District but because it's
 
01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
a Statewide license that would need to
 
01:43:42.629 --> 01:43:42.639 align:start position:0%
be verified at the state level so it
 
01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
would be a combination of those things
 
01:43:47.390 --> 01:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
and we
 
01:43:51.669 --> 01:43:51.679 align:start position:0%
also um have some grant money not
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
through the Teachers Association but
 
01:43:56.350 --> 01:43:56.360 align:start position:0%
from the University of Florida to field
 
01:43:58.629 --> 01:43:58.639 align:start position:0%
test this that when the legislation
 
01:44:01.470 --> 01:44:01.480 align:start position:0%
passes okay let's do a couple rounds of
 
01:44:04.109 --> 01:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
you write a portfolio and you score it
 
01:44:06.070 --> 01:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
and what do we need to change so by the
 
01:44:08.510 --> 01:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
time we could hand it over with
 
01:44:11.189 --> 01:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
Department's help on this process it we
 
01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
would know that it would be a viable
 
01:44:15.870 --> 01:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
process where the things my
 
01:44:17.109 --> 01:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
understanding I was not involved with
 
01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
the state in '98 but the things like the
 
01:44:22.830 --> 01:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
standardized assessment of teaching by
 
01:44:25.470 --> 01:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
parent that was never developed so head
 
01:44:27.870 --> 01:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
mual decided she wanted to do it none of
 
01:44:30.550 --> 01:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
that infrastructure was in place thank
 
01:44:33.709 --> 01:44:33.719 align:start position:0%
you further question represent Terry
 
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
thanks when you were discussing uh at
 
01:44:38.189 --> 01:44:38.199 align:start position:0%
the outset the process in which you
 
01:44:40.629 --> 01:44:40.639 align:start position:0%
engage at the initial stage you
 
01:44:42.149 --> 01:44:42.159 align:start position:0%
indicated that there were several
 
01:44:46.109 --> 01:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
possible courses of uh action that were
 
01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
um that were identified um was the one
 
01:44:51.270 --> 01:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
that you chose the one that were that
 
01:44:53.589 --> 01:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
has produced this product pretty much
 
01:44:56.510 --> 01:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
would you say self-evident to you or
 
01:44:59.470 --> 01:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
were there any what uh with respect to
 
01:45:01.109 --> 01:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
any of the other courses of action were
 
01:45:03.310 --> 01:45:03.320 align:start position:0%
there was there any that commended those
 
01:45:05.470 --> 01:45:05.480 align:start position:0%
cour of action that you actually
 
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
discarded because you found this one to
 
01:45:08.709 --> 01:45:08.719 align:start position:0%
Superior could you just drill down on
 
01:45:10.629 --> 01:45:10.639 align:start position:0%
that a little more for elaborate the
 
01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
three options were keep the law as it is
 
01:45:14.510 --> 01:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
that was a problem for us because well
 
01:45:17.070 --> 01:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
if the law current law and it's so
 
01:45:19.310 --> 01:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
prescriptive about three standardized
 
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
three observations from someone who
 
01:45:23.589 --> 01:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong in your school district
 
01:45:26.550 --> 01:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
that if no one's held it in 20 years
 
01:45:28.589 --> 01:45:28.599 align:start position:0%
that's probably not going to work so
 
01:45:30.870 --> 01:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
then we looked at the field and like do
 
01:45:32.629 --> 01:45:32.639 align:start position:0%
you want to have a master teacher and
 
01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:34.719 align:start position:0%
they're like well sure what does it look
 
01:45:36.589 --> 01:45:36.599 align:start position:0%
like because people did not know about
 
01:45:39.709 --> 01:45:39.719 align:start position:0%
it and so there was interest but it
 
01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
needed to change the law needed to
 
01:45:44.109 --> 01:45:44.119 align:start position:0%
change so we looked and this will
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
actually I'm think I should give this to
 
01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
you chairman lad we actually surveyed
 
01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
all 50 states with the help of NASDAQ
 
01:45:54.430 --> 01:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
which is is the National Association of
 
01:45:56.709 --> 01:45:56.719 align:start position:0%
State directors of education and
 
01:45:58.629 --> 01:45:58.639 align:start position:0%
certification and found out what are the
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
states that hold Master teacher licenses
 
01:46:04.109 --> 01:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
places like Ohio that does a portfolio
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
and what's been their outcome with it so
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
when we found gee there are other states
 
01:46:11.189 --> 01:46:11.199 align:start position:0%
doing it in different ways that really
 
01:46:14.350 --> 01:46:14.360 align:start position:0%
let us down if we could change the law
 
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
then here might be a viable process for
 
01:46:19.870 --> 01:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:22.589 --> 01:46:22.599 align:start position:0%
apply the representative uh Damon and
 
01:46:25.189 --> 01:46:25.199 align:start position:0%
then and right thank
 
01:46:27.390 --> 01:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
you could thank you for taking my
 
01:46:30.870 --> 01:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
question could you please speak to any
 
01:46:35.109 --> 01:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
um perspective you may have on how the
 
01:46:36.750 --> 01:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
prior or the
 
01:46:40.189 --> 01:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
existing Master teacher process may or
 
01:46:42.070 --> 01:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
may not have been communicated to
 
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
potential applicants and then parallel
 
01:46:49.229 --> 01:46:49.239 align:start position:0%
going forward if this um Bill were to
 
01:46:52.510 --> 01:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
pass what might there be to invite
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
teachers to participate how would they
 
01:46:58.189 --> 01:46:58.199 align:start position:0%
know I'm not really sure I know it was
 
01:47:00.669 --> 01:47:00.679 align:start position:0%
an RSA and there were regulations for
 
01:47:03.790 --> 01:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
the doe I can't speak to how they put
 
01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:05.330 align:start position:0%
that out there
 
01:47:05.330 --> 01:47:06.629 align:start position:0%
that out there
[Music]

01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:06.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at representative
 
01:47:11.229 --> 01:47:11.239 align:start position:0%
cascaden as a superintendent did we ever
 
01:47:13.390 --> 01:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
get anything out to say Hey you have
 
01:47:15.310 --> 01:47:15.320 align:start position:0%
teachers and I know you did who could
 
01:47:19.830 --> 01:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:24.070 --> 01:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
um and my immediate thinking about the
 
01:47:26.709 --> 01:47:26.719 align:start position:0%
way to get it out is I know there are 53
 
01:47:28.669 --> 01:47:28.679 align:start position:0%
teachers working on
 
01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
Statewide Competency Based assessments
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
and they pull together work groups
 
01:47:35.550 --> 01:47:35.560 align:start position:0%
voluntary work groups to work on issues
 
01:47:38.270 --> 01:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
like that there are 53 districts that
 
01:47:39.709 --> 01:47:39.719 align:start position:0%
have mentoring
 
01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
programs and meeting with the doe in two
 
01:47:46.629 --> 01:47:46.639 align:start position:0%
Fridays to talk about those districts so
 
01:47:49.669 --> 01:47:49.679 align:start position:0%
I would say the yes there should be
 
01:47:51.669 --> 01:47:51.679 align:start position:0%
General ways of getting the information
 
01:47:54.510 --> 01:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
out but I also Target those people who I
 
01:47:56.790 --> 01:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
think might already be doing the things
 
01:47:59.910 --> 01:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
that we think would be good enough to
 
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
become a master teacher and asked them
 
01:48:05.870 --> 01:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
to apply I would want to make sure that
 
01:48:08.709 --> 01:48:08.719 align:start position:0%
we had a viable process rather than oh
 
01:48:10.629 --> 01:48:10.639 align:start position:0%
maybe in six months there'll be a way to
 
01:48:13.030 --> 01:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
do this hopefully we could field test
 
01:48:16.109 --> 01:48:16.119 align:start position:0%
and get the doe to say yes these are the
 
01:48:18.189 --> 01:48:18.199 align:start position:0%
regulations get the
 
01:48:21.629 --> 01:48:21.639 align:start position:0%
PSB um to accept the regulations send
 
01:48:23.950 --> 01:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
them to the state board and
 
01:48:26.910 --> 01:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
get the word out there although I am
 
01:48:29.310 --> 01:48:29.320 align:start position:0%
concerned I was trying to figure out who
 
01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
was on the PSB for currently practicing
 
01:48:35.070 --> 01:48:35.080 align:start position:0%
teachers and there's one teacher in
 
01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
eight vacancies right now according to
 
01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:39.830 align:start position:0%
eight vacancies right now according to
the

01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:42.270 --> 01:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
website which made contacting the
 
01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:43.790 align:start position:0%
website which made contacting the
teachers

01:48:43.790 --> 01:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
01:48:46.270 --> 01:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
easy who had the next question here
 
01:48:48.550 --> 01:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
represent dry thank you and thank you
 
01:48:51.790 --> 01:48:51.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so looking at the
 
01:48:54.990 --> 01:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
current statute talked about um three
 
01:48:57.470 --> 01:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
classroom observations from some an
 
01:48:59.390 --> 01:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
independent Observer from outside the
 
01:49:01.189 --> 01:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
district and you're talking about moving
 
01:49:02.589 --> 01:49:02.599 align:start position:0%
it to
 
01:49:05.430 --> 01:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
locally being done and I just wonder
 
01:49:07.350 --> 01:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
does does the fact that it's got to be
 
01:49:09.030 --> 01:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
verified at the state level then take
 
01:49:12.149 --> 01:49:12.159 align:start position:0%
that element of you know familiarity uh
 
01:49:15.470 --> 01:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
rather than impartial uh out of
 
01:49:18.109 --> 01:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
that that's a great question I think
 
01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
there are um what we should this law
 
01:49:26.589 --> 01:49:26.599 align:start position:0%
pass is um be passed we would see that
 
01:49:28.629 --> 01:49:28.639 align:start position:0%
you as a teacher get evaluated every
 
01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
year anyway so why not use that existing
 
01:49:34.109 --> 01:49:34.119 align:start position:0%
evaluations you would have had to have
 
01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
taught for seven years so you've got a
 
01:49:38.070 --> 01:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
record why do we need to bring in
 
01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
someone outside we don't have a
 
01:49:43.149 --> 01:49:43.159 align:start position:0%
Statewide evaluation model so the person
 
01:49:45.470 --> 01:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
who comes in would need to know we use
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
Danielson or safy or whatever model we
 
01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
use and it would be someone who didn't
 
01:49:52.270 --> 01:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
know the kids didn't know the district
 
01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
didn't know the curriculum who would
 
01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
come in three times to say you're a
 
01:49:58.270 --> 01:49:58.280 align:start position:0%
master teacher that seems a little
 
01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
foreign as opposed to I've been your
 
01:50:02.669 --> 01:50:02.679 align:start position:0%
administrator I've observed you for
 
01:50:06.510 --> 01:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
seven years and then put that into your
 
01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
portfolio without having to hire someone
 
01:50:11.109 --> 01:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
to come evaluate
 
01:50:14.109 --> 01:50:14.119 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the
 
01:50:16.550 --> 01:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
committee well thank you very much IR
 
01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you I can recall when I was an
 
01:50:20.790 --> 01:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
elementary principal up in Alaska before
 
01:50:23.109 --> 01:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
getting in administration but principal
 
01:50:25.229 --> 01:50:25.239 align:start position:0%
I had a budget where I'd look for master
 
01:50:27.470 --> 01:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
teachers in lower 48 I look for
 
01:50:29.950 --> 01:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
nationally board certified teachers I'd
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
fly them up interview them whine and
 
01:50:35.870 --> 01:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
dine them uh at at our expense up there
 
01:50:38.589 --> 01:50:38.599 align:start position:0%
that's when we were flooded with dollars
 
01:50:41.030 --> 01:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
and employ them and it made a big
 
01:50:42.910 --> 01:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
difference in the
 
01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
school the one they came from well you
 
01:50:48.109 --> 01:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
know I wasn't worried about that and you
 
01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
know our achievement scores were real
 
01:50:52.830 --> 01:50:52.840 align:start position:0%
pretty good yes funny how that works
 
01:50:55.470 --> 01:50:55.480 align:start position:0%
yeah yep thank you for your time this
 
01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:57.040 align:start position:0%

01:50:59.950 --> 01:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
welcome are there any other speakers on
 
01:51:02.430 --> 01:51:02.440 align:start position:0%

01:51:04.750 --> 01:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
much we're closing this hearing and
 
01:51:08.109 --> 01:51:08.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to move into the next
 
01:51:12.030 --> 01:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
hearing which is 340 SB 340 relative
 
01:51:13.709 --> 01:51:13.719 align:start position:0%
communication between parents and school
 
01:51:20.430 --> 01:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:24.669 --> 01:51:24.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:26.669 --> 01:51:26.679 align:start position:0%
you got the floor thank you Mr chairman
 
01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
two bills in two days to see you all
 
01:51:31.870 --> 01:51:31.880 align:start position:0%
again uh I represent the people of gtown
 
01:51:35.390 --> 01:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
hookit candy arond and maner District W
 
01:51:38.189 --> 01:51:38.199 align:start position:0%
one uh this is a simple bill that was
 
01:51:39.870 --> 01:51:39.880 align:start position:0%
brought at the request of
 
01:51:42.390 --> 01:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
sau19 the town of gtown and their
 
01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:44.669 align:start position:0%
sau19 the town of gtown and their
business

01:51:44.669 --> 01:51:44.679 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:51:46.510 --> 01:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
administrator what this bill does
 
01:51:49.470 --> 01:51:49.480 align:start position:0%
essentially is make it so that parents
 
01:51:52.149 --> 01:51:52.159 align:start position:0%
can by default receive Communications
 
01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
regarding IEPs via email versus via
 
01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
postage they can still request to get
 
01:51:59.229 --> 01:51:59.239 align:start position:0%
the documentation from postage that's
 
01:52:00.990 --> 01:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
still an option under the bill but the
 
01:52:03.669 --> 01:52:03.679 align:start position:0%
default would be via email the benefits
 
01:52:05.189 --> 01:52:05.199 align:start position:0%
of doing this is that number one it
 
01:52:06.990 --> 01:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
would be faster you know I can say that
 
01:52:10.470 --> 01:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
I have a child who receives IPS
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
the um communication must be received
 
01:52:15.470 --> 01:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
promptly it must be returned promptly
 
01:52:17.310 --> 01:52:17.320 align:start position:0%
and having that happen via email is
 
01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
Instant versus taking a day or two to
 
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
get to me a day or two to get back that
 
01:52:23.149 --> 01:52:23.159 align:start position:0%
would be a huge benefit
 
01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
it would save a lot of money there's a
 
01:52:28.069 --> 01:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
this is not one simple piece of paper
 
01:52:30.109 --> 01:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
back and forth over the course of the
 
01:52:32.589 --> 01:52:32.599 align:start position:0%
year in some cases it's it's two or
 
01:52:34.830 --> 01:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
three a month and so you multiply that
 
01:52:37.550 --> 01:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
expense by all the parents receiving IEP
 
01:52:39.870 --> 01:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
information it would save considerable
 
01:52:42.589 --> 01:52:42.599 align:start position:0%
amount of money for the district um does
 
01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
preserve the the option to receive
 
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
information for um IEPs via UPS uh
 
01:52:52.030 --> 01:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
Postal Service and finally the last re
 
01:52:54.510 --> 01:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
notification so people at both end know
 
01:52:56.510 --> 01:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
when their email's been received and has
 
01:52:59.950 --> 01:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
been read um and I hope that someone is
 
01:53:02.069 --> 01:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
here from se19 to back me up on this
 
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
because it was at their request but um
 
01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
this came out of the Senate on
 
01:53:08.709 --> 01:53:08.719 align:start position:0%
consent okay thank you very much any
 
01:53:09.950 --> 01:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
questions I got one question for you
 
01:53:12.270 --> 01:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
when working with the the the districts
 
01:53:14.950 --> 01:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
which this is coming from was there any
 
01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
discussion regarding having to have
 
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
parental permission to send this
 
01:53:22.910 --> 01:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
confidential information out via uh by
 
01:53:27.589 --> 01:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
via the web uh uh before it was done
 
01:53:29.149 --> 01:53:29.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question Mr chairman
 
01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion of that in the
 
01:53:33.030 --> 01:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
Senate hearing I believe you've accessed
 
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
to the Senate report um but no I have
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
not looked at that asking the question
 
01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
yes sir I can answer the question the
 
01:53:42.589 --> 01:53:42.599 align:start position:0%
assistant principal of Maple Avenue
 
01:53:47.910 --> 01:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
School in Goffstown um said that se19
 
01:53:49.550 --> 01:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
employs a platform which provides a
 
01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
process for parents to confirm
 
01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
information uh they can then updated any
 
01:53:56.709 --> 01:53:56.719 align:start position:0%
time so I believe the answer is yes
 
01:53:56.719 --> 01:53:57.629 align:start position:0%
time so I believe the answer is yes
thank

01:53:57.629 --> 01:53:57.639 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
you further questions represent Celli
 
01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you being your Senator
 
01:54:03.589 --> 01:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
01:54:07.470 --> 01:54:07.480 align:start position:0%
um in light of what you just read um has
 
01:54:13.149 --> 01:54:13.159 align:start position:0%
anyone looked into um uh Federal um
 
01:54:15.950 --> 01:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
regulations regarding that because the
 
01:54:18.750 --> 01:54:18.760 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulations require written
 
01:54:21.550 --> 01:54:21.560 align:start position:0%
notice so I'm just wondering if have
 
01:54:24.589 --> 01:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
there been any s anywhere in New
 
01:54:27.589 --> 01:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or other states where um
 
01:54:31.189 --> 01:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
written notice um might u mean um
 
01:54:34.030 --> 01:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
handwritten or typed rather than
 
01:54:36.350 --> 01:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
electronic communication that's the
 
01:54:37.709 --> 01:54:37.719 align:start position:0%
first time I've been asked that question
 
01:54:41.229 --> 01:54:41.239 align:start position:0%
but I can say that uh it my
 
01:54:42.390 --> 01:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the vast majority
 
01:54:45.189 --> 01:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
of parents do choose to receive their
 
01:54:48.589 --> 01:54:48.599 align:start position:0%
communication via email when given the
 
01:54:51.629 --> 01:54:51.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity um but the first few forms
 
01:54:53.870 --> 01:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
still must go VIA mail they have to mail
 
01:54:55.510 --> 01:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
me the form and saying is it okay if we
 
01:54:57.669 --> 01:54:57.679 align:start position:0%
email you the information from here on
 
01:54:59.990 --> 01:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
out I've got to sign that and mail that
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
back and then from then at that point on
 
01:55:04.830 --> 01:55:04.840 align:start position:0%
things can happen via email but since it
 
01:55:06.270 --> 01:55:06.280 align:start position:0%
happens via email already I don't think
 
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
that would be an issue thank you thank
 
01:55:12.030 --> 01:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
you in your testimony or which you've
 
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
had over in the Senate on the other side
 
01:55:16.229 --> 01:55:16.239 align:start position:0%
of the wall was there any kind of a
 
01:55:17.790 --> 01:55:17.800 align:start position:0%
presentation from the Department of
 
01:55:19.870 --> 01:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
Education special education regarding
 
01:55:23.229 --> 01:55:23.239 align:start position:0%
the question just Glenn asked
 
01:55:24.390 --> 01:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
there was no one there from the State
 
01:55:26.229 --> 01:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to testify for
 
01:55:29.189 --> 01:55:29.199 align:start position:0%
the bill either for or against all the
 
01:55:31.189 --> 01:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
all the tested PE all the testimony
 
01:55:33.030 --> 01:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
received on the bill was positive thank
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
you further question represent
 
01:55:38.350 --> 01:55:38.360 align:start position:0%
whitcock thank you Mr chairman good
 
01:55:39.950 --> 01:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
morning how you doing Senator welc see
 
01:55:42.310 --> 01:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
you again um just a question is there
 
01:55:44.669 --> 01:55:44.679 align:start position:0%
was there any dialogue I surprised that
 
01:55:47.310 --> 01:55:47.320 align:start position:0%
Doe wasn't there but probably not um was
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
there any dialogue um at the testimony
 
01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
about the implication of
 
01:55:56.270 --> 01:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
deadlines uh from special education has
 
01:55:58.270 --> 01:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
required parent parent interaction that
 
01:56:01.030 --> 01:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
would may maybe negated dur by
 
01:56:03.550 --> 01:56:03.560 align:start position:0%
Electronics or the timeliness you know
 
01:56:06.510 --> 01:56:06.520 align:start position:0%
the 5 days 10 days 30 days those things
 
01:56:08.109 --> 01:56:08.119 align:start position:0%
or all of a sudden it show up the night
 
01:56:10.910 --> 01:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
before was any that that there was
 
01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
significant conversation regarding
 
01:56:13.669 --> 01:56:13.679 align:start position:0%
deadlines the importance because those
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
are statutory deadlines they have to be
 
01:56:17.550 --> 01:56:17.560 align:start position:0%
met by the district and it was all
 
01:56:19.709 --> 01:56:19.719 align:start position:0%
positive for email because email is
 
01:56:22.510 --> 01:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
instantaneous as opposed to taking two
 
01:56:24.189 --> 01:56:24.199 align:start position:0%
or 3 days to get to the parent two or 3
 
01:56:25.709 --> 01:56:25.719 align:start position:0%
days to get back two or 3 days to go
 
01:56:28.350 --> 01:56:28.360 align:start position:0%
back to the parent again email is
 
01:56:30.790 --> 01:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
immediate so it it was strongly in favor
 
01:56:33.390 --> 01:56:33.400 align:start position:0%
of email thank you thank you and when
 
01:56:35.109 --> 01:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
they sign the parent signs it it's not
 
01:56:36.709 --> 01:56:36.719 align:start position:0%
by a robot you know you got to do that
 
01:56:39.950 --> 01:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:42.510 --> 01:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
IRS other
 
01:56:44.669 --> 01:56:44.679 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much Senator
 
01:56:47.790 --> 01:56:47.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr are there any other cards
 
01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:50.880 align:start position:0%

okay we're ready to go ahead with the
 
02:19:32.950 --> 02:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
last bill that's scheduled for hearing

this morning this is uh s SP 338
 
02:19:37.230 --> 02:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
relative the education Professional
 
02:19:39.549 --> 02:19:39.559 align:start position:0%
Standards Board and I welcome
 
02:19:43.270 --> 02:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative Waters or Senator Dave
 
02:19:47.110 --> 02:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
Waters I wantes trying SP a lot of time
 
02:19:49.550 --> 02:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
I was trying to elevate you yeah I know
 
02:19:53.429 --> 02:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
I know I know it's true it's
 
02:19:57.270 --> 02:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
true uh thank you Mr chairman I think um
 
02:20:00.389 --> 02:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
I'm uh Senator David Waters uh District
 
02:20:02.750 --> 02:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
4 introducing Senate Bill 338 relative
 
02:20:04.389 --> 02:20:04.399 align:start position:0%
to the education Professional Standards
 
02:20:07.190 --> 02:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
Board uh the bill language it's itself
 
02:20:10.429 --> 02:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
as you'll see adds a member to this um
 
02:20:14.190 --> 02:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
board um and uh so we have two changes
 
02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
goes to 22 members and uh adding the
 
02:20:18.910 --> 02:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
administrator of the Department of
 
02:20:20.910 --> 02:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
Education Bureau of career development
 
02:20:20.920 --> 02:20:22.230 align:start position:0%
Education Bureau of career development
or

02:20:22.230 --> 02:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:20:22.240 --> 02:20:23.830 align:start position:0%
or
design

02:20:23.830 --> 02:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
design
 
02:20:26.469 --> 02:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
um it was you know not exactly an
 
02:20:28.790 --> 02:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
oversight that such a person who was so
 
02:20:31.510 --> 02:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
deeply involved uh in career development
 
02:20:34.389 --> 02:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
was not placed on this board um this
 
02:20:37.309 --> 02:20:37.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation does come to you from the
 
02:20:38.790 --> 02:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh Career and Technical education
 
02:20:42.830 --> 02:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
advisory Council and um I would just
 
02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
want to note that of course the CTE
 
02:20:46.990 --> 02:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
centers are so deeply involved in
 
02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:47.990 align:start position:0%
centers are so deeply involved in
student

02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
student
 
02:20:50.910 --> 02:20:50.920 align:start position:0%
credentialing um and consider an
 
02:20:52.710 --> 02:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
inclusion of someone who could represent
 
02:20:56.030 --> 02:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
them on this board uh fitting and um
 
02:20:57.550 --> 02:20:57.560 align:start position:0%
there's some discussion about well
 
02:21:01.190 --> 02:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
should we just say the um director of
 
02:21:05.389 --> 02:21:05.399 align:start position:0%
the of the state CTE or a CTE director
 
02:21:08.270 --> 02:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner Adu thought well
 
02:21:10.030 --> 02:21:10.040 align:start position:0%
because the hierarchy and Department of
 
02:21:14.070 --> 02:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
Ed is that because CTE is in the um
 
02:21:17.309 --> 02:21:17.319 align:start position:0%
Bureau of adult education that would be
 
02:21:19.590 --> 02:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate to phrase it this way but
 
02:21:21.230 --> 02:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
the understanding is that it's quite
 
02:21:23.150 --> 02:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
likely that it will be the design and it
 
02:21:25.870 --> 02:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
will either be um Jeff beard the state
 
02:21:27.870 --> 02:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
director or or select a director from
 
02:21:30.990 --> 02:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
elsewhere um so that's what the way it's
 
02:21:33.349 --> 02:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
I mean the intent is pretty clear but I
 
02:21:34.630 --> 02:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
the commissioner thought this is the
 
02:21:36.270 --> 02:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
best way to phrase that because of the
 
02:21:38.309 --> 02:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
hierarchy of they're not being a you
 
02:21:39.790 --> 02:21:39.800 align:start position:0%
know with the reorganization a few years
 
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
ago there's no longer a separate Bureau
 
02:21:43.309 --> 02:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
for um Career and Technical education
 
02:21:46.790 --> 02:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
that was folded into the um uh adult
 
02:21:48.469 --> 02:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
education so that was the way that's
 
02:21:49.870 --> 02:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
that's why we came up with this wording
 
02:21:51.630 --> 02:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
but that that is the intent that the
 
02:21:53.309 --> 02:21:53.319 align:start position:0%
people who right there on the ground
 
02:21:54.990 --> 02:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
working with students about
 
02:21:57.830 --> 02:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
credentialing and those programs I mean
 
02:21:59.309 --> 02:21:59.319 align:start position:0%
that's that's what's so value about them
 
02:22:00.309 --> 02:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
as you come out of them with a
 
02:22:01.630 --> 02:22:01.640 align:start position:0%
credential and that there ought to be
 
02:22:04.349 --> 02:22:04.359 align:start position:0%
somebody on this board that can um speak
 
02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
speak for that group and and work with
 
02:22:08.910 --> 02:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
them so Mr chairman that is the Bill
 
02:22:12.150 --> 02:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh Senator Waters uh
 
02:22:14.070 --> 02:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
on that item e there where it says
 
02:22:15.389 --> 02:22:15.399 align:start position:0%
administrator of the Department of
 
02:22:17.550 --> 02:22:17.560 align:start position:0%
Education Bureau of career development
 
02:22:21.070 --> 02:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
or selected local CTE director instead
 
02:22:21.080 --> 02:22:21.750 align:start position:0%
or selected local CTE director instead
of

02:22:21.750 --> 02:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:22:24.510 --> 02:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
design um the wisdom of this committee
 
02:22:27.870 --> 02:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
is nearly infinite I I just I'm sorry I
 
02:22:29.750 --> 02:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
just wanted to explain
 
02:22:33.550 --> 02:22:33.560 align:start position:0%
why I thought I'd turn that
 
02:22:36.670 --> 02:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
off my apologies don't don't appoint him
 
02:22:38.389 --> 02:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
don't appoint him
 
02:22:41.710 --> 02:22:41.720 align:start position:0%
okay um but I I I'm sure if that's the
 
02:22:43.750 --> 02:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
change that you felt was necessary that
 
02:22:45.550 --> 02:22:45.560 align:start position:0%
I I I would imagine the Department of
 
02:22:48.510 --> 02:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
Education would see that as
 
02:22:50.590 --> 02:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable uh further questions from the
 
02:22:53.270 --> 02:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
committee represent Cornell thank you
 
02:22:54.630 --> 02:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
02:22:57.070 --> 02:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters um line seven where it
 
02:22:59.349 --> 02:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
says b nine members representing
 
02:23:00.870 --> 02:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
classroom teachers educational
 
02:23:03.150 --> 02:23:03.160 align:start position:0%
Specialists or instructional Specialists
 
02:23:05.750 --> 02:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
is there any designation of What
 
02:23:08.230 --> 02:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
proportion are they Elementary are they
 
02:23:11.469 --> 02:23:11.479 align:start position:0%
high school are they CTE
 
02:23:13.469 --> 02:23:13.479 align:start position:0%
teachers thanks for the question you
 
02:23:15.750 --> 02:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
know um since this bill only changes
 
02:23:18.150 --> 02:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
that that one that one place I didn't
 
02:23:20.630 --> 02:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
really look into the to the rest of it
 
02:23:25.429 --> 02:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
okay so it's possible that they do but
 
02:23:27.750 --> 02:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
um you know I think in terms of somebody
 
02:23:29.910 --> 02:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
who is you know intimately connected
 
02:23:32.830 --> 02:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
with what the CTE do is the point of
 
02:23:35.309 --> 02:23:35.319 align:start position:0%
this and with the chair's potential
 
02:23:38.389 --> 02:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
Amendment that'll be even clearer thank
 
02:23:42.910 --> 02:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the
 
02:23:45.750 --> 02:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
committee see your preceding
 
02:23:48.790 --> 02:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
lunch that's always a good place to
 
02:23:51.510 --> 02:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
be so thank you very much Senator have

Hampshire Career and Technical
 
02:24:29.030 --> 02:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
Association that's it comprises of all
 
02:24:30.630 --> 02:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
our teachers and
 
02:24:34.110 --> 02:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
administrators um with regards to this
 
02:24:36.990 --> 02:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
proposed Bill uh our association has
 
02:24:39.910 --> 02:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
taken a deep look into it and CTE needs
 
02:24:42.750 --> 02:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
to be represented on the PSB uh the
 
02:24:44.790 --> 02:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
professional standard board uh the
 
02:24:47.030 --> 02:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
requirements and process for hiring a
 
02:24:50.750 --> 02:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
CTE teacher is very unique and has many
 
02:24:55.790 --> 02:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
nuances we have 28 centers over 400
 
02:24:55.800 --> 02:24:56.670 align:start position:0%
nuances we have 28 centers over 400
staff

02:24:56.670 --> 02:24:56.680 align:start position:0%
staff
 
02:24:59.309 --> 02:24:59.319 align:start position:0%
members th those staff members come from
 
02:25:01.790 --> 02:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
industry they have very different
 
02:25:04.429 --> 02:25:04.439 align:start position:0%
credentialing requirements uh different
 
02:25:06.750 --> 02:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
backgrounds and they're hired because of
 
02:25:08.950 --> 02:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
their industry knowledge their knowledge
 
02:25:11.950 --> 02:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
of equipment their industry recognized
 
02:25:13.990 --> 02:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
certifications and more importantly
 
02:25:16.710 --> 02:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
their connections to the industry we are
 
02:25:19.790 --> 02:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
CTE because of them our success is
 
02:25:21.190 --> 02:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
because of them
 
02:25:23.830 --> 02:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
ncka has tried for three years to get
 
02:25:25.910 --> 02:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
somebody on this board
 
02:25:28.030 --> 02:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
unsuccessfully um they've applied
 
02:25:30.750 --> 02:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
they've gone through the formal process
 
02:25:32.790 --> 02:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
and because they've been unsuccessful
 
02:25:35.030 --> 02:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
they've even requested the open seats
 
02:25:37.670 --> 02:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
there's been nine open seats um if you
 
02:25:40.150 --> 02:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
look at B there's been nine open seats
 
02:25:43.070 --> 02:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
and we still haven't been granted access
 
02:25:47.110 --> 02:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
to sitting on this board so due to the N
 
02:25:50.630 --> 02:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
requirements of our centers and the un
 
02:25:52.309 --> 02:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
successful attempts in getting somebody
 
02:25:55.030 --> 02:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
on this board we recommend that we
 
02:25:59.510 --> 02:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
change the language in E to read CTE
 
02:26:03.070 --> 02:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
license administrator currently employed
 
02:26:09.469 --> 02:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:11.630 --> 02:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
Center yep
 
02:26:14.710 --> 02:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
CTE licensed
 
02:26:18.070 --> 02:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
administrator currently employed in a
 
02:26:23.790 --> 02:26:23.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:26.070 --> 02:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
sounds like Steve
 
02:26:28.870 --> 02:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
Rothenberg does it that where you get it
 
02:26:30.590 --> 02:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
no I wrote it myself this morning
 
02:26:34.469 --> 02:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:37.469 --> 02:26:37.479 align:start position:0%
not all right and I'm done so if you
 
02:26:39.190 --> 02:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
want any questions are there any
 
02:26:43.710 --> 02:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
questions of Miss fer yes Terry uh so
 
02:26:47.550 --> 02:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
you uh you you said that uh that you
 
02:26:51.230 --> 02:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
applied without success correct on
 
02:26:54.950 --> 02:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
several occasions yes years can you
 
02:26:56.790 --> 02:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
describe the nature of that resistance
 
02:26:59.389 --> 02:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
or at least how that resistance was
 
02:27:00.790 --> 02:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
betrayed to you or was there just
 
02:27:03.950 --> 02:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
silence um that I do not know I I'm
 
02:27:06.309 --> 02:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
representing the association who gave me
 
02:27:08.269 --> 02:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
the talking point that for three years
 
02:27:10.510 --> 02:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
they've applied and been unsuccessful I
 
02:27:12.670 --> 02:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
didn't ask that detail thank sorry
 
02:27:16.230 --> 02:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
thanks yep Hall you Mr chair thank you
 
02:27:18.389 --> 02:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you suggested
 
02:27:21.590 --> 02:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
replacing letter e with the CTE licensed
 
02:27:23.349 --> 02:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
administrator currently employed in a
 
02:27:25.990 --> 02:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
CTE Center correct is there a reason why
 
02:27:27.790 --> 02:27:27.800 align:start position:0%
you haven't is that different than
 
02:27:31.230 --> 02:27:31.240 align:start position:0%
adding F or F would give one more person
 
02:27:33.830 --> 02:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
I guess yeah right or I guess I'm just
 
02:27:35.070 --> 02:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
wondering who the administrator of the
 
02:27:36.590 --> 02:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed Bureau of career
 
02:27:38.710 --> 02:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
development sure um can that be the same
 
02:27:40.550 --> 02:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
person as the C no there are two
 
02:27:43.269 --> 02:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
different roles um prior to my position
 
02:27:44.750 --> 02:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
as principal of conquer Regional
 
02:27:46.309 --> 02:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
Technical Center I work for the Bureau
 
02:27:48.830 --> 02:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
of career development and that role uh
 
02:27:50.790 --> 02:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
is slightly different they they don't
 
02:27:53.309 --> 02:27:53.319 align:start position:0%
hire fire the staff members that are in
 
02:27:55.750 --> 02:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
individual CTE centers they oversight
 
02:27:57.870 --> 02:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
the quality control of how we administer
 
02:28:00.790 --> 02:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
our programs the Perkins funding uh they
 
02:28:04.150 --> 02:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
do monitoring visits but the actual you
 
02:28:06.389 --> 02:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
know meeting with the individual
 
02:28:09.750 --> 02:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
applicants in our role is at the local
 
02:28:11.190 --> 02:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
level you know we're in our schools
 
02:28:12.830 --> 02:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
we're in our buildings we're working
 
02:28:14.469 --> 02:28:14.479 align:start position:0%
with the business community and our
 
02:28:16.670 --> 02:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods um so when we have our
 
02:28:18.670 --> 02:28:18.680 align:start position:0%
applications and we're interviewing our
 
02:28:20.910 --> 02:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
candidates that's that's the
 
02:28:23.830 --> 02:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the CTE administrator
 
02:28:27.830 --> 02:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
so thank you yep representative Damon
 
02:28:29.389 --> 02:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:28:32.110 --> 02:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
question so I'm wondering if you could
 
02:28:34.590 --> 02:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
comment on something that we heard in a
 
02:28:36.429 --> 02:28:36.439 align:start position:0%
prior hearing this
 
02:28:39.349 --> 02:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
morning I believe the speaker then said
 
02:28:42.389 --> 02:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
that um there's only one position filled
 
02:28:46.269 --> 02:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
of the nine members it what's line b or
 
02:28:49.950 --> 02:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
line seven um letter B on this bill is
 
02:28:52.550 --> 02:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
that correct I I did hear that there
 
02:28:55.269 --> 02:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
were many unfilled positions I didn't
 
02:28:57.870 --> 02:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
get a quantity but there's many unfilled
 
02:29:00.590 --> 02:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
positions and and that leads to our
 
02:29:03.110 --> 02:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
puzzlement of why why they would not let
 
02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
us sit on this board so that in L of
 
02:29:09.469 --> 02:29:09.479 align:start position:0%
continuing down that path it's best that
 
02:29:12.469 --> 02:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
we write it so that we have a position
 
02:29:16.269 --> 02:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
uh you know on the board directly thank
 
02:29:16.279 --> 02:29:18.550 align:start position:0%
uh you know on the board directly thank
youon

02:29:18.550 --> 02:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
youon
 
02:29:21.070 --> 02:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chair
 
02:29:25.389 --> 02:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
I have two questions here thank you uh
 
02:29:27.790 --> 02:29:27.800 align:start position:0%
notice you remember lunch I don't eat it
 
02:29:29.550 --> 02:29:29.560 align:start position:0%
thank you oh you don't eat
 
02:29:32.910 --> 02:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
Lun um thank good morning good morning
 
02:29:35.550 --> 02:29:35.560 align:start position:0%
good morning um as someone who has a
 
02:29:38.110 --> 02:29:38.120 align:start position:0%
wife has spent 32 years in vocational
 
02:29:40.550 --> 02:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
education I I understand that and having
 
02:29:42.790 --> 02:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
served on the school board there for a
 
02:29:45.469 --> 02:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
different time uh I have one two
 
02:29:47.790 --> 02:29:47.800 align:start position:0%
questions the first one is as you your
 
02:29:49.630 --> 02:29:49.640 align:start position:0%
wording suggested wording for an
 
02:29:53.950 --> 02:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
amendment or change to e
 
02:29:58.590 --> 02:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
um the part that who currently serves as
 
02:30:01.469 --> 02:30:01.479 align:start position:0%
uh a licensed administrator is it
 
02:30:03.670 --> 02:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
possible just thinking I know sometimes
 
02:30:05.590 --> 02:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
people around this table here are
 
02:30:07.990 --> 02:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable having someone who's in
 
02:30:10.150 --> 02:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
the field in the field um so I was
 
02:30:12.030 --> 02:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
wondering if it currently served as or
 
02:30:13.870 --> 02:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
who has served
 
02:30:15.950 --> 02:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
as that if you have n you have nine
 
02:30:18.389 --> 02:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
centers or 10 centors 28 c c so that
 
02:30:20.389 --> 02:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
would at least give you 28 plus who were
 
02:30:23.070 --> 02:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
there before to me yeah I mean it's been
 
02:30:26.070 --> 02:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
my experience that the um the
 
02:30:28.550 --> 02:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
environment that we work in changes very
 
02:30:31.670 --> 02:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
quickly and when somebody retires or
 
02:30:36.190 --> 02:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
leaves or moves on I would hesitate to
 
02:30:38.710 --> 02:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
have them okay play such an important
 
02:30:40.670 --> 02:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
role in this decision- making process
 
02:30:41.710 --> 02:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
although that might be one more than you
 
02:30:43.630 --> 02:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
have now right right right and the
 
02:30:45.630 --> 02:30:45.640 align:start position:0%
second question thank you um and
 
02:30:47.070 --> 02:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
strictly for my own lack of knowledge
 
02:30:48.910 --> 02:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
had nothing with this well this I have a
 
02:31:50.230 --> 02:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:52.269 --> 02:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
this of one of which may be a CTE
 
02:31:55.670 --> 02:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
teacher but if e is not phrased uh
 
02:31:57.710 --> 02:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
licensed administrator because we have
 
02:32:00.950 --> 02:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
I'm a principal right a different title
 
02:32:03.190 --> 02:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
um saying director can also be
 
02:32:05.510 --> 02:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
misconstrued as the Director Bureau of
 
02:32:07.750 --> 02:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
credit Career Development I'm agreeing
 
02:32:09.870 --> 02:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
with that I'm not trying to change that
 
02:32:12.750 --> 02:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
no but that's why we said CTE license
 
02:32:15.550 --> 02:32:15.560 align:start position:0%
administrator because of the allows us
 
02:32:18.429 --> 02:32:18.439 align:start position:0%
the mobility that the CTE administrators
 
02:32:20.710 --> 02:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
some are directors some are principal
 
02:32:23.950 --> 02:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
so it allows to eliminate any
 
02:32:26.429 --> 02:32:26.439 align:start position:0%
confusion yeah from that that's all
 
02:32:28.910 --> 02:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
thank you because I'm technically a a a
 
02:32:31.590 --> 02:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
principal and the technicality would be
 
02:32:33.870 --> 02:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
to eliminate me you you have two hats
 
02:32:36.309 --> 02:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
then I do that's right that's just like
 
02:32:39.150 --> 02:32:39.160 align:start position:0%
your predecessor had yes correct
 
02:32:41.110 --> 02:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell well this is just
 
02:32:42.830 --> 02:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
a point of information I just looked it
 
02:32:44.710 --> 02:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
up and the State Board of Education
 
02:32:46.750 --> 02:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
appoints the 20
 
02:32:46.760 --> 02:32:48.910 align:start position:0%
appoints the 20
members

02:32:48.910 --> 02:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
members
 
02:32:48.920 --> 02:32:50.710 align:start position:0%
members
so

02:32:50.710 --> 02:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:32:52.830 --> 02:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
it's the state board that would apply
 
02:32:55.870 --> 02:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
that would appoint the the nine teachers
 
02:32:58.990 --> 02:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I don't know why they
 
02:33:03.309 --> 02:33:03.319 align:start position:0%
haven't thank you any excuse me any
 
02:33:08.230 --> 02:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
further questions for M fer state board
 
02:33:14.429 --> 02:33:14.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:18.030 --> 02:33:18.040 align:start position:0%
chair see see no further representative
 
02:33:20.389 --> 02:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
Woodcock further question I I missed
 
02:33:22.030 --> 02:33:22.040 align:start position:0%
whatever it was because I was cheating
 
02:33:23.750 --> 02:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
with representative Damon here because
 
02:33:26.230 --> 02:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
we looking at the law um research thank
 
02:33:27.670 --> 02:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
you we look at the law it does say State
 
02:33:30.309 --> 02:33:30.319 align:start position:0%
Board of Ed app points but it says
 
02:33:33.750 --> 02:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
quoting D thank you I I associate it
 
02:33:37.469 --> 02:33:37.479 align:start position:0%
quoting D it says um find D take off my
 
02:33:39.870 --> 02:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
glasses from nominations submitted by
 
02:33:42.590 --> 02:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
the education profession and interested
 
02:33:45.590 --> 02:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
persons so it's really kind of so the
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
State Board of Ed appoints but doesn't
 
02:33:50.030 --> 02:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
really give you the process of how that
 
02:33:54.830 --> 02:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
D so maybe that's just just a point of
 
02:33:57.670 --> 02:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
information thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:33:59.630 --> 02:33:59.640 align:start position:0%
uh see no further questions thank you
 
02:34:02.950 --> 02:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
very much for uh being here and your
 
02:34:06.429 --> 02:34:06.439 align:start position:0%
testimony um is there anyone else who
 
02:34:12.990 --> 02:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:17.550 --> 02:34:17.560 align:start position:0%
us yeah if I I may thank you um so uh I
 
02:34:18.830 --> 02:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
a really interesting and helpful
 
02:34:20.510 --> 02:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
conversation this suggestions that are
 
02:34:23.710 --> 02:34:23.720 align:start position:0%
made and um I will suggest to um the
 
02:34:25.469 --> 02:34:25.479 align:start position:0%
chair that he talk to the commissioner
 
02:34:27.309 --> 02:34:27.319 align:start position:0%
and I'll certainly call uh commissioner
 
02:34:29.790 --> 02:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
ad um because I I think the direction
 
02:34:32.670 --> 02:34:32.680 align:start position:0%
that you know both suggestions uh do
 
02:34:34.550 --> 02:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
make very good sense so let's see if we
 
02:34:37.309 --> 02:34:37.319 align:start position:0%
can can't get this worked out but thank
 
02:34:41.469 --> 02:34:41.479 align:start position:0%
you thank you and I I think that uh
 
02:34:46.230 --> 02:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
closes the hearing on uh Senate Bill 338
 
02:34:48.950 --> 02:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
and with with that we'll um break for
 
02:36:18.750 --> 02:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:18.760 --> 02:36:48.710 align:start position:0%

director SE and myself to to um uh to be
 
03:36:49.830 --> 03:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
able to amend this the current statute
 
03:36:53.750 --> 03:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
um regarding the able um uh Savings
 
03:36:56.830 --> 03:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
Program so
 
03:36:59.750 --> 03:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
um as you heard from Sarah Carson the
 
03:37:01.429 --> 03:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
primary purpose of this amendment is to
 
03:37:04.469 --> 03:37:04.479 align:start position:0%
create a nonlin dedicated account and is
 
03:37:07.990 --> 03:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to deposit a portion of a fee
 
03:37:11.349 --> 03:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
that gets charged to Able Savings Plan
 
03:37:15.309 --> 03:37:15.319 align:start position:0%
participants um so um just to um give
 
03:37:17.790 --> 03:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
you a little background um as you may
 
03:37:20.630 --> 03:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
recall the able savings account program
 
03:37:23.389 --> 03:37:23.399 align:start position:0%
allow individuals with disabilities to
 
03:37:25.790 --> 03:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
and their families to save for
 
03:37:28.790 --> 03:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
disability related expenses and those
 
03:37:31.870 --> 03:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
expenses uh and and those savings grow
 
03:37:34.790 --> 03:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
taxfree if they use it for for you know
 
03:37:36.990 --> 03:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
for that purpose to to help themselves
 
03:37:39.590 --> 03:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
in for disability uh related expenses
 
03:37:41.590 --> 03:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
and at the same time it helps them
 
03:37:45.910 --> 03:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
protect their uh Federal benefits so um
 
03:37:49.110 --> 03:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire uh launched the able
 
03:37:52.510 --> 03:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
program in New Hampshire in 2017 after
 
03:37:55.030 --> 03:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
the able until the achievement of better
 
03:37:57.950 --> 03:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
life experience Act of 2014 was enacted
 
03:38:01.030 --> 03:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
in uh at the feral level so uh at the
 
03:38:03.910 --> 03:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
time I pressor of the state treasur and
 
03:38:07.070 --> 03:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
executive Chua uh partnered with the
 
03:38:10.670 --> 03:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
state of Ohio to have um to to have a
 
03:38:13.990 --> 03:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
program in the state um so that was that
 
03:38:17.349 --> 03:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
lasted for about six years and um about
 
03:38:20.389 --> 03:38:20.399 align:start position:0%
2 years ago when it was time to uh renew
 
03:38:22.189 --> 03:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
that agreement and revisit that
 
03:38:25.710 --> 03:38:25.720 align:start position:0%
agreement uh we decided to uh terminate
 
03:38:27.670 --> 03:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
that relationship in join a New
 
03:38:30.070 --> 03:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
Consortium which is the national able
 
03:38:34.550 --> 03:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
Alliance um um executive um director CH
 
03:38:37.950 --> 03:38:37.960 align:start position:0%
and I decided that that was a better uh
 
03:38:40.950 --> 03:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
decision for the state at the time so uh
 
03:38:44.150 --> 03:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
with this new contract um we do have the
 
03:38:47.469 --> 03:38:47.479 align:start position:0%
ability to collect a small fee as we
 
03:38:49.990 --> 03:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned and so that uh so we need a
 
03:38:51.630 --> 03:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
place to deposit the money and that's
 
03:38:53.630 --> 03:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
really what this amendment is doing it's
 
03:38:56.150 --> 03:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
just creating um it will allow the
 
03:38:58.070 --> 03:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
creation of a dedicate account so when
 
03:39:00.389 --> 03:39:00.399 align:start position:0%
we receive those small dollars we're
 
03:39:03.630 --> 03:39:03.640 align:start position:0%
able to uh have a place to to to put
 
03:39:07.189 --> 03:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
them and to budget for that um so that
 
03:39:10.870 --> 03:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
in a you know um summary that's what uh
 
03:39:14.110 --> 03:39:14.120 align:start position:0%
this amendment is doing um I will
 
03:39:16.030 --> 03:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
probably turn it over to uh for
 
03:39:18.590 --> 03:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
additional sure comments and thank you
 
03:39:20.469 --> 03:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
uh State treasur Mell why don't you move
 
03:39:24.469 --> 03:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
the mic yeah absolutely thank you uh and
 
03:39:26.110 --> 03:39:26.120 align:start position:0%
again Mr chairman and members of this
 
03:39:27.590 --> 03:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
committee thank you again for having us
 
03:39:30.550 --> 03:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
here today um as Monica had pointed out
 
03:39:32.630 --> 03:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
we're looking at this as a housekeeping
 
03:39:34.309 --> 03:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
um you may remember and members of this
 
03:39:36.389 --> 03:39:36.399 align:start position:0%
committee who are who sat here back in
 
03:39:40.349 --> 03:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
2016 2015 that's when RSA 195k was
 
03:39:43.229 --> 03:39:43.239 align:start position:0%
passed which essentially brought uh able
 
03:39:45.229 --> 03:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
savings accounts um to the state of New
 
03:39:47.590 --> 03:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire after was there was 2014
 
03:39:50.630 --> 03:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
Federal legislation enacted um I will
 
03:39:52.870 --> 03:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
tell you able savings account are truly
 
03:39:55.030 --> 03:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
game changes and lifechanging for
 
03:39:56.830 --> 03:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities because
 
03:39:59.750 --> 03:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
individuals now have the opportunity to
 
03:40:01.750 --> 03:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
save money as a state treasurer has
 
03:40:04.150 --> 03:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
stated tax deferred and it doesn't
 
03:40:06.510 --> 03:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
affect their uh potential for benefits
 
03:40:08.750 --> 03:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
such as supplemental security income in
 
03:40:11.269 --> 03:40:11.279 align:start position:0%
Medicaid so it really was a truly a game
 
03:40:12.990 --> 03:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
changer so to have this program in the
 
03:40:15.670 --> 03:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire uh is wonderful
 
03:40:17.469 --> 03:40:17.479 align:start position:0%
um now that we have joined a New
 
03:40:19.870 --> 03:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
Consortium um which the enabling statute
 
03:40:22.269 --> 03:40:22.279 align:start position:0%
allows uh the state treasurer and I um
 
03:40:23.870 --> 03:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
have looked at it in order to clean it
 
03:40:26.150 --> 03:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
up because although the original statute
 
03:40:28.110 --> 03:40:28.120 align:start position:0%
states that no General funds shall be
 
03:40:30.429 --> 03:40:30.439 align:start position:0%
used uh to administer the program we now
 
03:40:32.670 --> 03:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to bring a bit of
 
03:40:34.830 --> 03:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
funds into the state um which the
 
03:40:36.950 --> 03:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
existing statute States but we just
 
03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to clean it up uh so that's
 
03:40:41.110 --> 03:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
essentially what we're looking to do and
 
03:40:42.790 --> 03:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
I think um the state treasur has said it
 
03:40:44.510 --> 03:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
very eloquently and we're more than
 
03:40:46.030 --> 03:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
03:40:47.150 --> 03:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
03:40:52.550 --> 03:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:56.189 --> 03:40:56.199 align:start position:0%
leus can you do me the favor of
 
03:41:00.750 --> 03:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
explaining how the able plan works when
 
03:41:04.150 --> 03:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
does it get paid in how much how does
 
03:41:07.110 --> 03:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
that work who pays it in who takes it
 
03:41:09.309 --> 03:41:09.319 align:start position:0%
out when all of that kind of stuff
 
03:41:12.429 --> 03:41:12.439 align:start position:0%
because I've heard of it but I don't
 
03:41:14.469 --> 03:41:14.479 align:start position:0%
understand exactly how it works thank
 
03:41:18.950 --> 03:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
you so so for
 
03:41:21.870 --> 03:41:21.880 align:start position:0%
um so I think you tried to I believe I'm
 
03:41:23.229 --> 03:41:23.239 align:start position:0%
not to try to answer your question
 
03:41:25.910 --> 03:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
related to this fund so not for this
 
03:41:28.870 --> 03:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
fund she talk related to the actual
 
03:41:31.030 --> 03:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
program this makes sense to me okay
 
03:41:32.990 --> 03:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
perfect I don't know how the program
 
03:41:35.950 --> 03:41:35.960 align:start position:0%
itself Works want to try to explain it
 
03:41:37.309 --> 03:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
by all means thank you for the question
 
03:41:39.550 --> 03:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
great question um and the state
 
03:41:41.950 --> 03:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
treasurer and I are are always uh
 
03:41:44.349 --> 03:41:44.359 align:start position:0%
entertaining questions like this because
 
03:41:46.189 --> 03:41:46.199 align:start position:0%
as a state we want to get the word out
 
03:41:48.110 --> 03:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
about these uh these accounts so
 
03:41:49.510 --> 03:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
essentially if you are an individual
 
03:41:52.830 --> 03:41:52.840 align:start position:0%
with a disability um you this person
 
03:41:54.189 --> 03:41:54.199 align:start position:0%
with a disability can open up the
 
03:41:56.349 --> 03:41:56.359 align:start position:0%
account in his or her own name there are
 
03:41:59.229 --> 03:41:59.239 align:start position:0%
a couple of um criteria the onset of the
 
03:42:03.309 --> 03:42:03.319 align:start position:0%
disability excuse me has to be by age 21
 
03:42:05.910 --> 03:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
and also there are other conditions uh
 
03:42:07.910 --> 03:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
essentially you have to be eligible the
 
03:42:09.710 --> 03:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
individual would have to be eligible to
 
03:42:12.870 --> 03:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
receive SSI or Medicaid supplement
 
03:42:14.670 --> 03:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
security income so those are the basic
 
03:42:16.750 --> 03:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
standards to up an account then the
 
03:42:19.070 --> 03:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
individual with the disability can
 
03:42:21.389 --> 03:42:21.399 align:start position:0%
contribute to his or her own account up
 
03:42:24.830 --> 03:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
to $188,000 a year uh that that that's a
 
03:42:27.110 --> 03:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
big deal because if you're if you're
 
03:42:29.870 --> 03:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
receiving benefits such as SSI or
 
03:42:31.670 --> 03:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid there's a threshold that's out
 
03:42:33.630 --> 03:42:33.640 align:start position:0%
there we hear the term $2,000
 
03:42:34.990 --> 03:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
essentially individuals with a
 
03:42:37.269 --> 03:42:37.279 align:start position:0%
disability can't have more than $2,000
 
03:42:39.189 --> 03:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
in assets because it could jeopardize
 
03:42:42.830 --> 03:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or SSI so in this situation the
 
03:42:44.830 --> 03:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
individual could contribute to his or
 
03:42:46.030 --> 03:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
her own
 
03:42:47.990 --> 03:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis calendar year up to
 
03:42:50.910 --> 03:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
18,000 or any family members and if the
 
03:42:52.510 --> 03:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
individual is
 
03:42:55.990 --> 03:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
working um that person can also uh
 
03:42:58.469 --> 03:42:58.479 align:start position:0%
contribute about another 14,000 a year
 
03:43:00.269 --> 03:43:00.279 align:start position:0%
so it brings it up to about 32,000 a
 
03:43:03.189 --> 03:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
year which is again I we you know State
 
03:43:05.389 --> 03:43:05.399 align:start position:0%
treasur and I use terms like GameChanger
 
03:43:07.110 --> 03:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
it is a GameChanger because when you
 
03:43:08.670 --> 03:43:08.680 align:start position:0%
look at it from the perspective of an
 
03:43:10.990 --> 03:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
individual who has a disability parents
 
03:43:13.149 --> 03:43:13.159 align:start position:0%
and family members were always and this
 
03:43:15.030 --> 03:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
is across the board not unique to New
 
03:43:16.670 --> 03:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire had to stay under that
 
03:43:20.149 --> 03:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
threshold the assets so and and then as
 
03:43:22.189 --> 03:43:22.199 align:start position:0%
importantly once the money is in the
 
03:43:23.910 --> 03:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
account and it's funded in all types of
 
03:43:25.870 --> 03:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
investment options you can choose a bank
 
03:43:27.710 --> 03:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
safe which is a traditional checking
 
03:43:30.309 --> 03:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
account with FDIC insured or you can
 
03:43:33.950 --> 03:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
choose various uh Investments portfolios
 
03:43:35.950 --> 03:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
uh from aggressive to lease aggressive
 
03:43:37.950 --> 03:43:37.960 align:start position:0%
you know whatever your tolerance is but
 
03:43:40.550 --> 03:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
then the expenses have to be paid they
 
03:43:43.349 --> 03:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
have to be related to the disability and
 
03:43:46.870 --> 03:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
they have to um uh iner to the benefit
 
03:43:49.149 --> 03:43:49.159 align:start position:0%
of quality of life so if an individual
 
03:43:51.670 --> 03:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
with a disability um has money in the
 
03:43:53.389 --> 03:43:53.399 align:start position:0%
account and now they want to spend that
 
03:43:55.389 --> 03:43:55.399 align:start position:0%
money on what we refer to as a qualified
 
03:43:58.389 --> 03:43:58.399 align:start position:0%
disability expense they can and again it
 
03:44:01.670 --> 03:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
won't jeopardize the Medicaid or the SSI
 
03:44:03.429 --> 03:44:03.439 align:start position:0%
qualified disability expense could be
 
03:44:05.309 --> 03:44:05.319 align:start position:0%
education could be
 
03:44:07.710 --> 03:44:07.720 align:start position:0%
Transportation um it really um basic
 
03:44:10.590 --> 03:44:10.600 align:start position:0%
living expenses so it runs the gamut um
 
03:44:13.510 --> 03:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
so that that's a very high level um
 
03:44:16.030 --> 03:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
State Treasurer and I uh we present
 
03:44:18.830 --> 03:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
often um across the state to to give uh
 
03:44:20.830 --> 03:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
to answer your your question exactly
 
03:44:23.189 --> 03:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
representative so I hope that helps out
 
03:44:25.510 --> 03:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
and it does very much thank you
 
03:44:25.520 --> 03:44:26.510 align:start position:0%
and it does very much thank you
represent

03:44:26.510 --> 03:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:44:28.630 --> 03:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chairman good
 
03:44:31.269 --> 03:44:31.279 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you for joining us um if
 
03:44:33.590 --> 03:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
I read this right you have
 
03:44:36.229 --> 03:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
104 uh participants now but your goal is
 
03:44:40.309 --> 03:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
a thousand s right I'm sorry I I'm sorry
 
03:44:42.389 --> 03:44:42.399 align:start position:0%
reading the docum you passed out yes get
 
03:44:45.309 --> 03:44:45.319 align:start position:0%
PS okay so 104 partici now so that's
 
03:44:48.630 --> 03:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
like $520 we're talking about here right
 
03:44:50.790 --> 03:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
okay the scheme of things here between
 
03:44:53.710 --> 03:44:53.720 align:start position:0%
the 34,000 and the 520 bucks um the
 
03:44:56.510 --> 03:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
second one is the
 
03:44:58.830 --> 03:44:58.840 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
03:45:01.510 --> 03:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
participant at some point they pass this
 
03:45:03.670 --> 03:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
is for an eternal right so if they stop
 
03:45:06.550 --> 03:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
before 21 then go until 67 80 90 years
 
03:45:09.630 --> 03:45:09.640 align:start position:0%
old is that the intent okay so when they
 
03:45:12.030 --> 03:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
pass away where's the balance of the
 
03:45:15.309 --> 03:45:15.319 align:start position:0%
funds go yeah did you like me are you
 
03:45:18.790 --> 03:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
can yeah probably
 
03:45:21.429 --> 03:45:21.439 align:start position:0%
you yeah another great question um
 
03:45:22.990 --> 03:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
because the individual with a disability
 
03:45:25.469 --> 03:45:25.479 align:start position:0%
is the owner of the account um you can
 
03:45:27.550 --> 03:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
only have one account that's just
 
03:45:29.710 --> 03:45:29.720 align:start position:0%
Nationwide it would go to the estate
 
03:45:32.149 --> 03:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
process so there's no beneficiary name
 
03:45:33.910 --> 03:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
that would actually receive it but again
 
03:45:36.349 --> 03:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
that's standard across the industry so
 
03:45:38.630 --> 03:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
okay I just okay perfect thank you so
 
03:45:40.710 --> 03:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
much thank you Mr chair you're welcome
 
03:45:42.590 --> 03:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
03:45:44.389 --> 03:45:44.399 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you and thank you for
 
03:45:46.349 --> 03:45:46.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question again referring to
 
03:45:49.990 --> 03:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
the handout that you gave um the annual
 
03:45:52.550 --> 03:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
account maintenance fee who receives
 
03:45:55.269 --> 03:45:55.279 align:start position:0%
that is that the the Ohio group or
 
03:45:57.349 --> 03:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
whatever yes thank you for the question
 
03:46:00.149 --> 03:46:00.159 align:start position:0%
so so we we we work uh so this program
 
03:46:02.349 --> 03:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
again we're part of a Consortium uh of
 
03:46:05.510 --> 03:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
19 state so um the the state of Illinoi
 
03:46:08.670 --> 03:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
actually leads um the group and they
 
03:46:11.670 --> 03:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
contracted with uh a program manager uh
 
03:46:14.429 --> 03:46:14.439 align:start position:0%
Miss sensus so as sensus is The Record
 
03:46:17.110 --> 03:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
Keeper and and the manager of the all of
 
03:46:18.790 --> 03:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
the program and then M chain the assets
 
03:46:21.590 --> 03:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
for all the accounts so um so so as
 
03:46:23.910 --> 03:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
sensus collects the fee from the
 
03:46:27.469 --> 03:46:27.479 align:start position:0%
individuals um and and they essentially
 
03:46:30.750 --> 03:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
they they handle the administration um
 
03:46:34.670 --> 03:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
of the program so um in terms of how
 
03:46:35.950 --> 03:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
this money is going to work they're
 
03:46:37.870 --> 03:46:37.880 align:start position:0%
going to they're going to assess it to
 
03:46:40.070 --> 03:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
the to the participant and it's going to
 
03:46:42.910 --> 03:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
be um you know they collect what they
 
03:46:45.309 --> 03:46:45.319 align:start position:0%
keep and then they send the small
 
03:46:47.469 --> 03:46:47.479 align:start position:0%
portion to all of the states so we will
 
03:46:49.630 --> 03:46:49.640 align:start position:0%
be receiving that on a quarterly basis
 
03:46:52.550 --> 03:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
after as has after that fee has been
 
03:46:55.950 --> 03:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
assessed did so they're sending you some
 
03:46:58.910 --> 03:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
maintenance fee back to you as well that
 
03:47:00.870 --> 03:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
is correct but you feel as though it's
 
03:47:02.670 --> 03:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
not enough and that's why you're
 
03:47:04.990 --> 03:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
assessing the extra $5 oh no we are not
 
03:47:07.309 --> 03:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
assessing that so so this is this is
 
03:47:09.670 --> 03:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
part of um essentially we enter into a
 
03:47:11.630 --> 03:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
contract that was already established
 
03:47:14.469 --> 03:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
that way so some states um collect that
 
03:47:14.479 --> 03:47:15.670 align:start position:0%
that way so some states um collect that
$5

03:47:15.670 --> 03:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
$5
 
03:47:19.189 --> 03:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
as well um some others use it to wave to
 
03:47:21.750 --> 03:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
to to reduce the fee for the
 
03:47:24.469 --> 03:47:24.479 align:start position:0%
participants um we we just chose to
 
03:47:25.590 --> 03:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
receive the
 
03:47:28.910 --> 03:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
$5 um knowing that it's only essentially
 
03:47:31.590 --> 03:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
Chuck and I who manage the the
 
03:47:33.269 --> 03:47:33.279 align:start position:0%
administration of you know this program
 
03:47:35.189 --> 03:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so we we thought that
 
03:47:38.590 --> 03:47:38.600 align:start position:0%
if we collected that uh $5 fee um will
 
03:47:40.309 --> 03:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
at least grow a little money to be able
 
03:47:42.550 --> 03:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
to continue to promote the program in
 
03:47:44.630 --> 03:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
the state you know similar to one of the
 
03:47:46.070 --> 03:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
things that we want to be able to do
 
03:47:49.149 --> 03:47:49.159 align:start position:0%
more is is is promote essentially the
 
03:47:52.469 --> 03:47:52.479 align:start position:0%
benefits of this program and and again
 
03:47:55.110 --> 03:47:55.120 align:start position:0%
as as we heard before it's not going to
 
03:47:57.469 --> 03:47:57.479 align:start position:0%
be a lot of money it's just going to be
 
03:47:59.189 --> 03:47:59.199 align:start position:0%
um just some in there that will get
 
03:48:00.830 --> 03:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
collected and you know hopefully we're
 
03:48:03.070 --> 03:48:03.080 align:start position:0%
able to utilize it for the promotion of
 
03:48:04.830 --> 03:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
the program for the benefit of this
 
03:48:07.229 --> 03:48:07.239 align:start position:0%
program you have a follow up on that yes
 
03:48:11.309 --> 03:48:11.319 align:start position:0%
go ahead so um once the partic I assume
 
03:48:13.269 --> 03:48:13.279 align:start position:0%
these are like health savings accounts
 
03:48:16.550 --> 03:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
basically um you know in a way yeah sure
 
03:48:19.550 --> 03:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
so um once the person puts money into
 
03:48:22.550 --> 03:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
that do they accruit interest or do they
 
03:48:25.269 --> 03:48:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh actually you said investing yes so so
 
03:48:27.110 --> 03:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
this this are savings accounts so these
 
03:48:28.790 --> 03:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
are individual it's similar it works
 
03:48:30.990 --> 03:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
similar to um the college Savings
 
03:48:33.389 --> 03:48:33.399 align:start position:0%
Program the fighting United plan their
 
03:48:35.790 --> 03:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
their sister programs that were designed
 
03:48:37.990 --> 03:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
um they all under the same Federal uh
 
03:48:41.229 --> 03:48:41.239 align:start position:0%
tax code so um so essentially the
 
03:48:44.469 --> 03:48:44.479 align:start position:0%
savings accounts when participants um
 
03:48:47.429 --> 03:48:47.439 align:start position:0%
the quality for this accounts um save
 
03:48:49.429 --> 03:48:49.439 align:start position:0%
their money on them then they can choose
 
03:48:52.429 --> 03:48:52.439 align:start position:0%
whether they want to um save it using
 
03:48:54.110 --> 03:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
the checking account option or the
 
03:48:56.510 --> 03:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
savings account option or they could
 
03:48:58.469 --> 03:48:58.479 align:start position:0%
choose to invest their money long term
 
03:49:01.990 --> 03:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
depending on how these individuals um
 
03:49:05.229 --> 03:49:05.239 align:start position:0%
you know their their own personal needs
 
03:49:07.070 --> 03:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
can't choose to either save for short
 
03:49:09.269 --> 03:49:09.279 align:start position:0%
term or long term if they want to use it
 
03:49:12.030 --> 03:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
to say for retirement I mean this is
 
03:49:14.030 --> 03:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
this is the benefit of this accounts
 
03:49:16.070 --> 03:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
there are a lot more flexible and is is
 
03:49:18.469 --> 03:49:18.479 align:start position:0%
is it is for the benefit of the um
 
03:49:20.830 --> 03:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
disability Community for example Savings
 
03:49:23.349 --> 03:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
Program is only to save for college so
 
03:49:25.790 --> 03:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
if you don't go to college then you now
 
03:49:26.990 --> 03:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
the at the federal level trying to
 
03:49:28.670 --> 03:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
figure out what else they can do with
 
03:49:31.950 --> 03:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
those funds this one is very flexible so
 
03:49:34.469 --> 03:49:34.479 align:start position:0%
uh individuals with disabilities have
 
03:49:37.469 --> 03:49:37.479 align:start position:0%
the ability to just use it uh for their
 
03:49:40.030 --> 03:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
own purposes to just um you know to have
 
03:49:43.670 --> 03:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
a better life uh while they essentially
 
03:49:46.429 --> 03:49:46.439 align:start position:0%
uh don't have to pay taxes if if they
 
03:49:48.469 --> 03:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
put their money in those accounts or
 
03:49:49.830 --> 03:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
they can use it for something else
 
03:49:51.790 --> 03:49:51.800 align:start position:0%
savings you know for for on the benefits
 
03:49:53.590 --> 03:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
so it's very flexible that's the benefit
 
03:49:54.469 --> 03:49:54.479 align:start position:0%
of this
 
03:49:58.750 --> 03:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
accounts if I want to open up a an able
 
03:50:01.790 --> 03:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
account do I go to Fidelity do I go to
 
03:50:03.750 --> 03:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
Wells Fargo advisors do I go across the
 
03:50:06.670 --> 03:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
street to Banger savings what do I do um
 
03:50:09.670 --> 03:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
to to the website so we have a so so
 
03:50:11.429 --> 03:50:11.439 align:start position:0%
with this change of program so we used
 
03:50:13.550 --> 03:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
to be part of the Ohio plan so we used
 
03:50:17.710 --> 03:50:17.720 align:start position:0%
to be called stable New Hampshire plan
 
03:50:21.229 --> 03:50:21.239 align:start position:0%
now our name for this this this program
 
03:50:22.670 --> 03:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
sponsored by the state of New Hampshire
 
03:50:25.590 --> 03:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
is called the New Hampshire able plan so
 
03:50:27.790 --> 03:50:27.800 align:start position:0%
there is a website um and it's
 
03:50:29.870 --> 03:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
essentially what we need to promote more
 
03:50:31.830 --> 03:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
and I don't have the the link but
 
03:50:33.830 --> 03:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
there's a website for this program the
 
03:50:37.189 --> 03:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire able plan and that's how
 
03:50:39.590 --> 03:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
um um you know essentially anyone can
 
03:50:42.030 --> 03:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
enroll and open an account that way
 
03:50:44.389 --> 03:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of um different um ways
 
03:50:47.149 --> 03:50:47.159 align:start position:0%
to do it whether I think there's a I
 
03:50:49.349 --> 03:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
think mainly as to this the enrollment
 
03:50:53.309 --> 03:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
formats online right um and if I may Mr
 
03:50:56.269 --> 03:50:56.279 align:start position:0%
chair actually if you go to nh.gov uh
 
03:50:58.389 --> 03:50:58.399 align:start position:0%
right on the landing page at the bottom
 
03:51:00.910 --> 03:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
there there are a few tabs the NH aable
 
03:51:03.349 --> 03:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
plan is one of them right on nh.gov if
 
03:51:05.309 --> 03:51:05.319 align:start position:0%
you were to visit the state treasurer's
 
03:51:07.030 --> 03:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
website the treasury or the governor's
 
03:51:08.870 --> 03:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
Commission on disability we also have
 
03:51:10.830 --> 03:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
links right there uh which will direct
 
03:51:12.830 --> 03:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
the individual how to enroll it's
 
03:51:15.389 --> 03:51:15.399 align:start position:0%
typically done online um but there is
 
03:51:18.349 --> 03:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
paper options also there is no um brick
 
03:51:19.870 --> 03:51:19.880 align:start position:0%
and water so to speak in the state of
 
03:51:21.670 --> 03:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire be because we are part of
 
03:51:24.189 --> 03:51:24.199 align:start position:0%
this Consortium of 19
 
03:51:26.630 --> 03:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
States so just to follow up and then
 
03:51:30.149 --> 03:51:30.159 align:start position:0%
represent Dr um if I wanted to open up a
 
03:51:33.870 --> 03:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
unique program which is for
 
03:51:36.950 --> 03:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
education or in my case I have it with
 
03:51:39.030 --> 03:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
the Virginia plan which through American
 
03:51:41.790 --> 03:51:41.800 align:start position:0%
Funds but I do that through like a
 
03:51:44.990 --> 03:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
Fidelity or through U American Funds or
 
03:51:47.870 --> 03:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
through you know Wells Fargo you mean in
 
03:51:50.349 --> 03:51:50.359 align:start position:0%
order to open up the able account here
 
03:51:52.830 --> 03:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have to go that's the only
 
03:51:54.990 --> 03:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
place where I can get at this is through
 
03:51:59.110 --> 03:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
the web I can't go to you know uh um
 
03:52:00.670 --> 03:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
some kind of a mutual fund or something
 
03:52:02.870 --> 03:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
and and select
 
03:52:05.510 --> 03:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
it that is correct so the so the only
 
03:52:08.389 --> 03:52:08.399 align:start position:0%
place is is through our our um landing
 
03:52:11.550 --> 03:52:11.560 align:start position:0%
page is the dis aable New Hampshire plan
 
03:52:13.550 --> 03:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
and as sensus again as sensus is a
 
03:52:16.510 --> 03:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
company um the manages the plan what
 
03:52:19.269 --> 03:52:19.279 align:start position:0%
what the difference between for example
 
03:52:21.830 --> 03:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm obviously we our college savs
 
03:52:23.269 --> 03:52:23.279 align:start position:0%
program we have our contract with
 
03:52:26.469 --> 03:52:26.479 align:start position:0%
Fidelity so Fidelity uses uh Fidelity
 
03:52:30.229 --> 03:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
funds only um the differ so so so the EO
 
03:52:33.110 --> 03:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
plan is different because a census is
 
03:52:35.469 --> 03:52:35.479 align:start position:0%
The Record Keeper it's just um it's just
 
03:52:38.510 --> 03:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
the company that manages the program but
 
03:52:40.950 --> 03:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
the but the plan that the national able
 
03:52:45.030 --> 03:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
Alliance has chosen to use different um
 
03:52:48.710 --> 03:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
portfolio manager so they have Vanguard
 
03:52:51.910 --> 03:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
portfolios or um there's the that I
 
03:52:55.269 --> 03:52:55.279 align:start position:0%
believe the um um Sally May is the
 
03:52:57.910 --> 03:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
savings account the fdac insure savings
 
03:53:00.429 --> 03:53:00.439 align:start position:0%
account is a Sally May so um they have a
 
03:53:02.710 --> 03:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
committee the national ail Alliance uh
 
03:53:05.429 --> 03:53:05.439 align:start position:0%
has a committee that decides what port
 
03:53:07.910 --> 03:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
what portfolios should be included or be
 
03:53:12.030 --> 03:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
part of this plan so again um with with
 
03:53:14.510 --> 03:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we we our landing page is
 
03:53:18.030 --> 03:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
is is that uh that's really the place to
 
03:53:20.710 --> 03:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
enroll uh for these accounts so it
 
03:53:23.030 --> 03:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
functions a little bit different yeah
 
03:53:25.229 --> 03:53:25.239 align:start position:0%
gon dry thank you and thank you for
 
03:53:28.149 --> 03:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question so if you are doing
 
03:53:31.870 --> 03:53:31.880 align:start position:0%
okay advertising this with $520 if the
 
03:53:34.790 --> 03:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
program grows is your your advertising
 
03:53:37.510 --> 03:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
budget going to grow or will you outgrow
 
03:53:40.550 --> 03:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
it maybe so this is the only source of
 
03:53:42.750 --> 03:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
funds that we will have again the law
 
03:53:46.229 --> 03:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
was was is restricting our ability
 
03:53:49.750 --> 03:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
to um have more funds so this is the
 
03:53:52.030 --> 03:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
only other extra income so obviously we
 
03:53:53.790 --> 03:53:53.800 align:start position:0%
you know again Chuck and I we've been
 
03:53:56.830 --> 03:53:56.840 align:start position:0%
leveraging uh and working with uh in the
 
03:53:58.750 --> 03:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
past it was Ohio doing most of the work
 
03:54:01.870 --> 03:54:01.880 align:start position:0%
so we we we we we are the ones that go
 
03:54:04.590 --> 03:54:04.600 align:start position:0%
and and do presentations to various uh
 
03:54:08.189 --> 03:54:08.199 align:start position:0%
disability groups so we we you know we
 
03:54:10.189 --> 03:54:10.199 align:start position:0%
try to bring our folks with us from our
 
03:54:12.389 --> 03:54:12.399 align:start position:0%
offices but this will allow us to have
 
03:54:14.349 --> 03:54:14.359 align:start position:0%
just a little bit more to perhaps pay
 
03:54:16.830 --> 03:54:16.840 align:start position:0%
for a little bit of you know a promotion
 
03:54:19.070 --> 03:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
advertising or anything else so um in
 
03:54:21.750 --> 03:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
terms of growing more it you if the if
 
03:54:23.590 --> 03:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
the accounts if you know if we're able
 
03:54:25.870 --> 03:54:25.880 align:start position:0%
to promote this plan to absolutely every
 
03:54:29.389 --> 03:54:29.399 align:start position:0%
single eligible person in the state yes
 
03:54:31.710 --> 03:54:31.720 align:start position:0%
our accounts should grow and the funding
 
03:54:33.429 --> 03:54:33.439 align:start position:0%
should grow as well until we figure
 
03:54:36.030 --> 03:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
something else uh you know what else how
 
03:54:37.389 --> 03:54:37.399 align:start position:0%
how you know if there's another way to
 
03:54:39.670 --> 03:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
grow our budget but as of right now this
 
03:54:42.910 --> 03:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
will be again um we'll go from zero to
 
03:54:45.189 --> 03:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
having a little more
 
03:54:47.670 --> 03:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock thank you chairman
 
03:54:49.349 --> 03:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
just a clarification fall up and
 
03:54:51.469 --> 03:54:51.479 align:start position:0%
represent D's question so I'm looking
 
03:54:55.070 --> 03:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
now I'm looking at um at the in the bill
 
03:54:58.229 --> 03:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
lines oh first one premise this this
 
03:55:00.790 --> 03:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
bill um strikes out the general fund
 
03:55:02.149 --> 03:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
meaning the state general fund right the
 
03:55:04.149 --> 03:55:04.159 align:start position:0%
state money okay so there no State
 
03:55:06.710 --> 03:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
monies in that um and it's in the bill
 
03:55:07.950 --> 03:55:07.960 align:start position:0%
is changed the name to make it New
 
03:55:10.389 --> 03:55:10.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire able versus your H piece but
 
03:55:13.070 --> 03:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
when I go down to 24 25
 
03:55:15.590 --> 03:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
26 um wondering if I'm understanding
 
03:55:17.149 --> 03:55:17.159 align:start position:0%
this correctly because initially I was
 
03:55:19.670 --> 03:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
thinking uh as some may have been well
 
03:55:21.830 --> 03:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
it's only 520 bucks it's just it's like
 
03:55:23.630 --> 03:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
a contra he a buck to retain a lawyer
 
03:55:25.349 --> 03:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
right type thing but then I'm looking at
 
03:55:28.229 --> 03:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
three and four and do is this correctly
 
03:55:29.550 --> 03:55:29.560 align:start position:0%
the money that you solicit through
 
03:55:31.990 --> 03:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
promotion the GI else that also goes to
 
03:55:33.710 --> 03:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
help pay for the administrative fund so
 
03:55:36.229 --> 03:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
it's not $500 it's really any money you
 
03:55:37.750 --> 03:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
collect in addition to that from other
 
03:55:39.229 --> 03:55:39.239 align:start position:0%
from other uh
 
03:55:41.950 --> 03:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
means that that is correct if we're able
 
03:55:45.790 --> 03:55:45.800 align:start position:0%
to request grants uh or or or gifts we
 
03:55:47.630 --> 03:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
will be adding those funds to that so
 
03:55:50.030 --> 03:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
that right this this language and this
 
03:55:52.630 --> 03:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
change will um will allow us to do that
 
03:55:57.389 --> 03:55:57.399 align:start position:0%
thanks fa chair further questions is all
 
03:56:00.590 --> 03:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
this money that various people are
 
03:56:03.389 --> 03:56:03.399 align:start position:0%
contributing is it comingled together or
 
03:56:05.229 --> 03:56:05.239 align:start position:0%
is it all together and the interest how
 
03:56:08.469 --> 03:56:08.479 align:start position:0%
do you develop you know you separate the
 
03:56:10.469 --> 03:56:10.479 align:start position:0%
interest when a person wants to take
 
03:56:13.269 --> 03:56:13.279 align:start position:0%
some money out to buy something that's
 
03:56:15.670 --> 03:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
eligible under the criteria that you've
 
03:56:18.830 --> 03:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
listed how do they how do you proportion
 
03:56:20.950 --> 03:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
out that interest yeah no that that's
 
03:56:23.309 --> 03:56:23.319 align:start position:0%
what they do The Record Keeper um does
 
03:56:25.510 --> 03:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
that census does that maintain separate
 
03:56:27.910 --> 03:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
accounts is by law that needs to um they
 
03:56:29.550 --> 03:56:29.560 align:start position:0%
need to have separate accounts because
 
03:56:32.670 --> 03:56:32.680 align:start position:0%
they all have tax tax consequences so
 
03:56:35.630 --> 03:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
they are you know every individual um
 
03:56:39.070 --> 03:56:39.080 align:start position:0%
has a separate account and um as a whole
 
03:56:40.189 --> 03:56:40.199 align:start position:0%
we you
 
03:56:42.469 --> 03:56:42.479 align:start position:0%
know they are commingle because they're
 
03:56:44.469 --> 03:56:44.479 align:start position:0%
tracking New Hampshire's accounts for
 
03:56:49.550 --> 03:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
example but um um in um there is a trust
 
03:56:52.030 --> 03:56:52.040 align:start position:0%
the funds need to be in a trust and they
 
03:56:54.030 --> 03:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
all going and they all essentially sub
 
03:56:57.349 --> 03:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
trust for each fund for each state each
 
03:57:00.750 --> 03:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
state has a sub Trust of this one called
 
03:57:03.590 --> 03:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
trust if that makes sense sounds like
 
03:57:05.710 --> 03:57:05.720 align:start position:0%
Mary Guile's old Bill remember that
 
03:57:08.790 --> 03:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
folks yeah in education um further
 
03:57:09.870 --> 03:57:09.880 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
 
03:57:12.269 --> 03:57:12.279 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner thank you I
 
03:57:15.030 --> 03:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
just how come this is an education
 
03:57:16.710 --> 03:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
rather than like Health and Human
 
03:57:16.720 --> 03:57:17.950 align:start position:0%
rather than like Health and Human
Services

03:57:17.950 --> 03:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
Services
 
03:57:21.429 --> 03:57:21.439 align:start position:0%
or what's the connection with education
 
03:57:25.790 --> 03:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
I think if I may and I could be wrong um
 
03:57:28.269 --> 03:57:28.279 align:start position:0%
I think it's where 19 where the bill was
 
03:57:30.189 --> 03:57:30.199 align:start position:0%
originally placed what
 
03:57:33.309 --> 03:57:33.319 align:start position:0%
195k it falls under education but I
 
03:57:35.189 --> 03:57:35.199 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
03:57:39.510 --> 03:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay wheelchair so if I want to buy a
 
03:57:41.950 --> 03:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
new car and I need to get all the
 
03:57:41.960 --> 03:57:43.309 align:start position:0%
new car and I need to get all the
handicap

03:57:43.309 --> 03:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
handicap
 
03:57:45.710 --> 03:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
associated equipment in that car I could
 
03:57:49.950 --> 03:57:49.960 align:start position:0%
use this fund to do that well yeah it
 
03:57:51.269 --> 03:57:51.279 align:start position:0%
again it would have to pass what we
 
03:57:53.870 --> 03:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
refer to as Mr chair uh the two prong
 
03:57:56.590 --> 03:57:56.600 align:start position:0%
test is what you're looking to do
 
03:57:58.950 --> 03:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
related to the disability based upon
 
03:58:01.550 --> 03:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
what you said it would be and the second
 
03:58:04.309 --> 03:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
part of the two-prong test does it look
 
03:58:06.830 --> 03:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
to benefit health and Independence and
 
03:58:08.349 --> 03:58:08.359 align:start position:0%
quality of life for the individual with
 
03:58:11.750 --> 03:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
a disability I would say yes yeah it's
 
03:58:14.030 --> 03:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
very broad application yeah yeah which
 
03:58:15.990 --> 03:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
which is a good thing yeah yeah yeah
 
03:58:18.910 --> 03:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock La last comment Mr
 
03:58:21.030 --> 03:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
last question so I just want to CU the
 
03:58:22.750 --> 03:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
numbers keep on keep on looking at these
 
03:58:25.429 --> 03:58:25.439 align:start position:0%
numbers um so if I understand the
 
03:58:27.870 --> 03:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
capacity here if the capacity was
 
03:58:30.950 --> 03:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
34,000 between the work and the 18,000
 
03:58:33.030 --> 03:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
donation and you're looking
 
03:58:36.750 --> 03:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
at goal initial goal is a th000 uh
 
03:58:39.590 --> 03:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
clients participants annually so you're
 
03:58:40.990 --> 03:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
basically talking about a potential of
 
03:58:43.349 --> 03:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
$34 million per year funding is that
 
03:58:43.359 --> 03:58:45.030 align:start position:0%
$34 million per year funding is that
right

03:58:45.030 --> 03:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:58:47.990 --> 03:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
think so I don't believe so so so right
 
03:58:51.070 --> 03:58:51.080 align:start position:0%
now is my math wrong it's modern math
 
03:58:54.429 --> 03:58:54.439 align:start position:0%
yeah no no no no no no Hightech
 
03:58:56.910 --> 03:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
man that that can be my problem is that
 
03:58:59.630 --> 03:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
right the 34,000 I think you need to
 
03:59:02.710 --> 03:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
share your tips on your math it might be
 
03:59:04.630 --> 03:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
helpful for other
 
03:59:08.269 --> 03:59:08.279 align:start position:0%
purposes um no I think um just to
 
03:59:11.429 --> 03:59:11.439 align:start position:0%
clarify we don't ever expect um that
 
03:59:13.830 --> 03:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
much money um so for example to give you
 
03:59:16.149 --> 03:59:16.159 align:start position:0%
an example this is what we we we I think
 
03:59:18.070 --> 03:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
we mentioned it as well maybe I wasn't I
 
03:59:20.550 --> 03:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear enough but for example with
 
03:59:25.110 --> 03:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
um with the stable um account program um
 
03:59:27.429 --> 03:59:27.439 align:start position:0%
right now because those accounts stay
 
03:59:29.870 --> 03:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
there uh we couldn't we couldn't
 
03:59:31.590 --> 03:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
transfer those accounts and Hampshire
 
03:59:34.349 --> 03:59:34.359 align:start position:0%
accounts to this new program so um over
 
03:59:38.710 --> 03:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
the course of um six years a thousand
 
03:59:42.870 --> 03:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
accounts um became part of that program
 
03:59:45.189 --> 03:59:45.199 align:start position:0%
so those folks are there and until we
 
03:59:48.830 --> 03:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
they either choose to change or um you
 
03:59:50.389 --> 03:59:50.399 align:start position:0%
know we continue to promote the fact
 
03:59:52.710 --> 03:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
that we have a new SP New Hampshire
 
03:59:55.269 --> 03:59:55.279 align:start position:0%
sponsor plan but so so just to give you
 
03:59:58.910 --> 03:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
an example when we when we uh we were
 
04:00:00.870 --> 04:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
looking at the number of accounts uh
 
04:00:03.870 --> 04:00:03.880 align:start position:0%
Chuck and I when we um provided
 
04:00:06.189 --> 04:00:06.199 align:start position:0%
testimony to the Senate we had because
 
04:00:10.110 --> 04:00:10.120 align:start position:0%
it was a brand new plan we had uh 14
 
04:00:12.630 --> 04:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
accounts and today we check the numbers
 
04:00:15.429 --> 04:00:15.439 align:start position:0%
and we have 104 accounts so we expect
 
04:00:18.990 --> 04:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
that this as again as this um program
 
04:00:22.269 --> 04:00:22.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's is gets more known and and and
 
04:00:25.429 --> 04:00:25.439 align:start position:0%
so we expect to to add more accounts but
 
04:00:29.110 --> 04:00:29.120 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be um no what would you say
 
04:00:32.189 --> 04:00:32.199 align:start position:0%
is is the number the eligible
 
04:00:33.910 --> 04:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
individuals in New Hampshire see we
 
04:00:35.469 --> 04:00:35.479 align:start position:0%
don't have a direct figure with that
 
04:00:38.550 --> 04:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
Monica so roughly there's a $1.3 million
 
04:00:38.560 --> 04:00:39.710 align:start position:0%
Monica so roughly there's a $1.3 million
um

04:00:39.710 --> 04:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:42.030 --> 04:00:42.040 align:start position:0%
1.3 that that's the residency of New
 
04:00:44.229 --> 04:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but that's our population and
 
04:00:46.429 --> 04:00:46.439 align:start position:0%
roughly one in8 individuals per the
 
04:00:48.990 --> 04:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
institute on disability report having a
 
04:00:50.670 --> 04:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
disability so it's like one in8 so we
 
04:00:52.590 --> 04:00:52.600 align:start position:0%
have about
 
04:00:56.149 --> 04:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
173,000 individuals per per the census
 
04:00:58.910 --> 04:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
per the IOD Institute on disability that
 
04:01:00.389 --> 04:01:00.399 align:start position:0%
states it's an individual with a
 
04:01:03.110 --> 04:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
disability whether or not they meet the
 
04:01:05.750 --> 04:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
criteria of onset of disability by age
 
04:01:08.990 --> 04:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
21 we can't determine that we but again
 
04:01:11.149 --> 04:01:11.159 align:start position:0%
that's that's the total population of of
 
04:01:13.110 --> 04:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
an individual with a disability
 
04:01:17.670 --> 04:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
173,000 um I I think and if I may so we
 
04:01:19.830 --> 04:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
again I know these are great questions
 
04:01:22.630 --> 04:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
and so when we first launched the
 
04:01:24.750 --> 04:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
program so that would have been in
 
04:01:27.469 --> 04:01:27.479 align:start position:0%
2017 um as a state treasur as as stated
 
04:01:29.670 --> 04:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
we were with the state of Ohio and the
 
04:01:33.910 --> 04:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
program then was known as stable NH um
 
04:01:37.750 --> 04:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
this past October the uh cont we decided
 
04:01:40.030 --> 04:01:40.040 align:start position:0%
State treasur and I heard the statute we
 
04:01:41.550 --> 04:01:41.560 align:start position:0%
we looked at other programs we vetted
 
04:01:42.590 --> 04:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
them out across the country and we
 
04:01:44.550 --> 04:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
decided to join a new platform
 
04:01:48.389 --> 04:01:48.399 align:start position:0%
right now there are roughly I would say
 
04:01:52.349 --> 04:01:52.359 align:start position:0%
just over a thousand accounts that are
 
04:01:54.710 --> 04:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
remain with the state of Ohio because
 
04:01:57.429 --> 04:01:57.439 align:start position:0%
they had joined state of Ohio either
 
04:02:00.510 --> 04:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
back in 2016 or 2017 when we launched
 
04:02:02.670 --> 04:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
but now New Hampshire has chosen a new
 
04:02:04.309 --> 04:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
platform and that's where we have the
 
04:02:08.950 --> 04:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
104 so essentially from 17 to say this
 
04:02:11.389 --> 04:02:11.399 align:start position:0%
past October we got to that thousand
 
04:02:13.469 --> 04:02:13.479 align:start position:0%
accounts and now we're whether or not
 
04:02:15.750 --> 04:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
they roll over that that's up to them I
 
04:02:18.510 --> 04:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
mean Ohio is a solid program um but this
 
04:02:20.389 --> 04:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
is the new program in New Hampshire so I
 
04:02:21.790 --> 04:02:21.800 align:start position:0%
think I don't know if that helps out
 
04:02:25.149 --> 04:02:25.159 align:start position:0%
representative we we're not we anticip
 
04:02:26.990 --> 04:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
we needed a vehicle when I say we State
 
04:02:28.229 --> 04:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
treasur and governance Commission on
 
04:02:30.469 --> 04:02:30.479 align:start position:0%
disability needed a vehicle to now
 
04:02:34.950 --> 04:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
accept this $5 fee annually um per
 
04:02:37.469 --> 04:02:37.479 align:start position:0%
account it is annually per account and I
 
04:02:39.830 --> 04:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
I think I mean it will be um I think
 
04:02:42.710 --> 04:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
what we hope and anticipate is perhaps
 
04:02:45.229 --> 04:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
if if the plan land grows to another a
 
04:02:47.189 --> 04:02:47.199 align:start position:0%
th000 accounts so we are able to collect
 
04:02:50.070 --> 04:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
about $5,000 per year that would be you
 
04:02:52.309 --> 04:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
know what we are
 
04:02:54.710 --> 04:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
anticipating but the account value the
 
04:02:57.229 --> 04:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
the account value goes up sure
 
04:02:59.990 --> 04:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
depending what that's right the 34,000
 
04:03:02.550 --> 04:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
is with working in the contribution the
 
04:03:05.110 --> 04:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
18 plus the 14 that's right I appreciate
 
04:03:08.229 --> 04:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
the program and thank you for the ANW I
 
04:03:09.630 --> 04:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
understand this is brand new so we're
 
04:03:11.990 --> 04:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
we're thank you Mr chair love questions
 
04:03:13.550 --> 04:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
 
04:03:13.560 --> 04:03:15.630 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
committee
