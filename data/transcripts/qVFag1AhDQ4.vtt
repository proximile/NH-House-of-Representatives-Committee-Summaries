00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
welcome to the full committee work
 
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 639
 
00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 align:start position:0%
Weir will not be taking public testimony
 
00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 align:start position:0%
today however we have invited the
 
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
experts in the agencies to be here with
 
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 align:start position:0%
us in case we have technical questions
 
00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 align:start position:0%
so thank you for being here
 
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
uh so we're going to focus really on
 
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
just this bill today and our goal is no
 
00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 align:start position:0%
matter how long it takes today we're
 
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 align:start position:0%
going to figure out what possible types
 
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
of amendments we might have on this bill
 
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 align:start position:0%
our plan is to exec this next Monday
 
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 align:start position:0%
March 27th because we'll be up against
 
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 align:start position:0%
deadline so of course we want to make
 
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 align:start position:0%
sure we spend all the time we need this
 
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 align:start position:0%
week to make sure our amendments are
 
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 align:start position:0%
typographically correct and do what we
 
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 align:start position:0%
intend them to do
 
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 align:start position:0%
so we talked about the fact that we're
 
00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 align:start position:0%
going to be focusing on the the revenue
 
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 align:start position:0%
aspects of this bill and not the
 
00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 align:start position:0%
underlying policy
 
00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 align:start position:0%
because that's already been addressed by
 
00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
another committee
 
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
one there's several key things we wanted
 
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 align:start position:0%
to talk about today but of course
 
00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
probably the biggest one is the tax rate
 
00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 align:start position:0%
because that is definitely in our
 
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
purview so I'd like to start focusing on
 
00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
that conversation and then of course we
 
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 align:start position:0%
have to have a conversation about well
 
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
where does the money go and then of
 
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
course we have to have a conversation
 
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
about the housekeeping type of
 
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
Corrections that need to be done that
 
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
have been pointed out
 
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll open it up to the
 
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
committee to talk about the tax rate
 
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
I thought we'd be listening to the
 
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
agencies first the agencies don't have a
 
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 align:start position:0%
position on this they are here to answer
 
00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 align:start position:0%
any technical questions you have or
 
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
informational questions you have but
 
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
they did put certain things that are
 
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
kind of positions in the
 
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note that we have
 
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
we can certainly bring whoever you want
 
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
up just let me know who well
 
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 align:start position:0%
all right so representative almie's
 
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:51.949 align:start position:0%
 
oops

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 align:start position:0%
while we're waiting I just wanted to
 
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
remind everyone that our deadline our
 
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
crossover is April 6th so plan to be
 
00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 align:start position:0%
busy until through April 6. I am
 
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
personally planning to not schedule
 
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
anything the week the next week the week
 
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
of April 10th
 
00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
so that all of you including myself can
 
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
get a little r r so that's kind of our
 
00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 align:start position:0%
vacation week before we have to start
 
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
attacking uh the Senate bills that come
 
00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:41.090 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.890 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
this one we got plenty extras on that
 
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 align:start position:0%
side it looks like
 
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.249 align:start position:0%
side it looks like
on

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
I have a real problem with a cultivator
 
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.590 align:start position:0%
I have a real problem with a cultivator
tax

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
the people that are going to be deciding
 
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
what prices
 
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
the cultivators get it's going to be
 
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 align:start position:0%
between large
 
00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 align:start position:0%
agribusiness firms from that are
 
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
probably from outside the state that are
 
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 align:start position:0%
going to come in and stick up green hat
 
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 align:start position:0%
large greenhouses
 
00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 align:start position:0%
it's too expensive
 
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
for most farmers
 
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
if you grow outside on you have a great
 
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
deal of problem with droughts with
 
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
floods with insects and viruses
 
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
and it damages the quality of your crop
 
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.529 align:start position:0%
and it damages the quality of your crop
and

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 align:start position:0%
and the Liquor Commission is going to
 
00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 align:start position:0%
have to do a lot more testing
 
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
it seems to me in order to guarantee
 
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
on the what outside cultivation gets
 
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
done I know there was one
 
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
person that came at the hearing who
 
00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 align:start position:0%
is a farmer and is growing hemp and
 
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
thinks that he can handle this
 
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.330 align:start position:0%
thinks that he can handle this
um

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.469 align:start position:0%
um
but

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
the Farm Bureau and the farmers around
 
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
the state that they consulted with I'll
 
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
say they want no part of it
 
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
of marijuana cultivation because it's
 
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
going to be taken over by large
 
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
out-of-state on Farm
 
00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139 align:start position:0%
on agribusinesses
 
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
and that they won't be able to compete
 
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 align:start position:0%
with them
 
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.670 align:start position:0%
with them
so

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
they did not want to come here to
 
00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 align:start position:0%
testify to that they said we're just
 
00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:50.819 align:start position:0%
staying away from the whole thing
 
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
I spent a lot of time getting a hold of
 
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
the head of the Farm Bureau who didn't
 
00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
want to talk to me about it and then
 
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
talking to him so
 
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.969 align:start position:0%
talking to him so
um

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:01.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:05.390 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
I did want to go back to something like
 
00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:12.539 align:start position:0%
the meals and rooms tax but I'm not sure
 
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 align:start position:0%
um what I have here is a hybrid
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
in the tobacco tax we have a secondary
 
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:24.300 align:start position:0%
tax which is collected in and um
 
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
and rate uh the rates are very different
 
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
from the rest of the tobacco tax which
 
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
is on on Vape
 
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
vaping products
 
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
and I felt that we could
 
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:48.060 align:start position:0%
easily treat this as a hybrid between
 
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
that and the rooms in males text that is
 
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
collected like the rooms in males tax
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
from the retailers
 
00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.730 align:start position:0%
from the retailers
um

00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:01.580 align:start position:0%
but on
 
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
regard it as
 
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
as an offshoot of the tobacco tax
 
00:08:09.249 --> 00:08:09.259 align:start position:0%
because it is a smoking
 
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
usually a smoking uh
 
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
device and the tobacco tax itself
 
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
contains things that you don't smoke you
 
00:08:20.809 --> 00:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
just stick behind your upper lip or
 
00:08:20.819 --> 00:08:21.890 align:start position:0%
just stick behind your upper lip or
or

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.869 align:start position:0%
or
uh

00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:23.879 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
or do something like that uh
 
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.689 align:start position:0%
or do something like that uh
so

00:08:29.689 --> 00:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
what I've got most of this document is
 
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
is a list of all of the states according
 
00:08:39.889 --> 00:08:39.899 align:start position:0%
to ncsl in February
 
00:08:39.899 --> 00:08:41.149 align:start position:0%
to ncsl in February
of

00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
um that have passed
 
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
uh marijuana
 
00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:50.930 align:start position:0%
uh marijuana
taxation

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
not not just legalization some of them
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
um are still in the process of
 
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.030 align:start position:0%
um are still in the process of
of

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:04.019 align:start position:0%
setting it up
 
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:07.140 align:start position:0%
so that they aren't terribly useful to
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
us in terms of of uh
 
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
how they're doing with the tax that
 
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
they're putting on but this is not just
 
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
the tax that they usually put out this
 
00:09:23.449 --> 00:09:23.459 align:start position:0%
is that Tax Plus any sales tax is excise
 
00:09:23.459 --> 00:09:25.090 align:start position:0%
is that Tax Plus any sales tax is excise
taxes

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:25.100 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
cultivator taxes there are
 
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
are two that are taxing at the
 
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
cultivator level not one I think not one
 
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:38.580 align:start position:0%
um Illinois
 
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
does both gross does growth receipts on
 
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.810 align:start position:0%
does both gross does growth receipts on
the

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
on the grower
 
00:09:49.009 --> 00:09:49.019 align:start position:0%
and sales taxes
 
00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:51.180 align:start position:0%
on the consumer
 
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.090 align:start position:0%
on the consumer
on

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:57.899 align:start position:0%
what I tried to do was put together as
 
00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:00.839 align:start position:0%
much of as that as I could a lot of them
 
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
have local sales taxes that also apply
 
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
and you don't know whether that sales
 
00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
tax is going to play certain places can
 
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
be zero or it's going to be 25 percent
 
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
so I just said or and local sales taxes
 
00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:20.660 align:start position:0%
New Jersey just passed something in 2020
 
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
on I don't think it's working yet
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
their sales their state sales tax is
 
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
only 6.6 percent
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
they say the locals can tax up to two
 
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
percent that's the only one that put a
 
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
cap on it
 
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.590 align:start position:0%
cap on it
um

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
and Vermont
 
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
made theirs their marijuana consumption
 
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.090 align:start position:0%
made theirs their marijuana consumption
legal

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
legal
 
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:50.700 align:start position:0%
but the sales part of it was only passed
 
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
in 2020.
 
00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:56.700 align:start position:0%
so that's still very preliminary in what
 
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
kinds of
 
00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:00.839 align:start position:0%
uh success that they're having with
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
attacks which is really 20.8 percent
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
when you finish adding up things
 
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
plus whatever local sales tax I haven't
 
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
run into a local sales tax in Vermont
 
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.230 align:start position:0%
run into a local sales tax in Vermont
but

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:17.700 align:start position:0%
but I'm only on the usually on the
 
00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:20.519 align:start position:0%
western side of this Eastern side of the
 
00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
state and they compete with us
 
00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:24.710 align:start position:0%
state and they compete with us
so

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
so they probably didn't
 
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.190 align:start position:0%
so they probably didn't
um

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
and I I highlighted our neighbors the
 
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
nearest after that is New Jersey and New
 
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
Jersey is just starting
 
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.110 align:start position:0%
Jersey is just starting
um

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.550 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.269 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
and New Jersey's
 
00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
is six points the 6.6 percent and up to
 
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
two percent they would be competitive if
 
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:52.740 align:start position:0%
people wanted to drive that far
 
00:11:55.449 --> 00:11:55.459 align:start position:0%
with anything that we do
 
00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
it was passed by a voter initiative and
 
00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
so the legislators didn't have any say
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
on the other two states are main
 
00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
which has a 16.1 percent cumulative
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
sales and excise tax I think it is and
 
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
all of this is from a bulletin that's in
 
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
uh NCS
 
00:12:28.569 --> 00:12:28.579 align:start position:0%
ncsl's files it's the most recent uh
 
00:12:30.889 --> 00:12:30.899 align:start position:0%
of them
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
and I tried to reach the author
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
yesterday and couldn't
 
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.650 align:start position:0%
yesterday and couldn't
but

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:37.430 align:start position:0%
but
um

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
so Maine is 16.1 percent cumulative I
 
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
multiplied the the two taxes and
 
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
took away one uh
 
00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:51.959 align:start position:0%
to get this to that point and they also
 
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
have a cultivator or processor tax it's
 
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
not clear which maybe someone who lives
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
near Maine knows
 
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.009 align:start position:0%
near Maine knows
um

00:13:01.009 --> 00:13:01.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
on on that is fairly low up to 2.93
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
percent on weight
 
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.389 align:start position:0%
percent on weight
um

00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
I used for the weight weight ones I
 
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
I used the methodology that represented
 
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
The Honorable around me
 
00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:24.839 align:start position:0%
and his commission used a couple of
 
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
years ago which is based on work in New
 
00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
York state
 
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.970 align:start position:0%
York state
so

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:33.500 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts
 
00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
comes to 17.7 percent and local sales
 
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
taxes which I think are pretty prevalent
 
00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:50.519 align:start position:0%
I thought looking at that
 
00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
that we could easily have a 10 or a 12
 
00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.449 align:start position:0%
that we could easily have a 10 or a 12
percent

00:13:56.449 --> 00:13:56.459 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:13:56.459 --> 00:13:57.230 align:start position:0%
percent
um

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
excise tax on
 
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
on marijuana uh
 
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:05.240 align:start position:0%
by by
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
price at the retail level
 
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.490 align:start position:0%
price at the retail level
and

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
and be able to compete quite handily in
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
in our neighborhood
 
00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Pleasant yes
 
00:14:25.009 --> 00:14:25.019 align:start position:0%
I'm going to question uh representative
 
00:14:25.019 --> 00:14:26.329 align:start position:0%
I'm going to question uh representative
almi

00:14:26.329 --> 00:14:26.339 align:start position:0%
almi
 
00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
um I heard you start out saying that
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
it'll be run by large out-of-state
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
agriculture firms coming in here and
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
setting up greenhouses what's that got
 
00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:38.700 align:start position:0%
to do with where we tax
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
well it's got several things to do with
 
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
it one of them is one we've already
 
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
discussed which is that it is extremely
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
difficult to
 
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:53.220 align:start position:0%
get to the actual cost on that you tax
 
00:14:56.889 --> 00:14:56.899 align:start position:0%
the cultivator on if the cultivator is
 
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
owned and run and managed by the The
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
Firm that is also processing it and then
 
00:15:08.689 --> 00:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
selling it even selling it at retail
 
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps but certainly processing it
 
00:15:16.569 --> 00:15:16.579 align:start position:0%
in my view this uh in my view this this
 
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
attacking at the cultivator level will
 
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
work as long as it's illegal at a
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
federal level as soon as the feds make
 
00:15:25.009 --> 00:15:25.019 align:start position:0%
it legal it won't work and we'll have to
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
go to a distributor level but the
 
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:29.220 align:start position:0%
question is do we want to change that
 
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
now because there's a lot of momentum
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
for the cultivator level yeah and if I
 
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
could just
 
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
we repeat when when we have a vertically
 
00:15:45.949 --> 00:15:45.959 align:start position:0%
integrated business which is doing
 
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
the cultivation and the processing and
 
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
then possibly in retail also but on they
 
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
as we found out with the communication
 
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
Services tax and some other things on
 
00:16:04.009 --> 00:16:04.019 align:start position:0%
the that firm pretty much gets to set
 
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
what they act what they say that they're
 
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519 align:start position:0%
selling themselves
 
00:16:10.009 --> 00:16:10.019 align:start position:0%
as a price
 
00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:12.839 align:start position:0%
and if the tax is at the cultivator
 
00:16:14.689 --> 00:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
level they will set that as low as
 
00:16:14.699 --> 00:16:18.670 align:start position:0%
level they will set that as low as
possible

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
although I I agree representative army
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be set in the market
 
00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
themselves then being the middleman and
 
00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
being the retailer what's the best
 
00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
approach in in addressing that is it
 
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:34.740 align:start position:0%
right here in simple language is it in
 
00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:37.139 align:start position:0%
rules where would be the best place to
 
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
all right I saw another hand over here I
 
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.970 align:start position:0%
all right I saw another hand over here I
apologize

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.350 align:start position:0%
apologize
no

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:49.019 align:start position:0%
okay could I just respond yeah I think
 
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:51.180 align:start position:0%
that we need to ask the Liquor
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
Commission which or dra I'm not sure
 
00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:56.459 align:start position:0%
which of them I think the Liquor
 
00:16:58.249 --> 00:16:58.259 align:start position:0%
Commission is going to be responsible
 
00:16:58.259 --> 00:16:59.629 align:start position:0%
Commission is going to be responsible
for

00:16:59.629 --> 00:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:17:02.329 --> 00:17:02.339 align:start position:0%
taking in the tax
 
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
so the question is how will the value be
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
termed be determined that this
 
00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
cultivator tax will be based on so is
 
00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
there someone in the audience who can
 
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
help us answer that definition is it in
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
this bill or is that something we should
 
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:20.220 align:start position:0%
be very specific about
 
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:27.409 --> 00:17:27.419 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to hear a response to your
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
a question there but um
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
but it may help us
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
to know that all of us to know that in
 
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
Illinois where they seem to have an
 
00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:42.500 align:start position:0%
identical tax but also some other taxes
 
00:17:45.409 --> 00:17:45.419 align:start position:0%
in their statute and this response to
 
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
what representative Doucette was asking
 
00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
they try to spell out what to do with a
 
00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
vertical vertically integrated uh entity
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
and uh here's what they say
 
00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:01.860 align:start position:0%
the department their Department of
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue I guess May determine the
 
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
selling price of the Cannabis when the
 
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
seller and purchaser are affiliated
 
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
persons when the sale and purchase of
 
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
cannabis is not an arm's length
 
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
transaction or when cannabis is
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
transferred by a craft grower to the
 
00:18:21.409 --> 00:18:21.419 align:start position:0%
craft Growers dispensing organization or
 
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
infuser or processing organization and
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
the value is not established for the
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
Cannabis the value to turn by the
 
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
department shall be commensurate with
 
00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
the actual price received for products
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
of light quality character and use in
 
00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
the area if there are no sales of
 
00:18:41.289 --> 00:18:41.299 align:start position:0%
cannabis of like of like quality
 
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
character and use in the name same area
 
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
then the department shall establish a
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable value based on sales of
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
products of like quality character and
 
00:18:54.289 --> 00:18:54.299 align:start position:0%
use in other areas of the state taking
 
00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
into any into consideration any other
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
relevant factors so I assume that some
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
rule making that would follow from this
 
00:19:06.409 --> 00:19:06.419 align:start position:0%
sort of overlay of how you do it and and
 
00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:09.140 align:start position:0%
that's how they're doing it in Illinois
 
00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:12.500 align:start position:0%
I had sent around
 
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
I think it was a link to maybe it was
 
00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:19.799 align:start position:0%
text as well to the Illinois
 
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
statute which I think is the only one I
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
could find this explicitly just a
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
cultivator tax and then there's a retail
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
tax but the cultivator tax is seven
 
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.710 align:start position:0%
tax but the cultivator tax is seven
percent

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:33.780 align:start position:0%
and it seems to be on the gross receipts
 
00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:38.039 align:start position:0%
just like well we're looking at here
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
um and when I sent that out last night I
 
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
didn't have any information on revenues
 
00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
specific to that tax there's lots of
 
00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:49.380 align:start position:0%
money flowing into Illinois but of
 
00:19:51.409 --> 00:19:51.419 align:start position:0%
course it's a huge State it's 10 times
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
our size population wise but there's
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
lots of money flowing in but how much of
 
00:19:58.610 --> 00:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
from this part of the tax structure and
 
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
this morning Jennifer poor
 
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
um gave me a
 
00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:16.380 align:start position:0%
printout from
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
from Illinois that is very interesting
 
00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:21.980 align:start position:0%
to me anyway
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
and it's just a piece and I don't think
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
this year I know exactly how it fits
 
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
into the overall picture and how final
 
00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:34.820 align:start position:0%
it is but it's by by region in in
 
00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
in Illinois and the most interesting
 
00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
thing to me is that
 
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
they should they have a retail sales tax
 
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
as well as this cannabis
 
00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
um and they're collecting about the same
 
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
amount of money from each
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
the retail sales tax I think is a higher
 
00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.730 align:start position:0%
the retail sales tax I think is a higher
rate

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
rate
 
00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
and I don't have that in front of me I
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
sorry but uh it varies in each region
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
it's almost exactly you know slightly
 
00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
different but almost exactly the same
 
00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
amount of money collected from each of
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
these taxes so they're getting
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
significant money from their seven
 
00:21:19.559 --> 00:21:20.930 align:start position:0%
significant money from their seven
percent

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
tax on
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
on the product at its cultivation level
 
00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
and then they're getting an equal amount
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
of money when it's sold and it adds up
 
00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:37.980 align:start position:0%
to twice that so
 
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:38.630 align:start position:0%
to twice that so
um

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
I think some of these questions about
 
00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:43.740 align:start position:0%
how difficult this is to have this kind
 
00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:47.900 align:start position:0%
of tax if we could only get uh
 
00:21:50.649 --> 00:21:50.659 align:start position:0%
someone from Illinois to
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
inform us that would be great maybe we
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
can't but that's some information that
 
00:21:58.330 --> 00:21:58.340 align:start position:0%
may be useful to everybody
 
00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
representative Elber
 
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'd like to get
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
back to the numbers uh one of the things
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
that representative Ami mentioned was
 
00:22:12.049 --> 00:22:12.059 align:start position:0%
that she's thinking she would think more
 
00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:15.260 align:start position:0%
in the uh rate of about 10 to 12 percent
 
00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:18.780 align:start position:0%
you have here written somewhere between
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
12 and 15 percent for retail tax and if
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
one of the purposes is to try to have a
 
00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
lower tax rate than our
 
00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
neighborly competitors
 
00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
why not go with the higher end of that
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
of 15 which is still
 
00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:40.980 align:start position:0%
two and a half percent lower
 
00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:43.740 align:start position:0%
than Massachusetts and four and a half
 
00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:49.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
would you like to respond to that I'd
 
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
just like to get some information from
 
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
liquor and or dra about how they'd
 
00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
actually what this would require at
 
00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
least at the beginning is determining
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
the price
 
00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
to that the cultivator would have to pay
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
on the the price per weight that the
 
00:23:15.529 --> 00:23:15.539 align:start position:0%
cultivator would have to pay at the
 
00:23:15.539 --> 00:23:16.549 align:start position:0%
cultivator would have to pay at the
beginning

00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
of the process yes we will ask them to
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
come up yeah but I saw a hand up here
 
00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:22.860 align:start position:0%
representative Pillsbury thank you madam
 
00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:23.870 align:start position:0%
representative Pillsbury thank you madam
chair

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
um to a question you post several
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
minutes ago and further on
 
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
representative Ames comment
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't have any language that
 
00:23:36.169 --> 00:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
gets to the question of how you would
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
determine value or what would happen in
 
00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:40.740 align:start position:0%
the case of a transfer a pricing
 
00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.289 align:start position:0%
the case of a transfer a pricing
situation

00:23:42.289 --> 00:23:42.299 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:43.860 align:start position:0%
the closest
 
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:47.820 align:start position:0%
it gets to is on page 22.
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
all the way to the bottom in lines 35 to
 
00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.250 align:start position:0%
all the way to the bottom in lines 35 to
37

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
37
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
this is part four under the section that
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
relates to the tax
 
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
and that simply says the commission
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
shall adopt rules under RSA 541a
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
relative to the tax rate to tax rates
 
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
and procedures for licensed cannabis
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
cultivation facilities that also hold a
 
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:14.220 align:start position:0%
cannabis product manufacturing facility
 
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
license or retail cannabis store license
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
so it's only addressed in the sense that
 
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
there's a delegation of rule making
 
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
weigh in on this or give us your inside
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
view you've spent a lot more time on
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:48.909 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:24:48.909 --> 00:24:48.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
Madam chair members of the committee for
 
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
the record Joseph Mullica chairman of
 
00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
so if the question is how would we go
 
00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:03.169 align:start position:0%
so if the question is how would we go
about

00:25:03.169 --> 00:25:03.179 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
first and foremost The Liquor Commission
 
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:11.700 align:start position:0%
is obviously neutral on this
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
but if we were going to if we were going
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
to tax it that would be that would all
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
be set in rule that would be done in
 
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
rule just those same way we've done with
 
00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
our with our liquor rules
 
00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
most importantly to The Liquor
 
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
Commission is
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
we're a business
 
00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:31.799 align:start position:0%
we want to be able to compete with the
 
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
states around us everybody's got a head
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
start on this so the first and the first
 
00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:38.700 align:start position:0%
thing is just like we do with our liquor
 
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
products every day
 
00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
we checked neighboring prices we adjust
 
00:25:45.649 --> 00:25:45.659 align:start position:0%
prices accordingly so if we're going to
 
00:25:45.659 --> 00:25:46.850 align:start position:0%
prices accordingly so if we're going to
have

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:50.220 align:start position:0%
we're going to be setting the price
 
00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't allow someone who was
 
00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturing to set a price just just
 
00:25:58.370 --> 00:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
like we wouldn't allow someone who was
 
00:26:00.529 --> 00:26:00.539 align:start position:0%
manufacturing to set a retail price in
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
our liquor stores they they we would we
 
00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:05.940 align:start position:0%
would check what the competition is
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
doing and we would uh we would set the
 
00:26:12.169 --> 00:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
price according to what the competition
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
was doing now if there was a product
 
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
that was being produced here that wasn't
 
00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:19.740 align:start position:0%
being produced in another state we would
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
use the expertise of of The Growers and
 
00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
manufacturers what I've seen in my trips
 
00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
to Maine and I've been to outdoor
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
facilities I've been to indoor
 
00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:34.310 align:start position:0%
facilities I've been to indoor
facilities

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.529 --> 00:26:36.539 align:start position:0%
kind of the repertoire that I hear is
 
00:26:39.169 --> 00:26:39.179 align:start position:0%
Max Massachusetts completely over taxes
 
00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
this product
 
00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:41.870 align:start position:0%
this product
uh

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.610 align:start position:0%
uh
Maine's

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
Maine's
 
00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.950 align:start position:0%
Maine's
Revenue

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
in 2020 on this product was 4.3 million
 
00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
in 2021 it was 82 million
 
00:26:57.169 --> 00:26:57.179 align:start position:0%
in 2022 was 159 million
 
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
and in 2023 it's projected to be around
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
rounding the numbers they have about 97
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
stores 48 manufacturing facilities and
 
00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
about 75 cultivators
 
00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
in 2022 that 159 million gave the state
 
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:20.700 align:start position:0%
16 million dollars in tax revenue but
 
00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
one of the things I hear from the
 
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
cultivators in Maine is they're very
 
00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
displeased with the tax that they have
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
to pay
 
00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
on the on the flower the 335 dollars a
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
pound or the 94 dollars a pound on the
 
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
trim when they transfer it over they
 
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
feel that that is raising the price of
 
00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
their product because then on top of
 
00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:48.059 align:start position:0%
that the state is adding their excise
 
00:27:48.059 --> 00:27:49.190 align:start position:0%
that the state is adding their excise
tax

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:27:52.029 --> 00:27:52.039 align:start position:0%
so we felt in
 
00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
speaking originally with this about with
 
00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt that if we could set the
 
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
price accordingly in the state of New
 
00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:03.289 align:start position:0%
price accordingly in the state of New
Hampshire

00:28:03.289 --> 00:28:03.299 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with a produce product so
 
00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
just like anything else that's grown and
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
anything else that's sold big S small D
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
small D big S it's a supply and demand
 
00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:19.559 align:start position:0%
product so as different times of the
 
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
year the product fluctuates in price
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
when there's a lot of of product that's
 
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
been manufactured the price is going to
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
be lower at certain times of year when
 
00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
there's less of the product the product
 
00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:34.380 align:start position:0%
is going to be higher in fact there's
 
00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
some manufacturers in Maine that will
 
00:28:41.149 --> 00:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
cultivate their flour and hold it
 
00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
it's a hedge they're waiting for the
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
price to go up so they can make more
 
00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
money on it
 
00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:48.900 align:start position:0%
so that this is the type of thing that
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
if we could set the price according to
 
00:28:54.409 --> 00:28:54.419 align:start position:0%
the markets around us
 
00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
when we get the product in we feel that
 
00:28:59.570 --> 00:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
we could be more competitive I I would
 
00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
think that the goal is to sell more
 
00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
product than anybody around us we can
 
00:29:06.649 --> 00:29:06.659 align:start position:0%
certainly we can certainly sell more
 
00:29:09.169 --> 00:29:09.179 align:start position:0%
than Massachusetts because they tax the
 
00:29:12.049 --> 00:29:12.059 align:start position:0%
life out of it and I think we can be at
 
00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
least certainly competitive with Maine
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
because of the way their tax structure
 
00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:19.140 align:start position:0%
is if we tax it
 
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better way to put it one
 
00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:24.539 align:start position:0%
time when it leaves the manufacturer on
 
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
a on a on a price that we're agreeing
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
upon just like we do with liquor
 
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
they we they give us a they give us
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
their their cost price we add the retail
 
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:37.140 align:start position:0%
markup and we put it out now if it's not
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
competitive we don't put it out
 
00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
so we want to work with those
 
00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
cultivators and manufacturers to make
 
00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
sure that whatever they're giving us
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to be competitive
 
00:29:51.049 --> 00:29:51.059 align:start position:0%
I hope that answered the question that
 
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
was very helpful to me thank you
 
00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative Platt
 
00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question and
 
00:29:58.909 --> 00:29:58.919 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me the question
 
00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
um are you comfortable with a 15 as the
 
00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:03.740 align:start position:0%
current bill uh
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
stipulates for tax rate or would you be
 
00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
happy with something lower
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
well I certainly think that something
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
lower would be uh would obviously pass
 
00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
the uh product along to the consumer at
 
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
uh at a better rate if if obviously if
 
00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
the committee's comfortable at 15 we'll
 
00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:26.700 align:start position:0%
make it work but if we if we are looking
 
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.549 align:start position:0%
make it work but if we if we are looking
to

00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
if we're looking to take business just
 
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
just as in liquor 50 of our business
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
comes from cross-border sales from out
 
00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
of state this is the same thing that
 
00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
we're looking at here we're looking at
 
00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
taking that business away from Maine and
 
00:30:45.889 --> 00:30:45.899 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and clearly the numbers
 
00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
that Maine is experiencing and if you go
 
00:30:51.169 --> 00:30:51.179 align:start position:0%
to those locations in Maine
 
00:30:53.649 --> 00:30:53.659 align:start position:0%
those license plates are Massachusetts
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire plates so our dollars
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
are now being spent in Maine we'd like
 
00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
to take some of that back
 
00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
representative janigan did you have your
 
00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
it didn't but I haven't okay I do have a
 
00:31:07.679 --> 00:31:08.930 align:start position:0%
it didn't but I haven't okay I do have a
question

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:08.940 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:31:12.529 --> 00:31:12.539 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:31:15.649 --> 00:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
um I'm struggling a little bit with the
 
00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:19.860 align:start position:0%
connection between so on page 22 line 27
 
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:27.289 --> 00:31:27.299 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:29.700 align:start position:0%
what representative spilsbury pointed
 
00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919 align:start position:0%
out in lines 35 and 37 that the
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
commission can adopt rules I guess the
 
00:31:36.529 --> 00:31:36.539 align:start position:0%
question is what what's the connection
 
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
between the 15 stated here and the fact
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
that the commission can set rates so I
 
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:43.740 align:start position:0%
guess I'm a little confused does that
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
mean you can change the 15 percent or
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
how does that work well I think when
 
00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:51.419 align:start position:0%
when this was set we were looking for
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
some sort of a base to do the fiscal
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
numbers off of so I I think that that we
 
00:31:59.450 --> 00:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
in the rule that certainly can be
 
00:32:04.669 --> 00:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
represented as 15 base or a 10 base but
 
00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
we had to have something to kind of set
 
00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:09.059 align:start position:0%
our our numbers off of our Revenue
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
numbers so I think that's where the
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
where the 15 came in
 
00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
follow-up so you see that as you could
 
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
set a base let's say of 10 but you have
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
to get up to 50 I mean
 
00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
that that means that at some point has
 
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
to be up to 15 based on what we have
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
right here now it's just that you may
 
00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:28.740 align:start position:0%
change where that extra five percent
 
00:32:30.889 --> 00:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
gets charged is that what you're saying
 
00:32:33.049 --> 00:32:33.059 align:start position:0%
well I I think what we're what we were
 
00:32:36.049 --> 00:32:36.059 align:start position:0%
trying to say is that it's it's an
 
00:32:36.059 --> 00:32:37.190 align:start position:0%
trying to say is that it's it's an
unknown

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
unknown
 
00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.389 align:start position:0%
unknown
and

00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
we would like to have a base to start
 
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:43.860 align:start position:0%
with we certainly don't want to over
 
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
over tax it and we don't we certainly
 
00:32:48.409 --> 00:32:48.419 align:start position:0%
don't want to under tax it one of the
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
things that some of including Vermont
 
00:32:54.169 --> 00:32:54.179 align:start position:0%
was the biggest state uh
 
00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
when they started this out they didn't
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
have enough product they ran out of
 
00:33:00.169 --> 00:33:00.179 align:start position:0%
product Mains run out of products
 
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
several times we want to make sure that
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
if we're going to sell sell it we want
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we have a constant
 
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
Supply which which leads us to we want
 
00:33:12.049 --> 00:33:12.059 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we have our
 
00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
cultivators in place
 
00:33:17.389 --> 00:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
and invested in this before we do the
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
retail piece of it and I think that the
 
00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:21.740 align:start position:0%
I don't want to get hung up on the 15
 
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
because we're certainly flexible on the
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
number and I think the rules can be
 
00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:29.820 align:start position:0%
written in a way that allows the Liquor
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
Commission that flexibility the main
 
00:33:34.669 --> 00:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
thing I I want everyone to to understand
 
00:33:36.529 --> 00:33:36.539 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:38.940 align:start position:0%
we will hire a consultant that's in the
 
00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:40.860 align:start position:0%
bill and someone will come in and and
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
help us through this but we want to be
 
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
able to work with the cultivators and
 
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:50.700 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to create a Harmony in
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
this business much like we've done with
 
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
our liquor business so it will be as
 
00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.750 align:start position:0%
our liquor business so it will be as
successful

00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
so what do you believe that it would be
 
00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
um where it talks about 15 she'll be um
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
is imposed at a rate of 15 percent would
 
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
it be better to say is imposed at a
 
00:34:16.849 --> 00:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
starting rate of 15 because right now
 
00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:18.599 align:start position:0%
the way that's worded it's it's strong
 
00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
it's like it doesn't really give you the
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
capability of modifying it so would you
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
be happier with a starting rate and I'm
 
00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:27.780 align:start position:0%
not saying 15 is the rate we'll end up
 
00:34:29.089 --> 00:34:29.099 align:start position:0%
on but just
 
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:32.220 align:start position:0%
sure I'm I'm fine with that absolutely
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
and Madam chair can I step in to clarify
 
00:34:37.129 --> 00:34:37.139 align:start position:0%
you can clarify but representatively had
 
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
her hand up first for the next question
 
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
right before we move on
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
the bill as written sets the tax rate at
 
00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:48.599 align:start position:0%
15 percent
 
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
that can't be changed by rulemaking
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
this committee can propose an amendment
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
uh you know so it's up for discussion
 
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
but once the bill is enacted it's not up
 
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
for rulemaking what is commissioner if
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
you can confirm that I'm right on this
 
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
what would be the likely subject of
 
00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
rulemaking would be how to ascertain the
 
00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
value of the product upon which the 15
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
is applied that's correct
 
00:35:20.329 --> 00:35:20.339 align:start position:0%
yeah so we might need to clarify that
 
00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
okay in this language just to be clear
 
00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead and representative and so
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
just to follow up on that that was
 
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
that's a good point that's the point I'm
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
making here where I didn't believe the
 
00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
way this is worded that they could
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
change the percentage and therefore you
 
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
know it's a business they want to be
 
00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
competitive we need to give the ability
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
to potentially change that rate to be
 
00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.430 align:start position:0%
to potentially change that rate to be
competitive

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
representative Leafly thank you for your
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
patience thank you thank you for taking
 
00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:48.599 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
um do we tax alcohol right now no okay
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
it it's hard for me to wrap my mind
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
around because
 
00:35:59.690 --> 00:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
we're talking about such different
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
things here we do get to set the price
 
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
on alcohol
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
um and the
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
money that the state is taking in is not
 
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
a tax right it's we own the state stores
 
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
it's the revenue that is transferred to
 
00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:15.900 align:start position:0%
the general fund that's correct right so
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm confused about the discourse
 
00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
of us being able to set prices are we is
 
00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:26.700 align:start position:0%
the proposal that we will sell
 
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
um cannabis products in state stores
 
00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
where we will control the prices but no
 
00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:34.140 align:start position:0%
all the stores will be privately owned
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
okay and the price that I'm talking
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
about being flexible is the price per
 
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
pound at the wholesale level
 
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
so that's the price where
 
00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
that's where there needs to be the
 
00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:50.700 align:start position:0%
flexibility right so I'm having a hard
 
00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
time understanding it it seems like I
 
00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
understand there are two models right we
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
could sell cannabis products in a state
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
store like we sell alcohol and there
 
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:02.220 align:start position:0%
would be Revenue associated with that it
 
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
seems like the other model we're
 
00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
discussing is we have a free market
 
00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:11.220 align:start position:0%
and we're taxing uh
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
product that is deter the value of which
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
is determined by the market so it it's I
 
00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
feel like that's what we're talking
 
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
about there's the sticky area of what is
 
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
the value if we're selling it to
 
00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
ourselves right if we're vertically
 
00:37:29.569 --> 00:37:29.579 align:start position:0%
integrated company how do we fairly
 
00:37:31.569 --> 00:37:31.579 align:start position:0%
determine the value and I think
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative Ames talked about
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
you know Illinois has written some of
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
that into the law my question remains
 
00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:39.650 align:start position:0%
that into the law my question remains
like

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
at the beginning there's really no known
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
price and it seems like if we're talking
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
about if we're comparing it to tobacco
 
00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
and I think we should because there's a
 
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
cost to society with this product right
 
00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
and I feel like we've in this bill
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
there's an expectation that we will
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
generate Revenue which will help address
 
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
that cost to society
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
um so that it's important that we
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
generate Revenue I believe so that we
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
can meet the expectations laid out in
 
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
the bill but I guess I'm wondering if
 
00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
we're going to tax something
 
00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
normally we do that based on a market a
 
00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
value determined by the market and it
 
00:38:26.089 --> 00:38:26.099 align:start position:0%
seems like we're kind of stuck on that
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
wholesale it's going to be tricky to
 
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
figure out even if we tax gross receipts
 
00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
it's if you're selling to yourself and
 
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
you're vertically integrated
 
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
company it's difficult to determine what
 
00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
those grocery seats are I think
 
00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:49.079 align:start position:0%
um we want to avoid
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
certain behaviors based on taxation
 
00:38:53.089 --> 00:38:53.099 align:start position:0%
right we want to avoid people saying oh
 
00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
well it's only worth X
 
00:38:58.490 --> 00:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
um so I feel like
 
00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:01.460 align:start position:0%
I just want to get clear around
 
00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
letting if we're letting the market
 
00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
determine price it seems like that's
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
where the taxation should happen so I'm
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
happy to have a taxation tax happen at
 
00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
the wholesale level and at the retail
 
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
level but I think it's important that we
 
00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that this isn't like alcohol
 
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:25.140 align:start position:0%
representative Bolton did I see your
 
00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
hand up earlier yeah I think she kind of
 
00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:30.180 align:start position:0%
nailed it though okay okay
 
00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:31.740 align:start position:0%
good for now okay other hands
 
00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
representative I would argue that the
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
rulemaking that would take place
 
00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
which is allowed in this legislation
 
00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
would set the price
 
00:39:44.329 --> 00:39:44.339 align:start position:0%
and so yeah we are setting the price by
 
00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
looking at comparable sales elsewhere
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
where it's not vertically integrated
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
so that's what the Liquor Commission
 
00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:53.940 align:start position:0%
just referred to setting the price
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
okay representative fellows yes
 
00:39:58.970 --> 00:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
um I just want to talk about the
 
00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
attempting to tax it at the wholesale
 
00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
level uh let me read to you a quote from
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
a news report in Michigan on February
 
00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
14th of this year
 
00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
and what they write is Michigan's spot
 
00:40:17.089 --> 00:40:17.099 align:start position:0%
wholesale flower price averaged nearly
 
00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
two thousand seven hundred fifty dollars
 
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
a pound in January of 2001.
 
00:40:29.329 --> 00:40:29.339 align:start position:0%
and dipped 66 percent to 925 dollars a
 
00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
pound in October of 2022.
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
so to add to the complication of
 
00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
just how you catch it at the wholesale
 
00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:42.109 align:start position:0%
just how you catch it at the wholesale
level

00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
um trying to assume you're going to get
 
00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
any certain amount of Revenue on that is
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
going to be particularly difficult and
 
00:40:55.849 --> 00:40:55.859 align:start position:0%
the one of the suggestions that we were
 
00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:58.140 align:start position:0%
hearing a little while ago oh from I
 
00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:00.180 align:start position:0%
think representative Ames was telling us
 
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
what another state did in terms of how
 
00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:05.720 align:start position:0%
they were trying to determine the value
 
00:41:08.329 --> 00:41:08.339 align:start position:0%
of of wholesale
 
00:41:11.569 --> 00:41:11.579 align:start position:0%
if if it was integrated they were going
 
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
to look at comparable prices uh how
 
00:41:18.109 --> 00:41:18.119 align:start position:0%
that's like that's it's a commodity
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
market and the spot price is today is
 
00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily nothing like it was a month
 
00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:28.380 align:start position:0%
or two months ago so any attempt to try
 
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
to find some kind of average just I just
 
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
totally would not work
 
00:41:38.089 --> 00:41:38.099 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is to if we were
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
um trying to get enough Revenue to even
 
00:41:45.849 --> 00:41:45.859 align:start position:0%
maintain the program in terms of EX in
 
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
inspection and Licensing and all that
 
00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
sort of thing to have
 
00:41:54.829 --> 00:41:54.839 align:start position:0%
um you know trying to raise a decent
 
00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
amount of Revenue off something that's
 
00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
taxed at 50 15 when it's less than
 
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:05.700 align:start position:0%
the wholesale price is less than a
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a pound is just we're
 
00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:11.460 align:start position:0%
not going to make any enough Revenue to
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna look around on this side
 
00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
any other hand on this side no
 
00:42:23.329 --> 00:42:23.339 align:start position:0%
representative Orris okay thank you
 
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:27.380 align:start position:0%
question sir
 
00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
are we
 
00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
can we set the price at the liquor store
 
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
or do you have to reinvent the wheel in
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
order to
 
00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:40.740 align:start position:0%
figure out where you would be at if this
 
00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
sorry representative can we set the
 
00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
price on liquor at the liquor store you
 
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
set the price on liquor at the liquor
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
store yeah so my question is can we set
 
00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:57.660 align:start position:0%
the price on cannabis based on the
 
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
market analysis that you're going to do
 
00:43:01.849 --> 00:43:01.859 align:start position:0%
and that you do do with liquor would you
 
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:04.740 align:start position:0%
be able to do the same with cannabis and
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
keep us competitive and would that be
 
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:10.140 align:start position:0%
something that would then generate the
 
00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:12.300 align:start position:0%
revenue that the liquor does which puts
 
00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
a lot of money in our general fund well
 
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
I I think that the the revenue that
 
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis produces would be a far stretch
 
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
to ever say that it would produce the
 
00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
same thing or even close to the same
 
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
thing that liquor produces obviously the
 
00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
liquor business has been entrenched for
 
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
85 years and this is something that's
 
00:43:36.609 --> 00:43:36.619 align:start position:0%
just starting out the goal the goal of
 
00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
the idea of how we put it how we put
 
00:43:43.849 --> 00:43:43.859 align:start position:0%
this into play would be to Simply tax
 
00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:49.380 align:start position:0%
the product once at a fair market value
 
00:43:52.849 --> 00:43:52.859 align:start position:0%
to the manufacturers and
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
The Growers
 
00:43:58.130 --> 00:43:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
because the the product would be sold in
 
00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
private stores this would allow the
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
people to own those stores to set the
 
00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
price at retail we wouldn't have
 
00:44:11.329 --> 00:44:11.339 align:start position:0%
anything to do with setting the price at
 
00:44:14.809 --> 00:44:14.819 align:start position:0%
retail and that way it truly will allow
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
the market to speak
 
00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
the people that sell it at the prices
 
00:44:22.609 --> 00:44:22.619 align:start position:0%
that are competitive will Thrive and the
 
00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:24.300 align:start position:0%
people that don't sell it at the prices
 
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
that aren't competitive will not the
 
00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission doesn't want to have
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
oversight of the retail price we were
 
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
just contemplating setting the price
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
setting a a rate at the
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
growing level in the manufacturing level
 
00:44:44.329 --> 00:44:44.339 align:start position:0%
and then allowing the market to speak so
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
obviously there's going to be just like
 
00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
there is in in some other states
 
00:44:50.089 --> 00:44:50.099 align:start position:0%
there'll be people that
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
grow at a very small level and make a
 
00:44:55.309 --> 00:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
comfortable revenue and there'll be
 
00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
people that grow at a larger level and
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
make even more money but it doesn't
 
00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
eliminate anyone from from taking any
 
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:06.839 align:start position:0%
piece of the market be it large or small
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
be it the guy who's got an acre
 
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
somewhere or a greenhouse that he isn't
 
00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
using he can do it if someone wants to
 
00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
come in and grow at a larger level they
 
00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
can do that as well we're not hurting
 
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
anybody in the manufacturing or the
 
00:45:23.329 --> 00:45:23.339 align:start position:0%
growing level that was kind of our goal
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
from the beginning okay follow-up
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
question please so is the Liquor
 
00:45:31.849 --> 00:45:31.859 align:start position:0%
Commission not interested in getting
 
00:45:34.609 --> 00:45:34.619 align:start position:0%
involved with cannabis at a retail level
 
00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
would you not be interested in
 
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
sectioning off part of your liquor store
 
00:45:40.609 --> 00:45:40.619 align:start position:0%
to handle cannabis or is this something
 
00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
that the Liquor Commission is just not
 
00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:44.700 align:start position:0%
interested this is not their policy let
 
00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:46.380 align:start position:0%
me just correct and and that was a
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
policy consideration of Prior
 
00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:49.740 align:start position:0%
legislatures but that is not what this
 
00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
bill entertains so we have to work
 
00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
within the constructs of this
 
00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
what has always been passed all we can
 
00:45:59.089 --> 00:45:59.099 align:start position:0%
do I think is focus on the tax rate and
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
just being clear what we're taxing okay
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
let me rephrase then which tax you think
 
00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
makes the most sense based on your
 
00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:09.349 align:start position:0%
makes the most sense based on your
experience

00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
well uh from a business standpoint I you
 
00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
know rate what rate makes what rate or
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
would it more likely does it fit better
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
with meal and rooms does it fit better
 
00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:23.220 align:start position:0%
within the tobacco tax
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
structure we have now
 
00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
I think it fits better from a consumer
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
standpoint within the tobacco tax area
 
00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:34.740 align:start position:0%
and I think the the way it should be
 
00:46:38.809 --> 00:46:38.819 align:start position:0%
structured in my humble opinion as the
 
00:46:41.809 --> 00:46:41.819 align:start position:0%
is that the consumer should never feel
 
00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:45.300 align:start position:0%
that they are being taxed at whatever
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
level it is I think it's taxed and the
 
00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:52.140 align:start position:0%
prices set at the manufacturing and the
 
00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
and the growing level
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
and then the market whoever owns those
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
stores however many retail stores there
 
00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
ends up being in the state
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
those individuals that own those stores
 
00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
can set the price in their particular
 
00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
store or stores that's the free market
 
00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
thank you okay lots of hands over here
 
00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
anyone else yes representative spilsbury
 
00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:15.290 align:start position:0%
anyone else yes representative spilsbury
I'm

00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
so representative Orr's
 
00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:19.980 align:start position:0%
last question someone anticipated mine
 
00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:22.740 align:start position:0%
but take a little further uh a year ago
 
00:47:26.089 --> 00:47:26.099 align:start position:0%
this committee approved HB 1598 which
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
was based on the Enterprise model where
 
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission would run the
 
00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
retail operation very much analogous to
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
the liquor operation we've moved beyond
 
00:47:41.569 --> 00:47:41.579 align:start position:0%
that and I think this is a much better
 
00:47:41.579 --> 00:47:42.790 align:start position:0%
that and I think this is a much better
model

00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
model
 
00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:46.940 align:start position:0%
to rely upon the marketplace
 
00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
the bill is introduced set the tax on
 
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
the basis of the meals and rooms and it
 
00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
literally piggybacked on the meals and
 
00:47:58.970 --> 00:47:58.980 align:start position:0%
rooms tax Provisions amending them to
 
00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
call it the meals uh cannabis and rooms
 
00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
I think that was
 
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
not ideal
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
and so I think that the Commerce
 
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
committee's amendments that have shifted
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
this to a straight tax on the product
 
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
and moved away from the meals and rooms
 
00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:17.690 align:start position:0%
and moved away from the meals and rooms
construct

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
construct
 
00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
is good and and I don't think we
 
00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
particularly want this to be a sales tax
 
00:48:29.569 --> 00:48:29.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:34.380 align:start position:0%
I'm perfectly prepared to support
 
00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:37.140 align:start position:0%
attacks of the nature we have here I'm
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
still somewhat confused
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
about exactly at what level and how
 
00:48:43.809 --> 00:48:43.819 align:start position:0%
we're going to determine the valuation
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
so several members of the committee have
 
00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:48.780 align:start position:0%
surfaced the question of transfer
 
00:48:52.089 --> 00:48:52.099 align:start position:0%
pricing and it is a thorny
 
00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
issue and certainly the committee will
 
00:48:57.290 --> 00:48:57.300 align:start position:0%
not be able to resolve how that would be
 
00:48:59.569 --> 00:48:59.579 align:start position:0%
done and I'm somewhat concerned that
 
00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:02.220 align:start position:0%
even rulemaking may not really get on
 
00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
top of it
 
00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:06.300 align:start position:0%
I think am I right that there are really
 
00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
three stages at which you could tax
 
00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:12.180 align:start position:0%
the cultivator
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
is more analogous to taxing wine on the
 
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
basis of taxing the grape when it's
 
00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
picked at the vineyard
 
00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
and that strikes me as problematic
 
00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
the retail final sale is more analogous
 
00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:28.140 align:start position:0%
to the sales tax and to the meals and
 
00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:29.089 align:start position:0%
to the sales tax and to the meals and
rooms

00:49:29.089 --> 00:49:29.099 align:start position:0%
rooms
 
00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:31.140 align:start position:0%
but isn't there an intermediate point
 
00:49:32.809 --> 00:49:32.819 align:start position:0%
there and and you've used the word
 
00:49:35.569 --> 00:49:35.579 align:start position:0%
wholesaler repeatedly
 
00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:38.780 align:start position:0%
is there not an intermediate point
 
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
that is somewhere above the cultivator
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
and somewhere below the retail and and
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
by the way I very much like your point
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
that the purchaser shouldn't feel the
 
00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:50.220 align:start position:0%
tax what was paid in tax should already
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
well I think that in my understanding of
 
00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
there is several
 
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
folks in business out there
 
00:50:06.250 --> 00:50:06.260 align:start position:0%
that do they grow the product
 
00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
they sell the flower one way they take
 
00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
the byproduct of the plant and create
 
00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:16.730 align:start position:0%
the byproduct of the plant and create
uh

00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:20.569 --> 00:50:20.579 align:start position:0%
Edibles from it they create a hash from
 
00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
it so that could be done simply within
 
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
the same manufacturing facility and or
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
you could much like you have producers
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
of beer who don't have a bottling line
 
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
either someone comes in and cans their
 
00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
product at their facility or they tank
 
00:50:42.829 --> 00:50:42.839 align:start position:0%
it out to someone else and they bottle
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
or can their beer so there's an
 
00:50:45.119 --> 00:50:46.670 align:start position:0%
or can their beer so there's an
opportunity

00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
in in my mind to tax the product when it
 
00:50:54.609 --> 00:50:54.619 align:start position:0%
leaves that facility in its final form
 
00:50:59.809 --> 00:50:59.819 align:start position:0%
regardless of if if it's Leaf uh if it's
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
Bud if it's Edibles if it's hash when
 
00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
it's in its final form and the value is
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
put on it that's when the tax is
 
00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839 align:start position:0%
appropriately laid so just to clarify
 
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
that's what you think would be the
 
00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
cleanest and easiest for the Liquor
 
00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
Commission to supervise and get right I
 
00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:20.700 align:start position:0%
think it's the cleanest for everyone and
 
00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:22.740 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers that I have spoken
 
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
with in other states agree it's one time
 
00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:29.700 align:start position:0%
it's out the door price it's taxed on
 
00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
what the retailer is going to mark up on
 
00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:36.180 align:start position:0%
and then the retailer now there's some
 
00:51:38.089 --> 00:51:38.099 align:start position:0%
retailers that will work on three
 
00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
percent there's some that want to make
 
00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:43.559 align:start position:0%
300. then the market speaks as to who is
 
00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:46.140 align:start position:0%
successful and who is not it's not the
 
00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission that makes that
 
00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:50.890 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission that makes that
decision

00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:50.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
representative all me and then
 
00:51:57.770 --> 00:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:03.049 --> 00:52:03.059 align:start position:0%
I just turned it off uh thank you I I
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
would agree with this idea of taxing the
 
00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:11.720 align:start position:0%
wholesaler as they sell to the retailer
 
00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:16.140 align:start position:0%
I think on that that I think is
 
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:19.140 align:start position:0%
well it's not what Illinois is doing but
 
00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
on when we get to that stage we're
 
00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:27.180 align:start position:0%
talking about on brownies and and sodas
 
00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:30.500 align:start position:0%
and things like that as well as
 
00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:33.740 align:start position:0%
the leaf or flower product
 
00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
and what Illinois
 
00:52:40.130 --> 00:52:40.140 align:start position:0%
the only Illinois apparently did was it
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
its cannabis purchase excise tax
 
00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:46.740 align:start position:0%
says that 20 percent of the purchase
 
00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:49.140 align:start position:0%
price is
 
00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:51.300 align:start position:0%
it it's taxed at 20 percent of the
 
00:52:54.049 --> 00:52:54.059 align:start position:0%
purchase price for cannabis infused
 
00:52:54.059 --> 00:52:55.750 align:start position:0%
purchase price for cannabis infused
products

00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
products
 
00:52:59.290 --> 00:52:59.300 align:start position:0%
and then it's taxed at 10 percent for
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
low low grade cannabis that is THC under
 
00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
35 percent
 
00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:08.940 align:start position:0%
um and at 25 percent of the purchase
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
price for THC above 35 so they've
 
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
they've just done a simple separation of
 
00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
the the Cannabis products from the leaf
 
00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:25.140 align:start position:0%
and flower at different potency levels
 
00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
and we had been asked by the
 
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:31.250 align:start position:0%
and we had been asked by the
uh

00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:31.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:33.800 align:start position:0%
the people that are worried about the
 
00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:37.980 align:start position:0%
addictiveness of the product to
 
00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
um and the effects on people who weren't
 
00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:45.900 align:start position:0%
used to seeing 40 THC
 
00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:47.630 align:start position:0%
used to seeing 40 THC
uh

00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:50.589 --> 00:53:50.599 align:start position:0%
taking it on that
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
they'd like to see the higher
 
00:53:59.450 --> 00:53:59.460 align:start position:0%
THC levels taxed more than the low THC
 
00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:01.030 align:start position:0%
THC levels taxed more than the low THC
levels

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
levels
 
00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
as a public health measure but on they
 
00:54:06.119 --> 00:54:07.609 align:start position:0%
as a public health measure but on they
did

00:54:07.609 --> 00:54:07.619 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
they we would have to have some kind of
 
00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
separation of the tax level if we did it
 
00:54:13.690 --> 00:54:13.700 align:start position:0%
that way
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
between the infused products they call
 
00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:20.460 align:start position:0%
them in Illinois the Cannabis products
 
00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
and the the Royal leaf and flower
 
00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:26.690 align:start position:0%
and the the Royal leaf and flower
so

00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:26.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:29.089 align:start position:0%
so
representatively

00:54:29.089 --> 00:54:29.099 align:start position:0%
representatively
 
00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:30.839 align:start position:0%
my comments not for the Liquor
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
Commission so if other people have
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:43.380 align:start position:0%
um so I feel like that gets closer right
 
00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:44.390 align:start position:0%
um so I feel like that gets closer right
like

00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
because I feel like
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
taxing the flower on a meal that we're
 
00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
offering in a restaurant doesn't like
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's really far away from the product
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
and I feel like you know selling a
 
00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:58.450 align:start position:0%
and I feel like you know selling a
pastry

00:54:58.450 --> 00:54:58.460 align:start position:0%
pastry
 
00:55:01.690 --> 00:55:01.700 align:start position:0%
that has market value
 
00:55:04.849 --> 00:55:04.859 align:start position:0%
that makes sense to tax there because
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
the Market's going to establish the
 
00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
value of that my concern so I think
 
00:55:11.329 --> 00:55:11.339 align:start position:0%
we're getting closer to where we should
 
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
be taxing the product if we're taxing it
 
00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
when it's already a product that will be
 
00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:19.940 align:start position:0%
sold in that form
 
00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:22.140 align:start position:0%
my concern is that we're still running
 
00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
into the same problem when we heard from
 
00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
Prime their question was like how would
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
we even establish a value whether it's
 
00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:34.140 align:start position:0%
at the grower or the manufacturer
 
00:55:37.549 --> 00:55:37.559 align:start position:0%
they know what the the retail value is
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
if you're not if you're not selling the
 
00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:42.420 align:start position:0%
manufactured product to a different
 
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
retailer than yourself if you are a
 
00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and you're selling to 20
 
00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
different people then the price seems
 
00:55:51.049 --> 00:55:51.059 align:start position:0%
obvious but if that isn't happening I
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
guess that's my question about
 
00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
are we
 
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
is it clear what the value of the
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
product is there if it is then great
 
00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:01.740 align:start position:0%
that's a great place to to put it my
 
00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:03.410 align:start position:0%
that's a great place to to put it my
other

00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:07.140 align:start position:0%
um concern is that the customer should
 
00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
not feel like they're being taxed and I
 
00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:11.940 align:start position:0%
feel like as a citizen
 
00:56:14.809 --> 00:56:14.819 align:start position:0%
I don't I want to know what I'm being
 
00:56:14.819 --> 00:56:16.730 align:start position:0%
I don't I want to know what I'm being
taxed

00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:16.740 align:start position:0%
taxed
 
00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
um so I I would disagree with the
 
00:56:20.569 --> 00:56:20.579 align:start position:0%
premise that we should hide the tax in
 
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
the price somehow I feel like it's
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
important that consumers know that
 
00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
they're being taxed and know what that
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
tax rate is
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
so just to offer a different perspective
 
00:56:32.089 --> 00:56:32.099 align:start position:0%
on the taxation
 
00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:34.740 align:start position:0%
I saw representative Bolton yes
 
00:56:37.309 --> 00:56:37.319 align:start position:0%
I thank you madam chair I might disagree
 
00:56:38.809 --> 00:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
with that I don't think people really
 
00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
want to see how much they're being taxed
 
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
maybe they they intimately know how much
 
00:56:44.809 --> 00:56:44.819 align:start position:0%
uh taxes go on the pack of cigarettes
 
00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
they're buying but
 
00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
um I think in New Hampshire we shall not
 
00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:49.980 align:start position:0%
like indicate how much you're being
 
00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
taxed so
 
00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
um and I do kind of agree with the fact
 
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
that I prefer you know the tax to be not
 
00:56:59.150 --> 00:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily at the grower level even
 
00:57:00.829 --> 00:57:00.839 align:start position:0%
though it seems like the grower is still
 
00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
in the mix because they're basically in
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
the statute or in the uh the proposed
 
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
bill but you know um my concern also is
 
00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
on the Growers and there was a comment
 
00:57:14.329 --> 00:57:14.339 align:start position:0%
earlier I think was made regarding the
 
00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
fact that we're just going to be
 
00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
inundated with like multinational or at
 
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
least Interstate Growers that are gonna
 
00:57:23.089 --> 00:57:23.099 align:start position:0%
pretty much destroy any kind of like uh
 
00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
well Grassroots kind of like growing
 
00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:27.190 align:start position:0%
well Grassroots kind of like growing
situation

00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:28.940 align:start position:0%
I know
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
I kind of fed you that one but um but I
 
00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
think in fact I was talking to my
 
00:57:36.410 --> 00:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
accountant and and she was saying well
 
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
they have a side business of uh of
 
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
growing vegetables and also I have
 
00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
greenhouses and they're looking forward
 
00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
to this bill passing so they can become
 
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
a you know a small grower and I really
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
don't want to necessarily out of the
 
00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:51.780 align:start position:0%
gate kind of like you know put them out
 
00:57:54.829 --> 00:57:54.839 align:start position:0%
of business by uh putting more weight on
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
the on the grower that they just can't
 
00:57:57.890 --> 00:57:57.900 align:start position:0%
afford to
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
you know go forward with it but anyway
 
00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
that's where I'm coming from
 
00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
representative so given the topic that's
 
00:58:06.290 --> 00:58:06.300 align:start position:0%
on the table make a quick comment before
 
00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
going to my point uh yes I I think we
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
have plenty of analogies uh with the
 
00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:16.460 align:start position:0%
beer tax the tobacco tax the gas tax uh
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
where an excise tax is embedded in an
 
00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
intermediate level as distinct from a
 
00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
sales tax so I'm comfortable with this
 
00:58:28.609 --> 00:58:28.619 align:start position:0%
uh the conversation has
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
caused me to look more closely
 
00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
at the tax provision which again is page
 
00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:35.870 align:start position:0%
at the tax provision which again is page
22

00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
22
 
00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:38.940 align:start position:0%
lines 27 and 28
 
00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
and specifically it says
 
00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
total gross revenue of licensed cannabis
 
00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:48.900 align:start position:0%
cultivation facilities
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
so we're each getting sort of drawn
 
00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
along here in Commodities we learned I
 
00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
went back and I looked at the definition
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
of cannabis cultivation facility and
 
00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
it's broader than cultivator
 
00:59:02.089 --> 00:59:02.099 align:start position:0%
it says
 
00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
that that cannabis cultivation facility
 
00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:07.140 align:start position:0%
means an entity registered to cultivate
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
prepare and package cannabis
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
and sell cannabis to retail Cannabis
 
00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:13.730 align:start position:0%
and sell cannabis to retail Cannabis
stores

00:59:13.730 --> 00:59:13.740 align:start position:0%
stores
 
00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis product manufacturing
 
00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:17.700 align:start position:0%
facilities to alternate treatment
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
centers into other cannabis cult
 
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
cultivation facilities but not to
 
00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:23.569 align:start position:0%
cultivation facilities but not to
Consumers

00:59:23.569 --> 00:59:23.579 align:start position:0%
Consumers
 
00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:27.660 align:start position:0%
so I think I've now discovered
 
00:59:29.329 --> 00:59:29.339 align:start position:0%
that the Bill's in the right place
 
00:59:29.339 --> 00:59:30.650 align:start position:0%
that the Bill's in the right place
already

00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:59:34.849 --> 00:59:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative plett and then
 
00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:38.220 align:start position:0%
representative Olney I wanted to make
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
certain I understand what you just said
 
00:59:44.089 --> 00:59:44.099 align:start position:0%
even though we've been talk talking
 
00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
about it at a cultivator level this is
 
00:59:48.049 --> 00:59:48.059 align:start position:0%
really an existributor level then the
 
00:59:49.370 --> 00:59:49.380 align:start position:0%
way it's written
 
00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
yes that's exactly the way I read the
 
00:59:54.069 --> 00:59:54.079 align:start position:0%
definition of the
 
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
cultivation facility
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative could we just I
 
01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:00.660 align:start position:0%
saw some
 
01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:02.220 align:start position:0%
facial expressions over here I just want
 
01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:03.900 align:start position:0%
to see can you just confirm are we going
 
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
along the right thinking here to help us
 
01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:07.270 align:start position:0%
along the right thinking here to help us
understand

01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
I think you're spot on okay thank you I
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
saw the smile there representative
 
01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
yes the last sentence of that section is
 
01:00:17.329 --> 01:00:17.339 align:start position:0%
a can
 
01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:19.460 align:start position:0%
of accountability shall not produce
 
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis concentrates tinctures extracts
 
01:00:25.849 --> 01:00:25.859 align:start position:0%
or other cannabis products
 
01:00:25.859 --> 01:00:28.130 align:start position:0%
or other cannabis products
on

01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:28.140 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:00:31.309 --> 01:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
and so it is
 
01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:34.260 align:start position:0%
anything of that nature is going to go
 
01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
through the Cannabis production
 
01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.730 align:start position:0%
through the Cannabis production
facilities

01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:37.740 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
and the the large businesses that are
 
01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:46.980 align:start position:0%
going to be uh coming into the market
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
on with large greenhouses and
 
01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing attacks attached and I
 
01:00:54.890 --> 01:00:54.900 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's legal I would prefer
 
01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't that that they can own
 
01:00:58.370 --> 01:00:58.380 align:start position:0%
the retailer
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
stores as well except for samples or
 
01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:01.809 align:start position:0%
stores as well except for samples or
something

01:01:01.809 --> 01:01:01.819 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
but on
 
01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:07.740 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
they are going to be the majority of
 
01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.170 align:start position:0%
they are going to be the majority of
this

01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:12.180 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
this does allow small bits small farmers
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
with small greenhouses to sell directly
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
to the retail
 
01:01:22.559 --> 01:01:24.170 align:start position:0%
to the retail
but

01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:33.299 align:start position:0%
most of them are going most of the stuff
 
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
is going to be coming out of very large
 
01:01:37.370 --> 01:01:37.380 align:start position:0%
greenhouses that cost quite a bit of
 
01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:39.780 align:start position:0%
capital to set up
 
01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:41.329 align:start position:0%
capital to set up
okay

01:01:41.329 --> 01:01:41.339 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner can you weigh in on this
 
01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:44.940 align:start position:0%
did you study this at all is this going
 
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
to be hurting our local farmers do you
 
01:01:49.309 --> 01:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
have any thoughts on that well I'll use
 
01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
the analogy of uh independent Brewers
 
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
10 years ago there wasn't an independent
 
01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:58.849 align:start position:0%
10 years ago there wasn't an independent
Brewer

01:01:58.849 --> 01:01:58.859 align:start position:0%
Brewer
 
01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:02.460 align:start position:0%
license and now we have many
 
01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
people that Brew
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
beer and sell it into the market because
 
01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:11.700 align:start position:0%
there's a consumer demand for it so if
 
01:02:15.289 --> 01:02:15.299 align:start position:0%
these small manufacturers can produce
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
something that's unique
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
then they're going to they'll be setting
 
01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
their Market themselves if they can
 
01:02:24.589 --> 01:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
produce a flower that's different a
 
01:02:26.809 --> 01:02:26.819 align:start position:0%
product that's different a Tincher
 
01:02:29.569 --> 01:02:29.579 align:start position:0%
that's different a wax that's different
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's where they're going to thrive
 
01:02:35.329 --> 01:02:35.339 align:start position:0%
they're not going to try to compete I
 
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:36.559 align:start position:0%
wouldn't think
 
01:02:38.329 --> 01:02:38.339 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
able Ebenezer doesn't try to compete
 
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
with Budweiser it's it's two different
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
markets they each have their own Market
 
01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
they each are making money but they're
 
01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
it's two different markets so I think
 
01:02:54.289 --> 01:02:54.299 align:start position:0%
that that's that's kind of my analogy of
 
01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
how people that are in the market that
 
01:03:00.349 --> 01:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
are small Growers and or manufacturers
 
01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
can can compete because they're creating
 
01:03:06.049 --> 01:03:06.059 align:start position:0%
something that's unique
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's a Hands Up Now representative of
 
01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
rochefort yes thank you madam chair so
 
01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
you said something a minute ago earlier
 
01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
in your testimony that
 
01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
kind of maybe spoke will speak to this
 
01:03:19.130 --> 01:03:19.140 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
reaffirm what you just said and I want
 
01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure I got it right
 
01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:23.750 align:start position:0%
to make sure I got it right
um

01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
you said that seven there are 75
 
01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
cultivators in Maine
 
01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:29.940 align:start position:0%
did I get that right
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
so I'm assuming with 75 cultivators you
 
01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:34.140 align:start position:0%
have a mix of
 
01:03:37.130 --> 01:03:37.140 align:start position:0%
everything from Big agribusiness to I'm
 
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
assuming anyway because I can't imagine
 
01:03:42.170 --> 01:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
there's 75 agribusiness large-scale uh
 
01:03:43.789 --> 01:03:43.799 align:start position:0%
and then all the way to the other end is
 
01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:46.020 align:start position:0%
niche special
 
01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
flower grower I mean I don't know the
 
01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:50.420 align:start position:0%
industry but I'm sure that some guy can
 
01:03:52.609 --> 01:03:52.619 align:start position:0%
cultivate a pretty beautiful looking
 
01:03:54.349 --> 01:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
flower and that's probably what you have
 
01:03:57.049 --> 01:03:57.059 align:start position:0%
uh everything in in in everything in
 
01:03:59.470 --> 01:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
between so
 
01:04:03.069 --> 01:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
hearing that you know in Maine which
 
01:04:05.569 --> 01:04:05.579 align:start position:0%
next door I
 
01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
my when we were initially started this
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
conversation I was concerned about a
 
01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
supply and issue that we wouldn't be
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
able to meet a supply or there wouldn't
 
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
be anybody that would be willing to take
 
01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:16.980 align:start position:0%
that risk
 
01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like the demand is there
 
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
especially next door
 
01:04:24.109 --> 01:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
that would
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
Prevail and allow us to a variety of
 
01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
producers then is that I mean is that
 
01:04:32.210 --> 01:04:32.220 align:start position:0%
dude would you it sounds like you would
 
01:04:34.609 --> 01:04:34.619 align:start position:0%
hold to that absolutely and and in
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
speaking with the folks that I've many
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
folks that I've spoke with in Maine the
 
01:04:42.289 --> 01:04:42.299 align:start position:0%
cautionary pieces make sure that you
 
01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
have the manufacturing in place and
 
01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:48.780 align:start position:0%
those growers in place prior to opening
 
01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
the retail because the last thing you
 
01:04:54.049 --> 01:04:54.059 align:start position:0%
want to do is to open retail and not
 
01:04:57.410 --> 01:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
have enough product so that you need a
 
01:04:58.809 --> 01:04:58.819 align:start position:0%
plethora of
 
01:05:02.270 --> 01:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
Manufacturers big and small in order to
 
01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:05.579 align:start position:0%
to keep the market whole and full and
 
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
especially where if we're going to draw
 
01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
on the model that the Liquor Commission
 
01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:12.839 align:start position:0%
uses for its revenues we're going to
 
01:05:14.569 --> 01:05:14.579 align:start position:0%
take some of that revenue from outside
 
01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
and our goal is to make sure that the
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
manufacturing is in place both large and
 
01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:23.780 align:start position:0%
small prior to retail
 
01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
thank you that's exactly thank you very
 
01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
much thank you representative fellows
 
01:05:30.770 --> 01:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:05:34.549 --> 01:05:34.559 align:start position:0%
um I'm I just
 
01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate that the commissioner
 
01:05:38.569 --> 01:05:38.579 align:start position:0%
has done some research on this and it
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
does make sense to look at the states
 
01:05:43.490 --> 01:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
that are around us but Maine
 
01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
um has only had
 
01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:48.710 align:start position:0%
um has only had
two

01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:05:52.609 --> 01:05:52.619 align:start position:0%
full years of sales and one of the
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
things I've read repeatedly about the
 
01:05:58.250 --> 01:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
when a state starts
 
01:06:01.549 --> 01:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
in the legalizes cannabis and it starts
 
01:06:05.289 --> 01:06:05.299 align:start position:0%
to be sold is that there's not enough
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
product available for the first couple
 
01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
of years and then by the time you get to
 
01:06:15.410 --> 01:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
about year three the cultivators have
 
01:06:18.829 --> 01:06:18.839 align:start position:0%
perfected their their process and
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
they've expanded their crops and then
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
there is an overload of cannabis
 
01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
available and the price comes down
 
01:06:30.049 --> 01:06:30.059 align:start position:0%
I'm one of the things that I'm taking
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
into consideration here is exactly how
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
much money we're going to bring into the
 
01:06:34.559 --> 01:06:35.390 align:start position:0%
much money we're going to bring into the
state

01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
and so I don't think
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
that main I well I put it this way I've
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
been focusing
 
01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
um looking at the ones that have it at
 
01:06:49.849 --> 01:06:49.859 align:start position:0%
least three full years of data available
 
01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
for the sales and the prices come down
 
01:07:00.730 --> 01:07:00.740 align:start position:0%
and we're proposing to do a tax
 
01:07:03.529 --> 01:07:03.539 align:start position:0%
that's way below what any of the other
 
01:07:05.049 --> 01:07:05.059 align:start position:0%
states are doing
 
01:07:08.329 --> 01:07:08.339 align:start position:0%
the states that I've looked at two of
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
them did have do have a wholesale tax
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
but they also have a retail tax so they
 
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
have those two taxes combined
 
01:07:20.930 --> 01:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
and one consideration is compared to the
 
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
retail value how much of that value is
 
01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:26.420 align:start position:0%
coming from the price of the product
 
01:07:29.569 --> 01:07:29.579 align:start position:0%
that goes in there and and I don't I
 
01:07:32.329 --> 01:07:32.339 align:start position:0%
just think you know if you assume
 
01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
something like half and you tax it at 15
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
percent and the price of that cannabis
 
01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:42.200 align:start position:0%
is under a thousand dollars a pound
 
01:07:45.170 --> 01:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
we're not going to make hardly any money
 
01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
and you know maybe we're going to cover
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
your inspectors and the management of
 
01:07:56.210 --> 01:07:56.220 align:start position:0%
the program but we're not going to make
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
any significant amount of money to go
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
and either reduce the unfunded liability
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
um retirement system or school funding
 
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
and so I think that we need to give some
 
01:08:14.270 --> 01:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
consideration to how much money can be
 
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
raised from this
 
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
I mean it's it's great I'm have no
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
problem with like you know
 
01:08:25.249 --> 01:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
creating new business opportunities
 
01:08:28.610 --> 01:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
but this is a big operation it has
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
social consequences and we should be
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the whole picture thank you
 
01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to keep scanning around
 
01:08:37.729 --> 01:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
this side no representative did you have
 
01:08:37.739 --> 01:08:38.390 align:start position:0%
this side no representative did you have
something

01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:41.460 align:start position:0%
I do thank you madam chair
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:08:45.530 --> 01:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
in the case where you have a vertically
 
01:08:48.289 --> 01:08:48.299 align:start position:0%
integrated company where they
 
01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
they cultivate they manufacture and
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
they're the retail operation how do you
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
have you looked into how you would
 
01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
assess a tax in that case because now
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's not one company selling wholesale
 
01:09:02.329 --> 01:09:02.339 align:start position:0%
to another company it's a vertically
 
01:09:02.339 --> 01:09:03.530 align:start position:0%
to another company it's a vertically
integrated

01:09:03.530 --> 01:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
integrated
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
system how how would you propose going
 
01:09:07.789 --> 01:09:07.799 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:09:11.209 --> 01:09:11.219 align:start position:0%
the tax whatever it is would be based on
 
01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
the retail price so if a company is
 
01:09:18.650 --> 01:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
growing and Manufacturing when the
 
01:09:21.709 --> 01:09:21.719 align:start position:0%
product leaves either either segment of
 
01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
the business
 
01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
the product would be taxed on the retail
 
01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:26.990 align:start position:0%
the product would be taxed on the retail
value

01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
value
 
01:09:30.289 --> 01:09:30.299 align:start position:0%
so obviously hash doesn't weigh that
 
01:09:34.669 --> 01:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
much or you know or edibles it's it's
 
01:09:37.729 --> 01:09:37.739 align:start position:0%
based on the value of that product
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
so you're not doing that by the pound
 
01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
obviously you know you're doing flour by
 
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
the pound or Leaf by the pound or
 
01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
whatever those products are by the pound
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
and or ounce whatever however it ends up
 
01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
but the the dollars that the state will
 
01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
make are based on the retail value of
 
01:09:57.890 --> 01:09:57.900 align:start position:0%
that product and just like any other
 
01:10:00.169 --> 01:10:00.179 align:start position:0%
business I mean we have we'll have
 
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
Auditors in place and we will have
 
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
inspectors in place this product when
 
01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:06.709 align:start position:0%
inspectors in place this product when
it's

01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
it's given a skew number at the seed
 
01:10:13.370 --> 01:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
level so there's no sneaking one by the
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
goalie it doesn't happen because the
 
01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:19.980 align:start position:0%
product starts with a with a seed and a
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
skew and that follows the product all
 
01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
follow-up um
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
okay so then in a case where you have a
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
wholesaler who sells it to a different
 
01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:36.950 align:start position:0%
wholesaler who sells it to a different
retailer

01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
retailer
 
01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
where does the tax come in then is that
 
01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
that retailer that will
 
01:10:43.970 --> 01:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
pay the tax
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
because the the difference there is
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
if you have a vertically integrated
 
01:10:49.199 --> 01:10:50.209 align:start position:0%
if you have a vertically integrated
Market

01:10:50.209 --> 01:10:50.219 align:start position:0%
Market
 
01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
who sells retail
 
01:10:54.890 --> 01:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
that price is going to be presumably
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
higher than the person who's wholesaling
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
it to another retail because now they're
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
paying the tax on the wholesale price
 
01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
you see what I'm saying
 
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
I think I do but I you know the
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
Safeguard for us in this idea was to
 
01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
make it simple and to tax it once so
 
01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
it's taxed at the value when it leaves
 
01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing facility or the
 
01:11:22.010 --> 01:11:22.020 align:start position:0%
growing facility it's taxed at that
 
01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
level if somebody then transfers it to
 
01:11:27.709 --> 01:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
somebody else and sells it
 
01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
tax is already paid if someone else
 
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
wants to if someone's willing to pay I
 
01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:40.140 align:start position:0%
not not well thought out business idea
 
01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
to be able to take it and sell it to
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
somebody else and then try to make a
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
markup that's where I said I I think
 
01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
that we have to allow the business
 
01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
people who are out there that are in
 
01:11:53.689 --> 01:11:53.699 align:start position:0%
this business to make those decisions
 
01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
about how they'll buy and sell the
 
01:11:59.630 --> 01:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
product and if they make uh
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
if they make decisions that are
 
01:12:04.610 --> 01:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
not amenable to their the success of
 
01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
their business then that falls on their
 
01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:08.030 align:start position:0%
their business then that falls on their
shoulders

01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
shoulders
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative Madam chair we've been an
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
hour and 15 minutes or so discussing
 
01:12:16.189 --> 01:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
essential what tax level that should be
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
taxed at and what I heard is that we
 
01:12:20.090 --> 01:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
really are doing at a distributor level
 
01:12:22.610 --> 01:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
because of the wording and the bill I
 
01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
wonder if we could start going through
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
our brahmi comments and mark up the bill
 
01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
and come at the end to whether we think
 
01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
we need changes as to the level and the
 
01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.649 align:start position:0%
we need changes as to the level and the
rate

01:12:33.649 --> 01:12:33.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:33.659 --> 01:12:37.250 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
if you thank you
 
01:12:39.970 --> 01:12:39.980 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
 
01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:42.780 align:start position:0%
short question
 
01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
and we understand what purview of this
 
01:12:46.970 --> 01:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
committee to talk about these things
 
01:12:48.169 --> 01:12:48.179 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
how much how much of this that you've
 
01:12:54.410 --> 01:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
been expressing today if anything was
 
01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
brought forward in the Commerce
 
01:12:57.890 --> 01:12:57.900 align:start position:0%
Committee in the original hearing of the
 
01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
bill just just a question
 
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
all of it
 
01:13:06.010 --> 01:13:06.020 align:start position:0%
when we discussed it with Commerce I'm
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
the policy committee did the deep deep
 
01:13:10.490 --> 01:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
dive on this
 
01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
um and we're supposed to be focusing
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
very narrowly on what we're doing here
 
01:13:15.709 --> 01:13:15.719 align:start position:0%
representative Doucet
 
01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair as I told you
 
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
earlier I addressed some some of uh
 
01:13:24.130 --> 01:13:24.140 align:start position:0%
uh The Honorable Pat abrami's technical
 
01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
defects that he saw I didn't address any
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
what I saw as policy issues in the
 
01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
handout he gave us and I have a draft
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment if if we can work off of that
 
01:13:36.610 --> 01:13:36.620 align:start position:0%
so did you want to pass that out now
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
certainly okay included included in that
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
as a okay I see a bunch of hands up
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
we'll keep going with the hands but um
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
yeah at some point it would be nice if
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
we can get to some sort of consensus on
 
01:13:50.209 --> 01:13:50.219 align:start position:0%
this section of our discussion before we
 
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
move on but representative spilsbury and
 
01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
then we'll go down and then we'll Circle
 
01:13:55.689 --> 01:13:55.699 align:start position:0%
back around
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
sure I I think there's a level of
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
confusion that's sort of arisen back
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
into the conversation in the last few
 
01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
minutes uh when I thought we had gotten
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
clear uh and perhaps that's just you
 
01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
know verbal looseness uh but you
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh commissioner uh the retail
 
01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:14.270 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh commissioner uh the retail
term

01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
term
 
01:14:16.370 --> 01:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
and and yet I thought we were sort of
 
01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
you know coming into the conclusion that
 
01:14:20.090 --> 01:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
there's a culture for a cultivator
 
01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
wholesale retail
 
01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:26.340 align:start position:0%
cultivator and wholesale May coincide at
 
01:14:29.149 --> 01:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
times they may diverge at times
 
01:14:32.930 --> 01:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
and so representative Ami pointed to the
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
last sentence of the Cannabis
 
01:14:38.090 --> 01:14:38.100 align:start position:0%
cultivation facility definition that's
 
01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
page three
 
01:14:45.290 --> 01:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
final two lines 36 and 37 page three
 
01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:51.770 --> 01:14:51.780 align:start position:0%
cannabis cultivation facility is defined
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
lines 33 to 37. so certainly there are
 
01:14:58.130 --> 01:14:58.140 align:start position:0%
value added
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
steps that can be taken in the
 
01:15:01.850 --> 01:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
manufacturing process
 
01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
to create variants using the TLC product
 
01:15:09.649 --> 01:15:09.659 align:start position:0%
such as concentrates tinctures extracts
 
01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
and so on
 
01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:14.219 align:start position:0%
and I believe that that is incorporated
 
01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
into the definition that's found over on
 
01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
the next page for
 
01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
lines four to seven
 
01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
of a cannabis product manufacturing
 
01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:26.030 align:start position:0%
of a cannabis product manufacturing
facility

01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis product manufacturing facility
 
01:15:32.330 --> 01:15:32.340 align:start position:0%
definition is very parallel
 
01:15:35.149 --> 01:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
to cannabis cultivation facility
 
01:15:39.169 --> 01:15:39.179 align:start position:0%
in that in both cases it says
 
01:15:41.630 --> 01:15:41.640 align:start position:0%
you know manufacturing prepare package
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
these are similar in overlapping terms
 
01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
and cell cannabis and cannabis products
 
01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
to other cannabis product manufacturing
 
01:15:50.450 --> 01:15:50.460 align:start position:0%
facilities alternative treatment centers
 
01:15:53.209 --> 01:15:53.219 align:start position:0%
to retail Cannabis stores but not to
 
01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
Consumers now I understand that there's
 
01:15:56.930 --> 01:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
a need to define the two different terms
 
01:15:59.149 --> 01:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
I understand there's overlap
 
01:16:02.169 --> 01:16:02.179 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:07.739 align:start position:0%
then when we go back to page 22
 
01:16:11.630 --> 01:16:11.640 align:start position:0%
and we Define what this 15 tax applies
 
01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:12.950 align:start position:0%
and we Define what this 15 tax applies
to

01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:15.900 align:start position:0%
we use only the term cannabis
 
01:16:18.050 --> 01:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
cultivation facilities
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
should we be adding
 
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis product manufacturing facility
 
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
is that not also the wholesaler for
 
01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
certain variants of the product
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
the tax should be applied at any time
 
01:16:38.689 --> 01:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
the product is leaving a manufacturing
 
01:16:41.330 --> 01:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
facility in any form
 
01:16:43.870 --> 01:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
so given that
 
01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:48.780 align:start position:0%
I would think we would want to amend
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
the language on page 22 line 27 and 28
 
01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
to insert after cannabis cultivation
 
01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.729 align:start position:0%
to insert after cannabis cultivation
facilities

01:16:58.729 --> 01:16:58.739 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
the phrase
 
01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
or cannabis product manufacturing
 
01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
facility and that would Cover the
 
01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.229 align:start position:0%
facility and that would Cover the
Waterfront

01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
Waterfront
 
01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
consistent I believe with what you've
 
01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.229 align:start position:0%
consistent I believe with what you've
explained

01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
explained
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
I'd agree
 
01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
I the only thing I would add if there's
 
01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:21.420 align:start position:0%
if there's other deficiencies in the
 
01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
language I just want to be certain that
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
whenever the product leaves whether it's
 
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
a three thousand dollar pound of flour
 
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
or a ten dollar brownie yes it's taxed
 
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
at that number once one time so perhaps
 
01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
we use the term either or because we
 
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to apply two-point taxation
 
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to keep going down this
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
side and then we'll come swing back
 
01:17:53.810 --> 01:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
around representative Leafly
 
01:17:57.530 --> 01:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
so just so we can continue Along on this
 
01:17:57.540 --> 01:17:58.910 align:start position:0%
so just so we can continue Along on this
this

01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
um think through of this part of the
 
01:18:04.669 --> 01:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
bill it seems like you would never want
 
01:18:04.679 --> 01:18:06.229 align:start position:0%
bill it seems like you would never want
to

01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:09.300 align:start position:0%
have the tax fall on the brownie right
 
01:18:11.209 --> 01:18:11.219 align:start position:0%
if you're someone who wants to make
 
01:18:13.610 --> 01:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
money obviously you would be paying a
 
01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
lot more money on a manufactured
 
01:18:19.370 --> 01:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
finished product that's ready to go to
 
01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:21.050 align:start position:0%
finished product that's ready to go to
retail

01:18:21.050 --> 01:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
retail
 
01:18:22.729 --> 01:18:22.739 align:start position:0%
so it seems like
 
01:18:24.890 --> 01:18:24.900 align:start position:0%
by definition you would be setting up
 
01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:27.890 align:start position:0%
by definition you would be setting up
the

01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:27.900 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
the industry to tax at the
 
01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
to tax a cultivator let me just but
 
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
isn't right the tax based on the value
 
01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
they've already decided on
 
01:18:41.689 --> 01:18:41.699 align:start position:0%
who is they the market no the liquor
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission so the Liquor
 
01:18:47.149 --> 01:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
Commission is setting the price
 
01:18:49.370 --> 01:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
oh they're setting the value the excise
 
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
tax value
 
01:18:53.209 --> 01:18:53.219 align:start position:0%
the value which upon the excise tax will
 
01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
be charged am I correct correct me if
 
01:18:58.910 --> 01:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong thank you okay can can we
 
01:19:02.689 --> 01:19:02.699 align:start position:0%
pause here so is the excise tax the 15
 
01:19:02.699 --> 01:19:05.689 align:start position:0%
pause here so is the excise tax the 15
percent

01:19:05.689 --> 01:19:05.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
you would if you're involved in this
 
01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:12.530 align:start position:0%
you would if you're involved in this
industry

01:19:12.530 --> 01:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
industry
 
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
you would not be interested in paying a
 
01:19:18.050 --> 01:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
tax on a brownie that is going to sell
 
01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
for ten dollars right you don't want to
 
01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
pay 15 on ten dollars
 
01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
if you could pay
 
01:19:28.610 --> 01:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
a much smaller rate
 
01:19:34.729 --> 01:19:34.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:36.530 --> 01:19:36.540 align:start position:0%
the price wouldn't be tempting would you
 
01:19:38.990 --> 01:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
care to comment or clarify
 
01:19:41.630 --> 01:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
if you could pay if if I'm selling if
 
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
I'm in the market of selling cakes
 
01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
if I could pay my taxes on the flower
 
01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
that is valued lower than my pastry I
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
would pay the taxes on the flower I
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
would never choose to pay the taxes on
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
the pastry right so I guess my question
 
01:20:01.370 --> 01:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
is when we write a bill that says you
 
01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
can pay 15 percent on the flower or on
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
the on the pastry the finished pastry
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
there would be no interest in paying it
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
on the finished pastry right
 
01:20:14.209 --> 01:20:14.219 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to think through what
 
01:20:17.090 --> 01:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
what this looks like in the industry out
 
01:20:19.370 --> 01:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
in the wild let me just see if the
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner has anything to say and
 
01:20:22.130 --> 01:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
then we'll go around and keep going
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
around the room thank you anything to
 
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
comment or clarify
 
01:20:29.390 --> 01:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
at this point okay representative
 
01:20:32.209 --> 01:20:32.219 align:start position:0%
elberger I've got a couple of questions
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm feeling like I'm more confused
 
01:20:36.410 --> 01:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
now than I was at the beginning
 
01:20:40.130 --> 01:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
um at the bottom of page three
 
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
it says a cannabis cultivation facility
 
01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
shall not
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
produce cannabis concentrates tinctures
 
01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
extracts or other cannabis products
 
01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
and yet we're talking on page 22
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
about cannabis cultivation facilities
 
01:20:57.410 --> 01:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
can do all those things
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering about why it says on
 
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
one page shall not and on another page
 
01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
it says it's fine
 
01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
no where does it say that on kitchen 22.
 
01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:13.130 align:start position:0%
no where does it say that on kitchen 22.
yeah

01:21:13.130 --> 01:21:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:14.209 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:21:14.209 --> 01:21:14.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:17.689 --> 01:21:17.699 align:start position:0%
line 27 and on page three
 
01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
36 shall not
 
01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:21.470 align:start position:0%
36 shall not
no

01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:21:23.570 --> 01:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say it
 
01:21:26.090 --> 01:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
representative Orr thank you madam chair
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
so I'm sorry can I get an answer to that
 
01:21:30.350 --> 01:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
that was the point
 
01:21:34.130 --> 01:21:34.140 align:start position:0%
of adding the second definition
 
01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
of a cannabis
 
01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:37.729 align:start position:0%
of a cannabis
um

01:21:37.729 --> 01:21:37.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:40.610 --> 01:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
what's our terms product manufacturing
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
facility why are we leaving that not
 
01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.830 align:start position:0%
facility why are we leaving that not
then

01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
on page not just take it out
 
01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
to avoid anybody's confusion
 
01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:55.250 align:start position:0%
to avoid anybody's confusion
right

01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:21:56.810 --> 01:21:56.820 align:start position:0%
but I think they're performing two
 
01:21:59.870 --> 01:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
different roles in the chain of the
 
01:22:03.229 --> 01:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:05.689 --> 01:22:05.699 align:start position:0%
s came from a lot that working group
 
01:22:08.270 --> 01:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
that met over the last year to really
 
01:22:10.490 --> 01:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
understand the industry
 
01:22:12.830 --> 01:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
um so I think it came from that deep
 
01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
dive of understanding I I appreciate the
 
01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:16.910 align:start position:0%
dive of understanding I I appreciate the
work

01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:22:19.870 --> 01:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
I think that a typical human being
 
01:22:23.390 --> 01:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
seeing on this page shall not will
 
01:22:29.709 --> 01:22:29.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:33.070 --> 01:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
maybe I can lessen the confusion here
 
01:22:36.169 --> 01:22:36.179 align:start position:0%
what the my my interpretation of what
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
the cultivator does is from seed to
 
01:22:42.410 --> 01:22:42.420 align:start position:0%
flower okay in this instance and what
 
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
the production component the next
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
component of that would be taking that
 
01:22:50.030 --> 01:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
flower taking that product grown from
 
01:22:52.729 --> 01:22:52.739 align:start position:0%
seed by the cultivators and turning it
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
into what you reference the brownie or a
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
tincture or a topical or or what have
 
01:23:02.330 --> 01:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
you so they're two distinct different
 
01:23:06.770 --> 01:23:06.780 align:start position:0%
processes one one is the grower and one
 
01:23:09.649 --> 01:23:09.659 align:start position:0%
is the person that produces what the
 
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
retail and the third
 
01:23:15.169 --> 01:23:15.179 align:start position:0%
uh Link in the chain would sell retail
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
if if that helps that's my understanding
 
01:23:18.239 --> 01:23:19.209 align:start position:0%
if if that helps that's my understanding
anyway

01:23:19.209 --> 01:23:19.219 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it doesn't because we're using
 
01:23:24.169 --> 01:23:24.179 align:start position:0%
the exact same term
 
01:23:26.810 --> 01:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
cultivation facility representative orrs
 
01:23:29.709 --> 01:23:29.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so the help rep
 
01:23:32.630 --> 01:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
representative alberger I think the
 
01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
answer is this this still needs work
 
01:23:38.810 --> 01:23:38.820 align:start position:0%
last week we talked about taxing at the
 
01:23:41.810 --> 01:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
distributor level I started to touch on
 
01:23:43.850 --> 01:23:43.860 align:start position:0%
that today representative spilsberry
 
01:23:46.669 --> 01:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
gave us the answer
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
at the distributor lever level level The
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission has given us the
 
01:23:53.810 --> 01:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
answer at the distributor level we need
 
01:23:56.450 --> 01:23:56.460 align:start position:0%
to get the wording straight on this when
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
I went online I couldn't believe the
 
01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
products I saw I did some research over
 
01:24:03.470 --> 01:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
the weekend hard to believe but I
 
01:24:05.330 --> 01:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
actually did that because the weather
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
was nice and anyways I try them out was
 
01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:09.890 align:start position:0%
was nice and anyways I try them out was
what

01:24:09.890 --> 01:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:24:12.050 --> 01:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
did you try them out
 
01:24:14.810 --> 01:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
it was virtual
 
01:24:17.149 --> 01:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
but my point is I couldn't believe it
 
01:24:19.850 --> 01:24:19.860 align:start position:0%
was everything is out there cookies
 
01:24:22.630 --> 01:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
chocolate chip cookies chocolates
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
infused drinks gummy bears they actually
 
01:24:28.010 --> 01:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
are gummy bears out there and gummy
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
products and if there was anything you
 
01:24:32.450 --> 01:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
can think of
 
01:24:36.410 --> 01:24:36.420 align:start position:0%
it's there a cup of coffee infused with
 
01:24:39.130 --> 01:24:39.140 align:start position:0%
cannabis I think the Liquor Commission
 
01:24:42.290 --> 01:24:42.300 align:start position:0%
and the Brilliance of their experience
 
01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
says you have to tax it at the level the
 
01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:49.980 align:start position:0%
how did he put it you're going to tax
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
the products in final form that's just
 
01:24:54.050 --> 01:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
what we've been talking about we're kind
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
of dancing around it it's whatever that
 
01:24:59.090 --> 01:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
retail value is whether it's a cookie
 
01:25:01.330 --> 01:25:01.340 align:start position:0%
lollipop a gummy a chocolate a beverage
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
hash flour edible it all makes sense to
 
01:25:07.729 --> 01:25:07.739 align:start position:0%
tax it at whatever the retail value is
 
01:25:10.189 --> 01:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
at that time and then
 
01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
as the Liquor Commission is stated
 
01:25:16.250 --> 01:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
let the let the private Distributors
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
that are selling it figure out whether
 
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's I think he said three percent you
 
01:25:23.630 --> 01:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
know profit margin or 300 percent and
 
01:25:25.970 --> 01:25:25.980 align:start position:0%
that'll that'll level the playing field
 
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
as a who's right and who's wrong and as
 
01:25:30.950 --> 01:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
rep elberger just mentioned I mean she's
 
01:25:32.209 --> 01:25:32.219 align:start position:0%
absolutely right there's some
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
conflicting words in here whether we
 
01:25:38.450 --> 01:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
change it on page 22 as reps billsberry
 
01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
said about cannabis manufacturing
 
01:25:43.370 --> 01:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
facility in the final form
 
01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
this needs to work we have the answer I
 
01:25:48.830 --> 01:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
believe it's it's been it's been
 
01:25:50.930 --> 01:25:50.940 align:start position:0%
verified and given to us from The Liquor
 
01:25:53.930 --> 01:25:53.940 align:start position:0%
Commission it's at this level whatever
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
it is in final form whatever the product
 
01:25:59.930 --> 01:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
is in final form that's where you apply
 
01:26:02.570 --> 01:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
to tax and as it's been mentioned over
 
01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:03.350 align:start position:0%
to tax and as it's been mentioned over
here

01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to really know about
 
01:26:07.370 --> 01:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
except for the fact that representative
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
Jason Osborne was on WMUR over the
 
01:26:11.870 --> 01:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
weekend and said we're creating new tech
 
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
so everybody knows we're creating new
 
01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
tax don't worry about it thank you all
 
01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
right I'm just gonna and try to be fair
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
and just keep going around the room in a
 
01:26:23.810 --> 01:26:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:26.209 --> 01:26:26.219 align:start position:0%
seems to me there's only one solution to
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
this if you want to tax it if you want
 
01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
to raise revenue
 
01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:35.460 align:start position:0%
if you want to collect state revenue at
 
01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:36.890 align:start position:0%
if you want to collect state revenue at
the

01:26:36.890 --> 01:26:36.900 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
at the cultivator level or wholesale
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
level I think people when they I think
 
01:26:43.850 --> 01:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
they're using those two terms
 
01:26:46.669 --> 01:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
interchangeably the only way to do it is
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
to set a fixed amount so much per ounce
 
01:26:53.330 --> 01:26:53.340 align:start position:0%
is going to be the I don't even know if
 
01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
you call it a tax or you call it a
 
01:26:58.129 --> 01:26:58.139 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it I guess I
 
01:27:00.410 --> 01:27:00.420 align:start position:0%
guess you can say attacks so much per
 
01:27:02.090 --> 01:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
ounce and I think that you'd probably
 
01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:04.980 align:start position:0%
want to make a distinction between the
 
01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
flowers and the leaves because I did see
 
01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
not in too many places but I did see
 
01:27:13.490 --> 01:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
that um there's some states make a
 
01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
distinction between those two that's the
 
01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
only way to keep it that works for the
 
01:27:22.669 --> 01:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
integrator it works for the cultivator
 
01:27:22.679 --> 01:27:23.510 align:start position:0%
integrator it works for the cultivator
um

01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:29.390 --> 01:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
it just turned itself off and I've had
 
01:27:36.169 --> 01:27:36.179 align:start position:0%
it on forever on I would like to propose
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
I don't I'm not talking about the tax
 
01:27:42.850 --> 01:27:42.860 align:start position:0%
rate part of it but on page 22 line 27
 
01:27:45.770 --> 01:27:45.780 align:start position:0%
that we change that to a tax on the
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
monthly total gross revenue of licensed
 
01:27:49.199 --> 01:27:52.270 align:start position:0%
monthly total gross revenue of licensed
uh

01:27:52.270 --> 01:27:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis facilities when selling
 
01:27:59.050 --> 01:27:59.060 align:start position:0%
directly to the retailer
 
01:28:03.050 --> 01:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
that is the real wholesale level and it
 
01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't get into how many ounces are in
 
01:28:09.229 --> 01:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
a brownie it gets into what the
 
01:28:11.930 --> 01:28:11.940 align:start position:0%
Brownie's worth with the stuff in it
 
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
okay going back this way did I just add
 
01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:20.940 align:start position:0%
to that since I have uh we we are the
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
tax committee
 
01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:26.639 align:start position:0%
anything to do with taxes inside of this
 
01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:30.719 align:start position:0%
whole document we can change and we
 
01:28:33.290 --> 01:28:33.300 align:start position:0%
should change if we think that it's not
 
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
working as well
 
01:28:37.729 --> 01:28:37.739 align:start position:0%
and we need to get all of that clear
 
01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:42.060 align:start position:0%
before we go into to amendments I think
 
01:28:45.649 --> 01:28:45.659 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I agree with
 
01:28:47.330 --> 01:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
representative Almy
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
I also agree with representative
 
01:28:52.129 --> 01:28:52.139 align:start position:0%
elberger get rid of that shell not up
 
01:28:55.189 --> 01:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
front because we're allowing it to be a
 
01:28:57.530 --> 01:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
cultivator or a manufacturer and we're
 
01:29:00.590 --> 01:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
taxing it at the retail level
 
01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
essentially as it goes to the retailer
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
and so it's it's clear that it's a as as
 
01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
the commissioner already said it's at a
 
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturer level or a cultivated level
 
01:29:14.750 --> 01:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
which whichever is going directly to
 
01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:18.550 align:start position:0%
which whichever is going directly to
Consumers

01:29:18.550 --> 01:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:20.810 --> 01:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury nothing over
 
01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
here representative Spielberg
 
01:29:25.310 --> 01:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh I think we understand the nature of
 
01:29:27.890 --> 01:29:27.900 align:start position:0%
the issue at this point and I would be
 
01:29:30.050 --> 01:29:30.060 align:start position:0%
willing to undertake to put some
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
language together for a review next
 
01:29:31.679 --> 01:29:36.490 align:start position:0%
language together for a review next
Monday

01:29:36.490 --> 01:29:36.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:39.290 --> 01:29:39.300 align:start position:0%
defining as closely as possible that
 
01:29:41.149 --> 01:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
it's the final form at the wholesale
 
01:29:41.159 --> 01:29:43.669 align:start position:0%
it's the final form at the wholesale
level

01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:44.689 --> 01:29:44.699 align:start position:0%
okay we're just going to keep moving
 
01:29:46.129 --> 01:29:46.139 align:start position:0%
right or wrong and then once we get
 
01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
through this cycle I need to leave for
 
01:29:49.010 --> 01:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
another meeting and representative
 
01:29:50.930 --> 01:29:50.940 align:start position:0%
janigan will take over and make sure we
 
01:29:52.250 --> 01:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
get through this representative Doucet
 
01:29:54.530 --> 01:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
thank and I think representative
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
spilsberry and representative almie are
 
01:29:58.490 --> 01:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
on the same page it's just a matter of
 
01:30:00.169 --> 01:30:00.179 align:start position:0%
language agreeing to the language
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
because I think either or can be covered
 
01:30:05.950 --> 01:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
but to representative fellows comment
 
01:30:09.649 --> 01:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
the the commissioner the commission will
 
01:30:14.030 --> 01:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
set what the market price is and and an
 
01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
example that you gave was uh tax again
 
01:30:19.129 --> 01:30:19.139 align:start position:0%
at a certain ounce and we've heard
 
01:30:21.129 --> 01:30:21.139 align:start position:0%
testimony that there are certain
 
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
concentration levels there's certain
 
01:30:26.570 --> 01:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
quality levels there's uh
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
my Ferrari is going to be taxed at a
 
01:30:32.450 --> 01:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
higher rate than my Hyundai okay and and
 
01:30:35.390 --> 01:30:35.400 align:start position:0%
that that's the case the THC content in
 
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
this product
 
01:30:40.010 --> 01:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
can be grown and cultivated to be at a
 
01:30:41.330 --> 01:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
higher level
 
01:30:44.510 --> 01:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
depending on the strain from the from
 
01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
the testimony that I've heard okay which
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
makes it a more valuable a more
 
01:30:54.290 --> 01:30:54.300 align:start position:0%
profitable a a higher uh Market
 
01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:55.430 align:start position:0%
profitable a a higher uh Market
price

01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
price
 
01:30:57.530 --> 01:30:57.540 align:start position:0%
and they would tax it at that market
 
01:31:01.129 --> 01:31:01.139 align:start position:0%
price so I don't know that whether the
 
01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
weight of measure matters or not but I I
 
01:31:05.689 --> 01:31:05.699 align:start position:0%
have great confidence that they'll
 
01:31:08.209 --> 01:31:08.219 align:start position:0%
they'll navigate that but I I don't
 
01:31:10.370 --> 01:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
think we can just put put a one ounce
 
01:31:13.129 --> 01:31:13.139 align:start position:0%
thing on it has to be the market price
 
01:31:15.649 --> 01:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
that may be something we could further
 
01:31:17.149 --> 01:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
clarify when we give them rulemaking
 
01:31:19.010 --> 01:31:19.020 align:start position:0%
Authority the types of things we'd like
 
01:31:21.290 --> 01:31:21.300 align:start position:0%
them to consider as part of their rule
 
01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
making on that anyway representative
 
01:31:26.990 --> 01:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
Leafly thank you so again I thought it
 
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
was clear and now I'm confused
 
01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
um so I thought we were talking about a
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
15 tax and we are trying to figure out
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
where to put it right how do we get at
 
01:31:40.850 --> 01:31:40.860 align:start position:0%
the value of the product
 
01:31:43.129 --> 01:31:43.139 align:start position:0%
um if we're also going to be adding
 
01:31:45.770 --> 01:31:45.780 align:start position:0%
we're just giving the Liquor Commission
 
01:31:49.010 --> 01:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
authority to add additional taxes I'm
 
01:31:50.830 --> 01:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
not clear on that
 
01:31:54.890 --> 01:31:54.900 align:start position:0%
no I I believe that I'm speaking very
 
01:31:59.290 --> 01:31:59.300 align:start position:0%
much in alignment with your comments
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
of 15 with some language to help The
 
01:32:07.970 --> 01:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission uh establish rules as
 
01:32:10.669 --> 01:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
to what exactly they're taxing
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
and we will have that language
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm referring to
 
01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:17.110 align:start position:0%
so I'm referring to
um

01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
representative doucet's comments about
 
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
ounces and THC value
 
01:32:28.010 --> 01:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
my thinking is that again the market and
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
I would say we should tax the retail
 
01:32:33.709 --> 01:32:33.719 align:start position:0%
value of the product because it's the
 
01:32:37.129 --> 01:32:37.139 align:start position:0%
clearest thing it the market will decide
 
01:32:39.830 --> 01:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
the value of something based on a number
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
of factors because consumers are so
 
01:32:44.930 --> 01:32:44.940 align:start position:0%
Savvy right they're going to look at a
 
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
product and they're going to consider
 
01:32:49.070 --> 01:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
the THC value they're going to consider
 
01:32:51.530 --> 01:32:51.540 align:start position:0%
the ounces they're going to consider the
 
01:32:53.209 --> 01:32:53.219 align:start position:0%
need that their
 
01:32:55.970 --> 01:32:55.980 align:start position:0%
you know meeting with the purchase of
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
the product so it seems to me that the
 
01:33:00.410 --> 01:33:00.420 align:start position:0%
clearest easiest
 
01:33:03.649 --> 01:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
way to do it is a 15 tax on the retail
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
value because again I still see this
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
problem if you're vertically integrated
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
like the man from Prime who came and
 
01:33:14.870 --> 01:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
said you know we grow
 
01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
the stuff we manufacture the product and
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
then we sell it at the retail value and
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
sure he can like break those into three
 
01:33:23.689 --> 01:33:23.699 align:start position:0%
separate businesses right the
 
01:33:25.490 --> 01:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
cultivating business the manufacturing
 
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
business the retail business
 
01:33:29.930 --> 01:33:29.940 align:start position:0%
but what are you selling that to
 
01:33:33.709 --> 01:33:33.719 align:start position:0%
yourself at is unclear to him today
 
01:33:36.410 --> 01:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
but the price of that gummy being sold
 
01:33:39.229 --> 01:33:39.239 align:start position:0%
to a consumer is Crystal Clear to him
 
01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
and so taxing it there we don't The
 
01:33:44.030 --> 01:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission wouldn't need to have
 
01:33:47.450 --> 01:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
a conversation about THC levels the
 
01:33:49.850 --> 01:33:49.860 align:start position:0%
consumer is going to
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
establish the value of the product and I
 
01:33:55.610 --> 01:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
think that also addresses your concern
 
01:33:58.810 --> 01:33:58.820 align:start position:0%
about Revenue generation if we're taxing
 
01:34:02.450 --> 01:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
the bud as it comes off the plant
 
01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
there's a whole bunch of value added
 
01:34:06.830 --> 01:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
that you're missing out on taxing so I
 
01:34:09.169 --> 01:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
feel like it's the cleanest but I am
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
feel like we are getting a lot closer to
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
zeroing in on this thank you
 
01:34:15.770 --> 01:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
why do you feel like we're getting
 
01:34:18.169 --> 01:34:18.179 align:start position:0%
closer that's representative Spielberg
 
01:34:21.410 --> 01:34:21.420 align:start position:0%
yeah just just to respond
 
01:34:23.930 --> 01:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
um so let's keep
 
01:34:26.990 --> 01:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
some different things separate
 
01:34:29.689 --> 01:34:29.699 align:start position:0%
I think that representative Doucet was
 
01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
effectively addressing
 
01:34:34.189 --> 01:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
what's problematic
 
01:34:38.510 --> 01:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
about taxing on the basis of weight
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
and there are other parameters the
 
01:34:42.890 --> 01:34:42.900 align:start position:0%
beauty of taxing on price
 
01:34:47.149 --> 01:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
is that price makes all variables
 
01:34:51.050 --> 01:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
into the pie right so I think that you
 
01:34:53.629 --> 01:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
and I representative Ami and others are
 
01:34:55.310 --> 01:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
in agreement
 
01:34:57.290 --> 01:34:57.300 align:start position:0%
that we're better off
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
taxing value
 
01:35:03.169 --> 01:35:03.179 align:start position:0%
you're making a case
 
01:35:06.290 --> 01:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
for taxing at the retail level which is
 
01:35:09.050 --> 01:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
more like a sales tax
 
01:35:10.970 --> 01:35:10.980 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
basically the discussion is now boiled
 
01:35:15.110 --> 01:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
down to I think
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
if we can all agree we want a tax value
 
01:35:21.470 --> 01:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
will it be at the wholesale level or
 
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
will it include the Retailer's markup
 
01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
the wholesale level as has been
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
explained by the commissioner
 
01:35:32.570 --> 01:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
is intended to be where the product has
 
01:35:35.090 --> 01:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
reached its final form
 
01:35:37.490 --> 01:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
but has not yet
 
01:35:40.010 --> 01:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
at a retail markup
 
01:35:42.530 --> 01:35:42.540 align:start position:0%
if we can craft language that would
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%
capture that thought
 
01:35:46.129 --> 01:35:46.139 align:start position:0%
it strikes me we would have a clear
 
01:35:48.410 --> 01:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee would you go
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
along with it I agree
 
01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
could I respond to that I feel like
 
01:35:57.590 --> 01:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
we're getting so close so
 
01:35:57.600 --> 01:35:59.330 align:start position:0%
we're getting so close so
probably

01:35:59.330 --> 01:35:59.340 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:36:01.129 --> 01:36:01.139 align:start position:0%
um because the only problem I have with
 
01:36:03.169 --> 01:36:03.179 align:start position:0%
the wholesale is that how do we actually
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
know that's the value whereas the retail
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
Market we know that's the value because
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
somebody's buying it somebody who's not
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
yourself right
 
01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
um but the other little piece I want to
 
01:36:16.490 --> 01:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
add is I feel like there's a concern
 
01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
that it's too like a sales tax which I
 
01:36:21.890 --> 01:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
think is a valid concern here in New
 
01:36:24.290 --> 01:36:24.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I get it but I think we all
 
01:36:26.270 --> 01:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
agree we would not be taxing this
 
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
product if it weren't regular product
 
01:36:33.070 --> 01:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
right it's not a sales tax it is a tax
 
01:36:37.729 --> 01:36:37.739 align:start position:0%
on a drug right it is a tax on a drug
 
01:36:39.470 --> 01:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
that is currently illegal in New
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so the reason we want to tax
 
01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
it is not because it's being sold and we
 
01:36:47.689 --> 01:36:47.699 align:start position:0%
want to profit from the sale of a
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
product right as if it were a shirt or a
 
01:36:53.689 --> 01:36:53.699 align:start position:0%
carton of milk it's not a sales tax
 
01:36:57.530 --> 01:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
right just because we're we're letting
 
01:36:59.390 --> 01:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
letting the market determine the value
 
01:37:02.450 --> 01:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
of the product it's not a sales tax it's
 
01:37:04.250 --> 01:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
not creeping into we're going to tax
 
01:37:06.590 --> 01:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
everything it's
 
01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
this we want to tax it for the same
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
reason that we control alcohol sales and
 
01:37:13.970 --> 01:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
that we tax tobacco in the state so I
 
01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
think it would be more appropriate to
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
call it you know a cannabis tax because
 
01:37:20.209 --> 01:37:20.219 align:start position:0%
that's what we want to tax here we don't
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
want to tax a sale
 
01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
so I understand the concern about
 
01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
placing that tax at the retail
 
01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
um level but if that's the best place
 
01:37:34.490 --> 01:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:36.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:37:39.709 --> 01:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
thank you I agree with you by the way it
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
makes sense in the same way that
 
01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
if you're selling cakes and I'm selling
 
01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:46.070 align:start position:0%
if you're selling cakes and I'm selling
cakes

01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
cakes
 
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
we set the price of our cakes and people
 
01:37:49.970 --> 01:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
buy the cake that they want but
 
01:37:52.370 --> 01:37:52.380 align:start position:0%
one of the questions to shift gears a
 
01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:53.810 align:start position:0%
one of the questions to shift gears a
minute

01:37:53.810 --> 01:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
minute
 
01:37:56.689 --> 01:37:56.699 align:start position:0%
we're looking at as far as I can tell
 
01:37:58.729 --> 01:37:58.739 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
producers and manufacturers here in New
 
01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:02.810 align:start position:0%
producers and manufacturers here in New
Hampshire

01:38:02.810 --> 01:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:38:05.689 --> 01:38:05.699 align:start position:0%
well we know that we have craft beers
 
01:38:07.970 --> 01:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
produced here in New Hampshire and as
 
01:38:09.709 --> 01:38:09.719 align:start position:0%
you pointed out we also have liquor
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
products that are made somewhere else
 
01:38:13.250 --> 01:38:13.260 align:start position:0%
and brought in here
 
01:38:17.090 --> 01:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
how are we dealing with products that
 
01:38:20.810 --> 01:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
are not made in new not grown here if
 
01:38:24.649 --> 01:38:24.659 align:start position:0%
somebody in Massachusetts or Hawaii has
 
01:38:27.490 --> 01:38:27.500 align:start position:0%
a wonderful niche
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
strain of marijuana and people want to
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
bring it in here how are we taxing them
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
are we going back to Hawaii and taxing
 
01:38:39.890 --> 01:38:39.900 align:start position:0%
years get anything from Hawaii it's
 
01:38:42.050 --> 01:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
forbidden by the federal it's it was an
 
01:38:44.209 --> 01:38:44.219 align:start position:0%
example it's illegal today
 
01:38:46.729 --> 01:38:46.739 align:start position:0%
right or Massachusetts it's illegal
 
01:38:49.250 --> 01:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
today but the whole the whole question
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
that we talked about the other day is we
 
01:38:53.149 --> 01:38:53.159 align:start position:0%
don't know how long it's going to be
 
01:38:56.090 --> 01:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
illegal if we put it on the retail
 
01:38:59.030 --> 01:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
product today and tomorrow it becomes
 
01:39:02.629 --> 01:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
legal to import from Maine or Vermont or
 
01:39:04.970 --> 01:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
South Dakota
 
01:39:07.970 --> 01:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
we won't have to revisit this bill and
 
01:39:10.729 --> 01:39:10.739 align:start position:0%
lose Revenue in the meantime because
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
we're not taxing imports from South
 
01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
Dakota we will be all set right
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
okay let me uh come over the side and
 
01:39:21.169 --> 01:39:21.179 align:start position:0%
then we'll come back to representative
 
01:39:24.050 --> 01:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
Colette representative Ames
 
01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:26.750 align:start position:0%
Colette representative Ames
yeah

01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:39:30.770 --> 01:39:30.780 align:start position:0%
yeah I I just wanted to uh
 
01:39:33.770 --> 01:39:33.780 align:start position:0%
back up what you just said I think that
 
01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:34.669 align:start position:0%
back up what you just said I think that
um

01:39:34.669 --> 01:39:34.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:36.770 --> 01:39:36.780 align:start position:0%
that we are moving in a good direction
 
01:39:36.780 --> 01:39:38.149 align:start position:0%
that we are moving in a good direction
here

01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
um but that the retail level is what
 
01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
works in a environment where the
 
01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:46.270 align:start position:0%
works in a environment where the
cross-border

01:39:46.270 --> 01:39:46.280 align:start position:0%
cross-border
 
01:39:50.270 --> 01:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
restriction is no longer operative
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
it works for all the other reasons that
 
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative Leafly and others have uh
 
01:40:01.850 --> 01:40:01.860 align:start position:0%
have uh spoken to it's a better level to
 
01:40:07.310 --> 01:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
work to to uh to come down at
 
01:40:09.410 --> 01:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
in if we're going to look at the long
 
01:40:12.050 --> 01:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
term and we I think we all think that
 
01:40:16.370 --> 01:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
eventually and it may be sooner than
 
01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:18.189 align:start position:0%
eventually and it may be sooner than
later

01:40:18.189 --> 01:40:18.199 align:start position:0%
later
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
the federal restriction that um
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
by perception or by
 
01:40:27.610 --> 01:40:27.620 align:start position:0%
by law however you want to view it is
 
01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
operative right now and and preventing
 
01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:32.090 align:start position:0%
operative right now and and preventing
interstate

01:40:32.090 --> 01:40:32.100 align:start position:0%
interstate
 
01:40:35.570 --> 01:40:35.580 align:start position:0%
sales or transfers of product will go
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
away and if it goes away then the retail
 
01:40:40.669 --> 01:40:40.679 align:start position:0%
level is the level that works otherwise
 
01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
you miss a lot of things so I just
 
01:40:46.209 --> 01:40:46.219 align:start position:0%
wanted to reinforce what has been said
 
01:40:48.530 --> 01:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
on that point
 
01:40:48.540 --> 01:40:51.890 align:start position:0%
on that point
foreign

01:40:51.890 --> 01:40:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:54.110 --> 01:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
yes on
 
01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:55.490 align:start position:0%
yes on
we

01:40:55.490 --> 01:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
compete The Liquor Commission come
 
01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:00.169 align:start position:0%
compete The Liquor Commission come
across

01:41:00.169 --> 01:41:00.179 align:start position:0%
across
 
01:41:03.709 --> 01:41:03.719 align:start position:0%
a fairly large region of the Northeast
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that legally they're
 
01:41:08.450 --> 01:41:08.460 align:start position:0%
not supposed to be moving liquor back
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
and forth across the border uh
 
01:41:17.090 --> 01:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
and what I would like to do is to use
 
01:41:21.169 --> 01:41:21.179 align:start position:0%
whatever language you've got on that
 
01:41:24.590 --> 01:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
allows you to set these the prices in
 
01:41:26.689 --> 01:41:26.699 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission
 
01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
on if we could use that
 
01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
together with the idea of taxing at the
 
01:41:39.890 --> 01:41:39.900 align:start position:0%
level whatever level sells directly to
 
01:41:42.169 --> 01:41:42.179 align:start position:0%
the retailer
 
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
but I don't I it occurs to me that I've
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
never thought about
 
01:41:50.209 --> 01:41:50.219 align:start position:0%
um they that you're an Enterprise this
 
01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
would not be an Enterprise I take it so
 
01:41:56.930 --> 01:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
so perhaps on
 
01:41:59.390 --> 01:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
it would require that which would be
 
01:42:02.689 --> 01:42:02.699 align:start position:0%
quite a change in the structure
 
01:42:07.850 --> 01:42:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
well if the commission is thicker in
 
01:42:11.810 --> 01:42:11.820 align:start position:0%
cannabis then we certainly would would
 
01:42:14.870 --> 01:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
be covered we collect the beer tax now
 
01:42:18.109 --> 01:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
as well and uh
 
01:42:20.930 --> 01:42:20.940 align:start position:0%
to the statement of products that that
 
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
is being sold out of state in the Liquor
 
01:42:26.090 --> 01:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
Commission we we had a letter from the
 
01:42:29.209 --> 01:42:29.219 align:start position:0%
IRS that was written to to us that
 
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
clearly defined the ability to for the
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission to sell product
 
01:42:37.729 --> 01:42:37.739 align:start position:0%
and not require if someone buys product
 
01:42:39.950 --> 01:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
outside of the state that they're in
 
01:42:42.410 --> 01:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
it's their responsibility to pay the tax
 
01:42:45.109 --> 01:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
in the state that they live in yeah so
 
01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:48.719 align:start position:0%
uh the language that allows us to
 
01:42:55.129 --> 01:42:55.139 align:start position:0%
to set price is in in statute and those
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:04.490 --> 01:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
so what would we need to stick in thank
 
01:43:08.090 --> 01:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
you stick in here
 
01:43:10.910 --> 01:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
to give you that same
 
01:43:14.270 --> 01:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
ability I think
 
01:43:18.530 --> 01:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
the discussion that's taken place to tax
 
01:43:21.709 --> 01:43:21.719 align:start position:0%
the product at the retail value is
 
01:43:24.109 --> 01:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
exactly what we've been speaking to
 
01:43:26.810 --> 01:43:26.820 align:start position:0%
there's a value because of the great
 
01:43:29.229 --> 01:43:29.239 align:start position:0%
differentiation of value of each product
 
01:43:32.750 --> 01:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
that's where the state can make the
 
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
largest amount of Revenue and it's very
 
01:43:39.770 --> 01:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
fair for the grower and manufacturer and
 
01:43:43.070 --> 01:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
it's also very profitable for the state
 
01:43:45.530 --> 01:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
I I think that
 
01:43:48.010 --> 01:43:48.020 align:start position:0%
depending on how you
 
01:43:50.930 --> 01:43:50.940 align:start position:0%
finalize what's written I think that
 
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
that we're certainly on track to what we
 
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
our general idea was when we started out
 
01:44:00.169 --> 01:44:00.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:01.790 --> 01:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
representative Platt
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
my initial understanding of this bill
 
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
was that it's strictly at a cultivated
 
01:44:08.689 --> 01:44:08.699 align:start position:0%
level but at the discussion of the
 
01:44:10.729 --> 01:44:10.739 align:start position:0%
wording it's clear it's a distributor
 
01:44:13.010 --> 01:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
level not a cultivated level
 
01:44:17.390 --> 01:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
and that's fine there's some recent uh
 
01:44:19.729 --> 01:44:19.739 align:start position:0%
argument for a retail level
 
01:44:21.530 --> 01:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
is sort of a distributor level
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
distributor level works like the beer we
 
01:44:26.330 --> 01:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
tax at a distributor level and it works
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
fine the retail level is a it's more
 
01:44:30.770 --> 01:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
akin to a sales tax but we call them
 
01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
something different I I'm not falling on
 
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
my sword for uh retail level I think
 
01:44:38.689 --> 01:44:38.699 align:start position:0%
distributed level will work but what
 
01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
what won't work is 15 because there's a
 
01:44:44.450 --> 01:44:44.460 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of added value at a
 
01:44:46.729 --> 01:44:46.739 align:start position:0%
manufacturer level than it was right
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
straight off the farm essentially and so
 
01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
I point out that uh representative uh
 
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
to sets Bill Amendment here drops it to
 
01:44:57.770 --> 01:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
eight percent and we should have a
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
discussion about what's an appropriate
 
01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:00.850 align:start position:0%
discussion about what's an appropriate
rate

01:45:00.850 --> 01:45:00.860 align:start position:0%
rate
 
01:45:03.770 --> 01:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
all right we'll uh we'll get there in a
 
01:45:06.290 --> 01:45:06.300 align:start position:0%
minute let me just get to uh
 
01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:13.850 align:start position:0%
minute let me just get to uh
representative

01:45:13.850 --> 01:45:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:15.890 --> 01:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
put your microphone on please oh could
 
01:45:19.010 --> 01:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
we ask the commissioner to explain the
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
beer tax and how we collect that and how
 
01:45:24.290 --> 01:45:24.300 align:start position:0%
it goes through a warehouse and
 
01:45:26.930 --> 01:45:26.940 align:start position:0%
let me uh it's just so people understand
 
01:45:29.570 --> 01:45:29.580 align:start position:0%
what sure let me just get to
 
01:45:31.609 --> 01:45:31.619 align:start position:0%
representative ulery first thank you
 
01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
representative fellows for taking my
 
01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:34.430 align:start position:0%
representative fellows for taking my
question

01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:45:37.129 --> 01:45:37.139 align:start position:0%
oh wow
 
01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
yes what she said except explain both
 
01:45:43.970 --> 01:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
how you set the value or it's really not
 
01:45:45.709 --> 01:45:45.719 align:start position:0%
setting the value but it's setting your
 
01:45:50.270 --> 01:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
your cost uh basis for taxation purposes
 
01:45:53.450 --> 01:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
and how uh you take the beer out of
 
01:45:56.330 --> 01:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
Merrimack and it goes into a bonded
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
facility and all that yes that needs to
 
01:46:00.830 --> 01:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
be explained to everyone because they
 
01:46:02.810 --> 01:46:02.820 align:start position:0%
don't understand how it operates and I'm
 
01:46:05.390 --> 01:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
presuming that based upon the language
 
01:46:12.649 --> 01:46:12.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:14.689 --> 01:46:14.699 align:start position:0%
based upon the language on here a
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
similar type of bonding or regulated
 
01:46:22.850 --> 01:46:22.860 align:start position:0%
transfer for of uh product will take
 
01:46:22.860 --> 01:46:23.689 align:start position:0%
transfer for of uh product will take
place

01:46:23.689 --> 01:46:23.699 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:46:26.410 --> 01:46:26.420 align:start position:0%
if I'm not incorrect please
 
01:46:30.430 --> 01:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
well the tax on the beer is done on per
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
gallon so it's 30 cents a gallon
 
01:46:41.930 --> 01:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
30 cents a gallon at Manufacturing
 
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
regardless of the cost to sell it that's
 
01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
correct and the similar type of activity
 
01:46:50.450 --> 01:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
takes place with the marijuana bill
 
01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:51.770 align:start position:0%
takes place with the marijuana bill
correct

01:46:51.770 --> 01:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:46:51.780 --> 01:46:54.109 align:start position:0%
correct
no

01:46:54.109 --> 01:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:46:56.030 --> 01:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:47:00.290 --> 01:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
way the idea that we had in mind as I've
 
01:47:02.870 --> 01:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
said if
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
the value of a pound of flour
 
01:47:09.050 --> 01:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
is three thousand dollars now you can
 
01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
use the terminology at wholesale or at
 
01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
retail it's irrelevant my ma in my mind
 
01:47:19.550 --> 01:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
if a brownie is going to sell for ten
 
01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:20.629 align:start position:0%
if a brownie is going to sell for ten
dollars

01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
you pay the fifteen percent on the ten
 
01:47:26.270 --> 01:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
dollars if if a if a pound of flour is
 
01:47:28.189 --> 01:47:28.199 align:start position:0%
going to sell for thirty eight hundred
 
01:47:31.490 --> 01:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
dollars you pay the tax on that that way
 
01:47:33.590 --> 01:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
the tax is paid once and it's paid
 
01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:36.350 align:start position:0%
the tax is paid once and it's paid
through

01:47:36.350 --> 01:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:39.649 --> 01:47:39.659 align:start position:0%
follow-up okay that that
 
01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
makes perfect sense to me the only
 
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:47:46.189 --> 01:47:46.199 align:start position:0%
if we're basing this on a value who sets
 
01:47:48.770 --> 01:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
but we could have it the market sets the
 
01:47:54.770 --> 01:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
value if the market as I said the the
 
01:47:57.590 --> 01:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
market the dollar value of the flower or
 
01:48:00.590 --> 01:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
the anything will will fluctuate
 
01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:02.639 align:start position:0%
I I don't think that will be the same
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
with manufactured products
 
01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:06.410 align:start position:0%
with manufactured products
follow-up

01:48:06.410 --> 01:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:48:07.850 --> 01:48:07.860 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
01:48:10.129 --> 01:48:10.139 align:start position:0%
a brownie is going to a brownie is going
 
01:48:12.430 --> 01:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
to cost
 
01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:14.330 align:start position:0%
to cost
750.

01:48:14.330 --> 01:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
750.
 
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
I bought them recently I I mean 10 bucks
 
01:48:20.330 --> 01:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
all right that's the LSU is 10 bucks
 
01:48:22.490 --> 01:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
it's just a round number if the brownie
 
01:48:26.570 --> 01:48:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:29.209 --> 01:48:29.219 align:start position:0%
two ounces of flour to make that brownie
 
01:48:34.250 --> 01:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:37.010 --> 01:48:37.020 align:start position:0%
the value of two ounces of flour then is
 
01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
how much
 
01:48:41.149 --> 01:48:41.159 align:start position:0%
so that you can figure out what a pound
 
01:48:42.770 --> 01:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
of flour costs
 
01:48:45.649 --> 01:48:45.659 align:start position:0%
when it's produced well
 
01:48:48.290 --> 01:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the process is the
 
01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
flower would wouldn't be used in the
 
01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
manufacturing of an edible it's a
 
01:48:56.689 --> 01:48:56.699 align:start position:0%
byproduct the flour is of such value
 
01:49:00.410 --> 01:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
that it's sold at flower level only the
 
01:49:02.689 --> 01:49:02.699 align:start position:0%
Edibles are made from the byproduct the
 
01:49:06.830 --> 01:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
trim from the plant itself so you
 
01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:08.530 align:start position:0%
trim from the plant itself so you
the

01:49:08.530 --> 01:49:08.540 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:13.669 --> 01:49:13.679 align:start position:0%
the value of the tax is at the at the
 
01:49:16.430 --> 01:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
price of the product if someone it costs
 
01:49:19.609 --> 01:49:19.619 align:start position:0%
somebody 25 dollars to bake their cake
 
01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
and they want to sell it for 25 that's a
 
01:49:27.050 --> 01:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
business decision if I'm a businessman I
 
01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
want my cake to cost me ten dollars and
 
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
sell it for 25. that's a manufacturing
 
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
and or uh growing level decision but the
 
01:49:39.530 --> 01:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
question that seems to be bugging a
 
01:49:40.850 --> 01:49:40.860 align:start position:0%
bunch of people
 
01:49:47.149 --> 01:49:47.159 align:start position:0%
here is how does that that sale price
 
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
connect with the value or apportioned by
 
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
the agency on the product for taxation
 
01:49:58.370 --> 01:49:58.380 align:start position:0%
purposes well I think just like anything
 
01:50:00.770 --> 01:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
that you you do in business you're going
 
01:50:03.950 --> 01:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
to be in concert effort with those
 
01:50:08.270 --> 01:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and and Growers so that
 
01:50:10.129 --> 01:50:10.139 align:start position:0%
price will be set according to the
 
01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
market if somebody's if somebody says to
 
01:50:15.530 --> 01:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
me the manufacturer knows how much money
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
they want to make on their brownie if
 
01:50:19.970 --> 01:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
the retail on the brownie is ten dollars
 
01:50:22.430 --> 01:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
and it costs them five dollars to make
 
01:50:25.010 --> 01:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
they're comfortable with that so some
 
01:50:27.950 --> 01:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
might not be but it's irrelevant of how
 
01:50:31.250 --> 01:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
in my mind how you get to the price of
 
01:50:34.370 --> 01:50:34.380 align:start position:0%
of what it costs them to make it the
 
01:50:36.530 --> 01:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
most important piece is we're taxing at
 
01:50:40.490 --> 01:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
the retail dollars so if some to go back
 
01:50:42.649 --> 01:50:42.659 align:start position:0%
to the flower the you know the flour and
 
01:50:45.770 --> 01:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
baking the cake initiative uh to me it's
 
01:50:47.209 --> 01:50:47.219 align:start position:0%
it's irrelevant
 
01:50:53.090 --> 01:50:53.100 align:start position:0%
if you want to put a a pound of of X in
 
01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
your cake and the THC level is higher I
 
01:50:58.910 --> 01:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
think as a manufacturer you're a
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
business person you're going to say it
 
01:51:03.410 --> 01:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
cost me this much to make this I have to
 
01:51:06.290 --> 01:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
charge this much to sell it
 
01:51:09.530 --> 01:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
so those are decisions that are that are
 
01:51:12.109 --> 01:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
made at a at a growing and Manufacturing
 
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
level the value of of what it costs to
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
make someone wouldn't be in business if
 
01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
they put x amount in there in in this
 
01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:32.450 --> 01:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
I understand what you're saying okay
 
01:51:35.209 --> 01:51:35.219 align:start position:0%
I don't see how you can figure out a
 
01:51:35.219 --> 01:51:36.470 align:start position:0%
I don't see how you can figure out a
subjective

01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
subjective
 
01:51:39.050 --> 01:51:39.060 align:start position:0%
excuse me an objective
 
01:51:41.450 --> 01:51:41.460 align:start position:0%
pricing level
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:51:46.250 --> 01:51:46.260 align:start position:0%
scenario there has
 
01:51:48.229 --> 01:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
if you're saying that the market sets
 
01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
the price of the flower or the grain or
 
01:51:54.169 --> 01:51:54.179 align:start position:0%
the bag or you know whatever and I you
 
01:51:56.149 --> 01:51:56.159 align:start position:0%
hear all these reports about X number of
 
01:51:58.490 --> 01:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of uh marijuana being
 
01:52:00.590 --> 01:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
captured coming across the Arizona
 
01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:02.450 align:start position:0%
captured coming across the Arizona
border

01:52:02.450 --> 01:52:02.460 align:start position:0%
border
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
who sets that price where does it come
 
01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:05.870 align:start position:0%
who sets that price where does it come
from

01:52:05.870 --> 01:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:52:09.290 --> 01:52:09.300 align:start position:0%
and I think that is the question that a
 
01:52:11.390 --> 01:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
lot of people are trying to get their
 
01:52:13.669 --> 01:52:13.679 align:start position:0%
their their
 
01:52:19.750 --> 01:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:22.370 --> 01:52:22.380 align:start position:0%
did you want did you have a follow-up to
 
01:52:27.890 --> 01:52:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:30.830 --> 01:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
could you explain what you mean by the
 
01:52:33.290 --> 01:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
retail price
 
01:52:36.530 --> 01:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
the way I'm listening to it I think that
 
01:52:39.290 --> 01:52:39.300 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about is what
 
01:52:44.209 --> 01:52:44.219 align:start position:0%
they plan to sell it to the retailer for
 
01:52:46.669 --> 01:52:46.679 align:start position:0%
now the retail price in my mind would
 
01:52:50.810 --> 01:52:50.820 align:start position:0%
would be what the retailer is charging
 
01:52:54.229 --> 01:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
so we'd be taxing that
 
01:52:56.930 --> 01:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
that assumption even though you expect
 
01:53:00.169 --> 01:53:00.179 align:start position:0%
the retailers to all be selling at
 
01:53:02.270 --> 01:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
different prices well I I think just
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
like any business there will be people
 
01:53:06.410 --> 01:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
selling product at different prices and
 
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
to me it the discussion this was enough
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
this was the idea that we had that in
 
01:53:15.229 --> 01:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
order for the state to maximize the
 
01:53:17.350 --> 01:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
revenue that they were going to get
 
01:53:20.149 --> 01:53:20.159 align:start position:0%
regardless of how the product obviously
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
there's going to be rules and
 
01:53:24.070 --> 01:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
regulations on how the product is
 
01:53:27.770 --> 01:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
manufactured and the THC level that is
 
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
that's for the manufacturers and Growers
 
01:53:32.030 --> 01:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
to take into effect
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
but in in our minds If the product is
 
01:53:39.169 --> 01:53:39.179 align:start position:0%
going to be sold for x amount of dollars
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
we want to tax it at the highest
 
01:53:44.209 --> 01:53:44.219 align:start position:0%
possible level so in order to tax it at
 
01:53:47.209 --> 01:53:47.219 align:start position:0%
the retail level whatever the price if
 
01:53:49.550 --> 01:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
that product is going to be in someone's
 
01:53:52.729 --> 01:53:52.739 align:start position:0%
case in their store at ten dollars that
 
01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
that dollar fifty has already been paid
 
01:53:58.910 --> 01:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
at 15 percent that dollar fifty tax has
 
01:54:03.250 --> 01:54:03.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
how can the
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
on manufacturer know what the retailer
 
01:54:12.189 --> 01:54:12.199 align:start position:0%
is going to charge well
 
01:54:15.530 --> 01:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
when he transfers it over unless he is
 
01:54:19.250 --> 01:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
the retailer the man the manufacturer we
 
01:54:21.169 --> 01:54:21.179 align:start position:0%
would set the price of that product
 
01:54:23.149 --> 01:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
whatever it's going to be I mean
 
01:54:25.729 --> 01:54:25.739 align:start position:0%
obviously there's going to be if you're
 
01:54:27.890 --> 01:54:27.900 align:start position:0%
going to sell we'll go back to alcohol
 
01:54:30.050 --> 01:54:30.060 align:start position:0%
if you're selling alcohol that's a
 
01:54:32.689 --> 01:54:32.699 align:start position:0%
hundred proof it has a higher value than
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
a alcohol that's at 80 proof so these
 
01:54:37.850 --> 01:54:37.860 align:start position:0%
are these are all the gyrations that
 
01:54:39.729 --> 01:54:39.739 align:start position:0%
will have to be taken into consideration
 
01:54:42.890 --> 01:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
in rule making I mean nothing is set in
 
01:54:46.129 --> 01:54:46.139 align:start position:0%
stone as far as the idea of how we'd
 
01:54:48.050 --> 01:54:48.060 align:start position:0%
like to do it yeah I think that's that's
 
01:54:49.970 --> 01:54:49.980 align:start position:0%
a good point I think part of the maybe
 
01:54:52.490 --> 01:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
part of the confusion here is that in
 
01:54:55.010 --> 01:54:55.020 align:start position:0%
rulemaking many of these uh product
 
01:54:55.020 --> 01:54:56.330 align:start position:0%
rulemaking many of these uh product
levels

01:54:56.330 --> 01:54:56.340 align:start position:0%
levels
 
01:54:58.250 --> 01:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
um you know how much THC is in a product
 
01:55:00.590 --> 01:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
and so forth that's where the value will
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
be set and that's where the tax will be
 
01:55:05.209 --> 01:55:05.219 align:start position:0%
upon I think I'm getting the sense that
 
01:55:07.129 --> 01:55:07.139 align:start position:0%
people are thinking too much about a
 
01:55:08.930 --> 01:55:08.940 align:start position:0%
finished product like a brownie or a
 
01:55:10.490 --> 01:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
gummy I don't know what all the
 
01:55:12.350 --> 01:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
different products are but it it's more
 
01:55:15.709 --> 01:55:15.719 align:start position:0%
about what is the content of these
 
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
things my understanding is that
 
01:55:19.850 --> 01:55:19.860 align:start position:0%
basically what you're saying
 
01:55:22.609 --> 01:55:22.619 align:start position:0%
well yes and and there's it's kind of
 
01:55:25.490 --> 01:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
two-fold because I also think that the
 
01:55:28.970 --> 01:55:28.980 align:start position:0%
manufacturer when we buy a bottle of rum
 
01:55:32.270 --> 01:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
we'll buy a bottle of Bacardi we know in
 
01:55:34.729 --> 01:55:34.739 align:start position:0%
the market what it will sell for not
 
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
only in our Market but in the markets
 
01:55:39.410 --> 01:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
around us as a business person we're
 
01:55:41.090 --> 01:55:41.100 align:start position:0%
certainly not we don't want to sell it
 
01:55:44.689 --> 01:55:44.699 align:start position:0%
for for more because we're not going to
 
01:55:46.490 --> 01:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
we're not going to move the product we
 
01:55:47.930 --> 01:55:47.940 align:start position:0%
don't want to sell it for too little
 
01:55:49.550 --> 01:55:49.560 align:start position:0%
because then we're not going to make the
 
01:55:51.890 --> 01:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
profit so there's that sweet spot where
 
01:55:54.290 --> 01:55:54.300 align:start position:0%
you attract people to buy your product
 
01:55:57.290 --> 01:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
and the price is competitive
 
01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up yes I still
 
01:56:03.410 --> 01:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
don't quite understand are you going to
 
01:56:03.420 --> 01:56:04.490 align:start position:0%
don't quite understand are you going to
tax

01:56:04.490 --> 01:56:04.500 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:56:08.750 --> 01:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
each route basically tax the retailers
 
01:56:11.689 --> 01:56:11.699 align:start position:0%
but somehow do it at the wholesaler
 
01:56:16.010 --> 01:56:16.020 align:start position:0%
level on tax them on the basis of what
 
01:56:18.770 --> 01:56:18.780 align:start position:0%
they're charging in their store or are
 
01:56:21.229 --> 01:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
you going to go through
 
01:56:25.669 --> 01:56:25.679 align:start position:0%
what usually the price usually is of
 
01:56:29.330 --> 01:56:29.340 align:start position:0%
that particular item across several
 
01:56:32.629 --> 01:56:32.639 align:start position:0%
states to start with and then and then
 
01:56:35.209 --> 01:56:35.219 align:start position:0%
tax at that level
 
01:56:38.030 --> 01:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
the the for the retail price the product
 
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
will be taxed at the finished product at
 
01:56:44.689 --> 01:56:44.699 align:start position:0%
the retail price the manuf the retailer
 
01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
pays will pay no tax because for lack of
 
01:56:50.990 --> 01:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
a better way to put it the tax is
 
01:56:53.810 --> 01:56:53.820 align:start position:0%
already baked in to the brownie the tax
 
01:56:57.050 --> 01:56:57.060 align:start position:0%
is already it's already there with the
 
01:56:59.689 --> 01:56:59.699 align:start position:0%
price of the pound of flour so the
 
01:57:02.030 --> 01:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturer says this pound of flour at
 
01:57:05.090 --> 01:57:05.100 align:start position:0%
retail is thirty eight hundred dollars
 
01:57:07.189 --> 01:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
you add the fifteen percent to that
 
01:57:09.890 --> 01:57:09.900 align:start position:0%
number this pound of flour is twelve
 
01:57:11.629 --> 01:57:11.639 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars you add the fifteen
 
01:57:14.870 --> 01:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
percent to that this bag of Edibles is
 
01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
15. you add the tax to that this
 
01:57:20.330 --> 01:57:20.340 align:start position:0%
particular uh edible is only ten so
 
01:57:21.890 --> 01:57:21.900 align:start position:0%
that's how
 
01:57:24.770 --> 01:57:24.780 align:start position:0%
so you're not charging the markup you're
 
01:57:27.470 --> 01:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
charging this on the cost of production
 
01:57:29.209 --> 01:57:29.219 align:start position:0%
oh there's no markup on the liquor
 
01:57:32.270 --> 01:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
commissions part it's strictly whatever
 
01:57:35.930 --> 01:57:35.940 align:start position:0%
tax you decide will be added at the
 
01:57:38.750 --> 01:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
finished product level as it moves to
 
01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:40.129 align:start position:0%
finished product level as it moves to
retail

01:57:40.129 --> 01:57:40.139 align:start position:0%
retail
 
01:57:42.890 --> 01:57:42.900 align:start position:0%
so for that number at retail that's what
 
01:57:45.109 --> 01:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to that's what the idea was
 
01:57:46.990 --> 01:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
to tax at that number
 
01:57:51.229 --> 01:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
okay representative spilsbury
 
01:57:56.149 --> 01:57:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh so I think the entire range of our
 
01:57:58.430 --> 01:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
discussion can be boiled down to whether
 
01:58:00.890 --> 01:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
we're taxing on the value the retailer
 
01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:02.089 align:start position:0%
we're taxing on the value the retailer
pays

01:58:02.089 --> 01:58:02.099 align:start position:0%
pays
 
01:58:04.609 --> 01:58:04.619 align:start position:0%
or whether it includes the Retailer's
 
01:58:04.619 --> 01:58:05.510 align:start position:0%
or whether it includes the Retailer's
markup

01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
markup
 
01:58:08.270 --> 01:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
so that's a decision for the committee
 
01:58:11.089 --> 01:58:11.099 align:start position:0%
I just want to point out to go back to
 
01:58:15.229 --> 01:58:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:19.310 --> 01:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
the question about what evolves on the
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
federal level
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
and whether we've structured attacks
 
01:58:27.229 --> 01:58:27.239 align:start position:0%
that is prepared for interstate commerce
 
01:58:29.810 --> 01:58:29.820 align:start position:0%
the answer is it doesn't make a
 
01:58:31.370 --> 01:58:31.380 align:start position:0%
difference whether it's the wholesale or
 
01:58:34.609 --> 01:58:34.619 align:start position:0%
the retail level in both cases it works
 
01:58:37.850 --> 01:58:37.860 align:start position:0%
for an imported product so I think we've
 
01:58:42.350 --> 01:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:45.589 --> 01:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:58:48.770 --> 01:58:48.780 align:start position:0%
Alberta thank you
 
01:58:52.070 --> 01:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
um I think the notion of a retail price
 
01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:53.089 align:start position:0%
um I think the notion of a retail price
is

01:58:53.089 --> 01:58:53.099 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:58:55.790 --> 01:58:55.800 align:start position:0%
quite unrealistic
 
01:58:55.800 --> 01:58:56.750 align:start position:0%
quite unrealistic
um

01:58:56.750 --> 01:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:00.709 --> 01:59:00.719 align:start position:0%
a retailer is selling based on
 
01:59:04.669 --> 01:59:04.679 align:start position:0%
per or his costs somebody who has a shop
 
01:59:07.609 --> 01:59:07.619 align:start position:0%
in Nashua is paying high higher costs
 
01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
for their real estate than someone who
 
01:59:14.089 --> 01:59:14.099 align:start position:0%
is who has a shop in Berlin just because
 
01:59:16.910 --> 01:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
the cost of real estate is higher
 
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
so I I have a very hard time with the
 
01:59:21.589 --> 01:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
notion of a consistent
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
retail price here and quite honestly I
 
01:59:25.679 --> 01:59:27.430 align:start position:0%
retail price here and quite honestly I
think

01:59:27.430 --> 01:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:59:29.930 --> 01:59:29.940 align:start position:0%
that the most
 
01:59:33.709 --> 01:59:33.719 align:start position:0%
logical in my mind way to go is to set
 
01:59:39.290 --> 01:59:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:42.770 --> 01:59:42.780 align:start position:0%
I just want to ask a clarifying question
 
01:59:46.010 --> 01:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
I mean we're I think we're still getting
 
01:59:48.589 --> 01:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
in the weeds of a of specific retail
 
01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
products and how much they're worth
 
01:59:50.639 --> 01:59:51.950 align:start position:0%
products and how much they're worth
versus

01:59:51.950 --> 01:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
versus
 
01:59:55.010 --> 01:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
the value of the components aren't we
 
01:59:56.510 --> 01:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
really talking about the value of the
 
01:59:56.520 --> 01:59:58.790 align:start position:0%
really talking about the value of the
components

01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
components
 
02:00:01.790 --> 02:00:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:04.310 --> 02:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative maybe I can offer an
 
02:00:07.550 --> 02:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
analogy here as simple as it may
 
02:00:10.370 --> 02:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
and and we we could sit and talk about a
 
02:00:12.530 --> 02:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
sales tax or whatever label you want to
 
02:00:16.070 --> 02:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
put on it okay but but the fact remains
 
02:00:19.669 --> 02:00:19.679 align:start position:0%
is we have to entrust the Commission in
 
02:00:23.930 --> 02:00:23.940 align:start position:0%
in coupling what the market value of a
 
02:00:27.109 --> 02:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
product is at when we come to the
 
02:00:28.609 --> 02:00:28.619 align:start position:0%
language that we need to at the
 
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
cultivation and or production level
 
02:00:34.310 --> 02:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's common sense to know that
 
02:00:35.510 --> 02:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
there's going to be differing price
 
02:00:37.490 --> 02:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
points whether it's per ounce per pound
 
02:00:39.770 --> 02:00:39.780 align:start position:0%
you need to measure we shouldn't we
 
02:00:41.149 --> 02:00:41.159 align:start position:0%
shouldn't get into that what we should
 
02:00:44.270 --> 02:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
get into is what what the retail sale
 
02:00:47.089 --> 02:00:47.099 align:start position:0%
what and we keep into changing retail
 
02:00:48.830 --> 02:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
and wholesale and forgive me for doing
 
02:00:48.840 --> 02:00:49.790 align:start position:0%
and wholesale and forgive me for doing
that

02:00:49.790 --> 02:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:00:53.089 --> 02:00:53.099 align:start position:0%
what we need to do is say we have a uh a
 
02:00:56.089 --> 02:00:56.099 align:start position:0%
silk shirt made by Versace
 
02:00:58.970 --> 02:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
and I have a Fruit of the Loom canvas
 
02:01:02.510 --> 02:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
t-shirt two two T-shirts one of them is
 
02:01:04.669 --> 02:01:04.679 align:start position:0%
worth a little more than the other I
 
02:01:07.129 --> 02:01:07.139 align:start position:0%
have to have faith in the commission and
 
02:01:09.890 --> 02:01:09.900 align:start position:0%
whomever he assigns or whatever division
 
02:01:15.410 --> 02:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
they assign to to give that price that
 
02:01:18.290 --> 02:01:18.300 align:start position:0%
that market value and we tax on that
 
02:01:22.010 --> 02:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
market value at the level that the the
 
02:01:25.010 --> 02:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
uh silkworms are spinning it or at the
 
02:01:27.649 --> 02:01:27.659 align:start position:0%
level of the Craftsman that put the
 
02:01:30.109 --> 02:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
shirts together and we'll have to Cobble
 
02:01:32.149 --> 02:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
that language together but the fact
 
02:01:34.310 --> 02:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
remains is we have to have faith that
 
02:01:36.830 --> 02:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
somebody has to set what market value is
 
02:01:38.750 --> 02:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
we all know what our houses are worth we
 
02:01:40.669 --> 02:01:40.679 align:start position:0%
all know what our shoes are worth and on
 
02:01:42.649 --> 02:01:42.659 align:start position:0%
and on and on so we can go around and
 
02:01:45.109 --> 02:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
around in circles but we somebody has to
 
02:01:48.709 --> 02:01:48.719 align:start position:0%
set it and and I have great faith that
 
02:01:51.770 --> 02:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
the commission will couple with What's
 
02:01:54.589 --> 02:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
Done in rules we'll figure that out
 
02:01:57.050 --> 02:01:57.060 align:start position:0%
we'll navigate that okay let me ask you
 
02:01:58.729 --> 02:01:58.739 align:start position:0%
a question then representative you said
 
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
so they will in the rules they'll have
 
02:02:04.370 --> 02:02:04.380 align:start position:0%
prices for different retail products now
 
02:02:07.310 --> 02:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
if a retailer wants to sell it at
 
02:02:09.950 --> 02:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
50 more than that go ahead and do it but
 
02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's the point but the tax will be
 
02:02:13.070 --> 02:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
paid on representative that's the point
 
02:02:15.770 --> 02:02:15.780 align:start position:0%
we're getting in way into the minutia it
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with what a retailer
 
02:02:21.530 --> 02:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
sells right his price point if if I
 
02:02:23.629 --> 02:02:23.639 align:start position:0%
decide to do business in Berlin New
 
02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or Nash we're using using the
 
02:02:27.709 --> 02:02:27.719 align:start position:0%
example the representative just did
 
02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
that's that's my decision as a business
 
02:02:32.810 --> 02:02:32.820 align:start position:0%
owner okay and I know it's going to cost
 
02:02:34.490 --> 02:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
me a little less for rent a little more
 
02:02:36.709 --> 02:02:36.719 align:start position:0%
to heat and and so on a little less
 
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
traffic in Berlin as opposed to
 
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
Nashville that's not the point the point
 
02:02:43.490 --> 02:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
is what's the value of the commodity no
 
02:02:45.290 --> 02:02:45.300 align:start position:0%
matter what the commodity is the market
 
02:02:48.530 --> 02:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
value of the commodity going forward we
 
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
have to allow for them to set that bar
 
02:02:53.149 --> 02:02:53.159 align:start position:0%
comparing it whatever metrics they use
 
02:02:56.930 --> 02:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
to set that value okay as approved
 
02:02:58.550 --> 02:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
through rules
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
they set the mark
 
02:03:02.629 --> 02:03:02.639 align:start position:0%
they charge up whatever the tax is at
 
02:03:05.209 --> 02:03:05.219 align:start position:0%
the end at at that level
 
02:03:05.219 --> 02:03:07.310 align:start position:0%
the end at at that level
and

02:03:07.310 --> 02:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:03:09.109 --> 02:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
you know I'm just trying to simplify it
 
02:03:10.850 --> 02:03:10.860 align:start position:0%
a little bit yeah
 
02:03:13.790 --> 02:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative bleepley
 
02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you I have two I have a comment
 
02:03:18.770 --> 02:03:18.780 align:start position:0%
and then a question so my comment would
 
02:03:21.530 --> 02:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
be that what sets the market value
 
02:03:23.810 --> 02:03:23.820 align:start position:0%
is the market it's not a government
 
02:03:23.820 --> 02:03:24.950 align:start position:0%
is the market it's not a government
agency

02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
agency
 
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
so I think there's no way that a
 
02:03:30.709 --> 02:03:30.719 align:start position:0%
government agency can dynamically guess
 
02:03:33.290 --> 02:03:33.300 align:start position:0%
what the market value is for something
 
02:03:33.300 --> 02:03:35.330 align:start position:0%
what the market value is for something
and

02:03:35.330 --> 02:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:03:38.270 --> 02:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
like that's a capitalist system and
 
02:03:40.370 --> 02:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
we've agreed that we want
 
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
this to be sold on the open market by
 
02:03:46.070 --> 02:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
retailers that are overseeing and
 
02:03:49.010 --> 02:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
regulated and not have the commission
 
02:03:49.020 --> 02:03:50.870 align:start position:0%
regulated and not have the commission
sell

02:03:50.870 --> 02:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
sell
 
02:03:53.930 --> 02:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
um cannabis like they sell alcohol so
 
02:03:56.570 --> 02:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that the market is
 
02:04:00.169 --> 02:04:00.179 align:start position:0%
setting the value of the product which
 
02:04:03.350 --> 02:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
will be crystal clear at the retail
 
02:04:05.149 --> 02:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
store you'll walk in and you'll see what
 
02:04:07.850 --> 02:04:07.860 align:start position:0%
the value of things are if the silk
 
02:04:10.070 --> 02:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
shirt is something that's more desirable
 
02:04:12.589 --> 02:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
than the canvas shirt people will be
 
02:04:14.990 --> 02:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
willing to pay more for it so that's my
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
first comment is that I think we have to
 
02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that the way that we've
 
02:04:23.330 --> 02:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
there are other ways to do it but the
 
02:04:25.570 --> 02:04:25.580 align:start position:0%
way that we're talking about
 
02:04:27.770 --> 02:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
taxing this product is based on the
 
02:04:29.990 --> 02:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
market value and the market is the best
 
02:04:34.430 --> 02:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
way to establish that my question is for
 
02:04:37.310 --> 02:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
representative spilsberry
 
02:04:40.129 --> 02:04:40.139 align:start position:0%
um I think he's he's got it right like
 
02:04:41.930 --> 02:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
we've I think we're very close we're
 
02:04:45.050 --> 02:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
talking about how to do this best and
 
02:04:47.149 --> 02:04:47.159 align:start position:0%
one question is is there a way to do it
 
02:04:49.609 --> 02:04:49.619 align:start position:0%
at the wholesale level and I would be
 
02:04:51.709 --> 02:04:51.719 align:start position:0%
fine with that if we can figure out what
 
02:04:53.390 --> 02:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
the market value is at the wholesale
 
02:04:55.490 --> 02:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
level given that some people will be
 
02:04:58.970 --> 02:04:58.980 align:start position:0%
selling growing manufacturing and
 
02:05:00.669 --> 02:05:00.679 align:start position:0%
retelling themselves
 
02:05:04.370 --> 02:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
so my question for you was
 
02:05:06.530 --> 02:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
you said that there wouldn't be a
 
02:05:08.450 --> 02:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
problem with interstate commerce whether
 
02:05:10.189 --> 02:05:10.199 align:start position:0%
we tax at the retail value or the
 
02:05:12.410 --> 02:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
manufacturing value
 
02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
um can you walk me through that because
 
02:05:17.750 --> 02:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
in my brain I'm thinking okay this is
 
02:05:20.030 --> 02:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
manufactured in South Dakota
 
02:05:21.770 --> 02:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
South Dakota
 
02:05:24.830 --> 02:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
taxes their own businesses right so if
 
02:05:26.330 --> 02:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
you have a manufacturing business in
 
02:05:27.310 --> 02:05:27.320 align:start position:0%
South Dakota
 
02:05:29.089 --> 02:05:29.099 align:start position:0%
you're gonna
 
02:05:31.070 --> 02:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
pay for what you're manufacturing and
 
02:05:33.229 --> 02:05:33.239 align:start position:0%
get taxed in South Dakota
 
02:05:37.010 --> 02:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
um if New Hampshire wants to capture
 
02:05:39.530 --> 02:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
taxes can you walk me through would we
 
02:05:41.930 --> 02:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
would we be looking
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
where the how how is it the same for New
 
02:05:46.970 --> 02:05:46.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because I see if we're taxing
 
02:05:50.209 --> 02:05:50.219 align:start position:0%
15 retail that's clear to me I don't
 
02:05:54.350 --> 02:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:54.360 --> 02:05:56.270 align:start position:0%
 
sure

02:05:56.270 --> 02:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:06:01.010 --> 02:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:04.270 --> 02:06:04.280 align:start position:0%
I believe that the commissioner is is
 
02:06:08.270 --> 02:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
using the term wholesale
 
02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
in the context of the cost to the
 
02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:12.830 align:start position:0%
in the context of the cost to the
retailer

02:06:12.830 --> 02:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
retailer
 
02:06:15.950 --> 02:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
of the final form of the product
 
02:06:18.290 --> 02:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
and so it doesn't make a difference if
 
02:06:20.450 --> 02:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
you are trying to ascertain the
 
02:06:22.070 --> 02:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
wholesale value
 
02:06:24.649 --> 02:06:24.659 align:start position:0%
whether it was cultivated in South
 
02:06:26.930 --> 02:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
Dakota or cultivated in New Hampshire in
 
02:06:29.209 --> 02:06:29.219 align:start position:0%
either case the wholesale value is the
 
02:06:30.830 --> 02:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
cost to the retailer
 
02:06:33.770 --> 02:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
who by definition resides or is situated
 
02:06:35.870 --> 02:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so the only thing we're
 
02:06:39.169 --> 02:06:39.179 align:start position:0%
even trying to tax is a sale that occurs
 
02:06:40.550 --> 02:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
02:06:42.709 --> 02:06:42.719 align:start position:0%
that's why it doesn't make a difference
 
02:06:44.570 --> 02:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
from the perspective of interstate
 
02:06:48.169 --> 02:06:48.179 align:start position:0%
commerce whether we tax the value
 
02:06:51.470 --> 02:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
that the retailer obtains the product at
 
02:06:54.890 --> 02:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
versus the value that the retailer sells
 
02:06:57.649 --> 02:06:57.659 align:start position:0%
which is to say to the final consumer
 
02:06:59.870 --> 02:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
so there they both
 
02:07:03.169 --> 02:07:03.179 align:start position:0%
satisfy the concern of whether a law is
 
02:07:04.609 --> 02:07:04.619 align:start position:0%
structured in a way that would
 
02:07:07.010 --> 02:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
accommodate the the evolution of federal
 
02:07:09.830 --> 02:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
law in our Direction
 
02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
is that clear and and I think it's also
 
02:07:13.910 --> 02:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
very important to say
 
02:07:16.850 --> 02:07:16.860 align:start position:0%
that I agree completely
 
02:07:21.229 --> 02:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
with the earlier parts of your comments
 
02:07:23.709 --> 02:07:23.719 align:start position:0%
um we're talking about a market value
 
02:07:27.050 --> 02:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in this law that I see
 
02:07:29.089 --> 02:07:29.099 align:start position:0%
or there's nothing in the commissioner's
 
02:07:31.669 --> 02:07:31.679 align:start position:0%
comments that imply that the commission
 
02:07:33.950 --> 02:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
would set the price
 
02:07:36.169 --> 02:07:36.179 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're talking about
 
02:07:38.510 --> 02:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about monitoring the
 
02:07:45.589 --> 02:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:48.709 --> 02:07:48.719 align:start position:0%
representative Platt thank you Mr Vice
 
02:07:48.719 --> 02:07:50.750 align:start position:0%
representative Platt thank you Mr Vice
chair

02:07:50.750 --> 02:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
um we The Liquor Commission has been
 
02:07:54.649 --> 02:07:54.659 align:start position:0%
very helpful to us today to have us
 
02:07:57.649 --> 02:07:57.659 align:start position:0%
understand the mechanisms and we've
 
02:07:59.510 --> 02:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
discovered that it's not at a wholesale
 
02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
level it's at a distributor level
 
02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
essentially or want either either or if
 
02:08:06.970 --> 02:08:06.980 align:start position:0%
they're wholesaler is the distributor
 
02:08:10.070 --> 02:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
we haven't uh it with the next thing we
 
02:08:11.870 --> 02:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
want the commission to do is estimate
 
02:08:15.709 --> 02:08:15.719 align:start position:0%
revenues and we we can't tele ask the
 
02:08:17.510 --> 02:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
commission to do that till we settle on
 
02:08:19.310 --> 02:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
the great
 
02:08:21.470 --> 02:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
and so I would hope we'd come out of
 
02:08:23.209 --> 02:08:23.219 align:start position:0%
here with a straw poll what rate we
 
02:08:24.410 --> 02:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
could support
 
02:08:26.750 --> 02:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
so that the commission can work on it
 
02:08:28.450 --> 02:08:28.460 align:start position:0%
over the weekend when we come back for
 
02:08:34.390 --> 02:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:36.470 --> 02:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
Let's uh
 
02:08:40.550 --> 02:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
um the time being 12 10. let's try to
 
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
um I'll just take a few more comments in
 
02:08:43.850 --> 02:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
the next five minutes I want to stop at
 
02:08:46.129 --> 02:08:46.139 align:start position:0%
12 15 and
 
02:08:50.510 --> 02:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
um and reconvene at one but um
 
02:08:53.209 --> 02:08:53.219 align:start position:0%
while while the rate is important
 
02:08:54.890 --> 02:08:54.900 align:start position:0%
the the thing that we're getting stuck
 
02:08:57.830 --> 02:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
on is the language of how this should be
 
02:09:00.290 --> 02:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
how this should be taxed and we will get
 
02:09:02.510 --> 02:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
to the rate take a few more questions
 
02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative Army
 
02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:06.950 align:start position:0%
representative Army
on

02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:09:09.589 --> 02:09:09.599 align:start position:0%
first on on this I would like to work
 
02:09:12.290 --> 02:09:12.300 align:start position:0%
with representative billsbury on the
 
02:09:15.770 --> 02:09:15.780 align:start position:0%
language I think it's still not
 
02:09:17.930 --> 02:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
clear enough
 
02:09:20.570 --> 02:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
market value whether we're talking about
 
02:09:23.570 --> 02:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
the cost to the retailer which I think
 
02:09:25.870 --> 02:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
is clear
 
02:09:30.649 --> 02:09:30.659 align:start position:0%
or otherwise but also I don't want to
 
02:09:33.890 --> 02:09:33.900 align:start position:0%
discourage people but we
 
02:09:35.990 --> 02:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
the finance committee doesn't get to
 
02:09:37.370 --> 02:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
look at this
 
02:09:40.370 --> 02:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
on there is all a language about the
 
02:09:43.250 --> 02:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
distribution of whatever money there is
 
02:09:49.010 --> 02:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
which we all know is a little off uh and
 
02:09:53.030 --> 02:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
there is also how much it is going to
 
02:09:55.370 --> 02:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
cause how much The Liquor Commission
 
02:09:55.380 --> 02:09:56.629 align:start position:0%
cause how much The Liquor Commission
needs

02:09:56.629 --> 02:09:56.639 align:start position:0%
needs
 
02:09:59.390 --> 02:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
and anybody else needs to
 
02:10:05.689 --> 02:10:05.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:07.729 --> 02:10:07.739 align:start position:0%
uh representative spilsbury thank you Mr
 
02:10:09.410 --> 02:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
chairman yes
 
02:10:11.089 --> 02:10:11.099 align:start position:0%
um before we break for lunch I just
 
02:10:12.770 --> 02:10:12.780 align:start position:0%
wanted to signal that I think there is
 
02:10:15.410 --> 02:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
an entire discussion to be had about the
 
02:10:15.420 --> 02:10:16.669 align:start position:0%
an entire discussion to be had about the
distribution

02:10:16.669 --> 02:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
02:10:20.209 --> 02:10:20.219 align:start position:0%
of the money and the fund and so we have
 
02:10:22.070 --> 02:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
some work to do when we come back from
 
02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:26.270 align:start position:0%
some work to do when we come back from
lunch

02:10:26.270 --> 02:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:29.030 --> 02:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's right we actually have
 
02:10:31.070 --> 02:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
as uh
 
02:10:33.950 --> 02:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
The Madam chair mentioned there's three
 
02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
areas we're trying to hit Area one is
 
02:10:37.910 --> 02:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
what we're working on right now area two
 
02:10:40.010 --> 02:10:40.020 align:start position:0%
is a distribution and area three is just
 
02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
cleaning up any uh typos and and uh
 
02:10:42.719 --> 02:10:48.169 align:start position:0%
cleaning up any uh typos and and uh
inconsistencies

02:10:48.169 --> 02:10:48.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:50.750 --> 02:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
to make it work
 
02:10:54.649 --> 02:10:54.659 align:start position:0%
right uh representative likely thank you
 
02:10:54.659 --> 02:10:55.490 align:start position:0%
right uh representative likely thank you
um

02:10:55.490 --> 02:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:57.589 --> 02:10:57.599 align:start position:0%
yes I think what can we charge what's
 
02:11:00.109 --> 02:11:00.119 align:start position:0%
the rate and I think it's just a little
 
02:11:02.750 --> 02:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
bit less than our neighbors right and it
 
02:11:04.970 --> 02:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
seems like if this
 
02:11:07.490 --> 02:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
um is accurate that kind of lays out
 
02:11:10.250 --> 02:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
what some of our neighbors are doing am
 
02:11:12.530 --> 02:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
I correct in understanding that that
 
02:11:12.540 --> 02:11:14.870 align:start position:0%
I correct in understanding that that
these

02:11:14.870 --> 02:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:11:16.129 --> 02:11:16.139 align:start position:0%
um I understand there's kind of some
 
02:11:18.649 --> 02:11:18.659 align:start position:0%
breakouts plus sales tax plus whatever
 
02:11:21.229 --> 02:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
but the initial
 
02:11:24.649 --> 02:11:24.659 align:start position:0%
numbers the initial percents are on
 
02:11:24.659 --> 02:11:27.010 align:start position:0%
numbers the initial percents are on
retail

02:11:27.010 --> 02:11:27.020 align:start position:0%
retail
 
02:11:30.229 --> 02:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:38.570 --> 02:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
California 23.3 percent plus cultivation
 
02:11:41.270 --> 02:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
tax up to 1.3 percent by weight that
 
02:11:43.310 --> 02:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
23.3 percent
 
02:11:45.950 --> 02:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
it's not consistently on retail uh
 
02:11:47.330 --> 02:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
representative all me can you answer it
 
02:11:52.430 --> 02:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
yeah on what I did was I took the sales
 
02:11:54.770 --> 02:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
and excise taxes
 
02:11:58.129 --> 02:11:58.139 align:start position:0%
that are clear in here though the
 
02:12:01.550 --> 02:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
cultivation tax level and is sometimes
 
02:12:05.149 --> 02:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
unclear on and
 
02:12:05.159 --> 02:12:06.410 align:start position:0%
unclear on and
if

02:12:06.410 --> 02:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:12:10.189 --> 02:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
as in this particular case Colorado has
 
02:12:15.290 --> 02:12:15.300 align:start position:0%
a 15 excise tax and a 15 retail sales
 
02:12:18.490 --> 02:12:18.500 align:start position:0%
tax I multiplied
 
02:12:20.530 --> 02:12:20.540 align:start position:0%
1.15 times
 
02:12:23.830 --> 02:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
1.15 and then
 
02:12:28.729 --> 02:12:28.739 align:start position:0%
took away one the excise tax being on
 
02:12:30.229 --> 02:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
the retail price
 
02:12:35.089 --> 02:12:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:40.790 --> 02:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
is is probably on the marijuana as it
 
02:12:44.810 --> 02:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
transfers to the manufacturer so what I
 
02:12:46.250 --> 02:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
would throw out there for us to consider
 
02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
over lunch
 
02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:48.890 align:start position:0%
over lunch
is

02:12:48.890 --> 02:12:48.900 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:12:51.530 --> 02:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
um what might that rate be that's just a
 
02:12:53.930 --> 02:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
little bit less than our neighbors and
 
02:12:58.550 --> 02:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
between looking online and looking here
 
02:13:00.550 --> 02:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
I think it's not going to be far from 15
 
02:13:03.709 --> 02:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
but I certainly would not want to over
 
02:13:05.930 --> 02:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
tax it so I wonder if we can all kind of
 
02:13:07.970 --> 02:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
think about that and if we're talking
 
02:13:09.649 --> 02:13:09.659 align:start position:0%
about not doing it at the retail level
 
02:13:12.290 --> 02:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
but at the wholesale level that's going
 
02:13:15.830 --> 02:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
to involve a whole guessing game of
 
02:13:17.689 --> 02:13:17.699 align:start position:0%
you know if we're if our neighbors are
 
02:13:19.370 --> 02:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
charging it on the retail so just food
 
02:13:21.410 --> 02:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
for thought before we break for lunch
 
02:13:23.450 --> 02:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
yes I would encourage people to think
 
02:13:25.490 --> 02:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
about this over lunch representative
 
02:13:27.470 --> 02:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
well I just want to comment I think
 
02:13:29.629 --> 02:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
that's where the 15 came from
 
02:13:31.729 --> 02:13:31.739 align:start position:0%
understanding that it was higher up in
 
02:13:34.129 --> 02:13:34.139 align:start position:0%
the Chain versus on a retail level I
 
02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
think that's where they in their
 
02:13:37.490 --> 02:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
discussions and speaking with members of
 
02:13:39.770 --> 02:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
of Commerce where they came up with that
 
02:13:40.910 --> 02:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
number because they didn't want
 
02:13:43.970 --> 02:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
something so low that in taxing
 
02:13:45.950 --> 02:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
wholesale that it would be lost so they
 
02:13:47.390 --> 02:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to have it a little higher so
 
02:13:48.890 --> 02:13:48.900 align:start position:0%
that is appreciable
 
02:13:52.250 --> 02:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
and make sure it's getting getting uh I
 
02:13:54.530 --> 02:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
will do everything copy this and get it
 
02:13:57.050 --> 02:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
to everybody if we can have 45 minutes
 
02:13:59.569 --> 02:13:59.579 align:start position:0%
for lunch yes you can have 45 minutes
 
02:14:04.250 --> 02:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
for lunch uh one is a quick yes I point
 
02:14:06.890 --> 02:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
out that all the other states had as a
 
02:14:09.050 --> 02:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
goal driving out illegals none of them
 
02:14:09.060 --> 02:14:10.010 align:start position:0%
goal driving out illegals none of them
have

02:14:10.010 --> 02:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:14:12.290 --> 02:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
and so you have to make it low enough to
 
02:14:14.750 --> 02:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
do that and you want to be more than
 
02:14:16.490 --> 02:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
competitive with the pre the other
 
02:14:18.649 --> 02:14:18.659 align:start position:0%
states around us so we get the business
 
02:14:20.870 --> 02:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
here and so I would argue for something
 
02:14:23.689 --> 02:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
a lot less than 15 especially since it's
 
02:14:26.450 --> 02:14:26.460 align:start position:0%
applied at a distributor level not not a
 
02:14:29.330 --> 02:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
wholesale not a not a not a Grower's
 
02:14:29.340 --> 02:14:30.410 align:start position:0%

02:14:33.770 --> 02:14:33.780 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to take a 45 minute
 
02:14:35.390 --> 02:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
break we'll be back here at one o'clock
 
02:14:37.250 --> 02:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
and I would encourage everyone to think
 
02:14:59.930 --> 02:14:59.940 align:start position:0%

03:21:21.889 --> 03:21:21.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:24.469 --> 03:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
everyone should have a new handout which
 
03:21:27.650 --> 03:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
is um basically um
 
03:21:30.230 --> 03:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
a couple sentences five lines
 
03:21:34.190 --> 03:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
in an attempt to try to
 
03:21:36.110 --> 03:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
figure out what we've been discussing
 
03:21:37.790 --> 03:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
this morning in terms of how the
 
03:21:40.010 --> 03:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
taxation how and where the taxation
 
03:21:42.110 --> 03:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
happens and
 
03:21:42.120 --> 03:21:43.429 align:start position:0%
happens and
um

03:21:43.429 --> 03:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:45.170 --> 03:21:45.180 align:start position:0%
so you all have that before you I'll
 
03:21:47.269 --> 03:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
give you uh
 
03:21:49.010 --> 03:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
one minute to read it and then I'm going
 
03:21:53.870 --> 03:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:57.650 --> 03:21:57.660 align:start position:0%
actually I'll recognize you now
 
03:22:01.610 --> 03:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:05.269 --> 03:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
so this represents
 
03:22:09.830 --> 03:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
an effort to modify a single sentence
 
03:22:13.010 --> 03:22:13.020 align:start position:0%
that appears in the bill on page 22
 
03:22:15.710 --> 03:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
lines 27 and 28.
 
03:22:19.610 --> 03:22:19.620 align:start position:0%
and that's the sentence that
 
03:22:19.620 --> 03:22:20.990 align:start position:0%
and that's the sentence that
um

03:22:20.990 --> 03:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:24.290 --> 03:22:24.300 align:start position:0%
describes the 15 tax and the purpose of
 
03:22:25.730 --> 03:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
this language which I'll walk you
 
03:22:25.740 --> 03:22:26.630 align:start position:0%
this language which I'll walk you
through

03:22:26.630 --> 03:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
through
 
03:22:29.870 --> 03:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
is to establish with Clarity what that
 
03:22:33.050 --> 03:22:33.060 align:start position:0%
15 percent exactly applies to
 
03:22:35.389 --> 03:22:35.399 align:start position:0%
consistent with our discussion that it
 
03:22:38.150 --> 03:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
would be the wholesale level I.E the
 
03:22:41.510 --> 03:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
cost to the retailer
 
03:22:47.150 --> 03:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
so I do this by drawing from defined
 
03:22:50.269 --> 03:22:50.279 align:start position:0%
terms that you find back on page three
 
03:22:52.309 --> 03:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
and four
 
03:22:55.070 --> 03:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
as you as I read through this I want you
 
03:22:56.929 --> 03:22:56.939 align:start position:0%
to see that
 
03:23:00.230 --> 03:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
the term retail cannabis store is a
 
03:23:03.469 --> 03:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
defined term the term cannabis is a
 
03:23:05.929 --> 03:23:05.939 align:start position:0%
defined term cannabis products is a
 
03:23:08.330 --> 03:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
defined term cannabis cultivation
 
03:23:11.030 --> 03:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
facility is a defined term cannabis
 
03:23:12.950 --> 03:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
product manufacturing facility is a
 
03:23:15.309 --> 03:23:15.319 align:start position:0%
defined term so those five defined terms
 
03:23:18.650 --> 03:23:18.660 align:start position:0%
pull a lot of the specifics that we've
 
03:23:21.290 --> 03:23:21.300 align:start position:0%
been talking about into this one
 
03:23:21.300 --> 03:23:22.870 align:start position:0%
been talking about into this one
sentence

03:23:22.870 --> 03:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
03:23:25.429 --> 03:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
attacks on the monthly total gross
 
03:23:25.439 --> 03:23:27.170 align:start position:0%
attacks on the monthly total gross
revenue

03:23:27.170 --> 03:23:27.180 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
03:23:30.410 --> 03:23:30.420 align:start position:0%
that was in the bill
 
03:23:33.290 --> 03:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
now we add derived from sales or
 
03:23:36.349 --> 03:23:36.359 align:start position:0%
transfers to a retail cannabis store
 
03:23:39.650 --> 03:23:39.660 align:start position:0%
of either cannabis or cannabis products
 
03:23:42.349 --> 03:23:42.359 align:start position:0%
that covers the waterfront on products
 
03:23:44.150 --> 03:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
raw and improved
 
03:23:46.010 --> 03:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
by either a licensed cannabis
 
03:23:47.929 --> 03:23:47.939 align:start position:0%
cultivation facility or a cannabis
 
03:23:50.330 --> 03:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
product manufacturing facility that
 
03:23:51.769 --> 03:23:51.779 align:start position:0%
covers the Waterfront in terms of
 
03:23:55.010 --> 03:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
entities that precede the retail level
 
03:23:58.790 --> 03:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
is imposed at the rate of 15 percent
 
03:24:01.910 --> 03:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
and this would then allow
 
03:24:05.210 --> 03:24:05.220 align:start position:0%
the I you may also notice that uh in in
 
03:24:07.790 --> 03:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
addition to say derived from sales it
 
03:24:11.269 --> 03:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
says derived from sales or transfers and
 
03:24:13.849 --> 03:24:13.859 align:start position:0%
this would allow the Liquor Commission
 
03:24:15.769 --> 03:24:15.779 align:start position:0%
to take account of a vertically
 
03:24:18.050 --> 03:24:18.060 align:start position:0%
integrated operation and impute a
 
03:24:19.750 --> 03:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
transfer price
 
03:24:22.790 --> 03:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
between the manufacturing and the retail
 
03:24:25.969 --> 03:24:25.979 align:start position:0%
level which is standard in taxation
 
03:24:25.979 --> 03:24:30.130 align:start position:0%
level which is standard in taxation
generally

03:24:30.130 --> 03:24:30.140 align:start position:0%

03:24:34.309 --> 03:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for the language I love the
 
03:24:36.530 --> 03:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
language I think it's right on the head
 
03:24:38.769 --> 03:24:38.779 align:start position:0%
except for the 15 percent
 
03:24:38.779 --> 03:24:40.610 align:start position:0%
except for the 15 percent
huh

03:24:40.610 --> 03:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
huh
 
03:24:43.010 --> 03:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
as soon as we get the language agreed to
 
03:24:44.630 --> 03:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about the percent
 
03:24:46.849 --> 03:24:46.859 align:start position:0%
representative Almy
 
03:24:50.330 --> 03:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:53.210 --> 03:24:53.220 align:start position:0%
at least paragraphs Roman two and three
 
03:25:07.729 --> 03:25:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:10.610 --> 03:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
because you have to refer also to the
 
03:25:13.490 --> 03:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
manufacturing well all right take your
 
03:25:13.500 --> 03:25:14.330 align:start position:0%
manufacturing well all right take your
point

03:25:14.330 --> 03:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:25:15.889 --> 03:25:15.899 align:start position:0%
um but perhaps the better way to do that
 
03:25:19.429 --> 03:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
is in both cases
 
03:25:21.410 --> 03:25:21.420 align:start position:0%
add the term cannabis product
 
03:25:23.510 --> 03:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facility I think that's
 
03:25:25.969 --> 03:25:25.979 align:start position:0%
the way to do it okay
 
03:25:28.130 --> 03:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
thank you for that I hadn't noticed it's
 
03:25:28.140 --> 03:25:42.229 align:start position:0%
thank you for that I hadn't noticed it's
longer

03:25:42.229 --> 03:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:44.450 --> 03:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure
 
03:25:47.750 --> 03:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:47.760 --> 03:25:49.670 align:start position:0%
 
whether

03:25:49.670 --> 03:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
whether
 
03:25:52.610 --> 03:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
they were just concentrating on the
 
03:25:55.969 --> 03:25:55.979 align:start position:0%
cultivation facilities that also hold a
 
03:25:58.010 --> 03:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
cannabis product manufacturing facility
 
03:26:00.349 --> 03:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
license or retail cannabis store license
 
03:26:06.229 --> 03:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
if we don't need to talk also about the
 
03:26:09.670 --> 03:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
the tax rates and procedures for license
 
03:26:12.889 --> 03:26:12.899 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facilities
 
03:26:29.269 --> 03:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:30.710 --> 03:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
did you have a comment on that
 
03:26:33.290 --> 03:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
representative I think the language
 
03:26:36.590 --> 03:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
Works uh the way it is but because I
 
03:26:38.330 --> 03:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
think it's reciprocal
 
03:26:40.130 --> 03:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
it's basically if you're more than one
 
03:26:40.140 --> 03:26:47.030 align:start position:0%
it's basically if you're more than one
thing

03:26:47.030 --> 03:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:48.410 --> 03:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if you've heard what
 
03:26:50.090 --> 03:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury said he said he
 
03:26:51.710 --> 03:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
believes that this language is
 
03:26:51.720 --> 03:26:54.410 align:start position:0%
believes that this language is
appropriate

03:26:54.410 --> 03:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
03:26:57.830 --> 03:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
well if we have manufacturing facilities
 
03:27:01.309 --> 03:27:01.319 align:start position:0%
that are not integrated to the farmer we
 
03:27:03.050 --> 03:27:03.060 align:start position:0%
have manufacturing facilities that are
 
03:27:05.690 --> 03:27:05.700 align:start position:0%
not integrated to the farmer level but
 
03:27:08.269 --> 03:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
are integrated to the retail cannabis
 
03:27:12.110 --> 03:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
store we have the same problem
 
03:27:12.120 --> 03:27:14.570 align:start position:0%
store we have the same problem
what

03:27:14.570 --> 03:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:27:18.190 --> 03:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
why not just um
 
03:27:21.050 --> 03:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
do it relative to tax rates and
 
03:27:22.610 --> 03:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
procedures for licensed cannabis
 
03:27:25.729 --> 03:27:25.739 align:start position:0%
cultivation facilities and cannabis
 
03:27:29.750 --> 03:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
product manufacturing facilities
 
03:27:33.590 --> 03:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
or that hold multiple cannabis licenses
 
03:27:35.690 --> 03:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
well it's the only ones that are going
 
03:27:40.790 --> 03:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
to be paying tax or these two yeah right
 
03:27:40.800 --> 03:27:44.929 align:start position:0%
to be paying tax or these two yeah right
efficient

03:27:44.929 --> 03:27:44.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:46.849 --> 03:27:46.859 align:start position:0%
representative Ames I had difficulty
 
03:27:48.469 --> 03:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
hearing you could you just repeat your
 
03:27:52.130 --> 03:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
suggestion uh my suggestion is that we
 
03:27:54.110 --> 03:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
insert after licensed cannabis
 
03:27:56.330 --> 03:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
cultivation facilities
 
03:27:56.340 --> 03:27:59.210 align:start position:0%
cultivation facilities
and

03:27:59.210 --> 03:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:28:02.030 --> 03:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
licensed cannabis product manufacturing
 
03:28:02.040 --> 03:28:04.670 align:start position:0%
licensed cannabis product manufacturing
facilities

03:28:04.670 --> 03:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
03:28:07.070 --> 03:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
yeah period what we're trying to Define
 
03:28:09.830 --> 03:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
is that they don't get taxed twice no
 
03:28:12.110 --> 03:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
this is this is not this is the rules so
 
03:28:14.510 --> 03:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
this is essentially what the Liquor
 
03:28:16.190 --> 03:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
Commission can write rules to address
 
03:28:19.190 --> 03:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
right and uh and and that is where
 
03:28:21.050 --> 03:28:21.060 align:start position:0%
they're involved in more than one of
 
03:28:26.630 --> 03:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:29.330 --> 03:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
I guess that's right yeah I don't know
 
03:28:30.830 --> 03:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
where they need it
 
03:28:34.250 --> 03:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:34.260 --> 03:28:35.690 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:28:35.690 --> 03:28:35.700 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:28:37.849 --> 03:28:37.859 align:start position:0%
I think that has to be
 
03:28:37.859 --> 03:28:39.729 align:start position:0%
I think that has to be
a link

03:28:39.729 --> 03:28:39.739 align:start position:0%
a link
 
03:28:43.670 --> 03:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facility details oh I
 
03:28:45.830 --> 03:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
think there has to be a link between the
 
03:28:48.349 --> 03:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facility and the retail
 
03:28:51.530 --> 03:28:51.540 align:start position:0%
store if it's being taxed at the
 
03:28:54.710 --> 03:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:57.530 --> 03:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
there there has to be a link between how
 
03:29:00.110 --> 03:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
about we simplify the sentence
 
03:29:02.570 --> 03:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
by saying relative to tax rates and
 
03:29:04.969 --> 03:29:04.979 align:start position:0%
procedures for any entity holding more
 
03:29:08.349 --> 03:29:08.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:11.210 --> 03:29:11.220 align:start position:0%
more than this has to do with the
 
03:29:13.670 --> 03:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
transfer situation of vertical
 
03:29:20.389 --> 03:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:24.349 --> 03:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
can you read it as it reads now please
 
03:29:27.349 --> 03:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
yes so I'm suggesting the commission
 
03:29:30.170 --> 03:29:30.180 align:start position:0%
shall adopt rules under RSA 541-a
 
03:29:32.570 --> 03:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
relative to tax rates and procedures for
 
03:29:35.450 --> 03:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
any entity holding more than one license
 
03:29:44.269 --> 03:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:46.729 --> 03:29:46.739 align:start position:0%
would they not do that for somebody
 
03:29:53.170 --> 03:29:53.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:56.870 --> 03:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
I I I think your point is well taken I
 
03:29:59.290 --> 03:29:59.300 align:start position:0%
think that this was drafted to address
 
03:30:03.830 --> 03:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
the transfer problem that uh
 
03:30:06.349 --> 03:30:06.359 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh ellsberger and
 
03:30:08.450 --> 03:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
leapley have you know articulated quite
 
03:30:11.150 --> 03:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
well but I think it could be broader in
 
03:30:15.650 --> 03:30:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:18.290 --> 03:30:18.300 align:start position:0%
that's a good question and I I think
 
03:30:21.650 --> 03:30:21.660 align:start position:0%
that uh it should be broader and so I
 
03:30:23.389 --> 03:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
what I would suggest is that the
 
03:30:26.210 --> 03:30:26.220 align:start position:0%
commission shall adopt rules under RSA
 
03:30:26.220 --> 03:30:29.769 align:start position:0%
commission shall adopt rules under RSA
541-a

03:30:29.769 --> 03:30:29.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:33.650 --> 03:30:33.660 align:start position:0%
relative to the tax imposed by this
 
03:30:35.809 --> 03:30:35.819 align:start position:0%
section or something like that or any
 
03:30:46.450 --> 03:30:46.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:50.929 --> 03:30:50.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:53.450 --> 03:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
right secret seizures you better leave
 
03:30:57.070 --> 03:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:59.750 --> 03:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
it is
 
03:30:59.760 --> 03:31:01.550 align:start position:0%
it is
it

03:31:01.550 --> 03:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:31:04.070 --> 03:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
what do you have we so we are shifting
 
03:31:07.849 --> 03:31:07.859 align:start position:0%
the thrust of the um of this provision
 
03:31:10.250 --> 03:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
this sentence uh as it was drafted what
 
03:31:13.010 --> 03:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
it was meant to do is deal with those
 
03:31:19.309 --> 03:31:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:25.849 --> 03:31:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:25.859 --> 03:31:29.630 align:start position:0%
 
text

03:31:29.630 --> 03:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:32.389 --> 03:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
text that is good if I would just
 
03:31:35.809 --> 03:31:35.819 align:start position:0%
suggest taking out the a before the
 
03:31:38.809 --> 03:31:38.819 align:start position:0%
Cannabis product manufacturing so it
 
03:31:40.670 --> 03:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
looks like the license belongs to both
 
03:31:41.570 --> 03:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
of them
 
03:31:44.150 --> 03:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
I think that's good I don't think we
 
03:31:47.090 --> 03:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
need rules for
 
03:31:48.889 --> 03:31:48.899 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
03:31:52.309 --> 03:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
multiple licenses because
 
03:31:55.910 --> 03:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
the the person who grows the cannabis
 
03:31:58.370 --> 03:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
only has two places that he can sell it
 
03:32:01.370 --> 03:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
he can either sell it to the
 
03:32:05.389 --> 03:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:07.309 --> 03:32:07.319 align:start position:0%
what do they do they
 
03:32:10.429 --> 03:32:10.439 align:start position:0%
they do they make the products you know
 
03:32:13.370 --> 03:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
the intermediate people or the retail so
 
03:32:15.229 --> 03:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
I think that's fine I don't think you I
 
03:32:17.929 --> 03:32:17.939 align:start position:0%
don't think you need rules related to
 
03:32:20.150 --> 03:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
um more than one license but I do think
 
03:32:23.630 --> 03:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
you need to we need to have some kind of
 
03:32:26.809 --> 03:32:26.819 align:start position:0%
words related to
 
03:32:31.010 --> 03:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
transfers in something about how to and
 
03:32:35.630 --> 03:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
it's how to determine the value of the
 
03:32:40.130 --> 03:32:40.140 align:start position:0%
Cannabis when it's transferred
 
03:32:43.729 --> 03:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
and not sold well the value of that
 
03:32:46.570 --> 03:32:46.580 align:start position:0%
value is going to be in the rule making
 
03:32:49.130 --> 03:32:49.140 align:start position:0%
of the uh liquid Community that's part
 
03:32:51.349 --> 03:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
of they're going to be putting those in
 
03:32:54.050 --> 03:32:54.060 align:start position:0%
rules what the what those values are
 
03:32:55.969 --> 03:32:55.979 align:start position:0%
well that's what I'm saying that I think
 
03:32:58.309 --> 03:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
we need to do what what makes you think
 
03:33:00.229 --> 03:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
it's already in rules
 
03:33:01.910 --> 03:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not already in rules
 
03:33:03.950 --> 03:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
that's part of what they have to do is I
 
03:33:05.950 --> 03:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
think in in your rule making
 
03:33:08.450 --> 03:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
authorization don't don't we have things
 
03:33:09.590 --> 03:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
that say
 
03:33:12.410 --> 03:33:12.420 align:start position:0%
rules about
 
03:33:14.090 --> 03:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
doesn't isn't there a rule making
 
03:33:16.130 --> 03:33:16.140 align:start position:0%
section that tells you what you need
 
03:33:18.950 --> 03:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:37.969 --> 03:33:37.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:39.950 --> 03:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
well it has there has to be something in
 
03:33:42.349 --> 03:33:42.359 align:start position:0%
here about making rules somewhere and
 
03:33:42.359 --> 03:33:44.570 align:start position:0%
here about making rules somewhere and
usually

03:33:44.570 --> 03:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
usually
 
03:33:46.849 --> 03:33:46.859 align:start position:0%
there's some kind of scope of the rules
 
03:33:48.590 --> 03:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
that they can do I don't know where it
 
03:33:48.600 --> 03:33:53.030 align:start position:0%
that they can do I don't know where it
is

03:33:53.030 --> 03:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:01.429 --> 03:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:04.429 --> 03:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
well so this was not designed I I didn't
 
03:34:06.050 --> 03:34:06.060 align:start position:0%
draft this I'm just trying to interpret
 
03:34:08.150 --> 03:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
it I don't believe this sentence was put
 
03:34:10.910 --> 03:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
in there as a general authorization of
 
03:34:12.590 --> 03:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
rule making Authority I think it was an
 
03:34:15.590 --> 03:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
instruction specifically to have rules
 
03:34:17.990 --> 03:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
that address those entities that are
 
03:34:19.490 --> 03:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
vertically integrated or have multiple
 
03:34:23.690 --> 03:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
licenses so it's um it's on page 31.
 
03:34:26.750 --> 03:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
starts at line 22
 
03:34:29.630 --> 03:34:29.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's rule making Authority for the
 
03:34:29.640 --> 03:34:30.969 align:start position:0%
it's it's rule making Authority for the
commission

03:34:30.969 --> 03:34:30.979 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:34:33.650 --> 03:34:33.660 align:start position:0%
and it says
 
03:34:35.809 --> 03:34:35.819 align:start position:0%
so it's adding it to rules that the
 
03:34:39.530 --> 03:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
commission already has related to liquor
 
03:34:42.170 --> 03:34:42.180 align:start position:0%
so they have to for cannabis licensing
 
03:34:44.269 --> 03:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
it says that the things that they have
 
03:34:46.250 --> 03:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
to do
 
03:34:48.650 --> 03:34:48.660 align:start position:0%
for application
 
03:34:51.590 --> 03:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
to issue transfer deny that's like
 
03:34:51.600 --> 03:34:53.809 align:start position:0%
to issue transfer deny that's like
applications

03:34:53.809 --> 03:34:53.819 align:start position:0%
applications
 
03:34:57.469 --> 03:34:57.479 align:start position:0%
they collect fees I think it
 
03:35:01.870 --> 03:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
I think it needs to say more than that I
 
03:35:05.630 --> 03:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
determination of price
 
03:35:08.990 --> 03:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
return determination of value
 
03:35:14.030 --> 03:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
when the products transferred so I think
 
03:35:16.250 --> 03:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
I think we risk getting very confused
 
03:35:18.950 --> 03:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
here and I can't even give you a clear
 
03:35:20.990 --> 03:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
answer to what I think about what you've
 
03:35:24.110 --> 03:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
just said without going and reading what
 
03:35:29.750 --> 03:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
RSA 17614 is all about and what uh
 
03:35:33.290 --> 03:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
inserting a new paragraph nine how it
 
03:35:37.370 --> 03:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
fits in the context of that law but
 
03:35:39.710 --> 03:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
just bear in mind that these Provisions
 
03:35:42.889 --> 03:35:42.899 align:start position:0%
towards the end are each separate
 
03:35:45.290 --> 03:35:45.300 align:start position:0%
amendments of the law whereas the
 
03:35:46.790 --> 03:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
provisions we're reading on the bottom
 
03:35:49.010 --> 03:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
of page 22
 
03:35:53.809 --> 03:35:53.819 align:start position:0%
are a part of this entire chapter
 
03:35:56.330 --> 03:35:56.340 align:start position:0%
that's called regulation of cannabis
 
03:36:01.190 --> 03:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
starting back on page three right so I
 
03:36:02.750 --> 03:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
think this is a specific rule making
 
03:36:06.889 --> 03:36:06.899 align:start position:0%
instruction regarding a an issue that is
 
03:36:06.899 --> 03:36:08.630 align:start position:0%
instruction regarding a an issue that is
thorny

03:36:08.630 --> 03:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
thorny
 
03:36:10.910 --> 03:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
and I don't see the point of moving it
 
03:36:12.769 --> 03:36:12.779 align:start position:0%
so so the
 
03:36:15.769 --> 03:36:15.779 align:start position:0%
you know I'm I I was on e-dna and I'm
 
03:36:17.530 --> 03:36:17.540 align:start position:0%
I'm on gel car
 
03:36:20.990 --> 03:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
so I understand I'm I wouldn't say I'm
 
03:36:22.610 --> 03:36:22.620 align:start position:0%
an expert but I just I do understand
 
03:36:25.969 --> 03:36:25.979 align:start position:0%
about rule making and
 
03:36:28.610 --> 03:36:28.620 align:start position:0%
um you have to in the bill you need to
 
03:36:31.670 --> 03:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
Grant the agency
 
03:36:35.389 --> 03:36:35.399 align:start position:0%
you grant the agency authority to make
 
03:36:37.550 --> 03:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
rules but you have to say rules about
 
03:36:37.560 --> 03:36:39.349 align:start position:0%
rules but you have to say rules about
what

03:36:39.349 --> 03:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:36:42.410 --> 03:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
so I think that's what this is all about
 
03:36:45.769 --> 03:36:45.779 align:start position:0%
the licensing part so I think that we
 
03:36:49.070 --> 03:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
would also need a sentence you know one
 
03:36:52.070 --> 03:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
of these ABC we need D that would be
 
03:36:54.950 --> 03:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
like determination of
 
03:36:58.729 --> 03:36:58.739 align:start position:0%
the value when product is transferred
 
03:37:01.389 --> 03:37:01.399 align:start position:0%
something I certainly agree with your
 
03:37:03.889 --> 03:37:03.899 align:start position:0%
predicate that there needs to be rule
 
03:37:06.830 --> 03:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
making Authority this relates to the
 
03:37:09.229 --> 03:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
determination of the tax
 
03:37:10.969 --> 03:37:10.979 align:start position:0%
whereas the other language you were
 
03:37:14.389 --> 03:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
pointing to on 31 relates to the license
 
03:37:14.399 --> 03:37:20.389 align:start position:0%
pointing to on 31 relates to the license
process

03:37:20.389 --> 03:37:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:26.750 --> 03:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:30.290 --> 03:37:30.300 align:start position:0%
license tax
 
03:37:32.389 --> 03:37:32.399 align:start position:0%
correct they need rule making Authority
 
03:37:35.150 --> 03:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:43.729 --> 03:37:43.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:45.769 --> 03:37:45.779 align:start position:0%
where where are you
 
03:37:48.110 --> 03:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
where are you putting this sentence
 
03:37:50.510 --> 03:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
on which page
 
03:37:53.330 --> 03:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
so on the bottom of page 22 okay that's
 
03:37:53.340 --> 03:37:54.349 align:start position:0%
so on the bottom of page 22 okay that's
not

03:37:54.349 --> 03:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:37:57.110 --> 03:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
you have to you put this in and then you
 
03:37:59.990 --> 03:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
give them rule making Authority
 
03:38:02.630 --> 03:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
you give you give the commission rule
 
03:38:05.090 --> 03:38:05.100 align:start position:0%
making authority to determine the
 
03:38:05.100 --> 03:38:07.190 align:start position:0%
making authority to determine the
valuation

03:38:07.190 --> 03:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
valuation
 
03:38:09.830 --> 03:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
of the product no isn't that what the
 
03:38:11.929 --> 03:38:11.939 align:start position:0%
words the commission shall adopt rules
 
03:38:16.670 --> 03:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:16.680 --> 03:38:25.990 align:start position:0%
 
31a

03:38:25.990 --> 03:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:33.590 --> 03:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:36.290 --> 03:38:36.300 align:start position:0%
okay so that's what he said
 
03:38:40.910 --> 03:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:42.650 --> 03:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:38:44.630 --> 03:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
usually you don't see the rule making in
 
03:38:47.150 --> 03:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
two different places so yeah
 
03:38:50.150 --> 03:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
and since you don't it's probably a good
 
03:38:52.729 --> 03:38:52.739 align:start position:0%
idea to put it
 
03:38:54.950 --> 03:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
put some reference to it in the
 
03:38:56.750 --> 03:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority
 
03:38:58.729 --> 03:38:58.739 align:start position:0%
part two
 
03:39:02.450 --> 03:39:02.460 align:start position:0%
I think but
 
03:39:05.210 --> 03:39:05.220 align:start position:0%
I just want to
 
03:39:07.429 --> 03:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
say The Liquor Commission since they
 
03:39:09.410 --> 03:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
missed the first part of this but they
 
03:39:10.729 --> 03:39:10.739 align:start position:0%
have read
 
03:39:16.070 --> 03:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
read the controlling paragraph now on
 
03:39:20.570 --> 03:39:20.580 align:start position:0%
we're trying to figure out the easiest
 
03:39:24.650 --> 03:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
way to change two three and four so that
 
03:39:28.309 --> 03:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a tax which is levied
 
03:39:31.370 --> 03:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
on the manufactured level or
 
03:39:31.380 --> 03:39:32.870 align:start position:0%
on the manufactured level or
the

03:39:32.870 --> 03:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:39:36.170 --> 03:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
the producer level that is
 
03:39:36.180 --> 03:39:37.670 align:start position:0%
the producer level that is
not

03:39:37.670 --> 03:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:39:44.150 --> 03:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:44.160 --> 03:39:45.530 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:39:45.530 --> 03:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:39:48.830 --> 03:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
you you I presume are the ones that gave
 
03:39:53.630 --> 03:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
this language to the chair of Commerce
 
03:39:56.389 --> 03:39:56.399 align:start position:0%
and I'm worried if we go too far away
 
03:39:59.510 --> 03:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
from your language if it will go too far
 
03:40:01.790 --> 03:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
away from your procedures and make it
 
03:40:04.190 --> 03:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
harder too
 
03:40:07.670 --> 03:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
comply so I just
 
03:40:09.170 --> 03:40:09.180 align:start position:0%
want to make sure you're in the
 
03:40:09.180 --> 03:40:12.050 align:start position:0%
want to make sure you're in the
conversation

03:40:12.050 --> 03:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:12.060 --> 03:40:14.090 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:40:14.090 --> 03:40:14.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:17.410 --> 03:40:17.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:20.389 --> 03:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
so I'm back to trying to sort out what
 
03:40:23.870 --> 03:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
should be in subsection Roman four
 
03:40:26.990 --> 03:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:40:31.729 --> 03:40:31.739 align:start position:0%
section 318-ft 23. and I think there
 
03:40:33.650 --> 03:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
should be a first point I think there
 
03:40:36.889 --> 03:40:36.899 align:start position:0%
should be a section about the rulemaking
 
03:40:39.290 --> 03:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
for tax for the tax
 
03:40:43.849 --> 03:40:43.859 align:start position:0%
and this is a good place for it and then
 
03:40:46.849 --> 03:40:46.859 align:start position:0%
I would go back to what I tried to get
 
03:40:50.510 --> 03:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
at before and uh and keep it General so
 
03:40:52.790 --> 03:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
the commission shall adopt rules under
 
03:40:56.570 --> 03:40:56.580 align:start position:0%
RSA 541a relative tax rates and
 
03:40:56.580 --> 03:40:57.769 align:start position:0%
RSA 541a relative tax rates and
procedures

03:40:57.769 --> 03:40:57.779 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
03:41:00.349 --> 03:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
needed to implement the provisions of
 
03:41:02.030 --> 03:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
this section
 
03:41:02.040 --> 03:41:03.650 align:start position:0%
this section
yeah

03:41:03.650 --> 03:41:03.660 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:41:10.750 --> 03:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:16.790 --> 03:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:18.590 --> 03:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that's gonna be a challenge
 
03:41:20.929 --> 03:41:20.939 align:start position:0%
but Mike my question on that would be
 
03:41:22.790 --> 03:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
though where it says relative to tax
 
03:41:22.800 --> 03:41:24.050 align:start position:0%
though where it says relative to tax
rates

03:41:24.050 --> 03:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
rates
 
03:41:25.490 --> 03:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
aren't we already setting the tax rate
 
03:41:27.769 --> 03:41:27.779 align:start position:0%
in paragraph one that's a good point to
 
03:41:29.330 --> 03:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
the tax rate
 
03:41:32.090 --> 03:41:32.100 align:start position:0%
the tax rate the tax rate okay
 
03:41:36.309 --> 03:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
don't want to confuse that issue yeah
 
03:41:40.610 --> 03:41:40.620 align:start position:0%
representative who Among Us is a taken
 
03:41:42.830 --> 03:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
on scrivening responsibilities
 
03:41:45.170 --> 03:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
to capture these points that we since we
 
03:41:47.030 --> 03:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
sense people are agreeing on okay as
 
03:41:50.950 --> 03:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:54.050 --> 03:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury is uh got
 
03:41:58.010 --> 03:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
section one my my suggestion is that
 
03:42:00.950 --> 03:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
the sentence that replaces
 
03:42:00.960 --> 03:42:01.550 align:start position:0%
the sentence that replaces
um

03:42:01.550 --> 03:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:04.670 --> 03:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
subsection one
 
03:42:04.680 --> 03:42:05.630 align:start position:0%
subsection one
um

03:42:05.630 --> 03:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:09.050 --> 03:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
the added into representative to Seth's
 
03:42:09.060 --> 03:42:10.610 align:start position:0%
the added into representative to Seth's
Amendment

03:42:10.610 --> 03:42:10.620 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
03:42:14.210 --> 03:42:14.220 align:start position:0%
yeah along with
 
03:42:14.220 --> 03:42:15.729 align:start position:0%
yeah along with
in

03:42:15.729 --> 03:42:15.739 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:42:18.469 --> 03:42:18.479 align:start position:0%
subsections two and three
 
03:42:20.450 --> 03:42:20.460 align:start position:0%
the addition of the phrase after
 
03:42:23.269 --> 03:42:23.279 align:start position:0%
cannabis cultivation facility
 
03:42:26.090 --> 03:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
to insert or cannabis product
 
03:42:28.969 --> 03:42:28.979 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facility
 
03:42:31.190 --> 03:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
both places
 
03:42:33.170 --> 03:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
are you capturing what representative
 
03:42:35.929 --> 03:42:35.939 align:start position:0%
Ames just said and then in in section
 
03:42:38.690 --> 03:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
four I was going to ask representative
 
03:42:43.490 --> 03:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:45.670 --> 03:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
um am I on the stage yeah
 
03:42:48.050 --> 03:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
03:42:50.150 --> 03:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
what I have is the commission shall
 
03:42:55.010 --> 03:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
adopt rules under under RSA 541-a
 
03:42:58.370 --> 03:42:58.380 align:start position:0%
relative to the tax rate
 
03:43:00.349 --> 03:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
and procedures
 
03:43:00.359 --> 03:43:01.910 align:start position:0%
and procedures
for

03:43:01.910 --> 03:43:01.920 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair acting chair
 
03:44:02.030 --> 03:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
um just at the risk of beating a dead
 
03:44:04.729 --> 03:44:04.739 align:start position:0%
horse yet again I'd like to make sure
 
03:44:09.110 --> 03:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
that the not on page two or page three
 
03:44:13.450 --> 03:44:13.460 align:start position:0%
is uh removed all right uh page three
 
03:44:20.090 --> 03:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:23.750 --> 03:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
page three cannabis cultivation facility
 
03:44:31.429 --> 03:44:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:33.229 --> 03:44:33.239 align:start position:0%
if you want to produce them you have to
 
03:44:36.710 --> 03:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
have a manufacturing license as well
 
03:44:36.720 --> 03:44:37.490 align:start position:0%
have a manufacturing license as well
um

03:44:37.490 --> 03:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:41.090 --> 03:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
we go back to page 22 where it doesn't
 
03:44:43.849 --> 03:44:43.859 align:start position:0%
say manufacturing it says licensed
 
03:44:46.429 --> 03:44:46.439 align:start position:0%
cannabis cultivation facility which we
 
03:44:48.010 --> 03:44:48.020 align:start position:0%
heard includes
 
03:44:50.690 --> 03:44:50.700 align:start position:0%
manufacturing cultivation preparation
 
03:44:53.269 --> 03:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
and packaging
 
03:44:57.050 --> 03:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
on I'm just no we're we're using this
 
03:44:59.269 --> 03:44:59.279 align:start position:0%
which gives you
 
03:45:03.050 --> 03:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
gives you a choice on Sorry by either a
 
03:45:04.910 --> 03:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
licensed cannabis cultivation I forgot
 
03:45:06.650 --> 03:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
this week was replacing the whole thing
 
03:45:08.570 --> 03:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
yeah all right I apologize the other
 
03:45:11.030 --> 03:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
thing is I'm not sure are we discussing
 
03:45:13.250 --> 03:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
03:45:16.130 --> 03:45:16.140 align:start position:0%
um who is going to be paying this 15 tax
 
03:45:18.530 --> 03:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
or are we just discussing sort of more
 
03:45:20.630 --> 03:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
generalized type language
 
03:45:24.610 --> 03:45:24.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:29.090 --> 03:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
so the payur of the tax
 
03:45:29.100 --> 03:45:30.670 align:start position:0%
so the payur of the tax
is

03:45:30.670 --> 03:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:45:34.130 --> 03:45:34.140 align:start position:0%
specifically uh the Cannabis cultivation
 
03:45:36.830 --> 03:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
facility right or the Cannabis product
 
03:45:40.130 --> 03:45:40.140 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facility according to the
 
03:45:42.349 --> 03:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
monthly total gross revenue derived from
 
03:45:44.269 --> 03:45:44.279 align:start position:0%
sales that were transfers to a retail
 
03:45:46.370 --> 03:45:46.380 align:start position:0%
cannabis store I I wanted to be clear
 
03:45:47.809 --> 03:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
that that's what you were saying because
 
03:45:50.690 --> 03:45:50.700 align:start position:0%
in that case I need to make clear that I
 
03:45:52.550 --> 03:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
disagree with that decision
 
03:45:55.750 --> 03:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
okay I would rather see that the final
 
03:45:58.490 --> 03:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
purchaser of the product
 
03:46:08.570 --> 03:46:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:12.170 --> 03:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
okay any other comments on this area if
 
03:46:14.990 --> 03:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
not we'll move on to
 
03:46:18.410 --> 03:46:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:20.710 --> 03:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
saying no
 
03:46:23.929 --> 03:46:23.939 align:start position:0%
where how we're going this amendment
 
03:46:27.710 --> 03:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
unread and undiscovered no no no we
 
03:46:31.130 --> 03:46:31.140 align:start position:0%
still need to discuss at that time uh
 
03:46:32.809 --> 03:46:32.819 align:start position:0%
we still need to discuss the amendment
 
03:46:34.969 --> 03:46:34.979 align:start position:0%
but what we've just talked about the
 
03:46:38.269 --> 03:46:38.279 align:start position:0%
changes they will be integrated into uh
 
03:46:40.250 --> 03:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
representative doucet's Amendment we
 
03:46:43.490 --> 03:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
still need to review that
 
03:46:43.500 --> 03:46:44.210 align:start position:0%
still need to review that
um

03:46:44.210 --> 03:46:44.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:46.969 --> 03:46:46.979 align:start position:0%
it is can we clarify your Amendment
 
03:46:50.510 --> 03:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
include where the money goes
 
03:46:53.570 --> 03:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
okay excuse me before we I understood we
 
03:46:54.830 --> 03:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
were going to talk about the tax rate
 
03:46:57.410 --> 03:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
before we moved on to good solution good
 
03:47:01.070 --> 03:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
point well yeah or we can talk about it
 
03:47:02.690 --> 03:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
when we go through
 
03:47:05.030 --> 03:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative doucet's Amendment do you
 
03:47:06.830 --> 03:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
have a preference representative descent
 
03:47:09.650 --> 03:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
whether we doesn't matter okay we can we
 
03:47:12.229 --> 03:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
can talk about it to me but are we going
 
03:47:13.670 --> 03:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
to talk about the rate should we talk
 
03:47:15.710 --> 03:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
about the distribution and any
 
03:47:17.690 --> 03:47:17.700 align:start position:0%
possibilities of changing what we have
 
03:47:19.250 --> 03:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
in front that's a good point what we
 
03:47:21.110 --> 03:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
have in front of us first yeah maybe we
 
03:47:23.090 --> 03:47:23.100 align:start position:0%
should talk about this representative
 
03:47:24.950 --> 03:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
spilsbury catch up with the scribble
 
03:47:28.250 --> 03:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
here yeah yeah we'll uh go back to
 
03:47:36.050 --> 03:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:38.630 --> 03:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
um I was very proud to be part of the
 
03:47:39.950 --> 03:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
discussion of the Ways and Means
 
03:47:43.010 --> 03:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
Committee last term where we really
 
03:47:44.750 --> 03:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
thrashed through
 
03:47:49.070 --> 03:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
the trade-offs and choices about how the
 
03:47:50.990 --> 03:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
funds would be distributed
 
03:47:54.290 --> 03:47:54.300 align:start position:0%
and I would like to propose that we draw
 
03:47:59.750 --> 03:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
straight from HB 1598 last term in
 
03:48:03.050 --> 03:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
specific uh the allocation of these
 
03:48:03.060 --> 03:48:04.670 align:start position:0%
specific uh the allocation of these
funds

03:48:04.670 --> 03:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
funds
 
03:48:06.410 --> 03:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
I've got the language here in front of
 
03:48:09.050 --> 03:48:09.060 align:start position:0%
me it's long and tedious to read excuse
 
03:48:10.910 --> 03:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
me so we're not going to talk about the
 
03:48:12.710 --> 03:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
rate I got confused I thought we agreed
 
03:48:14.510 --> 03:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
we were going to talk about that uh we
 
03:48:16.610 --> 03:48:16.620 align:start position:0%
will get we're going to talk about the
 
03:48:18.050 --> 03:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
rate but we thought we should talk about
 
03:48:20.630 --> 03:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
so we're putting this aside
 
03:48:22.429 --> 03:48:22.439 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about distribution and
 
03:48:24.229 --> 03:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
then we'll come back to this
 
03:48:25.910 --> 03:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
right so I know at the point right
 
03:48:28.130 --> 03:48:28.140 align:start position:0%
exactly because that rate may get
 
03:48:29.750 --> 03:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
affected by what we talk about now
 
03:48:33.110 --> 03:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:36.889 --> 03:48:36.899 align:start position:0%
possibly maybe not but
 
03:48:38.870 --> 03:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
I think the important thing is we agreed
 
03:48:41.150 --> 03:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
to wording that I think we were all
 
03:48:43.309 --> 03:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
struggling with all morning and now the
 
03:48:45.170 --> 03:48:45.180 align:start position:0%
rate you know
 
03:48:49.250 --> 03:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of us were bracketing
 
03:48:50.870 --> 03:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
questions because we wanted to
 
03:48:54.830 --> 03:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
understand the language and then we were
 
03:48:56.690 --> 03:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
good because I don't think it's a
 
03:48:58.250 --> 03:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
foregone conclusion that we all agree
 
03:49:00.410 --> 03:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
this should be taxed at the manufacturer
 
03:49:02.210 --> 03:49:02.220 align:start position:0%
rate or that it should be taxed at 15
 
03:49:04.610 --> 03:49:04.620 align:start position:0%
percent and I think we were all being
 
03:49:06.769 --> 03:49:06.779 align:start position:0%
patient for this language to get ironed
 
03:49:08.630 --> 03:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
out so then we could talk about those
 
03:49:10.670 --> 03:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
two things
 
03:49:13.250 --> 03:49:13.260 align:start position:0%
um so it seems like our patience is now
 
03:49:16.130 --> 03:49:16.140 align:start position:0%
being tried it's by moving on to
 
03:49:16.140 --> 03:49:17.290 align:start position:0%
being tried it's by moving on to
distribution

03:49:17.290 --> 03:49:17.300 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
03:49:19.790 --> 03:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
with total deference I'm perfectly
 
03:49:22.550 --> 03:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
willing to
 
03:49:25.429 --> 03:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
that's fine it's not it's not super
 
03:49:27.229 --> 03:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
critical for us to jump to something
 
03:49:29.870 --> 03:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
else right now so let's finish uh let's
 
03:49:32.570 --> 03:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
finish this topic um so I'll take uh
 
03:49:34.490 --> 03:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
input on
 
03:49:39.530 --> 03:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:42.110 --> 03:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
I've got a representative Lee since she
 
03:49:43.670 --> 03:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned it first
 
03:49:45.229 --> 03:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:49:45.239 --> 03:49:46.490 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:49:46.490 --> 03:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:49.790 --> 03:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
so as we're discussing I just to make
 
03:49:53.090 --> 03:49:53.100 align:start position:0%
clear it sounds like the question about
 
03:49:53.100 --> 03:49:54.410 align:start position:0%
clear it sounds like the question about
transfer

03:49:54.410 --> 03:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
03:49:59.269 --> 03:49:59.279 align:start position:0%
price is being shifted and that we are
 
03:50:02.450 --> 03:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
assuming that the Liquor Commission will
 
03:50:04.870 --> 03:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
set a price
 
03:50:07.190 --> 03:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
so that when
 
03:50:09.370 --> 03:50:09.380 align:start position:0%
someone owns both
 
03:50:11.750 --> 03:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis cultivator
 
03:50:14.090 --> 03:50:14.100 align:start position:0%
or manufacturer and they're selling to
 
03:50:17.690 --> 03:50:17.700 align:start position:0%
themselves as a retail store that the
 
03:50:21.050 --> 03:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
market may not
 
03:50:23.389 --> 03:50:23.399 align:start position:0%
especially early on may not make clear
 
03:50:25.969 --> 03:50:25.979 align:start position:0%
what the value of that product is and so
 
03:50:27.830 --> 03:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission is being charged
 
03:50:27.840 --> 03:50:29.210 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission is being charged
with

03:50:29.210 --> 03:50:29.220 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:50:32.630 --> 03:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
setting a market rate
 
03:50:35.030 --> 03:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure that an appropriate tax is
 
03:50:35.040 --> 03:50:36.050 align:start position:0%
to make sure that an appropriate tax is
paid

03:50:36.050 --> 03:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
paid
 
03:50:39.170 --> 03:50:39.180 align:start position:0%
for manufacturer is that what we is that
 
03:50:40.300 --> 03:50:40.310 align:start position:0%
what this language says
 
03:50:40.310 --> 03:50:41.630 align:start position:0%
what this language says
[Music]

03:50:41.630 --> 03:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:50:45.170 --> 03:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
well this language doesn't say all that
 
03:50:47.750 --> 03:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
but the bill in concert with this
 
03:50:49.910 --> 03:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
language says that the Liquor Commission
 
03:50:52.670 --> 03:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
right will through rules set what those
 
03:50:55.130 --> 03:50:55.140 align:start position:0%
rates are and they'll be rates that are
 
03:50:57.349 --> 03:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
based on the best information they have
 
03:50:59.510 --> 03:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
for what the market rate should be it
 
03:51:01.130 --> 03:51:01.140 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that a retailer won't sell
 
03:51:03.410 --> 03:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
it for something else but those are the
 
03:51:05.210 --> 03:51:05.220 align:start position:0%
rates that upon which the tax will be
 
03:51:05.220 --> 03:51:08.990 align:start position:0%
rates that upon which the tax will be
levied

03:51:08.990 --> 03:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:09.000 --> 03:51:09.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:51:09.950 --> 03:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:12.769 --> 03:51:12.779 align:start position:0%
so the other question I have so that
 
03:51:14.809 --> 03:51:14.819 align:start position:0%
question I established earlier still
 
03:51:18.170 --> 03:51:18.180 align:start position:0%
have the question but my other question
 
03:51:22.250 --> 03:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
is about the 15 I think that's uh rate
 
03:51:23.570 --> 03:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
that people
 
03:51:25.849 --> 03:51:25.859 align:start position:0%
weren't sure if it was the right rate or
 
03:51:27.729 --> 03:51:27.739 align:start position:0%
not and that we want to talk about it
 
03:51:31.070 --> 03:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
when we were talking about loving
 
03:51:33.110 --> 03:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
attacks on a retail
 
03:51:37.550 --> 03:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
price I think it was much easier to look
 
03:51:39.170 --> 03:51:39.180 align:start position:0%
at some of the information that
 
03:51:43.190 --> 03:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
representative almi shared with us that
 
03:51:45.650 --> 03:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
lays out what our neighbors
 
03:51:49.550 --> 03:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
um are taxing their product at and if we
 
03:51:52.729 --> 03:51:52.739 align:start position:0%
look at Maine Vermont
 
03:51:55.309 --> 03:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:00.170 --> 03:52:00.180 align:start position:0%
even if we bracket a question that's a
 
03:52:02.929 --> 03:52:02.939 align:start position:0%
little bit hard for me to to get at for
 
03:52:04.910 --> 03:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
example in Maine they have a number of
 
03:52:07.670 --> 03:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
excise taxes
 
03:52:07.680 --> 03:52:08.510 align:start position:0%
excise taxes
um

03:52:08.510 --> 03:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:11.330 --> 03:52:11.340 align:start position:0%
is it a flower is it trim is it a plant
 
03:52:13.729 --> 03:52:13.739 align:start position:0%
even if we leave all of that tax revenue
 
03:52:16.670 --> 03:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
out and just look at the excise tax tax
 
03:52:19.670 --> 03:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
and the sales tax they're charging 15
 
03:52:22.630 --> 03:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
15.5 percent on a retail product right
 
03:52:26.210 --> 03:52:26.220 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts they're charging 17
 
03:52:26.220 --> 03:52:27.590 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts they're charging 17
percent

03:52:27.590 --> 03:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:52:29.809 --> 03:52:29.819 align:start position:0%
if you put the excise and the state
 
03:52:32.269 --> 03:52:32.279 align:start position:0%
sales tax together
 
03:52:36.110 --> 03:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
um and Vermont they have an excise tax
 
03:52:39.769 --> 03:52:39.779 align:start position:0%
of 14 on the sales tax sales price plus
 
03:52:43.729 --> 03:52:43.739 align:start position:0%
six percent on the state uh sales tax so
 
03:52:46.309 --> 03:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
it looks like if we just guessed
 
03:52:50.150 --> 03:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
and set a retail price at 15 percent we
 
03:52:51.889 --> 03:52:51.899 align:start position:0%
would be beating everyone in the
 
03:52:51.899 --> 03:52:52.969 align:start position:0%
would be beating everyone in the
neighborhood

03:52:52.969 --> 03:52:52.979 align:start position:0%
neighborhood
 
03:52:55.429 --> 03:52:55.439 align:start position:0%
but if we're now talking about putting
 
03:52:57.010 --> 03:52:57.020 align:start position:0%
it on wholesale
 
03:52:59.929 --> 03:52:59.939 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if any of the experts here
 
03:52:59.939 --> 03:53:01.250 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if any of the experts here
know

03:53:01.250 --> 03:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:53:04.190 --> 03:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
what the markup tends to be like an
 
03:53:06.769 --> 03:53:06.779 align:start position:0%
average markup between wholesale or
 
03:53:09.769 --> 03:53:09.779 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and Retail it seems that
 
03:53:13.130 --> 03:53:13.140 align:start position:0%
now we have to do some translating on
 
03:53:14.510 --> 03:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
what that
 
03:53:17.510 --> 03:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
what an appropriate rate would be so I
 
03:53:19.809 --> 03:53:19.819 align:start position:0%
don't know if we can get any information
 
03:53:22.130 --> 03:53:22.140 align:start position:0%
if there are any experts here who could
 
03:53:26.870 --> 03:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:29.450 --> 03:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
I saw a hand go up you want to come up
 
03:53:31.429 --> 03:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself and answer the
 
03:53:31.439 --> 03:53:42.110 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself and answer the
question

03:53:42.110 --> 03:53:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:44.809 --> 03:53:44.819 align:start position:0%
my name is Nathaniel Gurion I live in
 
03:53:44.819 --> 03:53:46.250 align:start position:0%
my name is Nathaniel Gurion I live in
Sandwich

03:53:46.250 --> 03:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
Sandwich
 
03:53:46.260 --> 03:53:46.849 align:start position:0%
Sandwich
um

03:53:46.849 --> 03:53:46.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:48.830 --> 03:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
I'm the executive director of the New
 
03:53:50.809 --> 03:53:50.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cannabis party um
 
03:53:53.990 --> 03:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
who was advocating for common sense
 
03:53:57.290 --> 03:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
cannabis legalization and I also run a
 
03:53:59.150 --> 03:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
financial services firm that helps
 
03:54:02.090 --> 03:54:02.100 align:start position:0%
people and operators and banks with
 
03:54:03.849 --> 03:54:03.859 align:start position:0%
cannabis banking Financial Services
 
03:54:06.650 --> 03:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
MasterCard fees and the like
 
03:54:06.660 --> 03:54:08.030 align:start position:0%
MasterCard fees and the like
um

03:54:08.030 --> 03:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:11.210 --> 03:54:11.220 align:start position:0%
you know typically
 
03:54:13.809 --> 03:54:13.819 align:start position:0%
you know the wholesale price
 
03:54:16.969 --> 03:54:16.979 align:start position:0%
that a retailer would pay for an ounce
 
03:54:19.429 --> 03:54:19.439 align:start position:0%
of pot nationally is in the ballpark of
 
03:54:23.450 --> 03:54:23.460 align:start position:0%
I don't know 75 or so and generally
 
03:54:25.250 --> 03:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
they're retailing it for in the
 
03:54:26.750 --> 03:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of
 
03:54:29.450 --> 03:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
well forty to fifty dollars for an
 
03:54:31.670 --> 03:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
eighth which comes out to three or four
 
03:54:33.170 --> 03:54:33.180 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars so there is a very
 
03:54:35.030 --> 03:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
significant uh you know it's not
 
03:54:37.550 --> 03:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily just a fifty percent or a
 
03:54:40.250 --> 03:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
hundred percent markup uh so if you're
 
03:54:40.260 --> 03:54:41.269 align:start position:0%
hundred percent markup uh so if you're
taxing

03:54:41.269 --> 03:54:41.279 align:start position:0%
taxing
 
03:54:44.990 --> 03:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
um at a cultivator wholesale level
 
03:54:47.809 --> 03:54:47.819 align:start position:0%
at fifteen percent that might be
 
03:54:52.670 --> 03:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
equivalent to a retail tax rate of four
 
03:54:54.830 --> 03:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
or five percent
 
03:54:57.710 --> 03:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
um it may be easier
 
03:54:57.720 --> 03:54:58.969 align:start position:0%
um it may be easier
to

03:54:58.969 --> 03:54:58.979 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:55:02.389 --> 03:55:02.399 align:start position:0%
just set this at a I mean I know it kind
 
03:55:03.769 --> 03:55:03.779 align:start position:0%
of undoes some of what you guys were
 
03:55:05.450 --> 03:55:05.460 align:start position:0%
talking about but it might be easier to
 
03:55:07.070 --> 03:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
just set this
 
03:55:10.070 --> 03:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
um set a tax rate on the retail level uh
 
03:55:11.450 --> 03:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
that would cover everything that was
 
03:55:15.050 --> 03:55:15.060 align:start position:0%
sold at a clear and definable value you
 
03:55:16.550 --> 03:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
know one of the I think one of the
 
03:55:18.410 --> 03:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
perspectives that I it would be helpful
 
03:55:19.849 --> 03:55:19.859 align:start position:0%
to share
 
03:55:19.859 --> 03:55:21.050 align:start position:0%
to share
um is

03:55:21.050 --> 03:55:21.060 align:start position:0%
um is
 
03:55:23.809 --> 03:55:23.819 align:start position:0%
that you guys are kind of getting a
 
03:55:25.429 --> 03:55:25.439 align:start position:0%
little sample especially this morning
 
03:55:27.830 --> 03:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
about how complex this would get
 
03:55:29.389 --> 03:55:29.399 align:start position:0%
um and it's it's probably going to be
 
03:55:31.309 --> 03:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
very difficult to come up with a formula
 
03:55:33.290 --> 03:55:33.300 align:start position:0%
that's perfectly good
 
03:55:35.689 --> 03:55:35.699 align:start position:0%
um you know I would um argue in favor of
 
03:55:35.699 --> 03:55:37.189 align:start position:0%
um you know I would um argue in favor of
simple

03:55:37.189 --> 03:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
simple
 
03:55:38.650 --> 03:55:38.660 align:start position:0%
um and flexible
 
03:55:41.330 --> 03:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
especially since um
 
03:55:43.610 --> 03:55:43.620 align:start position:0%
you know otherwise the regulatory burden
 
03:55:45.830 --> 03:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
is going to get pretty substantial
 
03:55:48.410 --> 03:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
and also this is an industry that's not
 
03:55:50.929 --> 03:55:50.939 align:start position:0%
mature it's in flux it's very
 
03:55:50.939 --> 03:55:52.610 align:start position:0%
mature it's in flux it's very
complicated

03:55:52.610 --> 03:55:52.620 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
03:55:55.429 --> 03:55:55.439 align:start position:0%
um and you know interstate commerce is
 
03:55:57.110 --> 03:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly coming sooner or later
 
03:55:59.510 --> 03:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
whether we embrace it or it is put upon
 
03:55:59.520 --> 03:56:00.469 align:start position:0%
whether we embrace it or it is put upon
us

03:56:00.469 --> 03:56:00.479 align:start position:0%
us
 
03:56:03.769 --> 03:56:03.779 align:start position:0%
um and federal legalization is going to
 
03:56:05.389 --> 03:56:05.399 align:start position:0%
happen at some point whether it's a
 
03:56:07.309 --> 03:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
system Mr chair
 
03:56:10.490 --> 03:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
we were asking for some input on setting
 
03:56:13.010 --> 03:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
the market rate of cannabis I appreciate
 
03:56:15.410 --> 03:56:15.420 align:start position:0%
the testimony but we're not here to hear
 
03:56:19.790 --> 03:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh testimony I'm sorry point taken so
 
03:56:28.729 --> 03:56:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:30.170 --> 03:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
does a Liquor Commission want to say
 
03:56:36.050 --> 03:56:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:39.349 --> 03:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
the retail retail versus wholesale
 
03:56:51.170 --> 03:56:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:52.610 --> 03:56:52.620 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure I understand
 
03:56:54.830 --> 03:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
the question I
 
03:56:56.870 --> 03:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
I I think the question can you ask it
 
03:56:59.269 --> 03:56:59.279 align:start position:0%
again yes you can ask
 
03:57:02.090 --> 03:57:02.100 align:start position:0%
um the question was
 
03:57:04.910 --> 03:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
our neighbors are taxing a product at
 
03:57:04.920 --> 03:57:06.530 align:start position:0%
our neighbors are taxing a product at
retail

03:57:06.530 --> 03:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
retail
 
03:57:09.050 --> 03:57:09.060 align:start position:0%
um we're talking about taxing the
 
03:57:12.229 --> 03:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
product at wholesale or manufacture
 
03:57:16.010 --> 03:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
so how could we compare those two rates
 
03:57:17.929 --> 03:57:17.939 align:start position:0%
it might help if we knew kind of what
 
03:57:21.590 --> 03:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
the markup was from uh manufacturer to
 
03:57:21.600 --> 03:57:22.670 align:start position:0%
the markup was from uh manufacturer to
retail

03:57:22.670 --> 03:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
retail
 
03:57:24.889 --> 03:57:24.899 align:start position:0%
and sounds like the testimony we heard
 
03:57:24.899 --> 03:57:25.689 align:start position:0%
and sounds like the testimony we heard
before

03:57:25.689 --> 03:57:25.699 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:57:29.389 --> 03:57:29.399 align:start position:0%
might be like three or four times
 
03:57:32.689 --> 03:57:32.699 align:start position:0%
that's that's what we have understood to
 
03:57:36.290 --> 03:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
be kind of the market rate
 
03:57:39.830 --> 03:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
and and again I think that the goal is
 
03:57:42.469 --> 03:57:42.479 align:start position:0%
obviously to sell more product than they
 
03:57:44.750 --> 03:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
do in the states across from us and
 
03:57:46.849 --> 03:57:46.859 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts given given what
 
03:57:50.030 --> 03:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has done that's bolstering
 
03:57:52.010 --> 03:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
the main business I mean you can see
 
03:57:54.050 --> 03:57:54.060 align:start position:0%
that growth in Maine has been
 
03:57:56.389 --> 03:57:56.399 align:start position:0%
what I would consider astronomical for
 
03:57:57.769 --> 03:57:57.779 align:start position:0%
the time that they've been in business
 
03:57:57.779 --> 03:57:59.030 align:start position:0%
the time that they've been in business
so

03:57:59.030 --> 03:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:58:02.689 --> 03:58:02.699 align:start position:0%
I think our goal of of taxing it
 
03:58:05.809 --> 03:58:05.819 align:start position:0%
uh at the finished product rate will
 
03:58:10.130 --> 03:58:10.140 align:start position:0%
keep that low whatever rate you decide I
 
03:58:13.910 --> 03:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
feel that 15 is is very amenable but if
 
03:58:16.309 --> 03:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
you decide it should be less I still
 
03:58:18.290 --> 03:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
think with the amount of business that's
 
03:58:20.809 --> 03:58:20.819 align:start position:0%
going to bleed over from Maine
 
03:58:24.590 --> 03:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Vermont we will have a
 
03:58:26.389 --> 03:58:26.399 align:start position:0%
substantial business in a very short
 
03:58:30.229 --> 03:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:32.269 --> 03:58:32.279 align:start position:0%
I'd like to go to representative Doucet
 
03:58:34.309 --> 03:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
you've proposed in your Amendment eight
 
03:58:36.229 --> 03:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
percent you want to talk to that sure
 
03:58:38.870 --> 03:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and some of my
 
03:58:38.880 --> 03:58:40.389 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and some of my
commentary

03:58:40.389 --> 03:58:40.399 align:start position:0%
commentary
 
03:58:43.189 --> 03:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
goes right to what the commission was
 
03:58:45.710 --> 03:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
talking about we heard testimony as to
 
03:58:48.830 --> 03:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
why this rate was set at 15 I don't know
 
03:58:50.630 --> 03:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
if anybody heard anything different than
 
03:58:53.410 --> 03:58:53.420 align:start position:0%
I did but it sounded Mighty arbitrary
 
03:58:56.150 --> 03:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
Mighty arbitrary we've heard testimony
 
03:58:58.189 --> 03:58:58.199 align:start position:0%
about how other States neighboring or
 
03:59:02.030 --> 03:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
not have done it wrong done it wrong we
 
03:59:04.550 --> 03:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
do things correctly in New Hampshire we
 
03:59:07.870 --> 03:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
talked about I know we did last biennium
 
03:59:10.610 --> 03:59:10.620 align:start position:0%
excuse me last biennium about
 
03:59:12.830 --> 03:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
undercutting most importantly the black
 
03:59:15.830 --> 03:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
market make no mistake we are we all
 
03:59:17.570 --> 03:59:17.580 align:start position:0%
heard testimony we all know this to be
 
03:59:19.370 --> 03:59:19.380 align:start position:0%
fact that people are getting their
 
03:59:22.429 --> 03:59:22.439 align:start position:0%
cannabis whether it's legally in Maine
 
03:59:25.429 --> 03:59:25.439 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Vermont now or if they're
 
03:59:28.070 --> 03:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
buying it on a street corner
 
03:59:31.969 --> 03:59:31.979 align:start position:0%
what we need to do is set the bar as a
 
03:59:34.729 --> 03:59:34.739 align:start position:0%
state let's not count on so many
 
03:59:36.830 --> 03:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars of Revenue going out
 
03:59:39.469 --> 03:59:39.479 align:start position:0%
to shoot let's count on
 
03:59:43.309 --> 03:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
a b being the best at what it is that
 
03:59:45.590 --> 03:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
we're looking down the barrel of I don't
 
03:59:47.389 --> 03:59:47.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily support or not support
 
03:59:49.910 --> 03:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis as a product or its use or
 
03:59:51.710 --> 03:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
anything I'm a supporter of Revenue
 
03:59:54.050 --> 03:59:54.060 align:start position:0%
whether that's minuscule from the start
 
03:59:55.610 --> 03:59:55.620 align:start position:0%
and it's going to take a long time for
 
03:59:57.769 --> 03:59:57.779 align:start position:0%
this to get off the ground but let's be
 
04:00:01.130 --> 04:00:01.140 align:start position:0%
the leaders nationally in this this
 
04:00:03.710 --> 04:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
eight percent is very specific it
 
04:00:06.710 --> 04:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
undercuts everybody it makes us the
 
04:00:06.720 --> 04:00:08.210 align:start position:0%
undercuts everybody it makes us the
benchmark

04:00:08.210 --> 04:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
benchmark
 
04:00:11.090 --> 04:00:11.100 align:start position:0%
eight percent puts us in a position
 
04:00:13.429 --> 04:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
where we can undercut most importantly
 
04:00:15.110 --> 04:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
to me because I've suffered personal
 
04:00:15.120 --> 04:00:16.370 align:start position:0%
to me because I've suffered personal
issues

04:00:16.370 --> 04:00:16.380 align:start position:0%
issues
 
04:00:18.889 --> 04:00:18.899 align:start position:0%
undercuts what we're hearing from our
 
04:00:21.830 --> 04:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
constituency perpetually the the
 
04:00:25.370 --> 04:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
poisoning of and and the
 
04:00:28.490 --> 04:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
the black market you know stuff with
 
04:00:31.849 --> 04:00:31.859 align:start position:0%
fentanyl I I would much rather
 
04:00:34.610 --> 04:00:34.620 align:start position:0%
have my 30 year old Sons buy a product
 
04:00:38.269 --> 04:00:38.279 align:start position:0%
if they choose to do so at Joyce's
 
04:00:41.330 --> 04:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
cannabis Palace in Berlin
 
04:00:44.389 --> 04:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
knowing that that product is good it's
 
04:00:47.330 --> 04:00:47.340 align:start position:0%
tested it's fair in price very fair in
 
04:00:49.490 --> 04:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
taxes the fairest in the country in
 
04:00:51.170 --> 04:00:51.180 align:start position:0%
taxes because we do it right in this
 
04:00:51.180 --> 04:00:52.370 align:start position:0%
taxes because we do it right in this
state

04:00:52.370 --> 04:00:52.380 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:00:55.130 --> 04:00:55.140 align:start position:0%
instead of going to the alley behind
 
04:00:57.650 --> 04:00:57.660 align:start position:0%
Joyce's cannabis Palace
 
04:01:00.590 --> 04:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
in Berlin and picking up a bag of pot
 
04:01:02.450 --> 04:01:02.460 align:start position:0%
who knows where the supplier is and
 
04:01:04.910 --> 04:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
we've all heard the horror stories so
 
04:01:06.790 --> 04:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
let's get it right and we're working
 
04:01:09.110 --> 04:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
cooperatively here and we're looking
 
04:01:10.610 --> 04:01:10.620 align:start position:0%
down the barrel of that this is
 
04:01:13.729 --> 04:01:13.739 align:start position:0%
something that's a reality and we we
 
04:01:15.710 --> 04:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
should be the leaders in this we should
 
04:01:18.349 --> 04:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
be the tip of the spear
 
04:01:21.830 --> 04:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
in setting The Benchmark low so we get
 
04:01:23.450 --> 04:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
the business from the other states much
 
04:01:25.309 --> 04:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
much like liquor
 
04:01:28.670 --> 04:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
okay and and somebody can correct me if
 
04:01:31.130 --> 04:01:31.140 align:start position:0%
they heard a reasoning as to why it was
 
04:01:33.229 --> 04:01:33.239 align:start position:0%
set at 15 but I've done the comparisons
 
04:01:36.830 --> 04:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
and we've seen a lot of uh
 
04:01:39.889 --> 04:01:39.899 align:start position:0%
pieces passed out today I assure you
 
04:01:41.630 --> 04:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
eight percent is the lowest in the
 
04:01:41.640 --> 04:01:42.410 align:start position:0%
eight percent is the lowest in the
country

04:01:42.410 --> 04:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
country
 
04:01:44.630 --> 04:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
tax-free New Hampshire remains tax-free
 
04:01:46.189 --> 04:01:46.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire even within eight percent
 
04:01:49.429 --> 04:01:49.439 align:start position:0%
tax excise tax or whatever label you
 
04:01:51.710 --> 04:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
want to put on it it's revenue for the
 
04:01:55.729 --> 04:01:55.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:59.689 --> 04:01:59.699 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Platt I would
 
04:02:03.530 --> 04:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
compare the eight percent proposed tax
 
04:02:06.110 --> 04:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
to uh rooms and meals which is what
 
04:02:08.750 --> 04:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
eight and a quarter now eight uh some
 
04:02:12.410 --> 04:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
eight and a half uh and so it's not 15.
 
04:02:14.389 --> 04:02:14.399 align:start position:0%
it's that uh it's rooms and meals and we
 
04:02:16.790 --> 04:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
don't have a sales tax but if we did I
 
04:02:19.070 --> 04:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
doubt we'd have anything any higher than
 
04:02:21.469 --> 04:02:21.479 align:start position:0%
eight percent so compared to a
 
04:02:23.630 --> 04:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
theoretical sales tax I think it's the
 
04:02:26.929 --> 04:02:26.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:28.610 --> 04:02:28.620 align:start position:0%
did you want to say something I just
 
04:02:30.769 --> 04:02:30.779 align:start position:0%
want to clarify something we keep
 
04:02:33.530 --> 04:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
talking about rooms and meals the fact
 
04:02:35.750 --> 04:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
all that does is brought rooms and meals
 
04:02:37.550 --> 04:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
our rooms and meals let's keep it there
 
04:02:39.650 --> 04:02:39.660 align:start position:0%
we don't have a sales tax let's keep it
 
04:02:42.889 --> 04:02:42.899 align:start position:0%
there I think you know no matter what
 
04:02:44.450 --> 04:02:44.460 align:start position:0%
your perspective no matter what side of
 
04:02:46.309 --> 04:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
your the aisle you're on we understand
 
04:02:48.710 --> 04:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
it needs to be taxed we understand that
 
04:02:51.110 --> 04:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
the majority leader said yesterday that
 
04:02:53.269 --> 04:02:53.279 align:start position:0%
it's a tax let's tax it at the
 
04:02:56.090 --> 04:02:56.100 align:start position:0%
appropriate point at the appropriate
 
04:02:58.309 --> 04:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
price and get the appropriate revenue
 
04:03:01.370 --> 04:03:01.380 align:start position:0%
and build out from there I I don't I
 
04:03:02.750 --> 04:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
don't think we need to be talking about
 
04:03:06.590 --> 04:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
retail taxes sales taxes coupling it and
 
04:03:09.110 --> 04:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
and diluting what is a true meals and
 
04:03:12.530 --> 04:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
rooms tax and we just get it done
 
04:03:15.790 --> 04:03:15.800 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I wasn't directly comparing
 
04:03:18.590 --> 04:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
confusing what I was doing is that it's
 
04:03:20.750 --> 04:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
in the range of those other taxes that's
 
04:03:23.510 --> 04:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
all not higher
 
04:03:25.070 --> 04:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
all right uh
 
04:03:26.389 --> 04:03:26.399 align:start position:0%
representative Olney and then
 
04:03:26.399 --> 04:03:30.889 align:start position:0%
representative Olney and then
representatively

04:03:30.889 --> 04:03:30.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:33.469 --> 04:03:33.479 align:start position:0%
absolutely no idea how much this is
 
04:03:35.689 --> 04:03:35.699 align:start position:0%
going to raise
 
04:03:38.090 --> 04:03:38.100 align:start position:0%
um but I am pretty sure that at eight
 
04:03:40.790 --> 04:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
and a half percent of what we're talking
 
04:03:44.510 --> 04:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
about given the large amount of cost it
 
04:03:46.309 --> 04:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
will bring to the state to The Liquor
 
04:03:50.570 --> 04:03:50.580 align:start position:0%
Commission budget in particular on that
 
04:03:53.030 --> 04:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
we will be getting practically nothing
 
04:03:56.769 --> 04:03:56.779 align:start position:0%
if any anything uh
 
04:03:59.510 --> 04:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
in to the treasury
 
04:04:04.790 --> 04:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
out of that on rooms and meals has two
 
04:04:06.769 --> 04:04:06.779 align:start position:0%
inspectors for meals I think it is
 
04:04:08.870 --> 04:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
across the entire state
 
04:04:11.210 --> 04:04:11.220 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
04:04:11.220 --> 04:04:12.349 align:start position:0%
uh and
on

04:04:12.349 --> 04:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:04:14.330 --> 04:04:14.340 align:start position:0%
some of the towns including mine went
 
04:04:16.670 --> 04:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
out and got their own person
 
04:04:19.910 --> 04:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
and found rats in the kitchens uh that
 
04:04:22.250 --> 04:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
was in Hanover actually that one
 
04:04:24.769 --> 04:04:24.779 align:start position:0%
on and
 
04:04:24.779 --> 04:04:25.670 align:start position:0%
on and
um

04:04:25.670 --> 04:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:29.030 --> 04:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
and then we've got the tax collection by
 
04:04:32.990 --> 04:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
dra which is extremely efficient
 
04:04:36.349 --> 04:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
and that's about all and we we give them
 
04:04:40.370 --> 04:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
six million a year I think it is for for
 
04:04:43.309 --> 04:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
um advertising now which helps
 
04:04:46.250 --> 04:04:46.260 align:start position:0%
grow that a lot
 
04:04:49.849 --> 04:04:49.859 align:start position:0%
this one you you need you said you need
 
04:04:52.729 --> 04:04:52.739 align:start position:0%
10 new inspectors you need a lot of
 
04:04:55.910 --> 04:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
other things we haven't looked at yet
 
04:04:59.150 --> 04:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
um and you need to pay a
 
04:05:01.630 --> 04:05:01.640 align:start position:0%
adequate Testing Lab
 
04:05:06.170 --> 04:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
on which is I imagine going to be fairly
 
04:05:06.180 --> 04:05:07.490 align:start position:0%
on which is I imagine going to be fairly
expensive

04:05:07.490 --> 04:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
04:05:11.210 --> 04:05:11.220 align:start position:0%
or set up one in the state system and
 
04:05:12.950 --> 04:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
find a way to pay them enough so that
 
04:05:15.050 --> 04:05:15.060 align:start position:0%
they'll do a good job so that we don't
 
04:05:18.469 --> 04:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
end up with fentanyl in the marijuana
 
04:05:18.479 --> 04:05:19.790 align:start position:0%
end up with fentanyl in the marijuana
and

04:05:19.790 --> 04:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:05:22.490 --> 04:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
um it's a totally different proposition
 
04:05:24.950 --> 04:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
I don't think that it's a proposition
 
04:05:28.189 --> 04:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
that is going to get us any money so we
 
04:05:29.750 --> 04:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't really need to talk about
 
04:05:34.309 --> 04:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:37.070 --> 04:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
representatively thank you
 
04:05:40.370 --> 04:05:40.380 align:start position:0%
um I just had a question on the
 
04:05:42.530 --> 04:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
representatives Amendment
 
04:05:45.889 --> 04:05:45.899 align:start position:0%
so it talks about eight percent on
 
04:05:49.969 --> 04:05:49.979 align:start position:0%
cultivation facilities so are we just to
 
04:05:53.510 --> 04:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
clarify are we pausing the conversation
 
04:05:56.510 --> 04:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
on this language to talk about the
 
04:05:57.710 --> 04:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
amendment and then we're going to
 
04:06:00.349 --> 04:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
compare no the the language that we
 
04:06:03.469 --> 04:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
talked about will be included submerged
 
04:06:04.910 --> 04:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
with you so what you're proposing is
 
04:06:07.130 --> 04:06:07.140 align:start position:0%
this language but you're just talking
 
04:06:09.650 --> 04:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
about replacing this 15 with an eight
 
04:06:11.750 --> 04:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
percent okay thank you I wanted to make
 
04:06:12.950 --> 04:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
sure I understood what we were
 
04:06:16.010 --> 04:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:19.010 --> 04:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:21.469 --> 04:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury
 
04:06:23.990 --> 04:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
and I don't feel strongly enough to
 
04:06:26.870 --> 04:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
resist where a consensus moves so I'm
 
04:06:28.130 --> 04:06:28.140 align:start position:0%
still waiting to see where that
 
04:06:30.429 --> 04:06:30.439 align:start position:0%
consensus moves
 
04:06:33.830 --> 04:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
but given that we have clarified we're
 
04:06:35.929 --> 04:06:35.939 align:start position:0%
going to move with the wholesale rather
 
04:06:37.670 --> 04:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
than retail level I'm very comfortable
 
04:06:40.309 --> 04:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
with 15 at the wholesale level
 
04:06:43.610 --> 04:06:43.620 align:start position:0%
and if we had landed on the retail then
 
04:06:45.590 --> 04:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
I would be expecting a sharply lower
 
04:06:45.600 --> 04:06:52.250 align:start position:0%
I would be expecting a sharply lower
figure

04:06:52.250 --> 04:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:55.670 --> 04:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative yes thank you um
 
04:06:58.130 --> 04:06:58.140 align:start position:0%
representative Doucet brings up some
 
04:07:00.969 --> 04:07:00.979 align:start position:0%
good points about uh
 
04:07:03.590 --> 04:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
legitimizing uh an industry and making
 
04:07:05.510 --> 04:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
sure the industry that we're opening up
 
04:07:08.750 --> 04:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
is is the best that it can be so I know
 
04:07:10.550 --> 04:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
we've all been inundated with all kinds
 
04:07:13.670 --> 04:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
of emails and literatures uh talking
 
04:07:16.610 --> 04:07:16.620 align:start position:0%
about the um the woes of a legalized
 
04:07:18.410 --> 04:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
marijuana industry and you know we've
 
04:07:20.210 --> 04:07:20.220 align:start position:0%
some of those emails that we're getting
 
04:07:22.910 --> 04:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
are look how bad Colorado is look at how
 
04:07:25.370 --> 04:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
bad California is so over the past
 
04:07:26.929 --> 04:07:26.939 align:start position:0%
weekend I think we've all probably done
 
04:07:29.630 --> 04:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
a little more deeper dive on the tax
 
04:07:31.670 --> 04:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
rate and if you look at the tax rate of
 
04:07:33.530 --> 04:07:33.540 align:start position:0%
those states that are telling us how bad
 
04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
things are they're very expensive I mean
 
04:07:37.670 --> 04:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
Washington I think close to over 40
 
04:07:42.469 --> 04:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
percent tax rate on that so I I Echo
 
04:07:45.710 --> 04:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
Representatives doucets sentiments
 
04:07:47.450 --> 04:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
in that
 
04:07:49.550 --> 04:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
you know we do want to get rid of a
 
04:07:51.170 --> 04:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
black market we do want to make sure
 
04:07:54.290 --> 04:07:54.300 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here is safe and and
 
04:07:55.670 --> 04:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
quite frankly we want to make sure that
 
04:07:57.469 --> 04:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
we are the best and most competitive
 
04:08:00.710 --> 04:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
state in New England is eight percent
 
04:08:04.309 --> 04:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
that that number uh I don't know if
 
04:08:06.469 --> 04:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
that's the number but I think 15 you
 
04:08:09.769 --> 04:08:09.779 align:start position:0%
know that's a hard gulp for me was from
 
04:08:12.590 --> 04:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
from the get-go uh so I think there is
 
04:08:14.689 --> 04:08:14.699 align:start position:0%
some and then going back to what
 
04:08:16.250 --> 04:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
representative Army was saying about the
 
04:08:18.290 --> 04:08:18.300 align:start position:0%
inspectors we will need inspectors we
 
04:08:20.510 --> 04:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
need qualified inspectors we will need a
 
04:08:22.490 --> 04:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
number of inspectors we don't need all
 
04:08:24.530 --> 04:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
these I don't believe we would need all
 
04:08:28.309 --> 04:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
the inspectors at capacity day one as
 
04:08:31.309 --> 04:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
these things will will ramp up over time
 
04:08:32.689 --> 04:08:32.699 align:start position:0%
I know
 
04:08:32.699 --> 04:08:33.410 align:start position:0%
I know
um

04:08:33.410 --> 04:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:35.389 --> 04:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
you know in in the state of New
 
04:08:37.610 --> 04:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have 200 pharmacies that
 
04:08:41.090 --> 04:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
get inspected every year for uh
 
04:08:43.790 --> 04:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
everything from contamination to sterile
 
04:08:45.710 --> 04:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
and non-sterile compounding to
 
04:08:48.710 --> 04:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
Administration uh of of dangerous drugs
 
04:08:51.469 --> 04:08:51.479 align:start position:0%
fentanyl legal Administration fennel so
 
04:08:53.630 --> 04:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
you know I think that as an emerging
 
04:08:57.349 --> 04:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
industry we don't need to there's a ramp
 
04:09:00.710 --> 04:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
up uh period with that so that being
 
04:09:04.130 --> 04:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
said I I would be comfortable going at a
 
04:09:05.870 --> 04:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
lower end
 
04:09:10.309 --> 04:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
um you know 15 seems high to me uh
 
04:09:11.990 --> 04:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know maybe eight percent is the
 
04:09:12.000 --> 04:09:15.110 align:start position:0%
uh you know maybe eight percent is the
number

04:09:15.110 --> 04:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:16.389 --> 04:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:09:18.889 --> 04:09:18.899 align:start position:0%
commissioner did you have
 
04:09:20.689 --> 04:09:20.699 align:start position:0%
something or
 
04:09:22.610 --> 04:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you can I just
 
04:09:24.650 --> 04:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
wondered if we were through Mr chairman
 
04:09:26.870 --> 04:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'm happy to continue to answer
 
04:09:29.090 --> 04:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you okay we may
 
04:09:31.429 --> 04:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
still have some certainly
 
04:09:34.010 --> 04:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
representative Albany could we suspend
 
04:09:36.349 --> 04:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
the rate discussion until we know how
 
04:09:39.229 --> 04:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
much they're going to need to operate
 
04:09:41.269 --> 04:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
we won't know how much they're going to
 
04:09:43.189 --> 04:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
get out of it but at least we'll have
 
04:09:45.170 --> 04:09:45.180 align:start position:0%
some idea of how much they need to
 
04:09:45.180 --> 04:09:46.910 align:start position:0%
some idea of how much they need to
operate

04:09:46.910 --> 04:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
operate
 
04:09:48.590 --> 04:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
I mean on the face of it that makes
 
04:09:52.010 --> 04:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
sense I think the the issue is that this
 
04:09:53.689 --> 04:09:53.699 align:start position:0%
is going to take two or three years to
 
04:09:55.610 --> 04:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
get started we're probably going to be
 
04:09:57.650 --> 04:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
in a deficit for a while to
 
04:09:59.870 --> 04:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
representative doucet's point we want to
 
04:09:59.880 --> 04:10:01.370 align:start position:0%
representative doucet's point we want to
be

04:10:01.370 --> 04:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:10:05.210 --> 04:10:05.220 align:start position:0%
we want to be the best states where this
 
04:10:06.889 --> 04:10:06.899 align:start position:0%
where this is sold and we want to make
 
04:10:08.689 --> 04:10:08.699 align:start position:0%
sure we're undercutting the black market
 
04:10:10.189 --> 04:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
because every single one of those States
 
04:10:11.389 --> 04:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
that's having problems Colorado
 
04:10:11.399 --> 04:10:13.910 align:start position:0%
that's having problems Colorado
California

04:10:13.910 --> 04:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
California
 
04:10:17.330 --> 04:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
um on Down the Line their black market
 
04:10:20.269 --> 04:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
is alive and well and strong and we want
 
04:10:21.769 --> 04:10:21.779 align:start position:0%
to make sure that's not the case here
 
04:10:24.830 --> 04:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
because we want this to uh
 
04:10:27.650 --> 04:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
to be to be again the best state where
 
04:10:31.070 --> 04:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
this is handled representative elberger
 
04:10:32.330 --> 04:10:32.340 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:10:34.130 --> 04:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
um representative spilsberry said that
 
04:10:36.650 --> 04:10:36.660 align:start position:0%
we seem to have come to consensus about
 
04:10:39.189 --> 04:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
where the tax is going to be
 
04:10:42.410 --> 04:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
positioned I'd just like to clarify find
 
04:10:42.420 --> 04:10:43.550 align:start position:0%
positioned I'd just like to clarify find
out

04:10:43.550 --> 04:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:10:45.889 --> 04:10:45.899 align:start position:0%
how much consensus we're at because I
 
04:10:47.450 --> 04:10:47.460 align:start position:0%
know I disagree with that I don't know
 
04:10:49.729 --> 04:10:49.739 align:start position:0%
if I'm the outlier here I'd just like to
 
04:10:56.689 --> 04:10:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:00.110 --> 04:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
um I think we we had um I don't know if
 
04:11:02.030 --> 04:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
we have 100 consensus I think we did
 
04:11:03.410 --> 04:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
have some
 
04:11:06.830 --> 04:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
um we can take a quick straw poll to see
 
04:11:08.090 --> 04:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
um how many people agree with the
 
04:11:10.849 --> 04:11:10.859 align:start position:0%
language that we've come up with so far
 
04:11:10.859 --> 04:11:11.510 align:start position:0%
language that we've come up with so far
um

04:11:11.510 --> 04:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:12.729 --> 04:11:12.739 align:start position:0%
all those
 
04:11:15.530 --> 04:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
accepting the tax rate
 
04:11:18.050 --> 04:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
the language that was handed out the
 
04:11:20.689 --> 04:11:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:22.670 --> 04:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
that representative spilsbury put
 
04:11:22.680 --> 04:11:24.469 align:start position:0%
that representative spilsbury put
together

04:11:24.469 --> 04:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:11:27.830 --> 04:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
with sheet here four lines five lines
 
04:11:30.050 --> 04:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
accepting for the percentage because
 
04:11:31.610 --> 04:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
we're still talking about the percentage
 
04:11:33.950 --> 04:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
how many people agree with this new
 
04:11:36.170 --> 04:11:36.180 align:start position:0%
language that we have just raise your
 
04:11:36.180 --> 04:11:38.030 align:start position:0%
language that we have just raise your
hand

04:11:38.030 --> 04:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
hand
 
04:11:40.030 --> 04:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
one two three
 
04:11:43.189 --> 04:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
six seven eight nine
 
04:11:47.150 --> 04:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
okay and how many are disagree
 
04:11:47.160 --> 04:11:49.150 align:start position:0%
okay and how many are disagree
okay

04:11:49.150 --> 04:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:11:52.250 --> 04:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
four one two three four so nine nine
 
04:11:54.889 --> 04:11:54.899 align:start position:0%
agree with it four disagree with it
 
04:11:57.349 --> 04:11:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh given the
 
04:12:00.050 --> 04:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
the complex the complication of this
 
04:12:01.729 --> 04:12:01.739 align:start position:0%
this bill and what we've gone through so
 
04:12:04.729 --> 04:12:04.739 align:start position:0%
far I think uh nine being four and nine
 
04:12:06.469 --> 04:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
being for this and four being against I
 
04:12:09.050 --> 04:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
think we should continue
 
04:12:11.630 --> 04:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
um our discussions so right now those
 
04:12:13.750 --> 04:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
discussions are based on the rate
 
04:12:16.490 --> 04:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
representative elberger yeah
 
04:12:18.469 --> 04:12:18.479 align:start position:0%
um I I am
 
04:12:22.990 --> 04:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
we want to be as uh representative
 
04:12:25.729 --> 04:12:25.739 align:start position:0%
put it uh the best
 
04:12:25.739 --> 04:12:27.050 align:start position:0%
put it uh the best
uh

04:12:27.050 --> 04:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:12:29.269 --> 04:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
the best can cover a range
 
04:12:33.469 --> 04:12:33.479 align:start position:0%
and I am inclined to go more toward the
 
04:12:37.790 --> 04:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
15 rate uh in part because one of the
 
04:12:39.469 --> 04:12:39.479 align:start position:0%
things that we also need to be looking
 
04:12:40.849 --> 04:12:40.859 align:start position:0%
at is
 
04:12:42.650 --> 04:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
this is a drug
 
04:12:42.660 --> 04:12:44.030 align:start position:0%
this is a drug
I'm

04:12:44.030 --> 04:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
04:12:46.189 --> 04:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
just put on record I am in support of
 
04:12:48.349 --> 04:12:48.359 align:start position:0%
legalization but there are going to be
 
04:12:50.090 --> 04:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
some health problems that come about as
 
04:12:53.450 --> 04:12:53.460 align:start position:0%
a result and we need to have some money
 
04:12:55.370 --> 04:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
set aside for things like that and that
 
04:12:57.710 --> 04:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
should be considered when we look at the
 
04:13:01.090 --> 04:13:01.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:05.450 --> 04:13:05.460 align:start position:0%
representative Ellery and then leapley
 
04:13:07.010 --> 04:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing up the health
 
04:13:09.889 --> 04:13:09.899 align:start position:0%
issues but I believe they already exist
 
04:13:12.290 --> 04:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
and we're already dealing with them I
 
04:13:15.290 --> 04:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
don't think this will extend the uh
 
04:13:18.590 --> 04:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
adverse health effects just because it
 
04:13:21.590 --> 04:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
becomes legal in New Hampshire when you
 
04:13:24.650 --> 04:13:24.660 align:start position:0%
can drive two minutes south of the
 
04:13:27.950 --> 04:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
Pheasant Lane Mall and get anything you
 
04:13:27.960 --> 04:13:31.130 align:start position:0%
Pheasant Lane Mall and get anything you
want

04:13:31.130 --> 04:13:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:33.650 --> 04:13:33.660 align:start position:0%
uh representative you said just quickly
 
04:13:35.450 --> 04:13:35.460 align:start position:0%
to that point we're going to get to it
 
04:13:38.090 --> 04:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
but we have we have a change that
 
04:13:40.790 --> 04:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
addresses that very issue that
 
04:13:43.490 --> 04:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
representative spilsberry is gonna
 
04:13:43.500 --> 04:13:46.490 align:start position:0%
representative spilsberry is gonna
propose

04:13:46.490 --> 04:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:49.550 --> 04:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
representative liebly thank you
 
04:13:49.560 --> 04:13:51.410 align:start position:0%
representative liebly thank you
um

04:13:51.410 --> 04:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:55.729 --> 04:13:55.739 align:start position:0%
I think the taxation on the
 
04:13:59.150 --> 04:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
retail price is way cleaner way more
 
04:13:59.160 --> 04:14:00.650 align:start position:0%
retail price is way cleaner way more
simple

04:14:00.650 --> 04:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
simple
 
04:14:02.870 --> 04:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
um I think most of us around this table
 
04:14:05.750 --> 04:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
support the free market and that would
 
04:14:09.710 --> 04:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
uh transparently allow prices to be set
 
04:14:11.210 --> 04:14:11.220 align:start position:0%
instead of having a government agency
 
04:14:14.510 --> 04:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
guess at what a price is my other
 
04:14:16.849 --> 04:14:16.859 align:start position:0%
concern is that when we
 
04:14:20.269 --> 04:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
move from discussing a retail rate which
 
04:14:22.429 --> 04:14:22.439 align:start position:0%
makes it so we can compare more easily
 
04:14:26.030 --> 04:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
with our neighbors to a wholesale rate
 
04:14:29.030 --> 04:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
um we're skipping a lot of math
 
04:14:32.570 --> 04:14:32.580 align:start position:0%
so if we want to compare our rate to our
 
04:14:34.370 --> 04:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
neighbors which I think is an important
 
04:14:38.510 --> 04:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
consideration when setting a tax rate
 
04:14:38.520 --> 04:14:39.650 align:start position:0%
consideration when setting a tax rate
um

04:14:39.650 --> 04:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:42.790 --> 04:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
in fact I don't think I've heard
 
04:14:45.349 --> 04:14:45.359 align:start position:0%
that any of these numbers are based on
 
04:14:45.359 --> 04:14:46.910 align:start position:0%
that any of these numbers are based on
anything

04:14:46.910 --> 04:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
anything
 
04:14:49.910 --> 04:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
else I'd love to base a tax rate on
 
04:14:52.070 --> 04:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
something so if if people want to bring
 
04:14:53.630 --> 04:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
forward what we should base it on it'd
 
04:14:56.150 --> 04:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
be great but just starting with our
 
04:14:56.160 --> 04:14:57.429 align:start position:0%
be great but just starting with our
neighbors

04:14:57.429 --> 04:14:57.439 align:start position:0%
neighbors
 
04:15:00.410 --> 04:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
So based on the testimony we heard here
 
04:15:02.809 --> 04:15:02.819 align:start position:0%
based on doing the math it seems like if
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
we're not charging at the retail level
 
04:15:08.689 --> 04:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
if we're going to tax at the wholesale
 
04:15:11.030 --> 04:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
or manufacturing level we have to take
 
04:15:13.610 --> 04:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
that into consideration and it seems to
 
04:15:17.269 --> 04:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
me that 15 percent is
 
04:15:20.689 --> 04:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
way off in that case and in order to
 
04:15:23.630 --> 04:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
make it comparable with our neighbors we
 
04:15:25.969 --> 04:15:25.979 align:start position:0%
would have to raise that taxation rate
 
04:15:28.729 --> 04:15:28.739 align:start position:0%
from 15 percent times it by three or
 
04:15:28.739 --> 04:15:29.750 align:start position:0%
from 15 percent times it by three or
four

04:15:29.750 --> 04:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:15:34.370 --> 04:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
which would make it 45 or 60 tax on the
 
04:15:37.670 --> 04:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
wholesale or the manufacturing level in
 
04:15:40.910 --> 04:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
order to be comparable with a 15 tax on
 
04:15:44.389 --> 04:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
the retail side in Vermont or Maine or
 
04:15:44.399 --> 04:15:45.889 align:start position:0%
the retail side in Vermont or Maine or
Massachusetts

04:15:45.889 --> 04:15:45.899 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
04:15:48.950 --> 04:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
so I think we haven't even paused
 
04:15:51.050 --> 04:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
to recognize that if we're moving the
 
04:15:53.929 --> 04:15:53.939 align:start position:0%
tax from retail to wholesale
 
04:15:53.939 --> 04:15:55.429 align:start position:0%
tax from retail to wholesale
that

04:15:55.429 --> 04:15:55.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:15:58.250 --> 04:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
it's orders of magnitude different so
 
04:15:59.870 --> 04:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
we'll have to consider when we discuss
 
04:16:02.210 --> 04:16:02.220 align:start position:0%
the taxation rate we should considering
 
04:16:04.969 --> 04:16:04.979 align:start position:0%
that consider that we're not taxing at
 
04:16:08.750 --> 04:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
that rate and so if it was set at 45 to
 
04:16:11.570 --> 04:16:11.580 align:start position:0%
60 percent at the wholesale rate that
 
04:16:13.189 --> 04:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
would be comparable to our neighbors 15
 
04:16:18.349 --> 04:16:18.359 align:start position:0%
on retail so to go from 15 to 8
 
04:16:20.990 --> 04:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
um worries me because we do have to pay
 
04:16:23.389 --> 04:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
to regulate
 
04:16:28.490 --> 04:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
um this new emerging industry and as um
 
04:16:30.050 --> 04:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
sounds like our colleagues are going to
 
04:16:32.929 --> 04:16:32.939 align:start position:0%
present on distribution but if we're
 
04:16:34.370 --> 04:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
going to tax the wholesale at eight
 
04:16:37.790 --> 04:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
percent my fear is that we won't even be
 
04:16:40.610 --> 04:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
able to cover the cost of regulating
 
04:16:42.889 --> 04:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
this industry so I think we need to
 
04:16:45.469 --> 04:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
pause and and consider what what are we
 
04:16:47.870 --> 04:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
basing those numbers on and have a
 
04:16:47.880 --> 04:16:50.630 align:start position:0%
basing those numbers on and have a
discussion

04:16:50.630 --> 04:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:50.640 --> 04:16:53.830 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:16:53.830 --> 04:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:56.510 --> 04:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
why don't we move
 
04:16:58.729 --> 04:16:58.739 align:start position:0%
on to well
 
04:17:01.370 --> 04:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
do we want to throw out what the rate
 
04:17:02.990 --> 04:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
should be or do we want to talk about
 
04:17:03.000 --> 04:17:08.450 align:start position:0%
should be or do we want to talk about
distribution

04:17:08.450 --> 04:17:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:11.349 --> 04:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
just to suggest you Mr chair maybe maybe
 
04:17:13.849 --> 04:17:13.859 align:start position:0%
representative spilsberg can offer that
 
04:17:15.650 --> 04:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
that change
 
04:17:18.410 --> 04:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
and uh members that served last year
 
04:17:19.969 --> 04:17:19.979 align:start position:0%
will understand and we can bring
 
04:17:22.250 --> 04:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
everybody else up to speed that sounds
 
04:17:23.990 --> 04:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
good let's let's talk about that we'll
 
04:17:25.790 --> 04:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
come back to the to the race I'd like to
 
04:17:27.410 --> 04:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
say some more about
 
04:17:27.420 --> 04:17:28.550 align:start position:0%
say some more about
um what

04:17:28.550 --> 04:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
um what
 
04:17:31.490 --> 04:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
representative lippley just commented on
 
04:17:34.330 --> 04:17:34.340 align:start position:0%
that when you look at Massachusetts
 
04:17:37.729 --> 04:17:37.739 align:start position:0%
their tax for just the Cannabis not
 
04:17:41.630 --> 04:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
their regular sales tax is 10.75 percent
 
04:17:44.870 --> 04:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
and that's at the retail level and what
 
04:17:49.849 --> 04:17:49.859 align:start position:0%
we heard is to be to make a
 
04:17:54.170 --> 04:17:54.180 align:start position:0%
comp that would be comparable to a
 
04:17:58.309 --> 04:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
wholesale tax on just the Cannabis of
 
04:18:01.090 --> 04:18:01.100 align:start position:0%
maybe three percent
 
04:18:04.490 --> 04:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
so in 2021
 
04:18:06.889 --> 04:18:06.899 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts their revenue from
 
04:18:10.729 --> 04:18:10.739 align:start position:0%
Cannabis was 46 million
 
04:18:13.250 --> 04:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about what would be
 
04:18:16.189 --> 04:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
comparable for that given the population
 
04:18:16.199 --> 04:18:17.870 align:start position:0%
comparable for that given the population
difference

04:18:17.870 --> 04:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
difference
 
04:18:19.790 --> 04:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
is we're talking about like 10 million
 
04:18:22.729 --> 04:18:22.739 align:start position:0%
dollars and a significant portion of
 
04:18:24.349 --> 04:18:24.359 align:start position:0%
that is going to have to go to the
 
04:18:26.389 --> 04:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
monitoring of the operation I mean
 
04:18:30.050 --> 04:18:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:32.269 --> 04:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
I mean we're not going to make any money
 
04:18:34.130 --> 04:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
on that and this is Ways and Means and
 
04:18:35.990 --> 04:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
one of our responsibilities is to look
 
04:18:38.229 --> 04:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
at revenue and how how we can have
 
04:18:41.150 --> 04:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable Revenue in the state we
 
04:18:44.689 --> 04:18:44.699 align:start position:0%
certainly look at Mr chair at gambling
 
04:18:47.750 --> 04:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
and Lottery and we say that's that's a
 
04:18:49.729 --> 04:18:49.739 align:start position:0%
good source of Revenue
 
04:18:52.010 --> 04:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
because it's discretionary for the
 
04:18:52.020 --> 04:18:53.269 align:start position:0%
because it's discretionary for the
people

04:18:53.269 --> 04:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:18:56.750 --> 04:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
who use it nobody is required and nobody
 
04:18:59.510 --> 04:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely needs that product and we
 
04:19:01.250 --> 04:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
should be doing the same thing with this
 
04:19:01.260 --> 04:19:03.290 align:start position:0%
should be doing the same thing with this
Revenue

04:19:03.290 --> 04:19:03.300 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
04:19:07.189 --> 04:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
thank you and no disrespect I I think we
 
04:19:09.110 --> 04:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
need to progress forward we took a straw
 
04:19:11.750 --> 04:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
poll it was fairly substantial we a
 
04:19:14.150 --> 04:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee wants to move
 
04:19:15.469 --> 04:19:15.479 align:start position:0%
forward we've figured out where we want
 
04:19:17.090 --> 04:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
to tax it
 
04:19:19.729 --> 04:19:19.739 align:start position:0%
um I'll spend less time comparing New
 
04:19:21.490 --> 04:19:21.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's successes to Massachusetts
 
04:19:25.130 --> 04:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
and move on please yeah I mean to be
 
04:19:28.070 --> 04:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
fair we agreed on the wording we did yet
 
04:19:30.349 --> 04:19:30.359 align:start position:0%
agree on a tax rate but
 
04:19:34.189 --> 04:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
um let's I I'm sorry we did a straw poll
 
04:19:36.610 --> 04:19:36.620 align:start position:0%
but I believe that we did a straw poll
 
04:19:39.769 --> 04:19:39.779 align:start position:0%
assuming that 15 percent meant 15
 
04:19:43.030 --> 04:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
percent in both places rather than
 
04:19:46.490 --> 04:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
Representatives leapley's uh analysis
 
04:19:49.250 --> 04:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
just now and thank you that it actually
 
04:19:52.010 --> 04:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
is not the same that if we were trying
 
04:19:55.849 --> 04:19:55.859 align:start position:0%
to get compare 15 on a retail level then
 
04:19:58.309 --> 04:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
we would need to be charging on the
 
04:20:01.610 --> 04:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
wholesale level 45 to 60 percent which I
 
04:20:04.189 --> 04:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
think might be a much harder or pill to
 
04:20:06.349 --> 04:20:06.359 align:start position:0%
swallow yeah no I think it's clear I
 
04:20:08.210 --> 04:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
think we understand what you're what
 
04:20:09.650 --> 04:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
04:20:11.929 --> 04:20:11.939 align:start position:0%
um it comes down to what should the rate
 
04:20:11.939 --> 04:20:12.769 align:start position:0%
um it comes down to what should the rate
be

04:20:12.769 --> 04:20:12.779 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:20:12.779 --> 04:20:13.550 align:start position:0%
be
um

04:20:13.550 --> 04:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:16.610 --> 04:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
let's um
 
04:20:18.590 --> 04:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:20:21.769 --> 04:20:21.779 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I appreciate everything
 
04:20:23.929 --> 04:20:23.939 align:start position:0%
that's been said and I just want to make
 
04:20:25.670 --> 04:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
an observation that we did take a straw
 
04:20:28.429 --> 04:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
poll of those people in the room we did
 
04:20:30.530 --> 04:20:30.540 align:start position:0%
not take a strong poll of everybody on
 
04:20:32.090 --> 04:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:20:33.950 --> 04:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
04:20:36.170 --> 04:20:36.180 align:start position:0%
right representative Doucet
 
04:20:37.610 --> 04:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
did you
 
04:20:39.650 --> 04:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering the purpose of the
 
04:20:41.510 --> 04:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
straw poll let's let's not do that I'm
 
04:20:43.429 --> 04:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
not against discussing it but if we're
 
04:20:45.229 --> 04:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
going to use it let's use it for its
 
04:20:47.330 --> 04:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
purpose the purpose of the straw poll
 
04:20:48.889 --> 04:20:48.899 align:start position:0%
was to agree on the wording which the
 
04:20:49.969 --> 04:20:49.979 align:start position:0%
majority of the people in the room
 
04:20:51.650 --> 04:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
agreed with
 
04:20:54.229 --> 04:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
but I did say before the straw poll that
 
04:20:56.689 --> 04:20:56.699 align:start position:0%
the 15 percent the tax part we would
 
04:21:01.550 --> 04:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:03.769 --> 04:21:03.779 align:start position:0%
representative spillsberg thank you Mr
 
04:21:06.229 --> 04:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
chairman yes I understood the straw poll
 
04:21:08.570 --> 04:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
the same way so I think that we will
 
04:21:10.969 --> 04:21:10.979 align:start position:0%
Circle back to the rate
 
04:21:12.769 --> 04:21:12.779 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's worth having this next
 
04:21:14.750 --> 04:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
conversation before we try to come down
 
04:21:18.769 --> 04:21:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:21.070 --> 04:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
so picking up where I left off
 
04:21:23.809 --> 04:21:23.819 align:start position:0%
this committee spent an enormous amount
 
04:21:27.290 --> 04:21:27.300 align:start position:0%
of effort just last year
 
04:21:27.300 --> 04:21:28.389 align:start position:0%
of effort just last year
um

04:21:28.389 --> 04:21:28.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:31.429 --> 04:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
evaluating the pros and cons of choices
 
04:21:33.469 --> 04:21:33.479 align:start position:0%
in allocating the funds
 
04:21:38.630 --> 04:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
and we put the emphasis on education
 
04:21:43.670 --> 04:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
and I'd like us to restore that emphasis
 
04:21:43.680 --> 04:21:45.349 align:start position:0%
and I'd like us to restore that emphasis
the

04:21:45.349 --> 04:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:21:45.359 --> 04:21:47.050 align:start position:0%
the
mechanism

04:21:47.050 --> 04:21:47.060 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
04:21:51.469 --> 04:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
in HP 1598 last year
 
04:21:54.889 --> 04:21:54.899 align:start position:0%
was that after the costs of the
 
04:21:56.990 --> 04:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
commission have been paid
 
04:22:00.229 --> 04:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
50 percent of the remaining funds would
 
04:22:02.150 --> 04:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
be dispersed to the Department of
 
04:22:04.010 --> 04:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration to be dispersed
 
04:22:06.530 --> 04:22:06.540 align:start position:0%
to cities and towns to offset the
 
04:22:08.630 --> 04:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
education tax imposed on all persons and
 
04:22:11.990 --> 04:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
property taxable pursuant to RSA 763 and
 
04:22:15.590 --> 04:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
76-8 that's the swept tax
 
04:22:18.410 --> 04:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
so half of the net revenue to the state
 
04:22:21.229 --> 04:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
would go directly
 
04:22:23.750 --> 04:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
to reducing the burden of the real
 
04:22:27.290 --> 04:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
estate tax in our municipalities
 
04:22:29.990 --> 04:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
and I think that's the least it should
 
04:22:30.000 --> 04:22:31.870 align:start position:0%
and I think that's the least it should
be

04:22:31.870 --> 04:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:22:35.210 --> 04:22:35.220 align:start position:0%
1598 went on to then allocate the next
 
04:22:37.849 --> 04:22:37.859 align:start position:0%
30 percent
 
04:22:40.130 --> 04:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
to offset the Retirement System's
 
04:22:42.889 --> 04:22:42.899 align:start position:0%
unfunded accrued liability
 
04:22:46.010 --> 04:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
and it had then a provision which we see
 
04:22:48.530 --> 04:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
repeated in this year's law
 
04:22:50.269 --> 04:22:50.279 align:start position:0%
but in the inverse
 
04:22:52.189 --> 04:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
it says upon certification by the
 
04:22:53.510 --> 04:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
04:22:55.189 --> 04:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
administrative services that the
 
04:22:57.050 --> 04:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
retirement system has no remaining
 
04:22:59.030 --> 04:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
unfunded accrued liability
 
04:23:00.830 --> 04:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
this disbursement of funds shall be
 
04:23:03.590 --> 04:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
credited to the education trust fund
 
04:23:05.750 --> 04:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
so theoretically
 
04:23:09.469 --> 04:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
if the Retirement Systems unfunded crude
 
04:23:12.050 --> 04:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
liability was satisfied we could end up
 
04:23:14.450 --> 04:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
with 80 percent going to education but
 
04:23:16.010 --> 04:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
we know from comments and testimony
 
04:23:17.689 --> 04:23:17.699 align:start position:0%
we've already heard that the likelihood
 
04:23:21.590 --> 04:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
of that in for coming years is very slim
 
04:23:24.830 --> 04:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
so effectively it remains 50 percent to
 
04:23:27.590 --> 04:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
education to offset swept
 
04:23:30.050 --> 04:23:30.060 align:start position:0%
fifty percent to retirement
 
04:23:33.950 --> 04:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
to offset the unfunded accrued liability
 
04:23:37.429 --> 04:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
30 I'm sorry thank you glad to hear
 
04:23:40.790 --> 04:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:42.410 --> 04:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
that leaves
 
04:23:44.630 --> 04:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
um 20 percent
 
04:23:48.590 --> 04:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
and 1598 divided that as follows ten
 
04:23:51.050 --> 04:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
percent of the remaining funds
 
04:23:54.290 --> 04:23:54.300 align:start position:0%
or 25 million whichever is less shall be
 
04:23:55.910 --> 04:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
credited to the Department of Health and
 
04:23:57.889 --> 04:23:57.899 align:start position:0%
Human Services Bureau of drug and
 
04:23:59.809 --> 04:23:59.819 align:start position:0%
alcohol services for use in
 
04:24:01.969 --> 04:24:01.979 align:start position:0%
evidence-based voluntary programs for
 
04:24:04.070 --> 04:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
substance use related education
 
04:24:07.189 --> 04:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
prevention treatment and recovery so we
 
04:24:11.210 --> 04:24:11.220 align:start position:0%
were very mindful of the implications of
 
04:24:14.510 --> 04:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
of having cannabis more freely used
 
04:24:16.370 --> 04:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
five percent of the remaining funds
 
04:24:19.189 --> 04:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
shall be distributed dispersed to Public
 
04:24:22.189 --> 04:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
Safety agencies goes on to specify
 
04:24:25.130 --> 04:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
police fire rescue
 
04:24:26.389 --> 04:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
etc etc
 
04:24:29.389 --> 04:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
and the final five percent again to the
 
04:24:32.990 --> 04:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
DHHS for children's Behavioral Health
 
04:24:33.000 --> 04:24:34.550 align:start position:0%
DHHS for children's Behavioral Health
Services

04:24:34.550 --> 04:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
Services
 
04:24:38.330 --> 04:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
I like that balance it could be tweaked
 
04:24:41.330 --> 04:24:41.340 align:start position:0%
but I would like to propose that we take
 
04:24:43.309 --> 04:24:43.319 align:start position:0%
it in its entirety we can then have a
 
04:24:44.809 --> 04:24:44.819 align:start position:0%
discussion about whether it should be
 
04:24:47.990 --> 04:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
tweaked the fundamental point of this is
 
04:24:49.670 --> 04:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
that it shifts the emphasis back to
 
04:24:49.680 --> 04:24:51.110 align:start position:0%
that it shifts the emphasis back to
education

04:24:51.110 --> 04:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:24:54.349 --> 04:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
and off of of the retirement liabilities
 
04:24:56.150 --> 04:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to make a final comment on
 
04:24:58.610 --> 04:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
that before I give up the floor
 
04:24:58.620 --> 04:25:01.429 align:start position:0%
that before I give up the floor
um

04:25:01.429 --> 04:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:04.309 --> 04:25:04.319 align:start position:0%

04:25:05.809 --> 04:25:05.819 align:start position:0%
some numbers that suggested it would
 
04:25:08.110 --> 04:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
take 130 years
 
04:25:10.969 --> 04:25:10.979 align:start position:0%
using this particular source of excess
 
04:25:10.979 --> 04:25:13.010 align:start position:0%
using this particular source of excess
Revenue

04:25:13.010 --> 04:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
04:25:15.410 --> 04:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
um to satisfy the retirement funds so
 
04:25:18.010 --> 04:25:18.020 align:start position:0%
it's it's not a solution to that problem
 
04:25:22.250 --> 04:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
it's a very material contribution to the
 
04:25:25.130 --> 04:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
extent that it could offset the 363
 
04:25:27.650 --> 04:25:27.660 align:start position:0%
million dollar swept obligation by
 
04:25:29.389 --> 04:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
something in the order of 50 to 80
 
04:25:31.250 --> 04:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
million maybe not in the first year
 
04:25:33.410 --> 04:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
maybe not in the second but in the third
 
04:25:37.189 --> 04:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
third fourth years and on and so that's
 
04:25:39.830 --> 04:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to put the emphasis behind
 
04:25:42.469 --> 04:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
that mission which is much more tangible
 
04:25:46.610 --> 04:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:48.649 --> 04:25:48.659 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:25:51.889 --> 04:25:51.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:53.990 --> 04:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative leapley
 
04:25:56.330 --> 04:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
thank you first I just wanted to clarify
 
04:25:59.389 --> 04:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
did you say was it 10 for health the
 
04:26:02.090 --> 04:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
04:26:04.910 --> 04:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
not the kids one the first one
 
04:26:07.630 --> 04:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
yes so there are two different
 
04:26:10.670 --> 04:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
allocations that would be managed by
 
04:26:12.130 --> 04:26:12.140 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:26:15.889 --> 04:26:15.899 align:start position:0%
and the 10 was for use in evidence-based
 
04:26:18.229 --> 04:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
voluntary programs for substance use
 
04:26:20.149 --> 04:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
related education prevention treatment
 
04:26:21.590 --> 04:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
and Recovery
 
04:26:24.110 --> 04:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
and the five percent would be for
 
04:26:26.990 --> 04:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health Services
 
04:26:30.290 --> 04:26:30.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification
 
04:26:30.300 --> 04:26:32.389 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification
um

04:26:32.389 --> 04:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:36.110 --> 04:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
I remember talking about the 130 years
 
04:26:36.120 --> 04:26:37.610 align:start position:0%
I remember talking about the 130 years
before

04:26:37.610 --> 04:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:26:40.849 --> 04:26:40.859 align:start position:0%
it gets paid off was that according to
 
04:26:42.969 --> 04:26:42.979 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note
 
04:26:42.979 --> 04:26:44.630 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note
attached

04:26:44.630 --> 04:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
attached
 
04:26:47.030 --> 04:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
because I feel like could we
 
04:26:50.149 --> 04:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
get a reminder of
 
04:26:52.429 --> 04:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about as far as
 
04:26:52.439 --> 04:26:56.210 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about as far as
Revenue

04:26:56.210 --> 04:26:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:58.309 --> 04:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
or do we do let's let's not get hung up
 
04:27:00.429 --> 04:27:00.439 align:start position:0%
on 130 degrees
 
04:27:03.229 --> 04:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
figuratively that give or take 50 years
 
04:27:06.710 --> 04:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's a long way off right but but to be
 
04:27:09.290 --> 04:27:09.300 align:start position:0%
clear that was representative of
 
04:27:10.849 --> 04:27:10.859 align:start position:0%
brahmi's former representative of
 
04:27:10.859 --> 04:27:12.309 align:start position:0%
brahmi's former representative of
brahmes

04:27:12.309 --> 04:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
brahmes
 
04:27:16.490 --> 04:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
estimate based on the notion of attacks
 
04:27:20.689 --> 04:27:20.699 align:start position:0%
in the ballpark of 50 to 57 dollars per
 
04:27:23.090 --> 04:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
ounce so it took a very very different
 
04:27:27.349 --> 04:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:30.290 --> 04:27:30.300 align:start position:0%
so just one final question just trying
 
04:27:33.590 --> 04:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
to get a handle on some number somewhere
 
04:27:35.929 --> 04:27:35.939 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
04:27:38.389 --> 04:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
representative Ami may have referenced
 
04:27:41.269 --> 04:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
this before we have no idea what it will
 
04:27:44.630 --> 04:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
cost to administer to oversee this
 
04:27:53.469 --> 04:27:53.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:55.490 --> 04:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:27:59.269 --> 04:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:01.309 --> 04:28:01.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner you want to address that
 
04:28:04.010 --> 04:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you Mr chairman well
 
04:28:06.170 --> 04:28:06.180 align:start position:0%
we've done some Tina has done some
 
04:28:09.469 --> 04:28:09.479 align:start position:0%
preliminary costs and what is actually
 
04:28:12.469 --> 04:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note uh tends to be a
 
04:28:12.479 --> 04:28:13.429 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note uh tends to be a
little

04:28:13.429 --> 04:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
little
 
04:28:14.929 --> 04:28:14.939 align:start position:0%
a little light
 
04:28:16.309 --> 04:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
on what
 
04:28:19.210 --> 04:28:19.220 align:start position:0%
on what really needs to be put in we do
 
04:28:21.769 --> 04:28:21.779 align:start position:0%
we do have some estimates here that I'll
 
04:28:21.779 --> 04:28:22.729 align:start position:0%
we do have some estimates here that I'll
have

04:28:22.729 --> 04:28:22.739 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:28:25.550 --> 04:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
I'll have Tina go through uh one of the
 
04:28:28.130 --> 04:28:28.140 align:start position:0%
biggest one of the biggest pieces is we
 
04:28:31.010 --> 04:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
want to make sure when we do this
 
04:28:31.020 --> 04:28:32.450 align:start position:0%
want to make sure when we do this
that

04:28:32.450 --> 04:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:28:34.849 --> 04:28:34.859 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission funds and the
 
04:28:36.349 --> 04:28:36.359 align:start position:0%
Cannabis commission funds aren't
 
04:28:39.410 --> 04:28:39.420 align:start position:0%
co-mingled at any point so we're we're
 
04:28:43.849 --> 04:28:43.859 align:start position:0%
having to uh set up a separate system we
 
04:28:45.950 --> 04:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
never want to put the Liquor Commission
 
04:28:48.170 --> 04:28:48.180 align:start position:0%
Revenue at risk at any time so there has
 
04:28:50.510 --> 04:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
to be a separate system put into place
 
04:28:53.269 --> 04:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
to get that done so we'll have Tina go
 
04:28:55.550 --> 04:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
through them
 
04:28:59.090 --> 04:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh so in the first year
 
04:29:02.149 --> 04:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh based on the timing there will be no
 
04:29:04.210 --> 04:29:04.220 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits
 
04:29:08.510 --> 04:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
we've accounted for a stipend that is uh
 
04:29:11.450 --> 04:29:11.460 align:start position:0%
in the bill for uh current Personnel
 
04:29:13.729 --> 04:29:13.739 align:start position:0%
that are going to overtake or oversee
 
04:29:16.429 --> 04:29:16.439 align:start position:0%
this responsibility that's about a
 
04:29:18.530 --> 04:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
hundred and eighty seven thousand we're
 
04:29:21.410 --> 04:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
estimating about 250 000 for a
 
04:29:23.870 --> 04:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
consultant in the first year
 
04:29:26.570 --> 04:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
uh we we're going to need to look into
 
04:29:29.269 --> 04:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
renting office space doing some
 
04:29:31.870 --> 04:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
construction in our building for staff
 
04:29:35.050 --> 04:29:35.060 align:start position:0%
there's equipment for the positions
 
04:29:39.050 --> 04:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
office furniture cars and the overhead
 
04:29:41.210 --> 04:29:41.220 align:start position:0%
expense so in the initial in the first
 
04:29:41.220 --> 04:29:42.290 align:start position:0%
expense so in the initial in the first
year

04:29:42.290 --> 04:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:29:45.170 --> 04:29:45.180 align:start position:0%
oh and then the Standalone system so
 
04:29:48.050 --> 04:29:48.060 align:start position:0%
we're going to need to do a standalone
 
04:29:50.330 --> 04:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
system that is going to do the seed to
 
04:29:51.710 --> 04:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
sale tracking
 
04:29:53.689 --> 04:29:53.699 align:start position:0%
and then there's also going to need to
 
04:29:56.149 --> 04:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
be a system for the licensing and the
 
04:29:59.269 --> 04:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
auditing aspect and then a financial
 
04:30:01.189 --> 04:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
system if we're not going to have this
 
04:30:03.410 --> 04:30:03.420 align:start position:0%
touch the Liquor Commission system we're
 
04:30:05.510 --> 04:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
going to need a financial system that
 
04:30:08.450 --> 04:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
this all feeds into and with all of
 
04:30:10.490 --> 04:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
those costs not including Personnel in
 
04:30:11.929 --> 04:30:11.939 align:start position:0%
the first year we're estimating about
 
04:30:19.030 --> 04:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:23.269 --> 04:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
yes my Standalone system you mean a
 
04:30:26.450 --> 04:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
software data management system correct
 
04:30:28.130 --> 04:30:28.140 align:start position:0%
purpose that would correct separate from
 
04:30:34.010 --> 04:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:36.769 --> 04:30:36.779 align:start position:0%
we do if someone could make copies Mr
 
04:30:39.429 --> 04:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
chairman we do have we do have a draft
 
04:30:41.510 --> 04:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
we do have a draft
 
04:30:43.809 --> 04:30:43.819 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we have something
 
04:30:46.790 --> 04:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
right now thank you Jennifer thank you
 
04:30:48.349 --> 04:30:48.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:30:53.630 --> 04:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:56.450 --> 04:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
so so that was the first year to have
 
04:30:59.090 --> 04:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
figures beyond that we have three years
 
04:31:03.349 --> 04:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:06.849 --> 04:31:06.859 align:start position:0%
so in in the second year if we were to
 
04:31:09.590 --> 04:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
become fully staffed
 
04:31:11.149 --> 04:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
um we would continue with the stipend
 
04:31:13.309 --> 04:31:13.319 align:start position:0%
which is allocated in the bill for 18
 
04:31:16.070 --> 04:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
months uh continuing with the consultant
 
04:31:18.769 --> 04:31:18.779 align:start position:0%
uh the renting of space and the overhead
 
04:31:22.670 --> 04:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
costs and not knowing how much the new
 
04:31:24.469 --> 04:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
system is going to cost us so in the
 
04:31:26.030 --> 04:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
first year we put five million dollars
 
04:31:29.269 --> 04:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
in for the systems for the licensing and
 
04:31:31.969 --> 04:31:31.979 align:start position:0%
the seed to sale tracking and the
 
04:31:33.530 --> 04:31:33.540 align:start position:0%
financial software we also put another
 
04:31:36.290 --> 04:31:36.300 align:start position:0%
five million in the second year not
 
04:31:38.149 --> 04:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
knowing how much all of these systems
 
04:31:39.769 --> 04:31:39.779 align:start position:0%
and Integrations are going to cost us so
 
04:31:41.090 --> 04:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
in the second year we were estimating
 
04:31:43.010 --> 04:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
about 8 million
 
04:31:45.170 --> 04:31:45.180 align:start position:0%
and then once we have all of the systems
 
04:31:47.030 --> 04:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
in place in the third year for just
 
04:31:49.490 --> 04:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
maintaining the overhead of the
 
04:31:51.769 --> 04:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
operations we were estimating about 4.2
 
04:31:51.779 --> 04:31:55.750 align:start position:0%
operations we were estimating about 4.2
million

04:31:55.750 --> 04:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:59.929 --> 04:31:59.939 align:start position:0%
well so that so maintaining the is 4.2
 
04:32:01.309 --> 04:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
million what is the
 
04:32:05.030 --> 04:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
PL that's 4.2 million plus what that's
 
04:32:07.070 --> 04:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
it that's in year three four okay so
 
04:32:08.630 --> 04:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
that includes salaries and everything
 
04:32:10.570 --> 04:32:10.580 align:start position:0%
okay that's everything fully staff
 
04:32:13.790 --> 04:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
representative fellows so how many
 
04:32:15.349 --> 04:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
um what kind of assumption did you make
 
04:32:17.149 --> 04:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
on the number of facilities that you'd
 
04:32:19.610 --> 04:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
have to interact with
 
04:32:22.309 --> 04:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
well I think the software is is would be
 
04:32:25.269 --> 04:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
unlimited so the the
 
04:32:28.670 --> 04:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
software is I'm asking about the year
 
04:32:32.090 --> 04:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
three when we'd be operational or at
 
04:32:35.149 --> 04:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
this point at the end of year three will
 
04:32:37.490 --> 04:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
there be any facilities open and you'll
 
04:32:37.500 --> 04:32:38.389 align:start position:0%
there be any facilities open and you'll
be

04:32:38.389 --> 04:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:32:41.149 --> 04:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
you know doing oh absolutely I I think
 
04:32:44.090 --> 04:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
so how many facilities did you assume
 
04:32:46.250 --> 04:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
this is a cost estimate of what it would
 
04:32:48.649 --> 04:32:48.659 align:start position:0%
cost The Liquor Commission to do it the
 
04:32:52.130 --> 04:32:52.140 align:start position:0%
the facilities are privately owned
 
04:32:53.870 --> 04:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
aren't you going to inspect the
 
04:32:57.830 --> 04:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
facilities yes how many people seven
 
04:33:00.229 --> 04:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
people seven seven Enforcement Officers
 
04:33:05.209 --> 04:33:05.219 align:start position:0%
seven people is how many you'd need to
 
04:33:10.010 --> 04:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
um inspect in audit or whatever how many
 
04:33:15.170 --> 04:33:15.180 align:start position:0%
retail outlets and retail outlets and
 
04:33:15.180 --> 04:33:16.131 align:start position:0%
retail outlets and retail outlets and
um

04:33:16.131 --> 04:33:16.141 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:29.570 --> 04:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:32.269 --> 04:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
so it
 
04:33:35.570 --> 04:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
at the point of how the operation runs
 
04:33:39.709 --> 04:33:39.719 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes the we've estimated
 
04:33:45.410 --> 04:33:45.420 align:start position:0%
this cost and we have a breakdown on uh
 
04:33:48.051 --> 04:33:48.061 align:start position:0%
on the org chart in positions that's
 
04:33:50.150 --> 04:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
something separate that we can we can
 
04:33:53.090 --> 04:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
hand out to you but it's a the number of
 
04:33:56.330 --> 04:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
facilities wouldn't be a concern from a
 
04:33:58.131 --> 04:33:58.141 align:start position:0%
cost standpoint of the Liquor Commission
 
04:34:01.310 --> 04:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
other than the inspection pieces
 
04:34:04.849 --> 04:34:04.859 align:start position:0%
the cost of those facilities being open
 
04:34:08.449 --> 04:34:08.459 align:start position:0%
are borne by the people who open them
 
04:34:13.670 --> 04:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
I I'm asking about your budget
 
04:34:18.250 --> 04:34:18.260 align:start position:0%
to for the Cannabis commission operation
 
04:34:21.890 --> 04:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
you're going to have people
 
04:34:25.970 --> 04:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
who will have jobs related to this in
 
04:34:25.980 --> 04:34:27.551 align:start position:0%
who will have jobs related to this in
inspecting

04:34:27.551 --> 04:34:27.561 align:start position:0%
inspecting
 
04:34:31.670 --> 04:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
what whatever I you know processing the
 
04:34:34.730 --> 04:34:34.740 align:start position:0%
applications managing the money
 
04:34:37.010 --> 04:34:37.020 align:start position:0%
how many facilities
 
04:34:40.131 --> 04:34:40.141 align:start position:0%
are you trying to did you put in your
 
04:34:40.141 --> 04:34:42.529 align:start position:0%
are you trying to did you put in your
estimate

04:34:42.529 --> 04:34:42.539 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
04:34:44.510 --> 04:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
we didn't do the estimate based on the
 
04:34:47.029 --> 04:34:47.039 align:start position:0%
number of facilities we did the estimate
 
04:34:51.230 --> 04:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
based on the final overall need as far
 
04:34:53.590 --> 04:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
as the number of positions
 
04:34:57.289 --> 04:34:57.299 align:start position:0%
for running the operations so in the
 
04:34:59.029 --> 04:34:59.039 align:start position:0%
first year it would be if we were fully
 
04:35:01.189 --> 04:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
staffed but I don't know if you have a
 
04:35:03.051 --> 04:35:03.061 align:start position:0%
better answer as far as the number of
 
04:35:08.929 --> 04:35:08.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:10.010 --> 04:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
04:35:12.170 --> 04:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
representative Mark armagedian chief of
 
04:35:14.869 --> 04:35:14.879 align:start position:0%
enforcement for the Liquor Commission
 
04:35:17.390 --> 04:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
um so that's a unknown number right
 
04:35:19.490 --> 04:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
because we don't know how many are
 
04:35:21.470 --> 04:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
coming in but we have to prepare for
 
04:35:24.349 --> 04:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
what the possibility of what we've seen
 
04:35:27.529 --> 04:35:27.539 align:start position:0%
in our universe being New England being
 
04:35:29.810 --> 04:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
that number we're preparing for a
 
04:35:31.730 --> 04:35:31.740 align:start position:0%
thousand between zero and a thousand
 
04:35:34.670 --> 04:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
which gives us somewhere and that's
 
04:35:37.551 --> 04:35:37.561 align:start position:0%
cultivators all the way on through so
 
04:35:39.289 --> 04:35:39.299 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at is our
 
04:35:43.010 --> 04:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
investigators are in the ballpark of uh
 
04:35:47.090 --> 04:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
overseeing somewhere around 200 100 to
 
04:35:51.289 --> 04:35:51.299 align:start position:0%
200 facilities a piece
 
04:35:54.051 --> 04:35:54.061 align:start position:0%
um that is auditing and that is doing
 
04:35:57.949 --> 04:35:57.959 align:start position:0%
compliance and inspections
 
04:36:01.310 --> 04:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
so multifaceted
 
04:36:03.529 --> 04:36:03.539 align:start position:0%
and you can see here in the startup cost
 
04:36:07.609 --> 04:36:07.619 align:start position:0%
that it's including 20 20 individuals to
 
04:36:11.029 --> 04:36:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:13.730 --> 04:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
equipment for 20 people laptop printers
 
04:36:13.740 --> 04:36:14.929 align:start position:0%
equipment for 20 people laptop printers
phones

04:36:14.929 --> 04:36:14.939 align:start position:0%
phones
 
04:36:14.939 --> 04:36:15.949 align:start position:0%
phones
Etc

04:36:15.949 --> 04:36:15.959 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
04:36:18.230 --> 04:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
it'll be a complete separate division
 
04:36:20.510 --> 04:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
the way it's set up so the folks that
 
04:36:22.849 --> 04:36:22.859 align:start position:0%
are working on the Cannabis piece will
 
04:36:24.830 --> 04:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
never be touching anything that has to
 
04:36:27.051 --> 04:36:27.061 align:start position:0%
do with the Liquor Commission piece it's
 
04:36:31.250 --> 04:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:33.551 --> 04:36:33.561 align:start position:0%
you have a question representative
 
04:36:35.209 --> 04:36:35.219 align:start position:0%
representative Almy and then
 
04:36:35.219 --> 04:36:40.609 align:start position:0%
representative Almy and then
representative

04:36:40.609 --> 04:36:40.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:40.619 --> 04:36:41.990 align:start position:0%
 
enforcement

04:36:41.990 --> 04:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
04:36:46.551 --> 04:36:46.561 align:start position:0%
fish officer 's and then 13 that do the
 
04:36:49.970 --> 04:36:49.980 align:start position:0%
licensing that do the the
 
04:36:49.980 --> 04:36:51.349 align:start position:0%
licensing that do the the
um

04:36:51.349 --> 04:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:55.369 --> 04:36:55.379 align:start position:0%
data data analysis and and
 
04:36:58.670 --> 04:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
all of that is that the finance yes
 
04:37:03.349 --> 04:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah okay and where is the
 
04:37:05.689 --> 04:37:05.699 align:start position:0%
testing laboratory The Testing
 
04:37:07.670 --> 04:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
Laboratories are separate facilities
 
04:37:09.349 --> 04:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
they're businesses that are privately
 
04:37:12.289 --> 04:37:12.299 align:start position:0%
owned and privately licensed and I
 
04:37:14.750 --> 04:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
believe in Maine there's three maybe
 
04:37:16.970 --> 04:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
three in Maine I think there's three in
 
04:37:19.609 --> 04:37:19.619 align:start position:0%
Maine that do it now and who who would
 
04:37:21.830 --> 04:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
be paying them
 
04:37:24.590 --> 04:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
visit the state no they're they're being
 
04:37:27.310 --> 04:37:27.320 align:start position:0%
paid by the company that's either
 
04:37:30.410 --> 04:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
manufacturing or growing the products
 
04:37:33.230 --> 04:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
brings their product to that facility to
 
04:37:36.529 --> 04:37:36.539 align:start position:0%
be tested and they pay those facilities
 
04:37:39.890 --> 04:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
to have their products tested
 
04:37:39.900 --> 04:37:44.029 align:start position:0%
to have their products tested
so

04:37:44.029 --> 04:37:44.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:45.650 --> 04:37:45.660 align:start position:0%
the seventh
 
04:37:47.449 --> 04:37:47.459 align:start position:0%
Heaven going to be going
 
04:37:51.650 --> 04:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
to do well to do enforcement on who who
 
04:37:54.410 --> 04:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
is looking at the
 
04:37:57.709 --> 04:37:57.719 align:start position:0%
um growing facilities that would be the
 
04:37:59.390 --> 04:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement investigation that would be
 
04:38:01.970 --> 04:38:01.980 align:start position:0%
the enforcement of investigators
 
04:38:03.369 --> 04:38:03.379 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:38:07.070 --> 04:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
and any testing that gets done will be
 
04:38:10.310 --> 04:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
that the the owner of the growing
 
04:38:13.269 --> 04:38:13.279 align:start position:0%
facility or the manufacturing facility
 
04:38:16.789 --> 04:38:16.799 align:start position:0%
picks his own sample and takes it there
 
04:38:19.369 --> 04:38:19.379 align:start position:0%
that's correct they go to those Sam
 
04:38:21.410 --> 04:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
everything that they grow and or
 
04:38:23.990 --> 04:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
manufacture before it can be sold has to
 
04:38:26.390 --> 04:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
be tested everything everything it has
 
04:38:28.551 --> 04:38:28.561 align:start position:0%
to go through that process
 
04:38:31.250 --> 04:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
and it has to go to those again the
 
04:38:33.170 --> 04:38:33.180 align:start position:0%
reason the reason I believe it's been
 
04:38:36.709 --> 04:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
done this way is because it's it's near
 
04:38:39.230 --> 04:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
the twain shall meet the manufacturers
 
04:38:42.470 --> 04:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
and Industry uh people that are growing
 
04:38:45.529 --> 04:38:45.539 align:start position:0%
are are not involved and cannot be
 
04:38:47.390 --> 04:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
involved with the testing facilities
 
04:38:49.609 --> 04:38:49.619 align:start position:0%
it's a separate business it's a separate
 
04:38:49.619 --> 04:38:50.869 align:start position:0%
it's a separate business it's a separate
license

04:38:50.869 --> 04:38:50.879 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:38:52.970 --> 04:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
so the
 
04:38:57.429 --> 04:38:57.439 align:start position:0%
the grower that has
 
04:39:03.170 --> 04:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
500 pounds or 200 pounds of marijuana
 
04:39:05.990 --> 04:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
leaf will take all of it to the testing
 
04:39:09.590 --> 04:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
facility and they'll do the sampling
 
04:39:12.289 --> 04:39:12.299 align:start position:0%
they they will do the they will take it
 
04:39:16.789 --> 04:39:16.799 align:start position:0%
by the skew is is is my understanding of
 
04:39:19.189 --> 04:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
it when it when a seed is planted it has
 
04:39:22.250 --> 04:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
a skew so when that when that product is
 
04:39:22.260 --> 04:39:23.650 align:start position:0%
a skew so when that when that product is
gone

04:39:23.650 --> 04:39:23.660 align:start position:0%
gone
 
04:39:26.390 --> 04:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
ask your stock keeping unit which is
 
04:39:28.609 --> 04:39:28.619 align:start position:0%
it's just your but your barcode
 
04:39:30.709 --> 04:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
everything gets a barcode every plant
 
04:39:33.709 --> 04:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
gets a barcode so when that plant goes
 
04:39:37.730 --> 04:39:37.740 align:start position:0%
to be sold that plant is taken to the
 
04:39:40.368 --> 04:39:40.378 align:start position:0%
testing facility and tested now in the
 
04:39:42.890 --> 04:39:42.900 align:start position:0%
facilities that I've seen especially the
 
04:39:46.250 --> 04:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
indoor facilities most of them are you
 
04:39:49.910 --> 04:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
know 20 25 30 000 square feet so you
 
04:39:54.110 --> 04:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
have a facility that's then divided into
 
04:39:57.650 --> 04:39:57.660 align:start position:0%
let's say five or six thousand square
 
04:40:01.130 --> 04:40:01.140 align:start position:0%
foot squares and each one of those rooms
 
04:40:04.550 --> 04:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
is a grow room so there's heating
 
04:40:07.070 --> 04:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
lighting air conditioning air
 
04:40:09.530 --> 04:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
conditioning humidity and there's some
 
04:40:11.410 --> 04:40:11.420 align:start position:0%
where between
 
04:40:15.590 --> 04:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
300 and to 600 plants in that room
 
04:40:18.948 --> 04:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
so they're all given a skew they're all
 
04:40:21.890 --> 04:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
given uh they're they're all grown and
 
04:40:24.288 --> 04:40:24.298 align:start position:0%
every one of those facilities each one
 
04:40:26.630 --> 04:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
of those individual facilities within
 
04:40:29.448 --> 04:40:29.458 align:start position:0%
that larger facility most of them have a
 
04:40:32.330 --> 04:40:32.340 align:start position:0%
a reproductive rate of every two weeks
 
04:40:34.788 --> 04:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
they're harvesting a room so there's a
 
04:40:37.070 --> 04:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
lot of product that's rolling through
 
04:40:39.948 --> 04:40:39.958 align:start position:0%
these rooms and you know from being
 
04:40:42.110 --> 04:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
planted to seed to through a product
 
04:40:46.270 --> 04:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
until it's harvested so uh
 
04:40:49.368 --> 04:40:49.378 align:start position:0%
these testing facilities are are pretty
 
04:40:52.368 --> 04:40:52.378 align:start position:0%
vast they have to be able to take in a
 
04:40:54.770 --> 04:40:54.780 align:start position:0%
lot of product and testing and obviously
 
04:40:57.170 --> 04:40:57.180 align:start position:0%
there'd be several of those we think as
 
04:41:00.708 --> 04:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
well as a smaller manufacturers
 
04:41:00.718 --> 04:41:01.610 align:start position:0%
well as a smaller manufacturers
okay

04:41:01.610 --> 04:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:41:01.620 --> 04:41:03.590 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:41:03.590 --> 04:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:05.330 --> 04:41:05.340 align:start position:0%
as time goes on we're losing more and
 
04:41:07.130 --> 04:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
more people so um I'm gonna go to
 
04:41:09.410 --> 04:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
representative roachford and then I want
 
04:41:11.750 --> 04:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
to focus back on representative
 
04:41:13.610 --> 04:41:13.620 align:start position:0%
spilsbury's presentation of the
 
04:41:16.190 --> 04:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
allocation and kind of get that under
 
04:41:19.368 --> 04:41:19.378 align:start position:0%
our belt because as you can see there's
 
04:41:20.868 --> 04:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
a lot there's a lot to discuss here but
 
04:41:23.690 --> 04:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
we need to contain it and continue to
 
04:41:25.850 --> 04:41:25.860 align:start position:0%
make progress so representative great
 
04:41:28.430 --> 04:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and I just wanna
 
04:41:30.530 --> 04:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
you set a number here I want to make
 
04:41:33.110 --> 04:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
sure I I got it right uh so there's
 
04:41:34.788 --> 04:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
seven maybe seven on seven Enforcement
 
04:41:37.910 --> 04:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
Officers I got that and I think you said
 
04:41:41.150 --> 04:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
each officer you're anticipating
 
04:41:45.530 --> 04:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
will be will be responsible for 200
 
04:41:50.170 --> 04:41:50.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:53.510 --> 04:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
I believe that the chief uh sent up two
 
04:41:56.150 --> 04:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
up to 200. okay all right so some of
 
04:41:58.250 --> 04:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
these facilities are obviously small
 
04:42:00.590 --> 04:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
facilities sure absolutely
 
04:42:03.650 --> 04:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
um so you're anticipating a pretty
 
04:42:07.430 --> 04:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
pretty uh widespread adoption and you
 
04:42:08.930 --> 04:42:08.940 align:start position:0%
know you're anticipating some pretty
 
04:42:11.510 --> 04:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
growth in this industry absolutely this
 
04:42:14.208 --> 04:42:14.218 align:start position:0%
this has the ability to be a very robust
 
04:42:17.150 --> 04:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
business so I think that maybe it sounds
 
04:42:18.890 --> 04:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
like maybe I mean you've been hearing
 
04:42:20.990 --> 04:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
some of our you know
 
04:42:24.050 --> 04:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
hesitations or questions about
 
04:42:24.060 --> 04:42:24.650 align:start position:0%
hesitations or questions about
um

04:42:24.650 --> 04:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:26.390 --> 04:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
is it going to be viable is there going
 
04:42:28.250 --> 04:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
to be enough Revenue it doesn't sound
 
04:42:30.350 --> 04:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
like you're you and you've done a lot of
 
04:42:32.030 --> 04:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
research you've told you've testified of
 
04:42:34.368 --> 04:42:34.378 align:start position:0%
that all day it doesn't sound like
 
04:42:37.430 --> 04:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
you're worried about Revenue with this
 
04:42:41.150 --> 04:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
no why I I will only say they're the one
 
04:42:45.230 --> 04:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
caveat is the the time that it takes the
 
04:42:48.708 --> 04:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
investors to build their facilities and
 
04:42:51.830 --> 04:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
grow the product so there's there's from
 
04:42:54.230 --> 04:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
my understanding of it usually the first
 
04:42:56.510 --> 04:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
growth is is a throwaway growth they
 
04:42:59.868 --> 04:42:59.878 align:start position:0%
they grow it they test it and then as
 
04:43:02.868 --> 04:43:02.878 align:start position:0%
they start to grow they kind of they
 
04:43:05.868 --> 04:43:05.878 align:start position:0%
stockpile it so they they cultivate the
 
04:43:08.690 --> 04:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
bud they start to manufacture so there's
 
04:43:11.030 --> 04:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
a period of time from one to three years
 
04:43:14.810 --> 04:43:14.820 align:start position:0%
where there'll be uh very little Revenue
 
04:43:17.448 --> 04:43:17.458 align:start position:0%
other than the licensing revenue and
 
04:43:19.128 --> 04:43:19.138 align:start position:0%
then as
 
04:43:21.590 --> 04:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
again one of the one of the cautionary
 
04:43:24.230 --> 04:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
tales that I've been told is make sure
 
04:43:26.570 --> 04:43:26.580 align:start position:0%
you have your cultivation and
 
04:43:29.390 --> 04:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing in place with plenty of
 
04:43:32.208 --> 04:43:32.218 align:start position:0%
stock to sell because when you do open
 
04:43:32.218 --> 04:43:33.590 align:start position:0%
stock to sell because when you do open
those

04:43:33.590 --> 04:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:43:37.310 --> 04:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
80 90 100 stores in the state they're
 
04:43:39.050 --> 04:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
going to you have to fill the pipeline
 
04:43:42.310 --> 04:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
first and then there'll be the revenue
 
04:43:45.288 --> 04:43:45.298 align:start position:0%
uh the constant Revenue that comes in
 
04:43:47.510 --> 04:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
and you know even with as many
 
04:43:50.390 --> 04:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
facilities as they have in Maine
 
04:43:54.590 --> 04:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
my understanding has been that they uh
 
04:43:57.410 --> 04:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
they are on at the limit of what the
 
04:44:01.430 --> 04:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturers can currently grow so uh
 
04:44:03.110 --> 04:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
so I guess to answer your question
 
04:44:05.690 --> 04:44:05.700 align:start position:0%
representative we're not concerned about
 
04:44:05.700 --> 04:44:07.550 align:start position:0%
representative we're not concerned about
uh

04:44:07.550 --> 04:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:44:10.310 --> 04:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
the the revenue once everything is
 
04:44:12.650 --> 04:44:12.660 align:start position:0%
brought up to speed it's not if it will
 
04:44:14.448 --> 04:44:14.458 align:start position:0%
happen it's it's kind of when it will
 
04:44:17.448 --> 04:44:17.458 align:start position:0%
happen and we we feel that there's a lot
 
04:44:19.788 --> 04:44:19.798 align:start position:0%
of people in the state that are willing
 
04:44:22.670 --> 04:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
to invest uh given that the state is
 
04:44:25.070 --> 04:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
going to be in control of it and given
 
04:44:28.310 --> 04:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
our history as the Liquor Commission
 
04:44:30.170 --> 04:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:44:33.230 --> 04:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
okay so um let's get back to what
 
04:44:36.170 --> 04:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury uh presented in
 
04:44:37.788 --> 04:44:37.798 align:start position:0%
terms of where the money would go
 
04:44:37.798 --> 04:44:39.708 align:start position:0%
terms of where the money would go
thoughts

04:44:39.708 --> 04:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
04:44:42.288 --> 04:44:42.298 align:start position:0%
on that
 
04:44:46.430 --> 04:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:48.708 --> 04:44:48.718 align:start position:0%
I like it a lot better
 
04:44:50.690 --> 04:44:50.700 align:start position:0%
thank you representative roachford I
 
04:44:52.430 --> 04:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
concur with that I think representative
 
04:44:54.708 --> 04:44:54.718 align:start position:0%
spilsbury brought up the fact about our
 
04:44:56.690 --> 04:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
constituents are asking for help in
 
04:44:59.208 --> 04:44:59.218 align:start position:0%
education and and this would do that so
 
04:45:02.150 --> 04:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
I I would concur
 
04:45:04.368 --> 04:45:04.378 align:start position:0%
um representative Doucet and I'm in
 
04:45:06.470 --> 04:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
agreement too I think we we drilled down
 
04:45:09.590 --> 04:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
if you remember correctly with the
 
04:45:11.390 --> 04:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
breakdown with that piece of legislation
 
04:45:15.590 --> 04:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
last year and specific to HHS naming
 
04:45:18.650 --> 04:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
specific uh purposes to use those funds
 
04:45:20.810 --> 04:45:20.820 align:start position:0%
and this makes a heck of a lot more
 
04:45:20.820 --> 04:45:21.948 align:start position:0%
and this makes a heck of a lot more
sense

04:45:21.948 --> 04:45:21.958 align:start position:0%
sense
 
04:45:23.270 --> 04:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative Platt and then
 
04:45:25.190 --> 04:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative fellows not only do I
 
04:45:27.110 --> 04:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
agree I think it's beyond our purview to
 
04:45:29.448 --> 04:45:29.458 align:start position:0%
change that's policy that's already been
 
04:45:32.628 --> 04:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
baked in we're after the rate we're at
 
04:45:32.638 --> 04:45:34.310 align:start position:0%
baked in we're after the rate we're at
level

04:45:34.310 --> 04:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
level
 
04:45:36.350 --> 04:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
did you want to comment I'd like to just
 
04:45:38.030 --> 04:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
respond directly to that
 
04:45:38.040 --> 04:45:39.050 align:start position:0%
respond directly to that
um

04:45:39.050 --> 04:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:41.690 --> 04:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
this is essentially a dedicated funds
 
04:45:44.150 --> 04:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds are fundamentally a ways
 
04:45:47.628 --> 04:45:47.638 align:start position:0%
and means issue
 
04:45:50.628 --> 04:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you
 
04:45:50.638 --> 04:45:51.288 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you
um

04:45:51.288 --> 04:45:51.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:55.070 --> 04:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
having been on Edna and also have having
 
04:45:57.948 --> 04:45:57.958 align:start position:0%
had a conversation with Marty Kalin who
 
04:46:00.948 --> 04:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
works for retirement
 
04:46:03.770 --> 04:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
um and I can tell you from this report
 
04:46:06.470 --> 04:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
from the retirement system that the
 
04:46:12.230 --> 04:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
unfunded actual Actuarial liability as
 
04:46:13.868 --> 04:46:13.878 align:start position:0%
of June
 
04:46:13.878 --> 04:46:15.670 align:start position:0%
of June
30th

04:46:15.670 --> 04:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
30th
 
04:46:19.910 --> 04:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
2022 was 5.7
 
04:46:23.270 --> 04:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
billion that's billion with a B
 
04:46:26.628 --> 04:46:26.638 align:start position:0%
and there is already in existence
 
04:46:28.730 --> 04:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
existence it might even be in statute
 
04:46:32.930 --> 04:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure uh a schedule for paying
 
04:46:35.628 --> 04:46:35.638 align:start position:0%
down that unfunded liability and it's
 
04:46:38.030 --> 04:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
paid for by the employers
 
04:46:41.448 --> 04:46:41.458 align:start position:0%
and it's scheduled to be paid off
 
04:46:45.190 --> 04:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
in 2039
 
04:46:48.170 --> 04:46:48.180 align:start position:0%
if we're looking at
 
04:46:52.610 --> 04:46:52.620 align:start position:0%
30 percent of the revenue from cannabis
 
04:46:55.490 --> 04:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
and sending that to address the unfunded
 
04:46:59.090 --> 04:46:59.100 align:start position:0%
liability it wouldn't
 
04:47:02.208 --> 04:47:02.218 align:start position:0%
um remove it wouldn't change what the
 
04:47:04.730 --> 04:47:04.740 align:start position:0%
employers have to contribute what it
 
04:47:07.310 --> 04:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
would do is make it end a little bit
 
04:47:11.330 --> 04:47:11.340 align:start position:0%
earlier so instead of 2039 it might end
 
04:47:15.530 --> 04:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
in 2038 but given the magnitude of what
 
04:47:16.850 --> 04:47:16.860 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here you know
 
04:47:18.530 --> 04:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
getting rid of
 
04:47:18.540 --> 04:47:19.070 align:start position:0%
getting rid of
um

04:47:19.070 --> 04:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:22.310 --> 04:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
you know five billion dollars worth of
 
04:47:25.010 --> 04:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
debt the amount of money we could put in
 
04:47:29.750 --> 04:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
would have a very minimal effect on
 
04:47:32.050 --> 04:47:32.060 align:start position:0%
getting rid of that unfunded liability
 
04:47:35.030 --> 04:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be it I don't even think it
 
04:47:37.190 --> 04:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
would make it one year earlier it would
 
04:47:37.200 --> 04:47:38.150 align:start position:0%
would make it one year earlier it would
just

04:47:38.150 --> 04:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:47:41.590 --> 04:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
be a minor contribution for that reason
 
04:47:45.230 --> 04:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
I would like to suggest that we take out
 
04:47:47.330 --> 04:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability altogether and
 
04:47:50.448 --> 04:47:50.458 align:start position:0%
move that into the education funding
 
04:47:52.490 --> 04:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
but the concept you know to have it go
 
04:47:56.628 --> 04:47:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:59.208 --> 04:47:59.218 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:48:00.530 --> 04:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:48:03.590 --> 04:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
um I also just am trying to make sure I
 
04:48:07.368 --> 04:48:07.378 align:start position:0%
get this that the 50 would be an offset
 
04:48:08.930 --> 04:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
to swept
 
04:48:08.940 --> 04:48:10.368 align:start position:0%
to swept
so

04:48:10.368 --> 04:48:10.378 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:48:13.490 --> 04:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
um the property tax bills would lower by
 
04:48:16.368 --> 04:48:16.378 align:start position:0%
however that much turned out but the
 
04:48:19.610 --> 04:48:19.620 align:start position:0%
overall uh impact in terms of funding
 
04:48:22.670 --> 04:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
for Education would not be changed by
 
04:48:25.190 --> 04:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
this this would simply be a change in
 
04:48:25.200 --> 04:48:27.590 align:start position:0%
this this would simply be a change in
source

04:48:27.590 --> 04:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
source
 
04:48:30.170 --> 04:48:30.180 align:start position:0%
that's an extremely important point I
 
04:48:31.448 --> 04:48:31.458 align:start position:0%
agree with you
 
04:48:34.788 --> 04:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
it does not direct more money to
 
04:48:34.798 --> 04:48:36.110 align:start position:0%
it does not direct more money to
education

04:48:36.110 --> 04:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:48:37.670 --> 04:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's simply
 
04:48:40.970 --> 04:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
changes and shifts the burden somewhat
 
04:48:44.470 --> 04:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
off of a real estate property tax
 
04:48:47.330 --> 04:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
every time I have a conversation with
 
04:48:49.910 --> 04:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
any other legislator about how we could
 
04:48:52.070 --> 04:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
embark on phasing out and getting rid of
 
04:48:55.970 --> 04:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
the swept tax I always get hit with find
 
04:49:01.550 --> 04:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:03.948 --> 04:49:03.958 align:start position:0%
and I just follow up on that because
 
04:49:03.958 --> 04:49:04.910 align:start position:0%
and I just follow up on that because
it's

04:49:04.910 --> 04:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:49:08.390 --> 04:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
because it's education funding so
 
04:49:11.868 --> 04:49:11.878 align:start position:0%
um I think that we could put in here and
 
04:49:14.810 --> 04:49:14.820 align:start position:0%
if if we have more money than it than it
 
04:49:17.530 --> 04:49:17.540 align:start position:0%
takes to get rid of swept which is
 
04:49:21.170 --> 04:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
363 million dollars a year so I sort of
 
04:49:24.110 --> 04:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
doubt we'll ever get to that level then
 
04:49:26.090 --> 04:49:26.100 align:start position:0%
you could say put it in the trust fund
 
04:49:28.070 --> 04:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
or put it in one of the other things I
 
04:49:31.430 --> 04:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
mean 363 million is a lot of money
 
04:49:33.288 --> 04:49:33.298 align:start position:0%
representative Bolton
 
04:49:35.628 --> 04:49:35.638 align:start position:0%
and then representative Doucet having
 
04:49:37.788 --> 04:49:37.798 align:start position:0%
heard the estimates of uh actually how
 
04:49:39.830 --> 04:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
much revenue we could possibly get from
 
04:49:42.590 --> 04:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
this and the fact that it was a state
 
04:49:43.788 --> 04:49:43.798 align:start position:0%
employee working for Health Human
 
04:49:46.610 --> 04:49:46.620 align:start position:0%
Services for 20 years I've also been
 
04:49:50.868 --> 04:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
um a um yeah select person for the town
 
04:49:53.330 --> 04:49:53.340 align:start position:0%
of Plymouth I'm thoroughly in favor of
 
04:49:56.208 --> 04:49:56.218 align:start position:0%
the breakdown of these funds
 
04:49:58.670 --> 04:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and and that's
 
04:50:01.250 --> 04:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
what I to to Echo what representative
 
04:50:04.310 --> 04:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
Boyd just said the towns incur the costs
 
04:50:06.470 --> 04:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
for their employees for the for a
 
04:50:08.930 --> 04:50:08.940 align:start position:0%
component or a percentage of the
 
04:50:11.030 --> 04:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
retirement system so either way we're
 
04:50:14.090 --> 04:50:14.100 align:start position:0%
impacting you know the taxpayers we know
 
04:50:16.610 --> 04:50:16.620 align:start position:0%
that they the unfunded mandates of a
 
04:50:19.628 --> 04:50:19.638 align:start position:0%
mountain high to climb maybe we could
 
04:50:23.930 --> 04:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
differentiate the you know uh Flip Flip
 
04:50:25.730 --> 04:50:25.740 align:start position:0%
the percentage and maybe give 50 to the
 
04:50:28.610 --> 04:50:28.620 align:start position:0%
swept and 30 to is that where it's at no
 
04:50:30.530 --> 04:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
it's already there so but I think
 
04:50:32.330 --> 04:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
there's I think it's that is a
 
04:50:35.270 --> 04:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
substantial issue and we heard testimony
 
04:50:37.970 --> 04:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
relative to that last biennium and I
 
04:50:40.128 --> 04:50:40.138 align:start position:0%
think that this breakdown is is a fair
 
04:50:42.530 --> 04:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
breakdown we're not going to overcome
 
04:50:44.868 --> 04:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
that that unfunded obstacle that we all
 
04:50:47.448 --> 04:50:47.458 align:start position:0%
have in front of us but it gives at
 
04:50:49.610 --> 04:50:49.620 align:start position:0%
least uh the towns that
 
04:50:52.610 --> 04:50:52.620 align:start position:0%
a view towards you know a break on that
 
04:50:55.730 --> 04:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
in the swept will will be easy live
 
04:50:57.230 --> 04:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
get over
 
04:51:00.650 --> 04:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:03.650 --> 04:51:03.660 align:start position:0%
representative blue please
 
04:51:06.650 --> 04:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
hold hold that thought I saw
 
04:51:09.890 --> 04:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
a hand from quinoa
 
04:51:25.628 --> 04:51:25.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:28.070 --> 04:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon King Ming Wong text
 
04:51:30.110 --> 04:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
policy Council from the dra
 
04:51:32.208 --> 04:51:32.218 align:start position:0%
um the department does not have a
 
04:51:33.650 --> 04:51:33.660 align:start position:0%
position on the bill and since we're
 
04:51:36.110 --> 04:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
talking about the distribution of the
 
04:51:39.170 --> 04:51:39.180 align:start position:0%
funds to the calculation of the searches
 
04:51:41.810 --> 04:51:41.820 align:start position:0%
feel like this is the opportune time for
 
04:51:43.850 --> 04:51:43.860 align:start position:0%
me to bring this up for for the
 
04:51:46.730 --> 04:51:46.740 align:start position:0%
discussion uh with the committee uh it
 
04:51:50.030 --> 04:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
is the in terms of the timing of when
 
04:51:54.530 --> 04:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
the money would be deposited into the
 
04:51:58.368 --> 04:51:58.378 align:start position:0%
ETF for the calculation of the um this
 
04:52:01.970 --> 04:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
is the rate for the swept taxes and this
 
04:52:05.390 --> 04:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
language is uh in both the current
 
04:52:09.350 --> 04:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
amended HP 639 as well as in the uh
 
04:52:13.448 --> 04:52:13.458 align:start position:0%
prior years HB um 12.
 
04:52:16.610 --> 04:52:16.620 align:start position:0%
1598 1598 that's right
 
04:52:20.090 --> 04:52:20.100 align:start position:0%
um and it says at the end of the uh the
 
04:52:22.128 --> 04:52:22.138 align:start position:0%
sentence at the end of the paragraph
 
04:52:24.470 --> 04:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
that says that the bill the the rate
 
04:52:28.310 --> 04:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
shall be applied to the uh the effective
 
04:52:30.830 --> 04:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
next fiscal year
 
04:52:33.830 --> 04:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
um essentially right now if we're
 
04:52:35.868 --> 04:52:35.878 align:start position:0%
talking about next fiscal year is fiscal
 
04:52:37.430 --> 04:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
year 24
 
04:52:39.350 --> 04:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
the swap rate has already been
 
04:52:42.530 --> 04:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
calculated for fiscal year 24.
 
04:52:43.850 --> 04:52:43.860 align:start position:0%
um so it's just a matter of
 
04:52:45.948 --> 04:52:45.958 align:start position:0%
clarification in terms of when that
 
04:52:48.650 --> 04:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
rates be will be applicable so it would
 
04:52:50.990 --> 04:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
be whether
 
04:52:53.628 --> 04:52:53.638 align:start position:0%
would this be undoing the rate that has
 
04:52:55.730 --> 04:52:55.740 align:start position:0%
already been calculated for fiscal year
 
04:52:59.868 --> 04:52:59.878 align:start position:0%
24 versus would this be a rate that
 
04:53:02.090 --> 04:53:02.100 align:start position:0%
would be applicable for the cat in the
 
04:53:03.650 --> 04:53:03.660 align:start position:0%
consideration for the calculation in
 
04:53:06.050 --> 04:53:06.060 align:start position:0%
fiscal 25 rates so that's just something
 
04:53:07.670 --> 04:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
that probably
 
04:53:10.430 --> 04:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
maybe certain um cleaning up of the
 
04:53:13.430 --> 04:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
language or if it's really evident there
 
04:53:15.590 --> 04:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
then then there's no need to to clarify
 
04:53:17.868 --> 04:53:17.878 align:start position:0%
that just to bring this up for the
 
04:53:20.628 --> 04:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
committee's consideration okay
 
04:53:22.550 --> 04:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you I I don't know the answer to
 
04:53:24.770 --> 04:53:24.780 align:start position:0%
that but
 
04:53:26.930 --> 04:53:26.940 align:start position:0%
uh does anybody know when that would
 
04:53:26.940 --> 04:53:29.090 align:start position:0%
uh does anybody know when that would
apply

04:53:29.090 --> 04:53:29.100 align:start position:0%
apply
 
04:53:30.830 --> 04:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
well I
 
04:53:33.590 --> 04:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
I concur with uh I mean it makes sense
 
04:53:36.850 --> 04:53:36.860 align:start position:0%
with King Wong the language in our bill
 
04:53:39.110 --> 04:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
specifically says this rate shall be
 
04:53:40.850 --> 04:53:40.860 align:start position:0%
effective for the following fiscal year
 
04:53:43.910 --> 04:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay so it's it's based on what occurs
 
04:53:46.970 --> 04:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
in this year affecting the rate to be
 
04:53:50.868 --> 04:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:53.810 --> 04:53:53.820 align:start position:0%
so if that's how the language is uh is
 
04:53:56.390 --> 04:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
being read then uh probably it needs to
 
04:53:58.550 --> 04:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
be um clarified what's the intention of
 
04:54:02.030 --> 04:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
the uh the legislation whether is it to
 
04:54:04.850 --> 04:54:04.860 align:start position:0%
have it effective if um the next fiscal
 
04:54:07.070 --> 04:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
year or have it be effective for the
 
04:54:09.830 --> 04:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
calculation for the next calculation for
 
04:54:12.830 --> 04:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
the swept rate which will be the
 
04:54:15.410 --> 04:54:15.420 align:start position:0%
following that we should be in the
 
04:54:16.788 --> 04:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
fiscal year following the next fiscal
 
04:54:20.570 --> 04:54:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:23.690 --> 04:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
representative fellows so I I don't know
 
04:54:26.030 --> 04:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
which page you look
 
04:54:29.030 --> 04:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
you look on me so I'm what I'm wondering
 
04:54:32.510 --> 04:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
is I think you're talking about
 
04:54:35.090 --> 04:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
um applying it
 
04:54:38.628 --> 04:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
before you print the warrant
 
04:54:41.448 --> 04:54:41.458 align:start position:0%
exactly but so I'm wondering is there
 
04:54:44.868 --> 04:54:44.878 align:start position:0%
any possibility that you
 
04:54:47.448 --> 04:54:47.458 align:start position:0%
send the warrant out just the way we're
 
04:54:49.010 --> 04:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
doing it now
 
04:54:51.830 --> 04:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
but when it comes time to set the tax
 
04:54:51.840 --> 04:54:52.910 align:start position:0%
but when it comes time to set the tax
rate

04:54:52.910 --> 04:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
rate
 
04:54:55.910 --> 04:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
you use the money that's identified at
 
04:54:57.948 --> 04:54:57.958 align:start position:0%
that point almost make it look like a
 
04:54:57.958 --> 04:54:59.570 align:start position:0%
that point almost make it look like a
revenue

04:54:59.570 --> 04:54:59.580 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
04:55:02.330 --> 04:55:02.340 align:start position:0%
do you understand what I'm saying well
 
04:55:05.090 --> 04:55:05.100 align:start position:0%
when the warn is sent out the uh
 
04:55:07.610 --> 04:55:07.620 align:start position:0%
the rate that
 
04:55:09.410 --> 04:55:09.420 align:start position:0%
the amount that needs to be collected by
 
04:55:12.470 --> 04:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
the town has been determined
 
04:55:15.590 --> 04:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
right so um so that would be when uh and
 
04:55:15.600 --> 04:55:16.430 align:start position:0%
right so um so that would be when uh and
then

04:55:16.430 --> 04:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:55:19.610 --> 04:55:19.620 align:start position:0%
and then further on late later on uh the
 
04:55:21.230 --> 04:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
rate will be determined
 
04:55:23.150 --> 04:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
at a later date
 
04:55:25.970 --> 04:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
um in the collection of um of that for
 
04:55:27.650 --> 04:55:27.660 align:start position:0%
that particular amount in that
 
04:55:29.330 --> 04:55:29.340 align:start position:0%
particular town
 
04:55:31.670 --> 04:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
um so I believe that this since the war
 
04:55:33.590 --> 04:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
has already been sent out the amount
 
04:55:36.410 --> 04:55:36.420 align:start position:0%
it's already been calculated what amount
 
04:55:38.628 --> 04:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
has needs to be collected for by each
 
04:55:42.350 --> 04:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
municipality to get to the 363 million
 
04:55:44.270 --> 04:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
um and I believe this
 
04:55:47.890 --> 04:55:47.900 align:start position:0%
the language in this bill is to reduce
 
04:55:52.550 --> 04:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
that warrant warrant amount yeah
 
04:55:54.650 --> 04:55:54.660 align:start position:0%
so I I still don't know where the
 
04:55:56.570 --> 04:55:56.580 align:start position:0%
language is but I'm just you know
 
04:55:59.690 --> 04:55:59.700 align:start position:0%
hearing what you're saying I'm wondering
 
04:55:59.700 --> 04:56:00.830 align:start position:0%
hearing what you're saying I'm wondering
can

04:56:00.830 --> 04:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:56:03.770 --> 04:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
somehow change the language so what you
 
04:56:08.868 --> 04:56:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:11.270 --> 04:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know some somehow we apply it
 
04:56:13.990 --> 04:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
when we're setting the tax rates
 
04:56:16.070 --> 04:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me I think representative
 
04:56:18.948 --> 04:56:18.958 align:start position:0%
spilsbury has found something if you
 
04:56:20.990 --> 04:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
look at page 22
 
04:56:21.000 --> 04:56:26.448 align:start position:0%
look at page 22
hb639

04:56:26.448 --> 04:56:26.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:29.090 --> 04:56:29.100 align:start position:0%
the first the first section B that you
 
04:56:31.788 --> 04:56:31.798 align:start position:0%
see in lines one through eight
 
04:56:34.550 --> 04:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
includes second sentence starting at the
 
04:56:37.128 --> 04:56:37.138 align:start position:0%
end of line four
 
04:56:38.990 --> 04:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of setting the education
 
04:56:42.230 --> 04:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
tax rate under RSA 76 3 the amount of
 
04:56:43.610 --> 04:56:43.620 align:start position:0%
Revenue required to be collected
 
04:56:46.788 --> 04:56:46.798 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA 76 3 shall be reduced by
 
04:56:48.890 --> 04:56:48.900 align:start position:0%
the amount transferred to the education
 
04:56:50.628 --> 04:56:50.638 align:start position:0%
trust fund is required in this
 
04:56:53.030 --> 04:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
subparagraph and the commission shall
 
04:56:55.010 --> 04:56:55.020 align:start position:0%
set the rate at a level sufficient to
 
04:56:57.050 --> 04:56:57.060 align:start position:0%
generate the reduced amount
 
04:56:59.330 --> 04:56:59.340 align:start position:0%
and that rate
 
04:57:01.190 --> 04:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
shall be effective for the following
 
04:57:01.200 --> 04:57:01.970 align:start position:0%
shall be effective for the following
year

04:57:01.970 --> 04:57:01.980 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:57:05.208 --> 04:57:05.218 align:start position:0%
so it means once this program is up and
 
04:57:05.218 --> 04:57:05.930 align:start position:0%
so it means once this program is up and
running

04:57:05.930 --> 04:57:05.940 align:start position:0%
running
 
04:57:07.970 --> 04:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
revenues are generated they're
 
04:57:11.150 --> 04:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
distributed according to this allocation
 
04:57:13.850 --> 04:57:13.860 align:start position:0%
the commissioner will
 
04:57:15.650 --> 04:57:15.660 align:start position:0%
take the allocation
 
04:57:19.430 --> 04:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
763 tells them to raise 363 million and
 
04:57:21.470 --> 04:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
distributed amongst the town
 
04:57:24.890 --> 04:57:24.900 align:start position:0%
76 8 I think it is tells them how to go
 
04:57:27.590 --> 04:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
about setting the rate for the next year
 
04:57:33.470 --> 04:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
so so there's two tax rates at play here
 
04:57:40.368 --> 04:57:40.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:43.070 --> 04:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
I think it must be at least a year
 
04:57:47.150 --> 04:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
before the beginning of the fiscal year
 
04:57:51.770 --> 04:57:51.780 align:start position:0%
there is a tax rate is set
 
04:57:54.770 --> 04:57:54.780 align:start position:0%
to to print the warrant and the warrants
 
04:57:57.110 --> 04:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
goes to the towns and says this is how
 
04:57:58.670 --> 04:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
much money you're going to have to raise
 
04:58:00.770 --> 04:58:00.780 align:start position:0%
from taxes for swep
 
04:58:03.470 --> 04:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
T and it also is part of the education
 
04:58:06.590 --> 04:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
funding formula because the funding
 
04:58:09.350 --> 04:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
formula says this is figures out how
 
04:58:11.708 --> 04:58:11.718 align:start position:0%
much they're entitled to in the town
 
04:58:14.270 --> 04:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
subtracts the swep and the balance is
 
04:58:17.628 --> 04:58:17.638 align:start position:0%
what they get as a grant
 
04:58:21.708 --> 04:58:21.718 align:start position:0%
when it comes time to actually send out
 
04:58:24.650 --> 04:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
the tax bills that's like a whole year
 
04:58:28.910 --> 04:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
later and it actually gets they take the
 
04:58:32.628 --> 04:58:32.638 align:start position:0%
warrant amount and then they apply it to
 
04:58:32.638 --> 04:58:34.190 align:start position:0%
warrant amount and then they apply it to
the

04:58:34.190 --> 04:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:58:34.200 --> 04:58:36.708 align:start position:0%
the
um

04:58:36.708 --> 04:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:38.750 --> 04:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
they apply they they know how much the
 
04:58:40.970 --> 04:58:40.980 align:start position:0%
town knows how much it has to raise in
 
04:58:44.090 --> 04:58:44.100 align:start position:0%
it appla applies to the local valuation
 
04:58:46.910 --> 04:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
so there are two points that you can
 
04:58:48.708 --> 04:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
intercept I'm not totally sure I'm
 
04:58:50.990 --> 04:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
following you but let me let me give you
 
04:58:52.910 --> 04:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
my best shot
 
04:58:54.830 --> 04:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
when you say the word are you talking
 
04:58:57.470 --> 04:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
about warrant articles you know the
 
04:58:58.910 --> 04:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
ballot in March are you talking about
 
04:59:01.788 --> 04:59:01.798 align:start position:0%
the warrant for taxes it's sent to dra
 
04:59:04.670 --> 04:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
like in October this may be something
 
04:59:07.970 --> 04:59:07.980 align:start position:0%
that's unique to education funding so
 
04:59:11.690 --> 04:59:11.700 align:start position:0%
what happens is it's it's it's actually
 
04:59:14.448 --> 04:59:14.458 align:start position:0%
a piece of the calculation of aid for
 
04:59:14.458 --> 04:59:16.250 align:start position:0%
a piece of the calculation of aid for
education

04:59:16.250 --> 04:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:59:18.770 --> 04:59:18.780 align:start position:0%
and so it's based on one year of
 
04:59:20.510 --> 04:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
property values
 
04:59:22.730 --> 04:59:22.740 align:start position:0%
that says how much
 
04:59:25.010 --> 04:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
has to come how much is going to be
 
04:59:27.050 --> 04:59:27.060 align:start position:0%
credited from
 
04:59:30.170 --> 04:59:30.180 align:start position:0%
the Statewide property tax
 
04:59:32.570 --> 04:59:32.580 align:start position:0%
but when it actually gets assessed is
 
04:59:34.250 --> 04:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
like I may be missing a part of the
 
04:59:37.310 --> 04:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
process you're trying to describe but
 
04:59:39.890 --> 04:59:39.900 align:start position:0%
um it's my understanding that
 
04:59:43.330 --> 04:59:43.340 align:start position:0%
say a school district's budget is
 
04:59:45.650 --> 04:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
determined in the deliberative and in
 
04:59:47.090 --> 04:59:47.100 align:start position:0%
the ballot in March
 
04:59:49.550 --> 04:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm the rate
 
04:59:51.490 --> 04:59:51.500 align:start position:0%
for the taxes
 
04:59:54.590 --> 04:59:54.600 align:start position:0%
necessary to raise the necessary amount
 
04:59:55.670 --> 04:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
of money that doesn't occur until
 
04:59:57.708 --> 04:59:57.718 align:start position:0%
October that's absolutely correct that's
 
04:59:59.510 --> 04:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying
 
05:00:02.090 --> 05:00:02.100 align:start position:0%
so there's plenty of time to react to
 
05:00:05.090 --> 05:00:05.100 align:start position:0%
this information so what I'm asking
 
05:00:08.390 --> 05:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
um him is is is there some way to write
 
05:00:10.310 --> 05:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
that sentence differently so we can do
 
05:00:11.930 --> 05:00:11.940 align:start position:0%
it at the time that they're actually
 
05:00:18.970 --> 05:00:18.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:23.270 --> 05:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
so um just to clarify that the intent is
 
05:00:28.128 --> 05:00:28.138 align:start position:0%
not to include that amount from the
 
05:00:30.470 --> 05:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
Cannabis funds
 
05:00:33.410 --> 05:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
to reduce to be included or to be
 
05:00:35.270 --> 05:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
calculated within during the
 
05:00:36.830 --> 05:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
calculations of the warrant that's
 
05:00:48.230 --> 05:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:50.150 --> 05:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
it's such a new proposal I think
 
05:00:52.128 --> 05:00:52.138 align:start position:0%
probably should think about it some for
 
05:00:54.190 --> 05:00:54.200 align:start position:0%
some more time but the point would be
 
05:00:59.448 --> 05:00:59.458 align:start position:0%
that they might use one set of figures
 
05:01:02.750 --> 05:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know if they use a
 
05:01:05.570 --> 05:01:05.580 align:start position:0%
almost go like on a
 
05:01:05.580 --> 05:01:06.830 align:start position:0%
almost go like on a
um

05:01:06.830 --> 05:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:08.750 --> 05:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
it'll be it would be kind of like an
 
05:01:13.970 --> 05:01:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:18.530 --> 05:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
okay I don't know to refocus do you know
 
05:01:20.690 --> 05:01:20.700 align:start position:0%
the spot in here that you were initially
 
05:01:23.628 --> 05:01:23.638 align:start position:0%
the point you brought up yes it is on
 
05:01:25.788 --> 05:01:25.798 align:start position:0%
page 22
 
05:01:32.090 --> 05:01:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:34.368 --> 05:01:34.378 align:start position:0%
oh so you're saying so the rate should
 
05:01:35.868 --> 05:01:35.878 align:start position:0%
be effective for the following fiscal
 
05:01:35.878 --> 05:01:37.788 align:start position:0%
be effective for the following fiscal
year

05:01:37.788 --> 05:01:37.798 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:01:40.610 --> 05:01:40.620 align:start position:0%
um and you are saying what what was the
 
05:01:44.090 --> 05:01:44.100 align:start position:0%
conflict there again so um the we need
 
05:01:46.730 --> 05:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
clarification that this rate is
 
05:01:49.970 --> 05:01:49.980 align:start position:0%
applicable to which fiscal year
 
05:01:53.330 --> 05:01:53.340 align:start position:0%
um because let's say using the current
 
05:01:56.030 --> 05:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
situation uh for
 
05:02:00.050 --> 05:02:00.060 align:start position:0%
23 the commission has already issued the
 
05:02:03.590 --> 05:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
warrant back in um September 22.
 
05:02:07.610 --> 05:02:07.620 align:start position:0%
or tax year 23 yeah and then so that
 
05:02:10.190 --> 05:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
amount has already been informed to the
 
05:02:13.010 --> 05:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
municipalities what they need to be
 
05:02:15.890 --> 05:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
collecting in this fiscal year ends June
 
05:02:18.890 --> 05:02:18.900 align:start position:0%
30th right so you're saying so the
 
05:02:20.270 --> 05:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
problem with that wording is that it
 
05:02:21.948 --> 05:02:21.958 align:start position:0%
would apply that it's effective in 24
 
05:02:25.310 --> 05:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
but it's too late yes the the amount
 
05:02:28.550 --> 05:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
okay has Mr chairman yes I think this is
 
05:02:31.868 --> 05:02:31.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:36.288 --> 05:02:36.298 align:start position:0%
this only is triggered when there is net
 
05:02:38.990 --> 05:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
revenue after expenses realized under
 
05:02:40.730 --> 05:02:40.740 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis tax
 
05:02:42.890 --> 05:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
and that hasn't happened yet can't
 
05:02:44.448 --> 05:02:44.458 align:start position:0%
happen till it's enacted can't happen
 
05:02:46.788 --> 05:02:46.798 align:start position:0%
until it gets up and running in any
 
05:02:48.948 --> 05:02:48.958 align:start position:0%
given annual cycle the school district's
 
05:02:51.350 --> 05:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
going to be setting its uh budget in
 
05:02:53.990 --> 05:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
March the fiscal year for the state will
 
05:02:57.890 --> 05:02:57.900 align:start position:0%
end June 30th between June 30th and
 
05:03:01.010 --> 05:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
October November when the tax rate is
 
05:03:05.390 --> 05:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
set all the information is in and it
 
05:03:07.670 --> 05:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
takes effect for the following year so
 
05:03:10.850 --> 05:03:10.860 align:start position:0%
okay I don't think that there is a
 
05:03:12.470 --> 05:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
problem I don't think it requires any
 
05:03:15.470 --> 05:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
change in language yeah I agree you're
 
05:03:17.448 --> 05:03:17.458 align:start position:0%
right by the time Revenue comes in we're
 
05:03:19.010 --> 05:03:19.020 align:start position:0%
way past this
 
05:03:21.708 --> 05:03:21.718 align:start position:0%
yeah representative and I think we're
 
05:03:22.788 --> 05:03:22.798 align:start position:0%
all in agreement we're not going to
 
05:03:24.590 --> 05:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
realize Revenue whatever that Revenue
 
05:03:27.530 --> 05:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
may be for at least 15 months if not
 
05:03:29.750 --> 05:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
pushing two years good point
 
05:03:31.970 --> 05:03:31.980 align:start position:0%
representative lupley and I apologize
 
05:03:34.128 --> 05:03:34.138 align:start position:0%
for not getting to you sooner
 
05:03:36.110 --> 05:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
05:03:36.120 --> 05:03:36.948 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
um

05:03:36.948 --> 05:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:42.170 --> 05:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
so I think that the proposal is fine
 
05:03:45.708 --> 05:03:45.718 align:start position:0%
um I agree that the biggest problem many
 
05:03:47.750 --> 05:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
of our constituents face is their
 
05:03:50.570 --> 05:03:50.580 align:start position:0%
property taxes and one of their biggest
 
05:03:53.090 --> 05:03:53.100 align:start position:0%
values is education for their kids and
 
05:03:55.190 --> 05:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
for future workers in the state so I
 
05:03:56.930 --> 05:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
think it's it totally makes sense the
 
05:04:00.288 --> 05:04:00.298 align:start position:0%
breakdown that was laid out I agree
 
05:04:02.330 --> 05:04:02.340 align:start position:0%
um I just want to come back to revenue
 
05:04:04.490 --> 05:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't matter if we say
 
05:04:06.590 --> 05:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
we'll give 50 education if we don't make
 
05:04:07.550 --> 05:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
any money
 
05:04:12.110 --> 05:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking and it does look like
 
05:04:15.830 --> 05:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue in States who Legalize It looks
 
05:04:19.368 --> 05:04:19.378 align:start position:0%
like it slowly increases year over year
 
05:04:23.090 --> 05:04:23.100 align:start position:0%
and that Revenue grows but I noticed
 
05:04:23.100 --> 05:04:24.530 align:start position:0%
and that Revenue grows but I noticed
that

05:04:24.530 --> 05:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:04:24.540 --> 05:04:26.090 align:start position:0%
that
um Maine

05:04:26.090 --> 05:04:26.100 align:start position:0%
um Maine
 
05:04:28.610 --> 05:04:28.620 align:start position:0%
which is maybe one of the states that's
 
05:04:31.510 --> 05:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
most like us their revenue
 
05:04:33.670 --> 05:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
last year
 
05:04:37.570 --> 05:04:37.580 align:start position:0%
was four million dollars
 
05:04:40.550 --> 05:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
05:04:43.610 --> 05:04:43.620 align:start position:0%
based on attacks that's maybe six times
 
05:04:44.930 --> 05:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
higher than the one that we're
 
05:04:48.410 --> 05:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
discussing right now so I think it just
 
05:04:49.970 --> 05:04:49.980 align:start position:0%
comes back to
 
05:04:51.470 --> 05:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter where we're going to
 
05:04:53.150 --> 05:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
put the earned Revenue if there isn't
 
05:04:57.170 --> 05:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
any so I I want to come back to my
 
05:05:00.170 --> 05:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
question of can we base
 
05:05:00.180 --> 05:05:01.070 align:start position:0%
question of can we base
um

05:05:01.070 --> 05:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:03.650 --> 05:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
the tax rate on
 
05:05:07.190 --> 05:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
something and what might we look at to
 
05:05:10.788 --> 05:05:10.798 align:start position:0%
to base it on if not our neighbors so I
 
05:05:10.798 --> 05:05:11.810 align:start position:0%
to base it on if not our neighbors so I
agree

05:05:11.810 --> 05:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
agree
 
05:05:15.230 --> 05:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
with the values that are
 
05:05:19.190 --> 05:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
that undergird the the distribution
 
05:05:23.030 --> 05:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
that's been proposed I just want to make
 
05:05:24.650 --> 05:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
sure there's money to fund those things
 
05:05:28.070 --> 05:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
thanks okay thank you
 
05:05:29.930 --> 05:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
um is everyone pretty much in agreement
 
05:05:31.610 --> 05:05:31.620 align:start position:0%
with representative
 
05:05:31.620 --> 05:05:32.330 align:start position:0%
with representative
um

05:05:32.330 --> 05:05:32.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:35.628 --> 05:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
plan let's hear from representative Ames
 
05:05:39.170 --> 05:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not going to challenge that but
 
05:05:41.030 --> 05:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
I will say
 
05:05:45.590 --> 05:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
that I think the allocation of money for
 
05:05:47.868 --> 05:05:47.878 align:start position:0%
Education a is
 
05:05:50.690 --> 05:05:50.700 align:start position:0%
definitely needed but
 
05:05:54.230 --> 05:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
um the swap of
 
05:05:57.890 --> 05:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
one source of State funds for another
 
05:06:01.850 --> 05:06:01.860 align:start position:0%
doesn't really help education it may
 
05:06:04.910 --> 05:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
help local property tax rates
 
05:06:06.650 --> 05:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
but the use of
 
05:06:09.470 --> 05:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
of a swept reduction
 
05:06:11.030 --> 05:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
I think
 
05:06:13.490 --> 05:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
and you can all do your own calculations
 
05:06:17.390 --> 05:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
plays out in a regressive way so that
 
05:06:17.400 --> 05:06:18.670 align:start position:0%
plays out in a regressive way so that
the

05:06:18.670 --> 05:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:06:22.490 --> 05:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
property the towns that have less
 
05:06:25.610 --> 05:06:25.620 align:start position:0%
property value produce less swept
 
05:06:27.650 --> 05:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
and the deduction
 
05:06:30.910 --> 05:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
and the the it all works out that the
 
05:06:36.050 --> 05:06:36.060 align:start position:0%
less lower value terms get
 
05:06:36.060 --> 05:06:37.190 align:start position:0%
less lower value terms get
um

05:06:37.190 --> 05:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:40.850 --> 05:06:40.860 align:start position:0%
less help than the higher value Toms I
 
05:06:43.070 --> 05:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
can stand corrected on that and as I sit
 
05:06:45.288 --> 05:06:45.298 align:start position:0%
here now I can't do the calculations but
 
05:06:47.930 --> 05:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
uh that's my understanding and as I say
 
05:06:49.430 --> 05:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
I don't want to step into the middle of
 
05:06:50.810 --> 05:06:50.820 align:start position:0%
this right now it's something that's
 
05:06:54.350 --> 05:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
years away I can live with that
 
05:06:56.570 --> 05:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
um but uh don't think that we're doing
 
05:06:58.310 --> 05:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
something for Education when we're just
 
05:07:02.530 --> 05:07:02.540 align:start position:0%
doing a swap and then also
 
05:07:05.150 --> 05:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
take a look at what I'm trying to say
 
05:07:08.350 --> 05:07:08.360 align:start position:0%
about the regressivity of this approach
 
05:07:10.128 --> 05:07:10.138 align:start position:0%
representative Ami and then
 
05:07:17.690 --> 05:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:20.570 --> 05:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
I'm off trying to look at how much
 
05:07:23.868 --> 05:07:23.878 align:start position:0%
revenue we might get if we were adopting
 
05:07:23.878 --> 05:07:26.030 align:start position:0%
revenue we might get if we were adopting
abrami's

05:07:26.030 --> 05:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
abrami's
 
05:07:29.810 --> 05:07:29.820 align:start position:0%
numbers and putting in the increased
 
05:07:32.270 --> 05:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
amounts that uh
 
05:07:35.810 --> 05:07:35.820 align:start position:0%
that the Liquor Commission says it needs
 
05:07:39.170 --> 05:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
and what happens in these next two years
 
05:07:41.750 --> 05:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
during the budget that they're trying to
 
05:07:43.670 --> 05:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
do across the hall now
 
05:07:46.430 --> 05:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
right now on
 
05:07:49.670 --> 05:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
you you need seven million the first
 
05:07:53.030 --> 05:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
year eight million the second year when
 
05:07:54.708 --> 05:07:54.718 align:start position:0%
do you when would you start getting a
 
05:08:12.470 --> 05:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:14.628 --> 05:08:14.638 align:start position:0%
by the way the fiscal note says that
 
05:08:17.390 --> 05:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
you're getting that that you're supposed
 
05:08:20.208 --> 05:08:20.218 align:start position:0%
to get 4.6 the first year and two the
 
05:08:21.288 --> 05:08:21.298 align:start position:0%
second year
 
05:08:25.310 --> 05:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:27.830 --> 05:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
well we did you know
 
05:08:30.948 --> 05:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
uh representative we did you know some
 
05:08:33.470 --> 05:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
some checking on the pricing before we
 
05:08:37.368 --> 05:08:37.378 align:start position:0%
we handed that out we obviously had uh
 
05:08:39.948 --> 05:08:39.958 align:start position:0%
we checked into the different
 
05:08:42.110 --> 05:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
programs that are available for it
 
05:08:43.850 --> 05:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
there's a few companies out there that
 
05:08:46.910 --> 05:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
are doing the seed to sale transactions
 
05:08:46.920 --> 05:08:48.470 align:start position:0%
are doing the seed to sale transactions
uh

05:08:48.470 --> 05:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:08:51.470 --> 05:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
but as far as licensing fees I wouldn't
 
05:08:53.990 --> 05:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't expect there to be any
 
05:08:57.830 --> 05:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
licensing fees for at least 18 months to
 
05:09:00.170 --> 05:09:00.180 align:start position:0%
24 months
 
05:09:02.208 --> 05:09:02.218 align:start position:0%
because I think that you're going to
 
05:09:03.910 --> 05:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
have those
 
05:09:07.730 --> 05:09:07.740 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and Growers get the
 
05:09:09.770 --> 05:09:09.780 align:start position:0%
license and then invest in the
 
05:09:11.750 --> 05:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
facilities that they have
 
05:09:15.830 --> 05:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
and if I could that would be uh
 
05:09:15.840 --> 05:09:17.570 align:start position:0%
and if I could that would be uh
after

05:09:17.570 --> 05:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
after
 
05:09:20.390 --> 05:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
the roles are written or that that's
 
05:09:22.368 --> 05:09:22.378 align:start position:0%
part of the time frame that would be
 
05:09:24.770 --> 05:09:24.780 align:start position:0%
after the rules are written after and
 
05:09:31.490 --> 05:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:36.650 --> 05:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:40.788 --> 05:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
and DHHS has got an amendment which I
 
05:09:42.708 --> 05:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
don't know if anybody else has got they
 
05:09:45.948 --> 05:09:45.958 align:start position:0%
couldn't stay after this morning uh
 
05:09:50.990 --> 05:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
there is someone here on which is asking
 
05:09:55.730 --> 05:09:55.740 align:start position:0%
as I understand it in part for
 
05:09:59.868 --> 05:09:59.878 align:start position:0%
a piece of the money that is going out
 
05:10:04.990 --> 05:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
right away so that they can do
 
05:10:08.330 --> 05:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
education about the effects of cannabis
 
05:10:11.270 --> 05:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
before the Cannabis is actually there or
 
05:10:14.030 --> 05:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
not right away I guess it would be
 
05:10:15.770 --> 05:10:15.780 align:start position:0%
at about the time when you're starting
 
05:10:17.990 --> 05:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
to license
 
05:10:21.470 --> 05:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
on and but they also think that the
 
05:10:23.448 --> 05:10:23.458 align:start position:0%
alternative on
 
05:10:25.670 --> 05:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh cannabis
 
05:10:28.430 --> 05:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
on centers that we already have the
 
05:10:32.330 --> 05:10:32.340 align:start position:0%
medical ones on would be they seem to
 
05:10:33.650 --> 05:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
think they would be immediately
 
05:10:33.660 --> 05:10:35.690 align:start position:0%
think they would be immediately
licensing

05:10:35.690 --> 05:10:35.700 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
05:10:37.490 --> 05:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
but that couldn't be done because we
 
05:10:39.350 --> 05:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
don't have the rules yet
 
05:10:40.850 --> 05:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
right that would be correct we don't
 
05:10:42.650 --> 05:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
have the rules is that stream 700
 
05:10:47.030 --> 05:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
million obviously the the rules only 700
 
05:10:49.550 --> 05:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
000. sorry everybody
 
05:10:51.948 --> 05:10:51.958 align:start position:0%
we're trying to you know be conservative
 
05:10:54.590 --> 05:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
in our estimates and and make sure that
 
05:10:57.350 --> 05:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh we give you timelines that we're
 
05:11:00.650 --> 05:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
comfortable with I mean 24 months to 36
 
05:11:04.368 --> 05:11:04.378 align:start position:0%
months is about the timeline that we
 
05:11:07.610 --> 05:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
feel it would take to get the rules get
 
05:11:10.670 --> 05:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
the license get the licenses start to
 
05:11:13.070 --> 05:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
begin to deal with uh the manufacturing
 
05:11:17.090 --> 05:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
and again it's not to to but I've been
 
05:11:18.890 --> 05:11:18.900 align:start position:0%
cautioned to make sure that there's
 
05:11:21.590 --> 05:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
plenty of manufacturing before there's
 
05:11:21.600 --> 05:11:24.530 align:start position:0%
plenty of manufacturing before there's
retail

05:11:24.530 --> 05:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:24.540 --> 05:11:26.810 align:start position:0%
 
right

05:11:26.810 --> 05:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:11:30.050 --> 05:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
so we're really looking at
 
05:11:30.060 --> 05:11:32.590 align:start position:0%
so we're really looking at
on

05:11:32.590 --> 05:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:11:35.750 --> 05:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
Appropriations against the budget
 
05:11:38.990 --> 05:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
on four
 
05:11:42.530 --> 05:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
the total amount that on
 
05:11:46.190 --> 05:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
we think should be in the bill
 
05:11:48.170 --> 05:11:48.180 align:start position:0%
to pay for
 
05:11:50.868 --> 05:11:50.878 align:start position:0%
what the Liquor Commission has to do on
 
05:11:52.910 --> 05:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
which the revenues are dependent
 
05:11:56.990 --> 05:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
and for the DHHS request which is much
 
05:11:58.910 --> 05:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
smaller but
 
05:12:02.750 --> 05:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
they were hoping for at least 250
 
05:12:05.330 --> 05:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
000 to do this campaign before things
 
05:12:08.030 --> 05:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:09.890 --> 05:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
representative Platt and then
 
05:12:13.310 --> 05:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr Vice chair
 
05:12:16.850 --> 05:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
if I I'm hearing correctly I think we've
 
05:12:18.890 --> 05:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
got General consensus on the wording of
 
05:12:21.410 --> 05:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
the bill so it comes down to what rate
 
05:12:26.208 --> 05:12:26.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:29.448 --> 05:12:29.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:32.208 --> 05:12:32.218 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just trying to make sure that
 
05:12:34.310 --> 05:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
I understand that we're likely not to
 
05:12:36.948 --> 05:12:36.958 align:start position:0%
get any revenue for about four years
 
05:12:42.070 --> 05:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:44.690 --> 05:12:44.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:12:44.700 --> 05:12:46.610 align:start position:0%
thank you

hear from uh if if you would entertain
 
05:12:56.150 --> 05:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
him a former representative Egan from
 
05:12:57.170 --> 05:12:57.180 align:start position:0%
Sugar Hill
 
05:12:59.510 --> 05:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
who has spent a lot of time on this and
 
05:13:01.070 --> 05:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
was very involved in the last session
 
05:13:02.868 --> 05:13:02.878 align:start position:0%
with the bill
 
05:13:05.570 --> 05:13:05.580 align:start position:0%
um and with uh with with marijuana
 
05:13:07.368 --> 05:13:07.378 align:start position:0%
legalization particularly the revenue
 
05:13:08.750 --> 05:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
side of it
 
05:13:11.448 --> 05:13:11.458 align:start position:0%
could he say a few words
 
05:13:15.288 --> 05:13:15.298 align:start position:0%
on what to expect maybe from revenues
 
05:13:15.298 --> 05:13:18.530 align:start position:0%
on what to expect maybe from revenues
okay

05:13:18.530 --> 05:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:20.690 --> 05:13:20.700 align:start position:0%
not I'm not against that I'm I'm
 
05:13:22.910 --> 05:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
struggling I'm struggling with timing
 
05:13:25.788 --> 05:13:25.798 align:start position:0%
all right we'll we'll give uh we'll give
 
05:13:27.470 --> 05:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
two minutes how's that all right thank
 
05:13:27.480 --> 05:13:34.368 align:start position:0%
two minutes how's that all right thank
you

05:13:34.368 --> 05:13:34.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:36.410 --> 05:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming down I I know that
 
05:13:37.730 --> 05:13:37.740 align:start position:0%
you've been we've talked a lot about
 
05:13:39.708 --> 05:13:39.718 align:start position:0%
this and stuff that we can predict and
 
05:13:41.628 --> 05:13:41.638 align:start position:0%
what we can't predict
 
05:13:41.638 --> 05:13:42.288 align:start position:0%
what we can't predict
um

05:13:42.288 --> 05:13:42.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:44.270 --> 05:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if we've got two minutes
 
05:13:48.288 --> 05:13:48.298 align:start position:0%
and we'll start when I stop uh just to
 
05:13:50.090 --> 05:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
say what what kind of predictions or
 
05:13:52.490 --> 05:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
estimates or or assumptions can we make
 
05:13:54.770 --> 05:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
about revenues
 
05:13:57.650 --> 05:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
with following legalization right maybe
 
05:13:58.910 --> 05:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
in two minutes I can give you some
 
05:14:00.890 --> 05:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
clarity thank you Mr chair Timothy Egan
 
05:14:02.930 --> 05:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
Sugar Hill from representative uh
 
05:14:04.670 --> 05:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
Grafton II I'm the chair of New
 
05:14:06.170 --> 05:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can the business trade
 
05:14:08.448 --> 05:14:08.458 align:start position:0%
industry I'm actually also a professor
 
05:14:10.310 --> 05:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
at Castleton University in the Cannabis
 
05:14:12.170 --> 05:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
studies program teaching Canada business
 
05:14:15.170 --> 05:14:15.180 align:start position:0%
and the Cannabis certificate program let
 
05:14:18.650 --> 05:14:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:21.650 --> 05:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
Vermont's first year projected their
 
05:14:25.330 --> 05:14:25.340 align:start position:0%
cost per pound is 340 per pound means is
 
05:14:29.090 --> 05:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
917 per pound Massachusetts which is
 
05:14:30.890 --> 05:14:30.900 align:start position:0%
correctly everybody addressed has
 
05:14:33.650 --> 05:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
cratered a bit is 800 to 1500 per pound
 
05:14:37.550 --> 05:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
Colorado is 650 dollars per pound and
 
05:14:39.708 --> 05:14:39.718 align:start position:0%
New Jersey is about 560 dollars per
 
05:14:39.718 --> 05:14:40.910 align:start position:0%
New Jersey is about 560 dollars per
pound

05:14:40.910 --> 05:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
pound
 
05:14:42.410 --> 05:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
so when you start thinking about if
 
05:14:44.150 --> 05:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to tax it at a wholesale
 
05:14:48.110 --> 05:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
rate or at the the process rate that's
 
05:14:49.910 --> 05:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
the pound per poundage current going
 
05:14:52.310 --> 05:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
rate uh the states that are looking at
 
05:14:53.690 --> 05:14:53.700 align:start position:0%
those same States looking at their
 
05:14:53.700 --> 05:14:54.890 align:start position:0%
those same States looking at their
taxation

05:14:54.890 --> 05:14:54.900 align:start position:0%
taxation
 
05:14:58.850 --> 05:14:58.860 align:start position:0%
Vermont has 14 on retail Maine has 10 on
 
05:14:58.860 --> 05:15:00.110 align:start position:0%
Vermont has 14 on retail Maine has 10 on
retail

05:15:00.110 --> 05:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
retail
 
05:15:03.708 --> 05:15:03.718 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has a 10.75 excise tax on
 
05:15:05.570 --> 05:15:05.580 align:start position:0%
all transfers
 
05:15:10.070 --> 05:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
it has a 6.5 6.25 sales tax on top of
 
05:15:12.470 --> 05:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
that and a three percent locality tax
 
05:15:14.270 --> 05:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
they actually have a instead of an
 
05:15:16.850 --> 05:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
opt-in or an opt-out Vermont as you may
 
05:15:19.910 --> 05:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
know has an opt in towns have to vote to
 
05:15:21.288 --> 05:15:21.298 align:start position:0%
be able to allow it
 
05:15:23.448 --> 05:15:23.458 align:start position:0%
I think this bill has a you have to opt
 
05:15:26.448 --> 05:15:26.458 align:start position:0%
out so Massachusetts adds a three
 
05:15:28.850 --> 05:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
percent tax on there so you're roughly
 
05:15:31.310 --> 05:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
looking at about 19.25 sales tax
 
05:15:35.570 --> 05:15:35.580 align:start position:0%
Colorado has a 15 sales tax as uh excuse
 
05:15:38.150 --> 05:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
me a marijuana sales tax on top of a 2.9
 
05:15:41.150 --> 05:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
percent personal sales tax and they also
 
05:15:44.208 --> 05:15:44.218 align:start position:0%
have a 15 transfer tax
 
05:15:49.750 --> 05:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:53.030 --> 05:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
6.625 sales tax and a two percent
 
05:15:55.670 --> 05:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
transfer tax so as you think about your
 
05:15:57.170 --> 05:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
tax rates
 
05:15:57.180 --> 05:15:58.070 align:start position:0%
tax rates
um

05:15:58.070 --> 05:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:01.490 --> 05:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
um hearing representative Doucette I
 
05:16:02.930 --> 05:16:02.940 align:start position:0%
think I remember meeting you a few times
 
05:16:05.208 --> 05:16:05.218 align:start position:0%
his ideas of ringing in the ear about
 
05:16:07.730 --> 05:16:07.740 align:start position:0%
making New Hampshire as we are one of
 
05:16:09.470 --> 05:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
the most competitive States in New
 
05:16:10.970 --> 05:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
England and this is going to be our our
 
05:16:12.948 --> 05:16:12.958 align:start position:0%
competition the last thing I'll share
 
05:16:14.030 --> 05:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
with you then you're talking about
 
05:16:18.050 --> 05:16:18.060 align:start position:0%
Revenue so Vermont very fresh their
 
05:16:21.288 --> 05:16:21.298 align:start position:0%
first year projection is 16 million
 
05:16:25.490 --> 05:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
they're estimated by 2025 is 225 million
 
05:16:28.128 --> 05:16:28.138 align:start position:0%
where they'd see 46 million dollars of
 
05:16:29.990 --> 05:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
state revenue
 
05:16:32.868 --> 05:16:32.878 align:start position:0%
they're the most recent that's why I'm
 
05:16:34.128 --> 05:16:34.138 align:start position:0%
mentioning them right off the top
 
05:16:35.810 --> 05:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
because they're the most recent to study
 
05:16:39.110 --> 05:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
this and October 2022 is when
 
05:16:41.810 --> 05:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
legalization active doors opened in the
 
05:16:44.570 --> 05:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
state of Vermont uh Maine as you see as
 
05:16:46.850 --> 05:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
you heard they made 158 million dollars
 
05:16:50.570 --> 05:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
in in 2022 with a state revenue net of
 
05:16:53.390 --> 05:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
16 million their growth was from 82
 
05:16:55.610 --> 05:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
million in 2021
 
05:16:55.620 --> 05:16:57.070 align:start position:0%
million in 2021
Massachusetts

05:16:57.070 --> 05:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
05:16:59.270 --> 05:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
tough to put them in this category of
 
05:17:00.410 --> 05:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
where we're studying our state because
 
05:17:02.570 --> 05:17:02.580 align:start position:0%
they've been at it so long but their
 
05:17:06.110 --> 05:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
revenue was 1.4 billion dollars last
 
05:17:08.868 --> 05:17:08.878 align:start position:0%
year in the Cannabis industry
 
05:17:11.090 --> 05:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
Colorado same thing they've been at it a
 
05:17:13.910 --> 05:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
little longer they're 1.8 billion
 
05:17:16.310 --> 05:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
dollars in gross revenue
 
05:17:20.628 --> 05:17:20.638 align:start position:0%
and New Jersey is estimating somewhere
 
05:17:23.750 --> 05:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
around 116 million dollars for their
 
05:17:27.650 --> 05:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
first year which would be 2022 to 2023
 
05:17:30.110 --> 05:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
because they're that new
 
05:17:32.208 --> 05:17:32.218 align:start position:0%
so maybe I took my two minutes well to
 
05:17:33.770 --> 05:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
give you some numbers and I'm glad to
 
05:17:35.570 --> 05:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
share this with you more this is what
 
05:17:37.128 --> 05:17:37.138 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can does I work actually
 
05:17:39.650 --> 05:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
closely with new New England cannabis
 
05:17:42.050 --> 05:17:42.060 align:start position:0%
they're the trade Association around the
 
05:17:44.270 --> 05:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
six New England states now including New
 
05:17:45.830 --> 05:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
York New Jersey
 
05:17:48.230 --> 05:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
so we try to look at what is the
 
05:17:50.390 --> 05:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
economic impact and I'll leave you with
 
05:17:52.670 --> 05:17:52.680 align:start position:0%
three thoughts one right now we're
 
05:17:54.350 --> 05:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
seeing revenu leave the state people are
 
05:17:57.350 --> 05:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
going to mass Vermont and
 
05:17:59.930 --> 05:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
Maine so I'm hoping that we can try and
 
05:18:02.270 --> 05:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
recoup Revenue to
 
05:18:05.510 --> 05:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
by allowing legalization testing and
 
05:18:07.368 --> 05:18:07.378 align:start position:0%
regulation we could potentially spawn
 
05:18:08.810 --> 05:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
new industries that come from the
 
05:18:10.610 --> 05:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
research of cannabis and the testing of
 
05:18:12.590 --> 05:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
it not just adult Recreation or
 
05:18:16.550 --> 05:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
medicinal but other uses and three
 
05:18:18.890 --> 05:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
the economic development as you begin to
 
05:18:20.750 --> 05:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
look at all the business services that
 
05:18:21.948 --> 05:18:21.958 align:start position:0%
could be utilized to build a grow
 
05:18:25.250 --> 05:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
facility a
 
05:18:28.070 --> 05:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
processing facility a dispensary the
 
05:18:29.570 --> 05:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
business profit tax and business
 
05:18:32.570 --> 05:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
Enterprise taxes of those businesses not
 
05:18:34.490 --> 05:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
just the ones in the Cannabis industry
 
05:18:37.128 --> 05:18:37.138 align:start position:0%
but the ones that feed the Cannabis
 
05:18:40.368 --> 05:18:40.378 align:start position:0%
industry there's an economic
 
05:18:40.378 --> 05:18:41.628 align:start position:0%
industry there's an economic
um

05:18:41.628 --> 05:18:41.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:43.850 --> 05:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
multiplier there that has yet to be
 
05:18:45.530 --> 05:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
determined we're trying to assess that
 
05:18:49.010 --> 05:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
by looking at Vermont Maine Mass New
 
05:18:51.890 --> 05:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
Jersey states that are most recent it's
 
05:18:54.110 --> 05:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
tough to compare our numbers to Oregon
 
05:18:56.690 --> 05:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
and California and Colorado because
 
05:18:58.670 --> 05:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
they've had such a long head start even
 
05:19:00.830 --> 05:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts had a Long Head Start
 
05:19:03.590 --> 05:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
so glad to answer any more questions I
 
05:19:07.670 --> 05:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:09.170 --> 05:19:09.180 align:start position:0%
question for him
 
05:19:12.350 --> 05:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
well that was helpful but on I can't
 
05:19:14.868 --> 05:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
write that fast and I'm glad to share
 
05:19:16.670 --> 05:19:16.680 align:start position:0%
this with the entire Community I think
 
05:19:25.868 --> 05:19:25.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:29.570 --> 05:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
I thought I turned it on you you gave
 
05:19:33.708 --> 05:19:33.718 align:start position:0%
some context to numbers that ncsl had
 
05:19:37.490 --> 05:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
had had sent out but that that don't
 
05:19:41.030 --> 05:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
give on a way of figuring out what
 
05:19:44.270 --> 05:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
exactly they're taxing how
 
05:19:46.788 --> 05:19:46.798 align:start position:0%
so I'd I'd love to see anything you've
 
05:19:49.550 --> 05:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
got written down yeah there's actually a
 
05:19:51.410 --> 05:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
um two existing pieces of information
 
05:19:53.208 --> 05:19:53.218 align:start position:0%
out there that exist as there's the
 
05:19:55.310 --> 05:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
Cannabis Benchmark report which is like
 
05:19:57.590 --> 05:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
a stock report or a bond report that
 
05:20:00.830 --> 05:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
analyzes the price per pound of you know
 
05:20:03.470 --> 05:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
like orange futures or wheat they're now
 
05:20:05.208 --> 05:20:05.218 align:start position:0%
studying cannabis and looking at the
 
05:20:06.890 --> 05:20:06.900 align:start position:0%
what is the average price per pound in
 
05:20:09.350 --> 05:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
America of cannabis it's that much of a
 
05:20:11.690 --> 05:20:11.700 align:start position:0%
of a focused Revenue generating industry
 
05:20:13.190 --> 05:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
that they're beginning to track it like
 
05:20:16.850 --> 05:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
anything else as well MJ bizcom does a
 
05:20:19.490 --> 05:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
you know annual report on States and
 
05:20:21.948 --> 05:20:21.958 align:start position:0%
evaluating the state's Revenue
 
05:20:24.770 --> 05:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
generation their excise tax their sales
 
05:20:28.250 --> 05:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
tax their costs as well as what impacts
 
05:20:31.368 --> 05:20:31.378 align:start position:0%
things in what other rules and Rule
 
05:20:33.230 --> 05:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
making within their agencies impact the
 
05:20:36.288 --> 05:20:36.298 align:start position:0%
industry like advertising or no use of
 
05:20:39.350 --> 05:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
billboards or things like that
 
05:20:42.948 --> 05:20:42.958 align:start position:0%
the cost per pound at what level of
 
05:20:46.670 --> 05:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
Taxation is right and that's and that
 
05:20:49.128 --> 05:20:49.138 align:start position:0%
applies to each different state the
 
05:20:49.138 --> 05:20:50.390 align:start position:0%
applies to each different state the
current

05:20:50.390 --> 05:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
current
 
05:20:52.010 --> 05:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
like if you're looking at the price of
 
05:20:55.070 --> 05:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
gold today the current cost per pound
 
05:20:55.080 --> 05:20:56.390 align:start position:0%
gold today the current cost per pound
um

05:20:56.390 --> 05:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:56.400 --> 05:21:00.128 align:start position:0%
um
is

05:21:00.128 --> 05:21:00.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:04.610 --> 05:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:08.030 --> 05:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
it's 971 dollars per pound for the
 
05:21:11.208 --> 05:21:11.218 align:start position:0%
nation as of March 17th
 
05:21:15.410 --> 05:21:15.420 align:start position:0%
is is plain gold it's the same right how
 
05:21:17.150 --> 05:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
each state applies their taxation
 
05:21:19.250 --> 05:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
process their legalization process
 
05:21:21.110 --> 05:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
licensing process too it does affect
 
05:21:22.430 --> 05:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
that I'm just trying to give you the
 
05:21:26.090 --> 05:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
Benchmark that the nation uses when the
 
05:21:28.788 --> 05:21:28.798 align:start position:0%
when when you're taxing the gold as it
 
05:21:31.610 --> 05:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
comes out of the mud pit
 
05:21:37.190 --> 05:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
in Brazil on do you pay pay what we
 
05:21:40.250 --> 05:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
would call Pennies on the dollar
 
05:21:42.830 --> 05:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
versus if you're taxing it at the
 
05:21:42.840 --> 05:21:44.090 align:start position:0%
versus if you're taxing it at the
Jewelers

05:21:44.090 --> 05:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
Jewelers
 
05:21:46.010 --> 05:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
right henceforth the conversation I've
 
05:21:47.570 --> 05:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
been listening to all day which is your
 
05:21:51.650 --> 05:21:51.660 align:start position:0%
it is a challenge to build this and
 
05:21:53.810 --> 05:21:53.820 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying by coming forward and
 
05:21:53.820 --> 05:21:55.070 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying by coming forward and
asking

05:21:55.070 --> 05:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
asking
 
05:21:56.448 --> 05:21:56.458 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative for
 
05:21:58.310 --> 05:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
recognizing me
 
05:22:00.770 --> 05:22:00.780 align:start position:0%
um I'm here and the industry is here to
 
05:22:02.628 --> 05:22:02.638 align:start position:0%
help you with information to help you
 
05:22:04.430 --> 05:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
build a bill that is the best interest
 
05:22:06.830 --> 05:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
of everyone in New Hampshire so
 
05:22:08.750 --> 05:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
um we're glad to do that as well support
 
05:22:11.510 --> 05:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
our agencies um you know I did have four
 
05:22:12.948 --> 05:22:12.958 align:start position:0%
years in the house and I understand sort
 
05:22:15.590 --> 05:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
of the the process here and so I know
 
05:22:17.868 --> 05:22:17.878 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of data collection it has
 
05:22:19.250 --> 05:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
to go on and you have to hear from a
 
05:22:21.288 --> 05:22:21.298 align:start position:0%
variety of sources so we're glad to
 
05:22:22.368 --> 05:22:22.378 align:start position:0%
support that in any way shape or form
 
05:22:23.868 --> 05:22:23.878 align:start position:0%
and I want to be respectful let them
 
05:22:25.310 --> 05:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
weigh over my two minutes
 
05:22:28.730 --> 05:22:28.740 align:start position:0%
and if I could follow up oh I'm here for
 
05:22:30.288 --> 05:22:30.298 align:start position:0%
you yeah you're
 
05:22:33.050 --> 05:22:33.060 align:start position:0%
you're one thing that uh struck me was
 
05:22:36.590 --> 05:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
that when you gave the net revenue to
 
05:22:40.550 --> 05:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
the state it was a lot less than the
 
05:22:43.610 --> 05:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
gross revenue to the state
 
05:22:46.190 --> 05:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh in the states that you did that for
 
05:22:48.770 --> 05:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
which was only some of them
 
05:22:50.810 --> 05:22:50.820 align:start position:0%
right every business has startup costs
 
05:22:53.208 --> 05:22:53.218 align:start position:0%
and we will as you heard we will assume
 
05:22:53.218 --> 05:22:54.590 align:start position:0%
and we will as you heard we will assume
those

05:22:54.590 --> 05:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:23:05.150 --> 05:23:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:08.090 --> 05:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
right now and um
 
05:23:10.430 --> 05:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
we have to look very carefully I think
 
05:23:13.550 --> 05:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
it how much it's going to cost to start
 
05:23:13.560 --> 05:23:14.570 align:start position:0%
it how much it's going to cost to start
up

05:23:14.570 --> 05:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:23:17.030 --> 05:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
as part of this
 
05:23:21.288 --> 05:23:21.298 align:start position:0%
okay I think that the if we don't give
 
05:23:23.990 --> 05:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
that money to The Liquor Commission it
 
05:23:26.208 --> 05:23:26.218 align:start position:0%
won't get started up
 
05:23:30.170 --> 05:23:30.180 align:start position:0%
but if we do we're talking about 15
 
05:23:33.288 --> 05:23:33.298 align:start position:0%
million in the next by this biennium
 
05:23:34.730 --> 05:23:34.740 align:start position:0%
coming up
 
05:23:36.770 --> 05:23:36.780 align:start position:0%
at a minimum
 
05:23:39.350 --> 05:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
okay um I wouldn't agree with that but I
 
05:23:41.810 --> 05:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
well that's what they just said
 
05:23:44.270 --> 05:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
05:23:46.730 --> 05:23:46.740 align:start position:0%
we appreciate it
 
05:23:48.110 --> 05:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
um did anyone else have any questions
 
05:23:50.090 --> 05:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
for him you have one I just wanted
 
05:23:51.890 --> 05:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
clarification because I heard some
 
05:23:55.490 --> 05:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
pretty big Revenue numbers from you and
 
05:23:57.590 --> 05:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
um I think that all the states you were
 
05:24:00.230 --> 05:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
talking about have a retail
 
05:24:03.530 --> 05:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
cannabis tax in were you also adding in
 
05:24:06.530 --> 05:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
things like sale taxes and how that
 
05:24:08.930 --> 05:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
translates to what we have how does that
 
05:24:11.810 --> 05:24:11.820 align:start position:0%
you know transfer to what we're looking
 
05:24:14.810 --> 05:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
at which is attacks only on wholesale
 
05:24:17.090 --> 05:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
right so I mentioned the states that
 
05:24:20.628 --> 05:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
have that I have sales tax and transfer
 
05:24:22.610 --> 05:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
or wholesale taxes and then states that
 
05:24:24.708 --> 05:24:24.718 align:start position:0%
just have retail I think that your fact
 
05:24:26.208 --> 05:24:26.218 align:start position:0%
that you're choosing one or the other
 
05:24:29.470 --> 05:24:29.480 align:start position:0%
not both is smart
 
05:24:32.090 --> 05:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
unsolicited I'm more in the preference
 
05:24:35.570 --> 05:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
of a lower cultivation tax or a vape or
 
05:24:37.850 --> 05:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals tax but that's I'm not
 
05:24:39.110 --> 05:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
on the committee making those decisions
 
05:24:42.350 --> 05:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
but that's my where I'd lean but it's
 
05:24:44.570 --> 05:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
also whatever is prudent for looking at
 
05:24:48.590 --> 05:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:50.628 --> 05:24:50.638 align:start position:0%
to representative leapley did you have a
 
05:24:50.638 --> 05:24:51.288 align:start position:0%
to representative leapley did you have a
question

05:24:51.288 --> 05:24:51.298 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:24:53.990 --> 05:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
and then representative spilsberg
 
05:24:58.010 --> 05:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that the numbers
 
05:25:00.350 --> 05:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
um that our guests provided
 
05:25:02.448 --> 05:25:02.458 align:start position:0%
Jive totally with the numbers we've been
 
05:25:06.470 --> 05:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
looking at all day and the main numbers
 
05:25:09.050 --> 05:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
the Vermont numbers this is revenue this
 
05:25:13.610 --> 05:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
is total tax revenue so Maine as we've
 
05:25:16.010 --> 05:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
been discussing has an excise tax and a
 
05:25:18.410 --> 05:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
sales tax
 
05:25:20.628 --> 05:25:20.638 align:start position:0%
um so if you're just looking at the
 
05:25:22.850 --> 05:25:22.860 align:start position:0%
excise tax it's ten percent but if you
 
05:25:25.550 --> 05:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
add in the sales tax it's 5.5 percent
 
05:25:27.490 --> 05:25:27.500 align:start position:0%
you put them both together you get
 
05:25:31.730 --> 05:25:31.740 align:start position:0%
apparently in 2022 60 million last last
 
05:25:33.190 --> 05:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
year it was like
 
05:25:36.770 --> 05:25:36.780 align:start position:0%
12.9 I think in Maine so I I just want
 
05:25:39.350 --> 05:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
to come back to the point that I think
 
05:25:42.948 --> 05:25:42.958 align:start position:0%
we have to to me
 
05:25:45.230 --> 05:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at all of the facts in front
 
05:25:47.270 --> 05:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
of us and
 
05:25:51.948 --> 05:25:51.958 align:start position:0%
it just looks like 15 retail
 
05:25:54.170 --> 05:25:54.180 align:start position:0%
is the starting point
 
05:25:56.448 --> 05:25:56.458 align:start position:0%
where other taxes other states are
 
05:25:59.510 --> 05:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
taxing this at the retail level with the
 
05:26:01.788 --> 05:26:01.798 align:start position:0%
exception of New Jersey and in Maine
 
05:26:03.890 --> 05:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
they also have
 
05:26:08.090 --> 05:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
and 335 dollars per pound excise tax on
 
05:26:12.230 --> 05:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
flour 94 dollars per pound on trim 150
 
05:26:14.628 --> 05:26:14.638 align:start position:0%
or one dollar fifty cents per seedling
 
05:26:17.208 --> 05:26:17.218 align:start position:0%
30 cents per seed that's before you get
 
05:26:20.330 --> 05:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
to the retail excise tax of 10 and then
 
05:26:22.490 --> 05:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
add on that the state sales tax of 5.5
 
05:26:22.500 --> 05:26:23.690 align:start position:0%
add on that the state sales tax of 5.5
percent

05:26:23.690 --> 05:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
percent
 
05:26:27.770 --> 05:26:27.780 align:start position:0%
so I just it seems really clear from all
 
05:26:30.430 --> 05:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
of the information we've been given
 
05:26:34.208 --> 05:26:34.218 align:start position:0%
what is kind of out there for taxation
 
05:26:37.910 --> 05:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
so I think that we can be New Hampshire
 
05:26:41.770 --> 05:26:41.780 align:start position:0%
and have low taxes without
 
05:26:46.190 --> 05:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
missing out on millions of dollars of
 
05:26:49.310 --> 05:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
Revenue and if this committee is
 
05:26:52.670 --> 05:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
interested in some of the tax cuts that
 
05:26:54.470 --> 05:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
have come before us or that have been
 
05:26:56.868 --> 05:26:56.878 align:start position:0%
cut in the last few years like we're
 
05:27:00.530 --> 05:27:00.540 align:start position:0%
losing IND income
 
05:27:02.448 --> 05:27:02.458 align:start position:0%
people are proposing to tax the
 
05:27:05.030 --> 05:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
communications tax or cut the
 
05:27:07.368 --> 05:27:07.378 align:start position:0%
communications tax
 
05:27:10.190 --> 05:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
I I mean it's Ways and Means so our job
 
05:27:13.310 --> 05:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
is to find Revenue so if we're going to
 
05:27:15.890 --> 05:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
legalize this I think our constituents
 
05:27:19.430 --> 05:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
would expect us to tax it in a in
 
05:27:22.788 --> 05:27:22.798 align:start position:0%
alignment with the way we tax tobacco
 
05:27:25.490 --> 05:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
the way we tax um other things that
 
05:27:28.490 --> 05:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
impose that will impose a cost on people
 
05:27:30.410 --> 05:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
who live in New Hampshire so we need to
 
05:27:32.330 --> 05:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
cover those costs and then it would be
 
05:27:35.390 --> 05:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
nice if we could generate Revenue
 
05:27:37.190 --> 05:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
um so I'm hoping that we can come back
 
05:27:41.990 --> 05:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
with a number that is
 
05:27:43.868 --> 05:27:43.878 align:start position:0%
on the planet Earth
 
05:27:46.970 --> 05:27:46.980 align:start position:0%
and comparable to other states in the
 
05:27:49.850 --> 05:27:49.860 align:start position:0%
union that's my hope for Monday
 
05:27:52.910 --> 05:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
okay let's let's um in an attempt to try
 
05:27:55.550 --> 05:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
to get the tax part wrapped up let's I
 
05:27:56.990 --> 05:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
want to hear from
 
05:27:59.090 --> 05:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
people as to what what is your proposed
 
05:28:01.310 --> 05:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
tax we've kind of understood where
 
05:28:03.470 --> 05:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
people are coming from now let's
 
05:28:05.390 --> 05:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
we know representative Doucette is
 
05:28:07.610 --> 05:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
proposing eight percent that's why I
 
05:28:09.190 --> 05:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
asked for caucus
 
05:28:13.310 --> 05:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:15.410 --> 05:28:15.420 align:start position:0%
um we don't have enough did I come back
 
05:28:17.150 --> 05:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
to you representative spilsbury you had
 
05:28:19.610 --> 05:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
something you were going to say
 
05:28:23.990 --> 05:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:24.000 --> 05:28:25.128 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:28:25.128 --> 05:28:25.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:26.750 --> 05:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
does anyone have
 
05:28:30.350 --> 05:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
a thought on the actual tax so
 
05:28:34.010 --> 05:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
um I I agree that if if we were doing a
 
05:28:38.628 --> 05:28:38.638 align:start position:0%
a retail tax that 15 would be like the
 
05:28:40.670 --> 05:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
starting point and and I'd like to see
 
05:28:42.350 --> 05:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
it more but you know I wouldn't get
 
05:28:45.890 --> 05:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
upset over 15. but if we're going to do
 
05:28:48.288 --> 05:28:48.298 align:start position:0%
it at the wholesale level we have to
 
05:28:50.150 --> 05:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
have something that's comparable to that
 
05:28:53.750 --> 05:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
and what we heard is that when you move
 
05:28:57.050 --> 05:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
the tax to the wholesale level the you
 
05:28:59.990 --> 05:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
know what you're taxing is a lot less
 
05:29:03.050 --> 05:29:03.060 align:start position:0%
expensive than the retail you're only
 
05:29:05.750 --> 05:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
going to get about 25 percent
 
05:29:11.350 --> 05:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
so the what's comparable to a 15 percent
 
05:29:15.350 --> 05:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
retail tax would be a 60 wholesale tax
 
05:29:19.010 --> 05:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
so I'm not really suggesting 60 but 15
 
05:29:21.948 --> 05:29:21.958 align:start position:0%
is just ludicrous I mean we won't we
 
05:29:23.930 --> 05:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
won't even take us like five or six
 
05:29:26.270 --> 05:29:26.280 align:start position:0%
years just to pay off the startup costs
 
05:29:28.190 --> 05:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
and then we're looking at revenues like
 
05:29:32.810 --> 05:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
maybe a a maybe 10 million a year so
 
05:29:35.810 --> 05:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
it if we're going to do wholesale it has
 
05:29:38.810 --> 05:29:38.820 align:start position:0%
to be comparable to what would be raised
 
05:29:45.350 --> 05:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
at a retail rate of 15 or more
 
05:29:47.570 --> 05:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
representative Doucet
 
05:29:50.270 --> 05:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
circling back here we've heard a lot of
 
05:29:54.288 --> 05:29:54.298 align:start position:0%
input a lot of testimony I stand on my
 
05:29:57.470 --> 05:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
ground I don't necessarily care how
 
05:29:59.810 --> 05:29:59.820 align:start position:0%
anybody else does it I don't care that
 
05:30:02.090 --> 05:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
they have a sales tax I don't care what
 
05:30:05.030 --> 05:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
the rate of their sales tax is people in
 
05:30:07.850 --> 05:30:07.860 align:start position:0%
my town of Salem New Hampshire voted for
 
05:30:10.010 --> 05:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
me and those people want me to control
 
05:30:12.708 --> 05:30:12.718 align:start position:0%
taxes most specifically they don't want
 
05:30:15.410 --> 05:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
a sales and or an income tax and I've
 
05:30:18.050 --> 05:30:18.060 align:start position:0%
made them that promise also they're
 
05:30:19.970 --> 05:30:19.980 align:start position:0%
talking to me about this very issue
 
05:30:22.670 --> 05:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
legalization that we all know is coming
 
05:30:25.610 --> 05:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
I want to do it right I want to do it
 
05:30:27.170 --> 05:30:27.180 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire way I want to make it
 
05:30:29.868 --> 05:30:29.878 align:start position:0%
affordable we can make comparisons to
 
05:30:31.070 --> 05:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
other states well here's a great
 
05:30:34.010 --> 05:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
comparison our border with the border of
 
05:30:37.190 --> 05:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that does 1.2 or 1.4
 
05:30:40.550 --> 05:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in cannabis sales it's a
 
05:30:42.230 --> 05:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
big border I happen to live on that
 
05:30:44.930 --> 05:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
border we're going to get some of that
 
05:30:47.390 --> 05:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
Revenue into this state I think we
 
05:30:49.430 --> 05:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
undercut the competition whether it be
 
05:30:51.350 --> 05:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
Black Market or whether it be Maine
 
05:30:55.610 --> 05:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Vermont or anybody else I
 
05:30:58.970 --> 05:30:58.980 align:start position:0%
I again retort that the 15 was a
 
05:31:02.030 --> 05:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
hypothetical nobody testified as to why
 
05:31:06.170 --> 05:31:06.180 align:start position:0%
there was a 15 tax I my belief is this
 
05:31:08.628 --> 05:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
puts us like I said earlier tip of the
 
05:31:11.330 --> 05:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
spear cheapest in the country done the
 
05:31:14.270 --> 05:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire way done right regulated
 
05:31:14.280 --> 05:31:15.708 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire way done right regulated
correctly

05:31:15.708 --> 05:31:15.718 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
05:31:17.750 --> 05:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know we're making comparisons I'd
 
05:31:20.810 --> 05:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
like to compare compare our liquor
 
05:31:23.510 --> 05:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue to any other state in in the
 
05:31:23.520 --> 05:31:24.410 align:start position:0%
Revenue to any other state in in the
country

05:31:24.410 --> 05:31:24.420 align:start position:0%
country
 
05:31:27.050 --> 05:31:27.060 align:start position:0%
okay we can do cannabis right we do a
 
05:31:29.090 --> 05:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
lot of things right in New Hampshire and
 
05:31:31.550 --> 05:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
this is the right thing to do start in
 
05:31:34.368 --> 05:31:34.378 align:start position:0%
undercut the competition set the mark
 
05:31:39.770 --> 05:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:41.330 --> 05:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury and then
 
05:31:41.340 --> 05:31:43.030 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury and then
elberger

05:31:43.030 --> 05:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
elberger
 
05:31:47.690 --> 05:31:47.700 align:start position:0%
so this is a brand new adventure there's
 
05:31:49.730 --> 05:31:49.740 align:start position:0%
no empirical data
 
05:31:54.170 --> 05:31:54.180 align:start position:0%
it's making the debate itself difficult
 
05:31:56.628 --> 05:31:56.638 align:start position:0%
because numbers are being thrown around
 
05:31:56.638 --> 05:31:57.770 align:start position:0%
because numbers are being thrown around
that

05:31:57.770 --> 05:31:57.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:32:02.030 --> 05:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
are being rounded or used Loosely and
 
05:32:04.368 --> 05:32:04.378 align:start position:0%
you come to a certain point where you
 
05:32:06.708 --> 05:32:06.718 align:start position:0%
just need to get started
 
05:32:08.750 --> 05:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
so we've already had a vote on the house
 
05:32:12.948 --> 05:32:12.958 align:start position:0%
floor and the house has decided it wants
 
05:32:15.530 --> 05:32:15.540 align:start position:0%
to proceed with this legislation
 
05:32:18.350 --> 05:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
where we set the rate today at the
 
05:32:18.360 --> 05:32:20.208 align:start position:0%
where we set the rate today at the
outset

05:32:20.208 --> 05:32:20.218 align:start position:0%
outset
 
05:32:22.850 --> 05:32:22.860 align:start position:0%
really doesn't govern where that rate is
 
05:32:24.830 --> 05:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
going to end up once we start to see the
 
05:32:28.670 --> 05:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
program unfold let's let's let's go with
 
05:32:31.310 --> 05:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
the 15 given that exit the wholesale
 
05:32:31.320 --> 05:32:32.868 align:start position:0%
the 15 given that exit the wholesale
level

05:32:32.868 --> 05:32:32.878 align:start position:0%
level
 
05:32:34.910 --> 05:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
I would be for eight percent or less if
 
05:32:36.590 --> 05:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
it was the retail level
 
05:32:39.350 --> 05:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
I don't buy the idea that the difference
 
05:32:41.930 --> 05:32:41.940 align:start position:0%
between wholesale and reset re and
 
05:32:44.930 --> 05:32:44.940 align:start position:0%
Retail would require the rate to be four
 
05:32:44.940 --> 05:32:47.330 align:start position:0%
Retail would require the rate to be four
times

05:32:47.330 --> 05:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:51.070 --> 05:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
I don't buy the idea of 45 or 60 percent
 
05:32:54.050 --> 05:32:54.060 align:start position:0%
I think it's fantasy
 
05:32:56.948 --> 05:32:56.958 align:start position:0%
I think we need to kick off a program
 
05:32:59.628 --> 05:32:59.638 align:start position:0%
and give the Liquor Commission the
 
05:33:01.030 --> 05:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
advantage of getting it started
 
05:33:04.368 --> 05:33:04.378 align:start position:0%
recognizing that it's going to take
 
05:33:06.890 --> 05:33:06.900 align:start position:0%
12 to 15 months to even initiate
 
05:33:09.170 --> 05:33:09.180 align:start position:0%
rulemaking under the terms of the bill
 
05:33:11.810 --> 05:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
and it's going to take 24 to 36 months
 
05:33:14.930 --> 05:33:14.940 align:start position:0%
to get it rolling to get licenses out
 
05:33:17.150 --> 05:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
and another legislature will come back
 
05:33:18.948 --> 05:33:18.958 align:start position:0%
with more information
 
05:33:21.590 --> 05:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
and the benefit of being able to reset
 
05:33:24.590 --> 05:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
the rate if and when the data indicates
 
05:33:25.910 --> 05:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
it should be
 
05:33:29.330 --> 05:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
so I I'm I'm all for sticking with the
 
05:33:30.830 --> 05:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
rate that we've received from the
 
05:33:33.650 --> 05:33:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:35.390 --> 05:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
representative lburger and then play
 
05:33:36.948 --> 05:33:36.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:33:36.958 --> 05:33:37.788 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:33:37.788 --> 05:33:37.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:40.910 --> 05:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
I may have different constituents from
 
05:33:43.610 --> 05:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
those of Representative Doucet but I
 
05:33:44.750 --> 05:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
will tell you that when I was
 
05:33:47.990 --> 05:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
campaigning last year the biggest issue
 
05:33:49.550 --> 05:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
that they presented to me was high
 
05:33:52.910 --> 05:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
property taxes and whatever we can do to
 
05:33:55.850 --> 05:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
help lower property taxes will be will
 
05:33:59.830 --> 05:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
make more of them happier than any other
 
05:34:02.690 --> 05:34:02.700 align:start position:0%
financial decision that I think we can
 
05:34:02.700 --> 05:34:04.250 align:start position:0%
financial decision that I think we can
make

05:34:04.250 --> 05:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
make
 
05:34:04.260 --> 05:34:05.150 align:start position:0%
make
um

05:34:05.150 --> 05:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:09.050 --> 05:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
I happen to believe that
 
05:34:12.590 --> 05:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
if we were to go in with a lower tax
 
05:34:15.230 --> 05:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
rate at this point and say well you know
 
05:34:17.390 --> 05:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
if we need to we can make it higher in a
 
05:34:19.310 --> 05:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
couple of years that that will fall flat
 
05:34:22.390 --> 05:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
on its face because
 
05:34:24.948 --> 05:34:24.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as we know doesn't like
 
05:34:28.670 --> 05:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
taxes and doesn't like tax increases so
 
05:34:31.070 --> 05:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
if we start low getting it higher even
 
05:34:34.730 --> 05:34:34.740 align:start position:0%
if we determine that it's necessary will
 
05:34:37.610 --> 05:34:37.620 align:start position:0%
be a very very difficult thing to
 
05:34:37.620 --> 05:34:38.810 align:start position:0%
be a very very difficult thing to
accomplish

05:34:38.810 --> 05:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
accomplish
 
05:34:43.128 --> 05:34:43.138 align:start position:0%
I'm comfortable with 15 at retail
 
05:34:45.890 --> 05:34:45.900 align:start position:0%
and particularly if it means that at
 
05:34:47.810 --> 05:34:47.820 align:start position:0%
some point we can help lower property
 
05:34:47.820 --> 05:34:50.650 align:start position:0%
some point we can help lower property
taxes

05:34:50.650 --> 05:34:50.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:53.930 --> 05:34:53.940 align:start position:0%
I agreed with everything that represents
 
05:34:58.490 --> 05:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
Pillsbury said except the rate and I buy
 
05:35:01.128 --> 05:35:01.138 align:start position:0%
a lot of what a representative Doucet
 
05:35:03.470 --> 05:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
says we want a really undercut illegal
 
05:35:05.208 --> 05:35:05.218 align:start position:0%
trade none of the other states have done
 
05:35:05.218 --> 05:35:05.930 align:start position:0%
trade none of the other states have done
it

05:35:05.930 --> 05:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:35:09.230 --> 05:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
and so to get it low enough to undercut
 
05:35:12.470 --> 05:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
the retail rate and then attract
 
05:35:15.470 --> 05:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
business across the border our way that
 
05:35:17.510 --> 05:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean I'm died in the wool over
 
05:35:33.288 --> 05:35:33.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:33.298 --> 05:35:34.670 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:35:34.670 --> 05:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:35:41.208 --> 05:35:41.218 align:start position:0%
um we have a 68 percent tax on Tobacco
 
05:35:43.610 --> 05:35:43.620 align:start position:0%
but it's much lower than our neighbors
 
05:35:47.270 --> 05:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
and we undercut them on cigarette sales
 
05:35:51.050 --> 05:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
we look like we smoke more two times
 
05:35:54.410 --> 05:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
more than anybody else in the country uh
 
05:35:58.190 --> 05:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
on the statistics uh
 
05:36:03.830 --> 05:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
if we are trying to lower this to the
 
05:36:06.170 --> 05:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
point where we are not going to be able
 
05:36:09.830 --> 05:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
to pay enough for the Liquor Commission
 
05:36:09.840 --> 05:36:11.510 align:start position:0%
to pay enough for the Liquor Commission
work

05:36:11.510 --> 05:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
work
 
05:36:15.110 --> 05:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
and keep the product safe and keep the
 
05:36:18.770 --> 05:36:18.780 align:start position:0%
product tasting okay we are not going to
 
05:36:22.610 --> 05:36:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:26.150 --> 05:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
and I think that you are getting down to
 
05:36:29.510 --> 05:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
a level where it is really hard to tell
 
05:36:33.110 --> 05:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
with all of of the complications of the
 
05:36:35.930 --> 05:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
way each state defines where and what
 
05:36:38.628 --> 05:36:38.638 align:start position:0%
they're taxing but
 
05:36:41.570 --> 05:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
it looks to me like
 
05:36:45.770 --> 05:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
15 is the lowest that's going to help us
 
05:36:47.868 --> 05:36:47.878 align:start position:0%
with this and it looks to me like we're
 
05:36:50.090 --> 05:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
going to have some trouble with the
 
05:36:54.170 --> 05:36:54.180 align:start position:0%
budgeters about the three year Hiatus
 
05:36:58.128 --> 05:36:58.138 align:start position:0%
that we've we have to have
 
05:37:00.770 --> 05:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
um this bill has got the Appropriations
 
05:37:05.628 --> 05:37:05.638 align:start position:0%
in it at uh half and a quarter of the
 
05:37:07.490 --> 05:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
amount that they're going to need and
 
05:37:09.110 --> 05:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
they're going to have other revenue for
 
05:37:09.120 --> 05:37:12.310 align:start position:0%
they're going to have other revenue for
it

05:37:12.310 --> 05:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:15.530 --> 05:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
representative lippley thank you
 
05:37:15.540 --> 05:37:16.850 align:start position:0%
representative lippley thank you
um

05:37:16.850 --> 05:37:16.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:21.110 --> 05:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
so just some reflection
 
05:37:21.120 --> 05:37:23.090 align:start position:0%
so just some reflection
if

05:37:23.090 --> 05:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:37:25.330 --> 05:37:25.340 align:start position:0%
when we run we're running against
 
05:37:28.910 --> 05:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
raising income taxes and against sales
 
05:37:30.770 --> 05:37:30.780 align:start position:0%
taxes which
 
05:37:33.590 --> 05:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
most people in New Hampshire are running
 
05:37:33.600 --> 05:37:34.850 align:start position:0%
most people in New Hampshire are running
on

05:37:34.850 --> 05:37:34.860 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:37:38.930 --> 05:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
we're not running on well I guess some
 
05:37:40.490 --> 05:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
people are running on not having a state
 
05:37:43.010 --> 05:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
that is definitely a group of people who
 
05:37:45.350 --> 05:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
are running in New Hampshire but if this
 
05:37:47.810 --> 05:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
isn't a sales tax right we just
 
05:37:50.750 --> 05:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
negotiated so it's not a sales tax it's
 
05:37:52.730 --> 05:37:52.740 align:start position:0%
on the manufacturing
 
05:37:54.948 --> 05:37:54.958 align:start position:0%
that was very important to members of
 
05:37:56.930 --> 05:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
this committee and we came to an
 
05:37:59.530 --> 05:37:59.540 align:start position:0%
agreement that it's a wholesale
 
05:38:03.550 --> 05:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturing tax not a sales tax right
 
05:38:05.930 --> 05:38:05.940 align:start position:0%
so I think that was essential to many
 
05:38:07.010 --> 05:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
people here
 
05:38:09.590 --> 05:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
it's not a sales tax it's not an income
 
05:38:09.600 --> 05:38:10.550 align:start position:0%
it's not a sales tax it's not an income
tax

05:38:10.550 --> 05:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
tax
 
05:38:13.670 --> 05:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
we have to raise revenue somehow in the
 
05:38:15.770 --> 05:38:15.780 align:start position:0%
state if we are opposed to raising
 
05:38:18.650 --> 05:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
revenue on income taxes and on sales
 
05:38:22.250 --> 05:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
taxes then we should have taxes that are
 
05:38:25.010 --> 05:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
not income taxes or sales taxes so that
 
05:38:27.110 --> 05:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
we can take in revenue and run our state
 
05:38:29.270 --> 05:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
because at this point we keep cutting
 
05:38:29.280 --> 05:38:30.830 align:start position:0%
because at this point we keep cutting
taxes

05:38:30.830 --> 05:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
05:38:32.868 --> 05:38:32.878 align:start position:0%
um and we're running out of places to
 
05:38:34.550 --> 05:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
cut and we're running out of money so
 
05:38:36.170 --> 05:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
because it's not an income tax and
 
05:38:38.750 --> 05:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
because it's a sale not a sales tax I
 
05:38:40.910 --> 05:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
think that we should vote for it thank
 
05:38:40.920 --> 05:38:42.288 align:start position:0%
think that we should vote for it thank
you

05:38:42.288 --> 05:38:42.298 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:38:44.390 --> 05:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Doucet just
 
05:38:47.090 --> 05:38:47.100 align:start position:0%
just a final comment here no nobody
 
05:38:48.948 --> 05:38:48.958 align:start position:0%
we've heard numbers thrown around we've
 
05:38:50.570 --> 05:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
heard figures thrown around we've heard
 
05:38:52.310 --> 05:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
assumptions thrown around as to how
 
05:38:54.128 --> 05:38:54.138 align:start position:0%
things are going to be paid for nobody
 
05:38:56.690 --> 05:38:56.700 align:start position:0%
nobody knows what the revenue is going
 
05:39:01.670 --> 05:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
to be generated nobody okay and to to uh

they want
 
05:59:53.330 --> 05:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
they a lot of it is just name changes
 
05:59:55.190 --> 05:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
they don't want Substance Abuse
 
05:59:56.990 --> 05:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
Prevention and Recovery they want
 
06:00:00.410 --> 06:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
substance use but and creation and
 
06:00:02.030 --> 06:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
promotion of scientifically and
 
06:00:04.610 --> 06:00:04.620 align:start position:0%
medically accurate public education
 
06:00:06.410 --> 06:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
committees instead of just
 
06:00:09.048 --> 06:00:09.058 align:start position:0%
scientifically and they want to create
 
06:00:13.070 --> 06:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
these okay and
 
06:00:16.730 --> 06:00:16.740 align:start position:0%
but they do and
 
06:00:21.350 --> 06:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
and explaining better what the the costs
 
06:00:23.750 --> 06:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
are for the Dual use the alternative
 
06:00:25.310 --> 06:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
treatment centers
 
06:00:28.730 --> 06:00:28.740 align:start position:0%
when they do both sides of it
 
06:00:30.770 --> 06:00:30.780 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
06:00:35.690 --> 06:00:35.700 align:start position:0%
but there is something else in here that
 
06:00:38.030 --> 06:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
it's been a while since I even decided
 
06:00:40.030 --> 06:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
to look at it
 
06:00:44.810 --> 06:00:44.820 align:start position:0%
they did want as part of this at least I
 
06:00:46.788 --> 06:00:46.798 align:start position:0%
think 250
 
06:00:49.270 --> 06:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
000 up before
 
06:00:52.570 --> 06:00:52.580 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis sales started
 
06:00:56.390 --> 06:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
before that so that they could
 
06:00:56.400 --> 06:00:56.930 align:start position:0%
before that so that they could
um

06:00:56.930 --> 06:00:56.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:00.170 --> 06:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
could um education and do an education
 
06:01:05.510 --> 06:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
campaign to Youth and vulnerable adults
 
06:01:08.090 --> 06:01:08.100 align:start position:0%
okay all right so we will discuss that
 
06:01:10.368 --> 06:01:10.378 align:start position:0%
Amendment on Monday
 
06:01:12.830 --> 06:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
and um at this point Let's uh
 
06:01:16.010 --> 06:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
representative Doucet go through the
 
06:01:16.020 --> 06:01:17.270 align:start position:0%
representative Doucet go through the
amendment

06:01:17.270 --> 06:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:01:22.128 --> 06:01:22.138 align:start position:0%
okay yeah the only component Amy
 
06:01:25.190 --> 06:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
there's there's three uh former
 
06:01:28.368 --> 06:01:28.378 align:start position:0%
representative of Rami brought a uh a
 
06:01:32.628 --> 06:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
sheet with issues that he he saw and in
 
06:01:35.868 --> 06:01:35.878 align:start position:0%
reading that myself and a couple others
 
06:01:39.350 --> 06:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
um a lot of what he gave to us
 
06:01:42.530 --> 06:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
was policy stuff we we picked out at
 
06:01:45.170 --> 06:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
least I picked out three very specific
 
06:01:47.270 --> 06:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
technical changes that had to be
 
06:01:49.430 --> 06:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
addressed and we did that in this
 
06:01:52.368 --> 06:01:52.378 align:start position:0%
amendment and I can point you to on page
 
06:01:59.090 --> 06:01:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:00.530 --> 06:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
um simply
 
06:02:02.990 --> 06:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
in the colon where it says D it should
 
06:02:05.628 --> 06:02:05.638 align:start position:0%
be a c
 
06:02:10.128 --> 06:02:10.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:16.490 --> 06:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:20.208 --> 06:02:20.218 align:start position:0%
we struck the following language
 
06:02:22.190 --> 06:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
where it reads
 
06:02:26.150 --> 06:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
and deposits into the fund by the
 
06:02:28.070 --> 06:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
06:02:31.610 --> 06:02:31.620 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration pursuant to RSA
 
06:02:31.620 --> 06:02:35.090 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration pursuant to RSA
77h

06:02:35.090 --> 06:02:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:38.690 --> 06:02:38.700 align:start position:0%
that's uh page 21
 
06:02:43.788 --> 06:02:43.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:47.208 --> 06:02:47.218 align:start position:0%
it's uh and deposits into the fund the
 
06:02:48.770 --> 06:02:48.780 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Department of Revenue
 
06:02:55.850 --> 06:02:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:58.368 --> 06:02:58.378 align:start position:0%
well we struck that all out
 
06:03:00.890 --> 06:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
stuck it all out okay
 
06:03:03.650 --> 06:03:03.660 align:start position:0%
also on page 21
 
06:03:08.810 --> 06:03:08.820 align:start position:0%
on line 22 an unneeded word uh simply
 
06:03:12.410 --> 06:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
line 22 the second word in cannabis just
 
06:03:18.890 --> 06:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:21.350 --> 06:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
on page 22
 
06:03:24.770 --> 06:03:24.780 align:start position:0%
lines 13 through 14.
 
06:03:29.510 --> 06:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:31.850 --> 06:03:31.860 align:start position:0%
see it's
 
06:03:36.470 --> 06:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
13 14 at the end okay based on the
 
06:03:38.208 --> 06:03:38.218 align:start position:0%
percent of
 
06:03:41.810 --> 06:03:41.820 align:start position:0%
striking out tax revenue collected
 
06:03:45.170 --> 06:03:45.180 align:start position:0%
instead reading based on the percentage
 
06:03:49.670 --> 06:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
percent of Statewide sales at retail
 
06:03:58.310 --> 06:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:01.548 --> 06:04:01.558 align:start position:0%
this is going to become rope could you
 
06:04:04.368 --> 06:04:04.378 align:start position:0%
repeat exactly it'll become moot by the
 
06:04:05.690 --> 06:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
other Amendment so I'm just going
 
06:04:09.830 --> 06:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:11.750 --> 06:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
so we should probably skip over that and
 
06:04:13.548 --> 06:04:13.558 align:start position:0%
and the remainder of that amendment is
 
06:04:16.970 --> 06:04:16.980 align:start position:0%
just the uh change from 15 to 8 percent
 
06:04:21.530 --> 06:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:24.530 --> 06:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
questions representative plett not with
 
06:04:26.868 --> 06:04:26.878 align:start position:0%
anything that representative set covered
 
06:04:30.288 --> 06:04:30.298 align:start position:0%
so far but on his Amendment the last two
 
06:04:30.298 --> 06:04:31.310 align:start position:0%
so far but on his Amendment the last two
lines

06:04:31.310 --> 06:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
lines
 
06:04:33.830 --> 06:04:33.840 align:start position:0%

06:04:35.628 --> 06:04:35.638 align:start position:0%

06:04:39.590 --> 06:04:39.600 align:start position:0%

06:06:05.208 --> 06:06:05.218 align:start position:0%
on a warrant on for the fiscal year
 
06:06:09.230 --> 06:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
ending June 30th 2024
 
06:06:11.628 --> 06:06:11.638 align:start position:0%
um so that's the first year of the next
 
06:06:11.638 --> 06:06:12.708 align:start position:0%
um so that's the first year of the next
budget

06:06:12.708 --> 06:06:12.718 align:start position:0%
budget
 
06:06:12.718 --> 06:06:14.930 align:start position:0%
budget
on

06:06:14.930 --> 06:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:06:17.330 --> 06:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
to draw a warrant for said some from any
 
06:06:18.890 --> 06:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
money in the treasury not otherwise
 
06:06:22.070 --> 06:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
appropriated that money is going to be
 
06:06:24.048 --> 06:06:24.058 align:start position:0%
going on
 
06:06:27.170 --> 06:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
not from the governor's warrants but in
 
06:06:29.810 --> 06:06:29.820 align:start position:0%
the budget as a
 
06:06:29.820 --> 06:06:31.610 align:start position:0%
the budget as a
on

06:06:31.610 --> 06:06:31.620 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:06:33.910 --> 06:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
end of the book
 
06:06:36.948 --> 06:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
deduction from the amount available for
 
06:06:38.230 --> 06:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
06:06:40.788 --> 06:06:40.798 align:start position:0%
and it's been going to The Liquor
 
06:06:43.548 --> 06:06:43.558 align:start position:0%
Commission which says it needs 7 million
 
06:06:45.110 --> 06:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
that first year
 
06:06:49.190 --> 06:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
on then it says 2 million for the fiscal
 
06:06:53.090 --> 06:06:53.100 align:start position:0%
year ended June 30th 2025 appropriated
 
06:06:56.690 --> 06:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
to the commission is established for
 
06:06:59.770 --> 06:06:59.780 align:start position:0%
deposit into the Cannabis fund
 
06:07:05.830 --> 06:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
for the administration of RSA 318f
 
06:07:09.470 --> 06:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
that money is the same thing it comes
 
06:07:11.208 --> 06:07:11.218 align:start position:0%
out of the budget in the back of the
 
06:07:13.670 --> 06:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
budget and reduces what they can use in
 
06:07:18.708 --> 06:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
the front of the budget on and on it is
 
06:07:21.948 --> 06:07:21.958 align:start position:0%
five million six million below what they
 
06:07:25.610 --> 06:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:28.190 --> 06:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:07:32.930 --> 06:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
do we just leave it like this and in the
 
06:07:34.310 --> 06:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
Assumption the whole thing is going to
 
06:07:37.310 --> 06:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
fail anyway or
 
06:07:40.070 --> 06:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
or do we change the Appropriations or do
 
06:07:43.010 --> 06:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
we decide that they they don't know how
 
06:07:44.628 --> 06:07:44.638 align:start position:0%
much it costs them to do the business
 
06:07:47.030 --> 06:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
and it could be less and let's just say
 
06:07:49.190 --> 06:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
it's less
 
06:07:52.250 --> 06:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
but going down from 8 million to 2
 
06:07:55.788 --> 06:07:55.798 align:start position:0%
million seems to me uh pretty hard for
 
06:08:04.510 --> 06:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:04.520 --> 06:08:06.410 align:start position:0%
 
thoughts

06:08:06.410 --> 06:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
06:08:08.510 --> 06:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
which is one more thing to discuss on
 
06:08:08.520 --> 06:08:09.788 align:start position:0%
which is one more thing to discuss on
Monday

06:08:09.788 --> 06:08:09.798 align:start position:0%
Monday
 
06:08:13.128 --> 06:08:13.138 align:start position:0%
well I want people to think about it and
 
06:08:15.650 --> 06:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
that's right that's exactly right that
 
06:08:17.390 --> 06:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
is a good point good
 
06:08:19.368 --> 06:08:19.378 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:08:21.410 --> 06:08:21.420 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury
 
06:08:23.690 --> 06:08:23.700 align:start position:0%
yeah while while we're contemplating the
 
06:08:25.610 --> 06:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
timing there and the amount
 
06:08:27.590 --> 06:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
I just want to draw attention to an
 
06:08:27.600 --> 06:08:30.890 align:start position:0%
I just want to draw attention to an
inconsistency

06:08:30.890 --> 06:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:33.830 --> 06:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
on page 32
 
06:08:36.530 --> 06:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
particularly focusing on line nine
 
06:08:38.810 --> 06:08:38.820 align:start position:0%
subparagraph two
 
06:08:41.150 --> 06:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
the sum of two million for the fiscal
 
06:08:44.510 --> 06:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
year ending June 30th 2025 which implies
 
06:08:47.390 --> 06:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
for the second year of the biennium but
 
06:08:50.948 --> 06:08:50.958 align:start position:0%
the language that's used back
 
06:08:54.890 --> 06:08:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:54.900 --> 06:08:58.490 align:start position:0%
 
21

06:08:58.490 --> 06:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:01.730 --> 06:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
online 21 talks about an appropriation
 
06:09:03.590 --> 06:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
for the biennium
 
06:09:05.990 --> 06:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
and so we're using the terminology
 
06:09:08.090 --> 06:09:08.100 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the biennium in one
 
06:09:09.470 --> 06:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
place and for the fiscal year and the
 
06:09:09.480 --> 06:09:14.208 align:start position:0%
place and for the fiscal year and the
other

06:09:14.208 --> 06:09:14.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:16.490 --> 06:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
so they should be reconciled and that's
 
06:09:19.190 --> 06:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
also true with the
 
06:09:22.490 --> 06:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
paragraph two for the biennium
 
06:09:22.500 --> 06:09:24.770 align:start position:0%
paragraph two for the biennium
and

06:09:24.770 --> 06:09:24.780 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:09:29.208 --> 06:09:29.218 align:start position:0%
paragraph 5A uh 100 000 for the
 
06:09:31.490 --> 06:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety I need to examine
 
06:09:33.830 --> 06:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
this a little bit more myself to make
 
06:09:35.390 --> 06:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
sure I've sorted it out and what's right
 
06:09:37.490 --> 06:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
but we've got two different areas of the
 
06:09:38.810 --> 06:09:38.820 align:start position:0%
law talking about the same thing in
 
06:09:46.990 --> 06:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:57.830 --> 06:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:59.570 --> 06:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
that's the one that doesn't existing
 
06:10:06.350 --> 06:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:10.010 --> 06:10:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:10.020 --> 06:10:12.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:10:12.350 --> 06:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:10:14.868 --> 06:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
I think there was just a typo in lines
 
06:10:18.948 --> 06:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
18 to 22. it was
 
06:10:21.708 --> 06:10:21.718 align:start position:0%
the biennium and the
 
06:10:25.070 --> 06:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
Roman 2 says the biennium ending in June
 
06:10:28.190 --> 06:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
30. uh and every biennium thereafter
 
06:10:30.170 --> 06:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
they will shall include the cost of
 
06:10:32.628 --> 06:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
administration into the commission's
 
06:10:35.570 --> 06:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
efficiency expenditure request it's too
 
06:10:36.890 --> 06:10:36.900 align:start position:0%
late for that
 
06:10:41.570 --> 06:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
by about 10 12 months 10 months at this
 
06:10:41.580 --> 06:10:42.470 align:start position:0%
by about 10 12 months 10 months at this
point

06:10:42.470 --> 06:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
point
 
06:10:42.480 --> 06:10:44.150 align:start position:0%
point
on

06:10:44.150 --> 06:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:10:49.910 --> 06:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
and then they say that 2002 million is
 
06:10:53.390 --> 06:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
it in Romans 3 they say for the biennium
 
06:10:53.400 --> 06:10:54.590 align:start position:0%
it in Romans 3 they say for the biennium
ending

06:10:54.590 --> 06:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
ending
 
06:10:54.600 --> 06:10:56.150 align:start position:0%
ending
on

06:10:56.150 --> 06:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:10:58.448 --> 06:10:58.458 align:start position:0%
June 30th
 
06:11:02.690 --> 06:11:02.700 align:start position:0%
2025 the sum of 2 million is here I
 
06:11:04.730 --> 06:11:04.740 align:start position:0%
appropriated commission for the cost of
 
06:11:08.090 --> 06:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
administration of this chapter
 
06:11:10.548 --> 06:11:10.558 align:start position:0%
and then the Appropriations at the end
 
06:11:13.548 --> 06:11:13.558 align:start position:0%
are look different from that maybe
 
06:11:17.690 --> 06:11:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:19.850 --> 06:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
I guess the question is do we want to
 
06:11:22.368 --> 06:11:22.378 align:start position:0%
authorize or appropriate so that they
 
06:11:24.230 --> 06:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
can spend 2 million at any time over the
 
06:11:25.610 --> 06:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
two-year cycle
 
06:11:27.230 --> 06:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
or are we trying to pin them down to
 
06:11:28.788 --> 06:11:28.798 align:start position:0%
spending it only in the second year of
 
06:11:37.070 --> 06:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:37.080 --> 06:11:38.930 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:11:38.930 --> 06:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:11:42.590 --> 06:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
if they spend 15 million
 
06:11:45.830 --> 06:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
in the two startup years they said they
 
06:11:50.628 --> 06:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
need they're buying all of those data
 
06:11:52.910 --> 06:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
management programs and learning how to
 
06:11:56.570 --> 06:11:56.580 align:start position:0%
use them they want seven million in the
 
06:11:59.570 --> 06:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
first year including some personnel and
 
06:12:01.850 --> 06:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
eight million in the second year
 
06:12:04.310 --> 06:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
including a lot more all of the
 
06:12:04.320 --> 06:12:06.110 align:start position:0%
including a lot more all of the
personnel

06:12:06.110 --> 06:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
06:12:09.890 --> 06:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
and then in the third year they need
 
06:12:11.750 --> 06:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
what they think they'll need going
 
06:12:15.110 --> 06:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
forward which is 4.2 million but all of
 
06:12:17.990 --> 06:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
that is more than what
 
06:12:22.310 --> 06:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:25.850 --> 06:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
and all of that would be additive until
 
06:12:29.510 --> 06:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
they start getting some money back
 
06:12:33.410 --> 06:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
which is at the end of the third year
 
06:12:36.770 --> 06:12:36.780 align:start position:0%
as I recall into the fourth year they're
 
06:12:38.930 --> 06:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
going to be getting money back and
 
06:12:40.730 --> 06:12:40.740 align:start position:0%
that's when they'll start paying that
 
06:12:43.788 --> 06:12:43.798 align:start position:0%
back because it says that some shall be
 
06:12:50.090 --> 06:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:53.930 --> 06:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:14.690 --> 06:13:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:18.650 --> 06:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:21.010 --> 06:13:21.020 align:start position:0%
I mean the
 
06:13:24.048 --> 06:13:24.058 align:start position:0%
it'd be nice to get this
 
06:13:25.490 --> 06:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
straightened out and added to the
 
06:13:28.310 --> 06:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
amendment for Monday
 
06:13:28.320 --> 06:13:29.390 align:start position:0%
amendment for Monday
um

06:13:29.390 --> 06:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:32.810 --> 06:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
is that something that
 
06:13:35.270 --> 06:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
yeah let's when we can sit down and
 
06:13:37.010 --> 06:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
convince ourselves we're thinking
 
06:13:37.020 --> 06:13:38.208 align:start position:0%
convince ourselves we're thinking
straight

06:13:38.208 --> 06:13:38.218 align:start position:0%
straight
 
06:13:40.970 --> 06:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
we will try to add that and of course we
 
06:13:45.048 --> 06:13:45.058 align:start position:0%
will we will cue OLS into the likelihood
 
06:13:47.208 --> 06:13:47.218 align:start position:0%
that some tweaks will be required while
 
06:13:49.310 --> 06:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
we're assembled on Monday I would I
 
06:13:50.628 --> 06:13:50.638 align:start position:0%
would think that would be a good good
 
06:13:50.638 --> 06:13:51.530 align:start position:0%
would think that would be a good good
bet

06:13:51.530 --> 06:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
bet
 
06:13:51.540 --> 06:13:53.030 align:start position:0%
bet
okay

06:13:53.030 --> 06:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:13:54.948 --> 06:13:54.958 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:13:54.958 --> 06:13:56.270 align:start position:0%
all right
um

06:13:56.270 --> 06:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:59.750 --> 06:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
I guess Monday we'll have
 
06:14:02.270 --> 06:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
separate amendments about some parts of
 
06:14:02.280 --> 06:14:03.770 align:start position:0%
separate amendments about some parts of
this

06:14:03.770 --> 06:14:03.780 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:14:05.930 --> 06:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
but I hate to have to
 
06:14:08.208 --> 06:14:08.218 align:start position:0%
think separately about whether we're
 
06:14:10.730 --> 06:14:10.740 align:start position:0%
accepting their numbers for what it
 
06:14:12.530 --> 06:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
takes them to do
 
06:14:15.048 --> 06:14:15.058 align:start position:0%
I'd hate to think that Monday we're
 
06:14:16.430 --> 06:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
going to have to be arguing about
 
06:14:18.708 --> 06:14:18.718 align:start position:0%
whether we're accepting their numbers
 
06:14:22.970 --> 06:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
for what they say they have to do
 
06:14:25.850 --> 06:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
um or we're going to try and cut them
 
06:14:28.730 --> 06:14:28.740 align:start position:0%
back some
 
06:14:31.070 --> 06:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
and whether we just put the
 
06:14:34.970 --> 06:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
Appropriations at the end or and dropped
 
06:14:38.030 --> 06:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
what was in 21 sorry drop what was in
 
06:14:38.040 --> 06:14:39.770 align:start position:0%
what was in 21 sorry drop what was in
21.

06:14:39.770 --> 06:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
21.
 
06:14:39.780 --> 06:14:42.288 align:start position:0%
21.
which

06:14:42.288 --> 06:14:42.298 align:start position:0%
which
 
06:14:42.298 --> 06:14:45.590 align:start position:0%
which
on

06:14:45.590 --> 06:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:47.690 --> 06:14:47.700 align:start position:0%
but which does say where the funding is
 
06:14:51.110 --> 06:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
coming from for the Cannabis fund
 
06:14:53.810 --> 06:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
and by the way that cannabis fund would
 
06:14:56.030 --> 06:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
according to the amendment we've got now
 
06:14:57.470 --> 06:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
should have been
 
06:15:01.970 --> 06:15:01.980 align:start position:0%
been liquor and cannabis fund I think
 
06:15:04.490 --> 06:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
maybe not no he said he's not just
 
06:15:06.948 --> 06:15:06.958 align:start position:0%
cannabis yeah it's One Fund they're not
 
06:15:08.390 --> 06:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
going to come in they don't they aren't
 
06:15:10.250 --> 06:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
they don't they don't come mango
 
06:15:11.868 --> 06:15:11.878 align:start position:0%
mingle so the question is what this
 
06:15:13.910 --> 06:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
thing gets called
 
06:15:16.010 --> 06:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
yeah consistent probably the Cannabis
 
06:15:19.610 --> 06:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
fund yes thank you Mr chairman
 
06:15:19.620 --> 06:15:20.690 align:start position:0%
fund yes thank you Mr chairman
um

06:15:20.690 --> 06:15:20.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:22.850 --> 06:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
representative Doucette and I will
 
06:15:25.070 --> 06:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
prepare an amendment that incorporates
 
06:15:26.570 --> 06:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
the things we've discussed today
 
06:15:28.850 --> 06:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
including the two proposals that I had
 
06:15:30.708 --> 06:15:30.718 align:start position:0%
made earlier
 
06:15:33.890 --> 06:15:33.900 align:start position:0%
um we our Amendment will not address the
 
06:15:35.510 --> 06:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
question of the amount of the
 
06:15:35.520 --> 06:15:36.948 align:start position:0%
question of the amount of the
appropriation

06:15:36.948 --> 06:15:36.958 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
06:15:38.690 --> 06:15:38.700 align:start position:0%
okay so if somebody thinks that's
 
06:15:41.030 --> 06:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
something they want to do it would be
 
06:15:43.670 --> 06:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
separate I'll I'll work on that okay
 
06:15:49.368 --> 06:15:49.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:52.368 --> 06:15:52.378 align:start position:0%

given that it may be another long day is
 
06:17:04.070 --> 06:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
there any way to start it maybe an hour
 
06:17:06.470 --> 06:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
earlier I don't know why it's that's
 
06:17:08.390 --> 06:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
representative Sanborn has already put
 
06:17:11.868 --> 06:17:11.878 align:start position:0%
that actually is that already in like
 
06:17:13.850 --> 06:17:13.860 align:start position:0%
it's surely put in the calendar at 11.
 
06:17:15.250 --> 06:17:15.260 align:start position:0%
it can't be changed
 
06:17:19.810 --> 06:17:19.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:21.770 --> 06:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
she could change it in this coming
 
06:17:21.780 --> 06:17:23.170 align:start position:0%
she could change it in this coming
calendar

06:17:23.170 --> 06:17:23.180 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
06:17:25.610 --> 06:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
it still can be changed but I'll I'll
 
06:17:27.948 --> 06:17:27.958 align:start position:0%
talk to her about starting it
 
06:17:30.288 --> 06:17:30.298 align:start position:0%
I have an oil fund disbursement board
 
06:17:33.230 --> 06:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
meeting from eight to nine okay yeah so
 
06:17:35.570 --> 06:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
I'd have trouble getting here ten no 10
 
06:17:37.788 --> 06:17:37.798 align:start position:0%
would be fine but I'll talk to her about
 
06:17:40.750 --> 06:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
seeing if we can push it back to 10.
 
06:17:43.430 --> 06:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
they can't do that just call a work
 
06:17:45.470 --> 06:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
session at 10.
 
06:17:47.330 --> 06:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
we're going to be in a work session when
 
06:17:49.430 --> 06:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
we start executing anyway
 
06:17:51.048 --> 06:17:51.058 align:start position:0%
all right well I'll talk to her and see
 
06:17:54.530 --> 06:17:54.540 align:start position:0%
what she wants to do did you have
 
06:17:56.628 --> 06:17:56.638 align:start position:0%
right yeah yeah well representative
 
06:17:58.250 --> 06:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
alberga was asking if we could start at
 
06:17:58.260 --> 06:18:01.010 align:start position:0%
alberga was asking if we could start at
10.

06:18:01.010 --> 06:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:02.448 --> 06:18:02.458 align:start position:0%
well I don't think we can start earlier
 
06:18:04.910 --> 06:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
I think we were but I don't know whether
 
06:18:04.920 --> 06:18:06.890 align:start position:0%
I think we were but I don't know whether
uh

06:18:06.890 --> 06:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:18:08.570 --> 06:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
the other side was talking about having
 
06:18:11.030 --> 06:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
a caucus prior too but I think that was
 
06:18:13.430 --> 06:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
part of the Chairman's uh oh was it
 
06:18:13.440 --> 06:18:18.128 align:start position:0%
part of the Chairman's uh oh was it
logic

06:18:18.128 --> 06:18:18.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:21.470 --> 06:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
well assume it's at 11 if it changes
 
06:18:24.110 --> 06:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
you'll be noticed
