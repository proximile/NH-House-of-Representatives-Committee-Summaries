opening the executive session on SP 58

I'm going to however recess it for about
 
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
five minutes we're waiting on a couple
 
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
more members so that we can have our
 
00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 align:start position:0%
full complement to move on with this so
 
00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 align:start position:0%
we're in recess for five more minutes

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
okay at this point I am reopening the
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
executive session on Senate Bill 58
 
00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:15.959 align:start position:0%
and I am going to recognize
 
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
representative Stone to tell us about
 
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee's work and the outcome
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair the subcommittee met
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
last week and uh we spoke with several
 
00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
stakeholders uh in addition we took
 
00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:30.180 align:start position:0%
additional testimony
 
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
and it was very abundantly clear to both
 
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
the committee and the stakeholders that
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
we all preferred to go with the SB 58
 
00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
Amendment for 594 10 versus going under
 
00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:42.839 align:start position:0%
the 627
 
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:46.860 align:start position:0%
8A which was a mostly unfavorable due to
 
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
the concerns of use of force by
 
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
untrained individuals and being Exempted
 
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.389 align:start position:0%
untrained individuals and being Exempted
uh

00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
representative Muse had prepared an
 
00:13:59.870 --> 00:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.129 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:14:01.129 --> 00:14:01.139 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
um at this point I would recognize
 
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
representative Muse to introduce or make
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.009 --> 00:14:13.019 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I move Amendment uh
 
00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:17.870 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I move Amendment uh
2023-1498h

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.569 align:start position:0%
 
second

00:14:20.569 --> 00:14:20.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak on your
 
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment your motion I I would
 
00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:27.779 align:start position:0%
um I think one of the experiences uh
 
00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
that sometimes you have with a bill and
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
sometimes with floor amendments too is
 
00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:34.740 align:start position:0%
that you may have the best intentions
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
when you introduce an amendment on the
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
floor but one of the things that the
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
floor amendment process does not give us
 
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:44.100 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to do is to go back to
 
00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and to other people who
 
00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:48.660 align:start position:0%
originally supported the bill to find
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
out if they still support the bill with
 
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
so in effect our our subcommittee
 
00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:57.740 align:start position:0%
meeting really became the public hearing
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
on the bill as it came through to us uh
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
in in the house and and I think one of
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
the things that we heard loudly and
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
clearly uh during the subcommittee
 
00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:09.959 align:start position:0%
meeting uh from the folks that we were
 
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:12.839 align:start position:0%
able to question uh is that there were
 
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
some some huge concerns uh with uh with
 
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
the bill the way that it came over to us
 
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
to a point where a lot of the a lot of
 
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:22.740 align:start position:0%
the folks
 
00:15:25.449 --> 00:15:25.459 align:start position:0%
um who uh who testified in front of us
 
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
had basically testified in support of
 
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
the original Bill and had actually been
 
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
involved in drafting the original
 
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:34.980 align:start position:0%
language but could no longer support the
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
bill as the Senate amended it
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
um Senator gray and his testimony to us
 
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
said his his number one objective is to
 
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
get uh a bill through that better
 
00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:50.459 align:start position:0%
protects uh uh health care workers and
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh and and I think I think he talked
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
about getting some kind of a bill
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
through is is something that's
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
absolutely essential and I think we
 
00:15:58.079 --> 00:15:59.090 align:start position:0%
absolutely essential and I think we
agreed

00:15:59.090 --> 00:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
agreed
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh but we also realize that given
 
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:07.740 align:start position:0%
the objections raised uh to the bill
 
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
which which included the fact that it
 
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
asked uh it would have allowed health
 
00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:14.519 align:start position:0%
care workers to actually restrain
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
individuals into a police arrive which
 
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
could potentially set medical facilities
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
up for violations of CMS rules which
 
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
could jeopardize things like Medicaid
 
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
and Medicare funding
 
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
um there were some questions around the
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
broadness of the language uh so for
 
00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:34.980 align:start position:0%
example would medical personnel be
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
allowed to detain people in places like
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
cafeterias and let's say places in a
 
00:16:43.009 --> 00:16:43.019 align:start position:0%
hospital where Medical Care was not
 
00:16:46.189 --> 00:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
being rendered so so essentially when we
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
when we looked at the bill the way that
 
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
it was originally worded along with uh
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
Senator rosenwald's Amendment we thought
 
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
that between the two of them they
 
00:16:58.610 --> 00:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
actually strike a balance between better
 
00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:59.949 align:start position:0%
actually strike a balance between better
protecting

00:16:59.949 --> 00:16:59.959 align:start position:0%
protecting
 
00:17:03.789 --> 00:17:03.799 align:start position:0%
health care workers but also ensuring
 
00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:06.839 align:start position:0%
that mentally that that people who are
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
in Mental Health crisis who actually
 
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:14.220 align:start position:0%
lash out aren't in a position where they
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
lash out once they're calmed down and
 
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
then they find themselves carted off to
 
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
a County Jail that as we heard uh in in
 
00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
testimony really doesn't have much of a
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
capability ability to treat them
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
so it it sets us up on this cycle where
 
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
we put mentally ill people in a jail
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
that's where they're not able to be
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
treated and well where can they be
 
00:17:39.289 --> 00:17:39.299 align:start position:0%
treated in a hospital setting
 
00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:42.419 align:start position:0%
so it's an extraordinarily tough uh
 
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
issue issue to deal with it but I think
 
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh the way that it uh
 
00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
stands in the way that it is worded now
 
00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
actually does deal with the situation in
 
00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
in a Fair Way
 
00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
um and uh the other thing that it does
 
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
is it narrowly uh expands more Atlas
 
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
arrest uh Powers which I think are I
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
think we're all
 
00:18:09.289 --> 00:18:09.299 align:start position:0%
basically I think this is an area where
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
I think we were all in agreement we want
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
to be we want to be careful when it
 
00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:15.299 align:start position:0%
comes to expanding this but what it does
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
do is it does expand it to include
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
um uh someone uh who actually commits a
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor or a violation uh while in
 
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
the care of a medical professional on
 
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
the premises of a residential care or
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
Health Care Facility through actional uh
 
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
through who through actual or threatened
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
violence interferes in the provision of
 
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
health care services that a licensed
 
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
professional has determined to be
 
00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
medically necessary
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
that's how we narrow it down so I would
 
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
urge everybody to uh to please vote for
 
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
it thank you
 
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.020 align:start position:0%

I would like to Simply add Mr chair that
 
00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
uh under the amendment it would maintain
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
the probable cause standard
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
s under five uh 94 10 and I would concur
 
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:09.660 align:start position:0%

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
anybody think that it is necessary does
 
00:19:45.289 --> 00:19:45.299 align:start position:0%
this have to be posted anywhere like in
 
00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:47.220 align:start position:0%
doctor's offices or hospitals that you
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
know there is this new law and if they
 
00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
do say to somebody hey you know get
 
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
yourself together man
 
00:19:57.289 --> 00:19:57.299 align:start position:0%
um does it need to be noticed anywhere
 
00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
I would um
 
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself I I would think that
 
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
it would behoove the medical facilities
 
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
to to post such a thing I don't think
 
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
that we need to make it statutorily
 
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
mandated but I'm open to hear discussion
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
on if anyone's interested
 
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
representative Manion
 
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
I think we have to remember that
 
00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
they're subject to arrest anyways this
 
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:30.780 align:start position:0%
just allows a warrantless arrest to deal
 
00:20:33.409 --> 00:20:33.419 align:start position:0%
with the issue at the scene as opposed
 
00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
to getting a warrant and arresting them
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
like we've been doing for ever so I
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
don't think a notice is necessary people
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
know that assault and criminal
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
threatening is a
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
is a crime this just allows an arrest at
 
00:20:48.409 --> 00:20:48.419 align:start position:0%
the scene so
 
00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
I agreed representative
 
00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:53.330 align:start position:0%
I agreed representative
well

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not being a police officer I look at
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
General Public
 
00:21:00.049 --> 00:21:00.059 align:start position:0%
most of the general public think when
 
00:21:03.289 --> 00:21:03.299 align:start position:0%
there's a police officer there that you
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
can be arrested
 
00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
right A lot of people don't know that in
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
some cases they really need to go get a
 
00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.830 align:start position:0%
some cases they really need to go get a
warrant

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
00:21:12.049 --> 00:21:12.059 align:start position:0%
they're just assuming oh I screwed up
 
00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
here's the police officer I'm probably
 
00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
going to jail so I think that's kind of
 
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
almost an understood thing that you you
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
muck up you're you're gonna
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
end up being arrested I have a friend
 
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:25.820 align:start position:0%
from the hospitals
 
00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.730 align:start position:0%
from the hospitals
yeah

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:27.740 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
I think that um I think that it's a tool
 
00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
that the hospitals could use to uh post
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
at their own discretion to uh Point
 
00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
people to if they start getting
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
unrolling that
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
um but we don't need to mandate it I
 
00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:43.559 align:start position:0%
don't think any further discussion on
 
00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative scitec uh Mr chair
 
00:21:50.029 --> 00:21:50.039 align:start position:0%
this is for my education and maybe not
 
00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:52.860 align:start position:0%
uh something we need to discuss here but
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
present law talks about uh has committed
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor or violation that's not in
 
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
the uh I'm reading from the amendment
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
but that looks like President law can
 
00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
you be arrested for a violation
 
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
on a warrant yes currently is that is
 
00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
that yeah
 
00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
or committed in the office's presence
 
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
you can actually arrest someone for a
 
00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
speeding ticket
 
00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
we don't do it but uh
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's it can be done the
 
00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
law allows it it's it's the way that uh
 
00:22:24.649 --> 00:22:24.659 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire current law is that
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's how you initiate a criminal
 
00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
complaint is through an arrest or a
 
00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:30.830 align:start position:0%
complaint is through an arrest or a
warrant

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
00:22:33.289 --> 00:22:33.299 align:start position:0%
so this
 
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:39.720 align:start position:0%

want to I'm going to speak for everyone
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
and say we don't want to I could have us
 
00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:36.200 align:start position:0%
all come back to organize
 
00:25:39.289 --> 00:25:39.299 align:start position:0%
for the subcommittees but or I could
 
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
just make them and send them out an
 
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
email what does everybody want to do do
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
you want to come back in June to talk
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
about subcommittees or would you rather
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
just have me do it
 
00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
could could you just send us a list of
 
00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
the various things and also maybe we
 
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
could submit like vacation times were
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
not available to make it work there'll
 
00:26:00.769 --> 00:26:00.779 align:start position:0%
be no work in July or August so the
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work would not start until
 
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.610 align:start position:0%

00:26:18.529 --> 00:26:18.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
because we do have quite a few there
 
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
might be something of perspects but
 
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
particular interest that somebody would
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
like to work on maybe yeah
 
00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.590 align:start position:0%
like to work on maybe yeah
if

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.310 align:start position:0%
if
um

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%

00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
if you have a particular interest in one
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
of our retained bills
 
00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.049 align:start position:0%
of our retained bills
um

00:26:39.049 --> 00:26:39.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
I would think sending out a list of what
 
00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:42.779 align:start position:0%
the bills are so we know which ones are
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
retained and then if we have something
 
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:46.740 align:start position:0%
that we find all right that's what I'll
 
00:26:48.169 --> 00:26:48.179 align:start position:0%
do I'll send out a list this afternoon
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
of all the retained bills and if you
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
have a particular interest I'll try to
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
accommodate that if not tough cookies
 
00:26:57.529 --> 00:26:57.539 align:start position:0%
um and then you guys can start working
 
00:27:00.649 --> 00:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
on those the chairs can contact them and
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
schedule dates in September to start
 
00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:04.980 align:start position:0%
working on them they have to be back by
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
the end of November end of October I
 
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
would prefer if you got them all done in
 
00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:10.919 align:start position:0%
September and then we wouldn't have a
 
00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
stress to get them done all right it's
 
00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:14.940 align:start position:0%
been a pleasure working with all of you
 
00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
and I'll see you next time
