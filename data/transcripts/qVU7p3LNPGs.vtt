thanks um good morning everyone we're
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
here for the introduction of this
 
00:23:31.149 --> 00:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment um this amendment that you
 
00:23:33.149 --> 00:23:33.159 align:start position:0%
have before you um I'm going to propose
 
00:23:34.269 --> 00:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
we change it
 
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
drastically um and the proposal is going
 
00:23:39.549 --> 00:23:39.559 align:start position:0%
to narrow it down to like a paragraph
 
00:23:42.029 --> 00:23:42.039 align:start position:0%
that's going to Define tency an
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
exception to tency instead of all this
 
00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:46.039 align:start position:0%
other stuff which I want to discuss
 
00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559 align:start position:0%
during the work session so that's going
 
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
to be the limit of my testimony on this
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
because this what's before us is going
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
to be altered significantly shortly so
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
um if I anyone has any questions I just
 
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
just ask you to hold them we're going to
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
discuss this in depth
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
shortly um and to anyone who is going to
 
00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
testify I would recommend you might hold
 
00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
off too much but you have a question
 
00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.470 align:start position:0%
off too much but you have a question
yeah

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
I I just uh have a question about the
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
process the process so we have an
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
amendment that's before us yeah and it
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
may be altered in the work session and
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
the function the way that would
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
be this Amendment would be um come in as
 
00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
a a different amendment is that cor same
 
00:24:35.389 --> 00:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
Amendment but it'll be the same
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment but it will have a different
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
number or something on it no it'll have
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
the same number it'll just be Rewritten
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
um as long as it's gerain to this
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
amendment okay and we'll do all that in
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
the work session we'll do all that and
 
00:24:49.389 --> 00:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
then we and then roduce it as then it
 
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
eventually gets exact as part of the
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
bill yeah if it gets ad when we do that
 
00:24:57.669 --> 00:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
if it's adopted yep and we'll be voting
 
00:24:59.789 --> 00:24:59.799 align:start position:0%
on adopted today or does that take place
 
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:01.240 align:start position:0%
today just working we won't take we're
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
not going to vote on anything till
 
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
Wednesday thank you represent
 
00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:06.200 align:start position:0%
representative Roy you have to sit back
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative scitec
 
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
representative Roy I think the that's
 
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
not the process I think the process is
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
that you don't amend an amendment we're
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
going to have a new Amendment with a new
 
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
number that may be based off of this
 
00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
modification this but this won't go
 
00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
forward that would be what OS does when
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
we send over the new language I'm sorry
 
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
if OLS assigns a new number when we send
 
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
over the
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
language wow okay and we'll have to
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
reintroduce the new one which is why I'm
 
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
trying to cut this yeah it it will be a
 
00:25:44.389 --> 00:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
new amendment number though they'll will
 
00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
assign us a whole new number I think
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
that's where there was confusion with
 
00:25:49.149 --> 00:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
representative Newman yeah bottom line
 
00:25:50.909 --> 00:25:50.919 align:start position:0%
is this is not going to be what we're
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
working right right but there will be a
 
00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
new there will be a new amendment number
 
00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
because we are it'll be just a different
 
00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.750 align:start position:0%
because we are it'll be just a different
Amendment

00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:06.430 align:start position:0%
Amendment
okay

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not sure if this is Nick Norman
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
yeah Nick Norman thank you very much for
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak with you based
 
00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
on what chairman Roy said I'll keep my
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
comments quite brief because I
 
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
understand that the whole amend is going
 
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
to be largely re written um I work as an
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
advocate for housing
 
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
providers I normally I I wrote to
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
everyone last night you got an email
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
from me I'm normally before Judiciary
 
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
and commerce so you don't see me too
 
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
much because you don't often take up
 
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant bills but I've been
 
00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:49.559 align:start position:0%
working for about 13 or more years
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
advocating for property owners around
 
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
the state I'm very active in that with
 
00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:55.640 align:start position:0%
anything involving new landlord tenant
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
law we have about 3,500 members that
 
00:26:59.870 --> 00:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
we're in touch with and we send out
 
00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:02.120 align:start position:0%
legislative upd updates during the
 
00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
legislative season every week so I let
 
00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
you know that to say that I I'm very
 
00:27:08.909 --> 00:27:08.919 align:start position:0%
involved in landlord tenant law um I'm
 
00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
often in the process of working out
 
00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
compromises and languages and helping
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
people to come to some win-win
 
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
situations and we I have a core team of
 
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:25.799 align:start position:0%
experienced investors and attorneys and
 
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
we'd be very happy to help you with this
 
00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:32.039 align:start position:0%
language and I would like to be offer
 
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
that um the concept I think is important
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
and needed to be able to quickly remove
 
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
illegal unauthorized you know people
 
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:46.360 align:start position:0%
that are illegally taking possession of
 
00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
a property the idea that it would have
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
to be written leases is extremely
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
Troublesome because many many people
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
have valid reasons to be at a property
 
00:27:59.389 --> 00:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
that it's not under a written Le
 
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
so um I can see that there's quite a
 
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
large number of issues with the way is
 
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:07.240 align:start position:0%
currently drafted um but I do believe
 
00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
it's something that would be needed to
 
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
be able to quickly remove illegal
 
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
squatters um so um that's basically it I
 
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
would I would love to be a resource to
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
you my I'll give you my phone number is
 
00:28:22.559 --> 00:28:24.950 align:start position:0%
you my I'll give you my phone number is
603

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
603
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
I'll give you my heart to remember email
 
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
yahoo.com and I would invite any
 
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr and I plan to be

here during your work session if you
 
00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:44.360 align:start position:0%
want to thank you any further are there
 
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:45.880 align:start position:0%

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
00:28:56.269 --> 00:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
Marson good
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
morning good morning I will try and keep
 
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
this brief also my name is Jessica
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
marison I'm a ten organizer with gsop
 
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
but I am here speaking on behalf of
 
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
myself today um the reason I oppose this
 
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
bill and think it's um a horrible
 
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
overreach is it passes and removes many
 
00:29:28.389 --> 00:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
due processes in the process of been
 
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
acting so when um the owner of a
 
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
property or law enforcement acting at
 
00:29:35.509 --> 00:29:35.519 align:start position:0%
the request of the owner May without
 
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:37.240 align:start position:0%
need for legal process immediately
 
00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
remove such person uh a lot of times I'm
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
helping tenants who were illegally
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
removed with a 548 to get back in their
 
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
apartment um this removes all due
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
process for a person to be able to stand
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
up and say this isn't right um the next
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
part of without due process is with no
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
advanced notice being required um guilty
 
00:30:01.389 --> 00:30:01.399 align:start position:0%
of a misdemeanor Criminal Trespass and
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
any property left occupied dwelling
 
00:30:06.669 --> 00:30:06.679 align:start position:0%
shall be deemed as abandoned um this is
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
already hard enough for many tenants
 
00:30:09.509 --> 00:30:09.519 align:start position:0%
trying to leave their property to get
 
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
stuff out within 7 days I can relate
 
00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
this to a personal um story though where
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
I was living at um for the past two
 
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
months I did not have a lease I did not
 
00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
have anything written in a contract um I
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
was quite desperate to get out of my car
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
and into a home so fast forward to about
 
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
a week and a half ago my person I was
 
00:30:33.149 --> 00:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
renting a room from decided they wanted
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
to do something different with that room
 
00:30:37.389 --> 00:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
they started picking up my stuff and
 
00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
trying to box it luckily the police were
 
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
called I had to keep tape recording out
 
00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
of safety and the cops reminded them
 
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:47.480 align:start position:0%
that there is a process for this and
 
00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
that I legally live there and they can't
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
go about doing
 
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:53.240 align:start position:0%
this so they thought they were in the
 
00:30:54.909 --> 00:30:54.919 align:start position:0%
right by doing this if we have a
 
00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
landlord that thinks they're in the
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
right you have an opportunity here where
 
00:31:00.629 --> 00:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
someone could be illegally removed from
 
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
their place and lose everything they
 
00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
have I at least have a little safety
 
00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:07.799 align:start position:0%
there of the seven days to go back and
 
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
luckily our Police
 
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:11.919 align:start position:0%
Department did know the rules to be able
 
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
to let them know and in my experience
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
not every police officer knows these
 
00:31:21.549 --> 00:31:21.559 align:start position:0%
laws um this was seems to be something
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
created to fix another problem and done
 
00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
horribly wrong um so I be be
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill and hope everyone does
 
00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
Kremer good
 
00:31:53.509 --> 00:31:53.519 align:start position:0%
morning good morning my name is Ben
 
00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
Kramer um I represent New Hampshire
 
00:31:58.909 --> 00:31:58.919 align:start position:0%
youth movement um I live in New Market
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
um my organization is a young people's
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
organization across the state we have
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
over a 100 dedicated members more than
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
5,000 supporters um all ages 15 to 30 in
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
the state and I'm here to testify on
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
behalf of young Granite Staters and as a
 
00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
young gr Stater myself um I oppose this
 
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
amendment we also oppose the underlying
 
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
bill I'll keep it brief knowing that
 
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
there are changes coming to this
 
00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:25.720 align:start position:0%
amendment and would caution you to uh
 
00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
apply what I'm about to say to any uh
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
propos proposed changes I think the
 
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
biggest concern with this amendment is
 
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:34.360 align:start position:0%
around due process and unintended
 
00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
consequences um both for this amendment
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
and that's a concern that I would apply
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
to any future changes as others have
 
00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:44.120 align:start position:0%
said and will say in this testimony um
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
many people in this state particularly
 
00:32:47.549 --> 00:32:47.559 align:start position:0%
young people living in their first
 
00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
apartment college students and their
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
their first time away from home don't
 
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
have access to written leases many
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
people don't have a written lease and
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
that's fine um and this this amendment
 
00:33:01.789 --> 00:33:01.799 align:start position:0%
would Place him in extremely precarious
 
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
position um I myself when I was in my
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
first apartment living on my own in
 
00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:07.720 align:start position:0%
college I did not have access to a
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
written lease easily didn't really know
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
how that works it's very concerning to
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
me to see legislation that would make
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
those people in a very precarious
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
situation to be removed without due
 
00:33:21.029 --> 00:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
process um to set the stakes here I
 
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
think it's important to to underline
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
that any law that makes tency more
 
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
precarious in this current housing
 
00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
crisis that we're in it will increase
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
homelessness and New Hampshire is
 
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
already the fastest rising rate of
 
00:33:39.629 --> 00:33:39.639 align:start position:0%
homelessness in the country last year
 
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
homelessness Rose 52% in the state and
 
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
that is the fastest rising rate of
 
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
homelessness in the country so I think
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
it's important to appreciate the stakes
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
here um and for this amendment that
 
00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
makes tendency extremely
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
precarious um and any future amendments
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
related to tendency I would ask you to
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
bear that in mind um we need to protect
 
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
due process for eviction we need to
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
require good cause for eviction and give
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
tenants their right to Due Process
 
00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
before they're removed from housing um
 
00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:12.839 align:start position:0%
and I would urge the committee to oppose
 
00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:15.399 align:start position:0%
this amendment um I would also imagine
 
00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
that I mean I'll read the amendment when
 
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
it is posted but um for the future
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
amendment I would bet that if it affects
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
the if it makes tendency more precarious
 
00:34:28.589 --> 00:34:28.599 align:start position:0%
I would oppose that too so thank you
 
00:34:28.599 --> 00:34:31.270 align:start position:0%
I would oppose that too so thank you
thank

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:34.069 --> 00:34:34.079 align:start position:0%
you representative Murphy thank you I
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
actually just have a question on the
 
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
chair yeah um since what
 
00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:39.399 align:start position:0%
we're pardon
 
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
me yeah um but my question is what we're
 
00:34:46.109 --> 00:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
talking about and what people are
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
testifying on is the amendment as
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
written and we've been told that there's
 
00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
going to be changes so will the people
 
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
that have come to testify have the
 
00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify to whatever the
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
final Amendment as proposed is because
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
we're they're limiting testimony based
 
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
on the fact that we assume there will be
 
00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
changes made so I just want to I want to
 
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
understand whether or not they'll have
 
00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:11.480 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for input once we really
 
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
actually have the amendment is proposed
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
yes perfect thank you you're
 
00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
Barry Mr Barry allow me to um tell you
 
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming back to join us
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
again today my pleasure thank you for
 
00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.109 align:start position:0%
again today my pleasure thank you for
having

00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:36.599 align:start position:0%
me for the for the record my name is
 
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
Elliott Barry I'm here as a private
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
citizen having retired from New
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance in
 
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
2023 uh after 47 years uh I think in 47
 
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
years it's fair to say that I've
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
represented more tenants than anybody in
 
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
the history of for better for worse uh
 
00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
than anybody in the history of the state
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:00.839 align:start position:0%
um I want to start out again by being
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
clear that I my testimony which is
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
strongly against the amendment as
 
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
written uh is not meant to uh impune
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
anybody's motives but there are plenty
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
of unintended consequences and before I
 
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
point them out though I'd like to say
 
00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
something um to make something very
 
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
clear this is all Arisen I believe in
 
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
the te in the uh context of a national
 
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
sudden National scandal about squatters
 
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
um based on on cases that allegedly
 
00:36:34.589 --> 00:36:34.599 align:start position:0%
happened in New York and happened in
 
00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
California where Apparently after 30 to
 
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
60 days of being somewhere you become
 
00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
you have some kind of right as a tenant
 
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
please understand in New Hampshire with
 
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
one exception the law does not recognize
 
00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
any squatter's rights what is that one
 
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
exception if you openly and notoriously
 
00:36:59.790 --> 00:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
occupy real estate for 20 years then you
 
00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
have rights to adverse possession that
 
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
is the totality of squatter's rights in
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
the state of New
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so the question though becomes
 
00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:11.560 align:start position:0%
then who is a squatter and that's a
 
00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:13.720 align:start position:0%
complicated question and one of the
 
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
things that I urge this committee to do
 
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
I believe we could work it out uh as
 
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
Nick Nick Norman suggested even you know
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
the landlords too recognize that
 
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:26.200 align:start position:0%
throwing people out of their homes
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
precipitously without without a lease
 
00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
and without without process is uh is bad
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
policy but um but understand
 
00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
that I can't see any basis for such a
 
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
somewhat complicated issue to be decided
 
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
upon on such short notice I mean
 
00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
whatever the problems we have with the
 
00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
current law have existed for at least
 
00:37:59.230 --> 00:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
the last 30 8
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
years so what is what's the emergency
 
00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:05.720 align:start position:0%
that is driving this so I would really
 
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
urge you to to hang on to either send it
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
to study or have somebody bring it back
 
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh next session but let me just
 
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
highlight a few of the problems that you
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
if if as you go through your work
 
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
session you can think about first and
 
00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:23.839 align:start position:0%
foremost by requiring a written
 
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
agreement as a requirement of ATT
 
00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.550 align:start position:0%
agreement as a requirement of ATT
tendency

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
tendency
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
it the bill totally eliminates the law
 
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
of implied contracts in the context of
 
00:38:36.309 --> 00:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant law there are two t
 
00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
kinds of implied contracts one is an
 
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
implied in fact contract which is based
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
on inferences drawn from the behavior of
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
the parties for example a girlfriend
 
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
moves in at the request of the of her
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
boyfriend who's a lawful tenant the
 
00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:54.200 align:start position:0%
landlord says okay if you pay me an
 
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
additional $50 there's nothing in
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
writing to uh about moving the uh the
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
girlfriend in um the tenant agrees they
 
00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
pay and after 6 months or so the there's
 
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and the quote lawful
 
00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:14.440 align:start position:0%
tenant moves out um and the girlfriend
 
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
is in the apartment she's been there
 
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:20.440 align:start position:0%
knowingly for for six months but under
 
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
but she doesn't have her written rental
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
agreement under the amendment or any
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
such requirement she's going to be
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
subjected to being forcibly
 
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:33.640 align:start position:0%
removed arrested charged with criminal
 
00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:36.520 align:start position:0%
trespass and and perhaps convicted
 
00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:39.640 align:start position:0%
without any notice
 
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
whatsoever I hate to but that's just
 
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
again I know it's not intended but
 
00:39:46.309 --> 00:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of situation that's
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
going to be opened up and this is also
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
true a lot of especially elderly tenants
 
00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
don't have Elites if and especially
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
those who are renting from
 
00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
nonprofessional landlords and if they po
 
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
the same problem was posed for them or a
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
college student who comes back after he
 
00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
graduates with no job and unfortunately
 
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's happening more and more in this
 
00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:09.640 align:start position:0%
in this Society uh parents moved to
 
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
Florida he was there knowingly for
 
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
months and months if not years uh
 
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
landlord gets unhappy Bingo he's gone
 
00:40:18.829 --> 00:40:18.839 align:start position:0%
because he didn't have a written
 
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
agreement that is not going to work and
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
especially when you pile this on with
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
arrest um for trespass impossible
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
conviction without any notice
 
00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
whatsoever regardless of the intent the
 
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
amendment would strip Untold number of
 
00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:37.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens of their
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
legitimate rights as tenants without any
 
00:40:43.349 --> 00:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity to ex to explain their claim
 
00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:45.640 align:start position:0%
of tenancy to a judge it would
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
precipitously throw throw them into the
 
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
most difficult housing market the state
 
00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:52.359 align:start position:0%
has ever seen and make them criminals
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
for per and for perfectly legitimate
 
00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
Behavior nothing in the current law TS a
 
00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
person who moves into a home or remains
 
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
there without permission of the owner or
 
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
a lawful tenant it's trespass pure and
 
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
simple under RSA 635 section
 
00:41:10.589 --> 00:41:10.599 align:start position:0%
2 notwithstanding the chatter in the
 
00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
media there's nothing happening in New
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that warrant dealing with this
 
00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
issue outside of the normal legislative
 
00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:19.400 align:start position:0%
process and that's what I urge you to do
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any questions so
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
Mr Barry I just um if you could you had
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
if a if a tenant says Hey can my can my
 
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
significant other come live with me and
 
00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:35.960 align:start position:0%
the landlord says sure $50 a month and
 
00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
it's a verbal
 
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
agreement if we could turn the table for
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
a minute and what happens what is the
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
process when the tenant stops paying the
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
$50 and the Tenant says well there's
 
00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
nothing in writing that says that I had
 
00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
to pay this
 
00:41:58.750 --> 00:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
$50 yes well then you have a a uh a
 
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
hearing in court to determine whether
 
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
the parties ever agreed to that my guess
 
00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
is in most cases they're going to be
 
00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
canceled checks or maybe I'm an oldtime
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
maybe Nobody Does that anymore but rent
 
00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
receipts and the judge will decide
 
00:42:12.109 --> 00:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
whether there was whether or not there
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
was an agreement and that's what you
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
know that's one of the things that's
 
00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
sorely missing here is the opportunity
 
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
for an alleged unauthorized tenant to
 
00:42:23.549 --> 00:42:23.559 align:start position:0%
establish that he or she is an
 
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:25.720 align:start position:0%
authorized tenant and could you just
 
00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
give us the the time frames for those
 
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
you know 30 days for this 20 days for
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
this sure the vast majority of evictions
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
are non-payment and they're going to be
 
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
so in your example you'd get a 7-Day
 
00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
eviction notice followed up by a court
 
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
process that's probably going to take
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
about 30 days from beginning to end um
 
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
for other cases if it were for
 
00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
unauthorized tenant which you can
 
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
certainly bring an eviction for in this
 
00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
state the eviction notice would provide
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
30 days prior notice and then a an
 
00:42:59.230 --> 00:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
additional court
 
00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
process so so the the seven days for
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
yeah for non-payment for damage or
 
00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
behavior which material adversely
 
00:43:10.549 --> 00:43:10.559 align:start position:0%
affects the health and safety of another
 
00:43:14.109 --> 00:43:14.119 align:start position:0%
tenant 30 days in all other cases okay
 
00:43:16.829 --> 00:43:16.839 align:start position:0%
so if if you could so my understanding
 
00:43:20.069 --> 00:43:20.079 align:start position:0%
is you have to notify the person of the
 
00:43:20.079 --> 00:43:22.950 align:start position:0%
is you have to notify the person of the
eviction

00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
eviction
 
00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
and so what once they receive the
 
00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:29.480 align:start position:0%
notification for the eviction do they is
 
00:43:31.549 --> 00:43:31.559 align:start position:0%
it 30 days that they have
 
00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
to yeah 30 days some will move out
 
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
within those 30 days some will wait
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
until the they are served after the 30
 
00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
days they'll be served with a Summons to
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
go to court called the landlord tenant
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
RIT and then they'll they'll fight it
 
00:43:48.549 --> 00:43:48.559 align:start position:0%
out in court as to whether they're that
 
00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
non-payment or the 30-day whether they
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
are in fact an unauthorized tenant okay
 
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
so 30 days and then they can go to court
 
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
yes and then they have to wait for their
 
00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
court date yeah which are
 
00:44:02.589 --> 00:44:02.599 align:start position:0%
pretty normally that court date is going
 
00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
about between I think 10 and 20 days
 
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
after the hearing I'm sorry after Ser
 
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
after service of process normally but
 
00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:17.190 align:start position:0%
after service of process normally but
somewh

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
somewh
 
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
longer okay so the reality is the the 7
 
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
Days the 30 days the 20 days is would
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
you say reasonably a 45 five 50
 
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:32.200 align:start position:0%
days if it's for a 30-day eviction as
 
00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:34.839 align:start position:0%
opposed to non-payment 7day um then yeah
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
I think that's probably right okay thank
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
you can I just add one thing certain if
 
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
I might your questions underscore that
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more going on here that
 
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
you're that you're being asked to deal
 
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:50.200 align:start position:0%
with than just what's covered in the
 
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:54.280 align:start position:0%
amendment and I think that uh I think
 
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
that just underscores the need for to
 
00:44:57.549 --> 00:44:57.559 align:start position:0%
have this done in the normal
 
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
deliberative process okay thank
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you um a question I have is
 
00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
I I noticed in the amendment that it
 
00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:13.880 align:start position:0%
authorizes police officers to use
 
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable force during the eviction
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
process itself um I know that uh
 
00:45:22.109 --> 00:45:22.119 align:start position:0%
currently this is a a civil matter where
 
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
sheriffs are used um that's absolutely
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
do you have I mean do you have any
 
00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
concerns about authorizing police
 
00:45:34.069 --> 00:45:34.079 align:start position:0%
officers to use any level of force in in
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
these matters I do I have and my only
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
parenthetical to that is I've never
 
00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
practiced any criminal law and I am I'm
 
00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
not um it's not my area of expertise but
 
00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:50.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
do followup could you elaborate on that
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
a little bit yeah I mean again if the
 
00:46:00.589 --> 00:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
people who are very experienced in in
 
00:46:02.589 --> 00:46:02.599 align:start position:0%
serving what they call rits of
 
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
possession the document that the
 
00:46:08.349 --> 00:46:08.359 align:start position:0%
landlord takes to actually remove uh the
 
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
tenant uh as you said those are sheriffs
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
and I don't I think that they're the
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
ones who are experienced enough to know
 
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
how to get it done in the maximally safe
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
way I think you know the Poli you bring
 
00:46:25.589 --> 00:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
the police into the process uh and I
 
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
think their orientation is is a lot
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
different and their experience is a lot
 
00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
different and I just think it it
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
heightens it heightens the tensions
 
00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:38.839 align:start position:0%
around a very tense uh event in the life
 
00:46:44.589 --> 00:46:44.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
sheriffs representative Newman I
 
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
apologize I meant to say representative
 
00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
Muse when I said your name earlier
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you madam
 
00:46:55.349 --> 00:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
chair so what would your ideal how would
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
you ideally remove
 
00:47:01.069 --> 00:47:01.079 align:start position:0%
um people who don't want to leave if you
 
00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:03.880 align:start position:0%
don't use sheriffs or law en oh no I'm
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
not it this happens let I I was checking
 
00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
this the other day um there were
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
actually about
 
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
3500 uh rits of possession issued where
 
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
the in the past year where the sheriff
 
00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
goes and and peaceably removes the
 
00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
tenant um It's a situation that happens
 
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
almost every day uh and I'm you know I
 
00:47:29.309 --> 00:47:29.319 align:start position:0%
think un unfortunately that's something
 
00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:31.720 align:start position:0%
that has to happen so I'm not opposed to
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
that this issue of how much force ought
 
00:47:38.109 --> 00:47:38.119 align:start position:0%
to be used uh and who's the best to uh
 
00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
to figure out a way to remove those
 
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
tenants I think that's a more
 
00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:45.109 align:start position:0%
tenants I think that's a more
complicated

00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
question Mr Barry I just have one more
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
question what is
 
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
the what are the the
 
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
months my understanding is I'm not sure
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
if it's just the winter months if it's
 
00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
like October through April ail November
 
00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
through April that a a person is not
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
allowed to be evicted in New Hampshire
 
00:48:03.549 --> 00:48:03.559 align:start position:0%
for the winter if I can just tell you a
 
00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
very brief anecdote uh after about five
 
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
years of practice uh where tenant where
 
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
people especially um mothers with
 
00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
children would come into my office and
 
00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:16.280 align:start position:0%
they'd say I got this eviction notice
 
00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:17.720 align:start position:0%
but I can't be evicted because it's
 
00:48:20.589 --> 00:48:20.599 align:start position:0%
winter time and finally I heard it so
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
often that I worked with a sponsor of to
 
00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
get a sponsor for a bill to say you
 
00:48:26.829 --> 00:48:26.839 align:start position:0%
can't evict somebody in the winter time
 
00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
it is not now and never has been the law
 
00:48:32.109 --> 00:48:32.119 align:start position:0%
evictions go through every month of the
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
year okay thank you representative
 
00:48:38.109 --> 00:48:38.119 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:39.880 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question could you
 
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
just briefly talk about the part of
 
00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:44.559 align:start position:0%
five4 40 that's being amended now that
 
00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:46.839 align:start position:0%
talks about evictions in 7 days and 30
 
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
days notice just kind of to help us
 
00:48:52.829 --> 00:48:52.839 align:start position:0%
understand when there's a dispute and
 
00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:55.640 align:start position:0%
the money is not paid sure and then
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
something happens in that what point in
 
00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
that process would it come to the point
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
where a force a a rid of possession
 
00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
would be used to get them out of the
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
property sure so all EV all lawful
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
evictions start with the issuance by the
 
00:49:14.829 --> 00:49:14.839 align:start position:0%
landlord of something called an eviction
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
notice used to be called a notice to
 
00:49:19.309 --> 00:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
quit that it's going to be other seven
 
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
days gives a 10 it says you have be have
 
00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:24.559 align:start position:0%
to vacate the premises by either seven
 
00:49:27.549 --> 00:49:27.559 align:start position:0%
days from service or 30 days it's seven
 
00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
days if it's non-payment of rent damage
 
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
or behavior which materially affects the
 
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
health and safety of another tenant or
 
00:49:36.589 --> 00:49:36.599 align:start position:0%
the landlord those are seven days
 
00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
everything else is 30 days if the tenant
 
00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
remains in the premises after after the
 
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
date on the eviction notice says they
 
00:49:46.349 --> 00:49:46.359 align:start position:0%
have to vacate by then the landlord
 
00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
serves what they call a landlord tenant
 
00:49:51.309 --> 00:49:51.319 align:start position:0%
RIT which is a summons to go to court
 
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
the tenant usually has seven days from
 
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
the state of service to file an
 
00:49:58.270 --> 00:49:58.280 align:start position:0%
appearance which is the equivalent of
 
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
asking for a hearing the hearing will
 
00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
usually be set 10 to 15 days uh
 
00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes less minimum of seven
 
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes up to 15 days later uh and
 
00:50:11.549 --> 00:50:11.559 align:start position:0%
then after the hearing if the landlord
 
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
prevails the landlord um there a what
 
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
they call a rid of possession will issue
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh on the eth day following the hearing
 
00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
and then the sheriff serves that rid of
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
possession and the Tenant is hopefully
 
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
not on the street but all too many times
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
in these days they
 
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.390 align:start position:0%
in these days they
are

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
followup and if uh the bill was written
 
00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
substantially to have that or as written
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
right now takes all of that due process
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
away is that correct for tenants who
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
don't have written um leases or rental
 
00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:50.200 align:start position:0%
agreements of which there are many thank
 
00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much Mr Barry thank
 
00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
welcome back thank you so much uh and
 
00:51:10.109 --> 00:51:10.119 align:start position:0%
thank you uh to all the committee for
 
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony today my name is
 
00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
Grace K I'm the program coordinator with
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
the American friends service committee
 
00:51:17.789 --> 00:51:17.799 align:start position:0%
um and a longtime New Hampshire resident
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh living in Manchester um so I'll keep
 
00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
my my comments brief I think there have
 
00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:23.720 align:start position:0%
been far more expert Witnesses who have
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
come before to testify um but I'll
 
00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:29.480 align:start position:0%
simply say that um that I I understand
 
00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
that the amendment will be changed and
 
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm really speaking to more the
 
00:51:34.789 --> 00:51:34.799 align:start position:0%
spirit and the intent of this bill and
 
00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:36.280 align:start position:0%
to really urge the committee to take
 
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
into consideration um the vulnerability
 
00:51:40.789 --> 00:51:40.799 align:start position:0%
of the populations who will be affected
 
00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:43.640 align:start position:0%
by a bill an amendment such as this um
 
00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
and I absolutely um um underscore the
 
00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
the comments that um the gentleman
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
before me spoke of of the importance of
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
recognizing that this is a very complex
 
00:51:55.069 --> 00:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
issue and giving it the care and I know
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
that this committee as is so often does
 
00:51:59.230 --> 00:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
will give it that care and attention um
 
00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
that is needed to unders underscore the
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
complexity and so I just wanted to talk
 
00:52:06.349 --> 00:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
about just very briefly the importance
 
00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
of balancing intent over impact and
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
recognizing what is the problem that is
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
trying to be solved by this bill um I
 
00:52:15.309 --> 00:52:15.319 align:start position:0%
have the privilege of being a homeowner
 
00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
um but I've been a long I was a longtime
 
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
tenant and renter for the majority of my
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
life living up here in New Hampshire as
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
well as when I was living in Boston I've
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
had um I've unfortunately had the
 
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
experience both as a child um and as an
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
adult to undergo eviction processes to
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
witness eviction processes which are
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
very difficult and painful experiences
 
00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
for anyone who's ever has ever gone
 
00:52:39.309 --> 00:52:39.319 align:start position:0%
through that themselves or has witnessed
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
it and so again thinking about um the
 
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
impact that this bill will have on
 
00:52:45.549 --> 00:52:45.559 align:start position:0%
already vulnerable people as we're
 
00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
talking about people who are you know in
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
situations where they are living without
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
a formal lease um whether that be family
 
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
members um whether that be partners
 
00:52:55.470 --> 00:52:55.480 align:start position:0%
whether that be and especially
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
particularly think about um within my
 
00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
own community bipac community immigrant
 
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
bipo Community here in New Hampshire
 
00:53:06.109 --> 00:53:06.119 align:start position:0%
where because of our housing um a lack
 
00:53:08.349 --> 00:53:08.359 align:start position:0%
of affordable housing we do have people
 
00:53:10.829 --> 00:53:10.839 align:start position:0%
living multiple people more people
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
living in a home um than their our
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
bedroom simply because that's what
 
00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
people have to do in order to ensure
 
00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
that you know they can they can survive
 
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
that they have a place that they can put
 
00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
their head down that is safe and free uh
 
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
from the elements and so I just really
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to really take into
 
00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
consideration again like what is the
 
00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:31.160 align:start position:0%
intent you know the intent of this bill
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
what is the impact that will have on our
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents that this this
 
00:53:38.589 --> 00:53:38.599 align:start position:0%
committee is tasked with safety
 
00:53:41.069 --> 00:53:41.079 align:start position:0%
Community safety within our state and
 
00:53:44.349 --> 00:53:44.359 align:start position:0%
does it make us more safe is it just to
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
put forward an amendment that would um
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
needlessly harm and burden tenants who
 
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
are in situations that are already
 
00:53:55.109 --> 00:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
vulnerable is it the committee's goal to
 
00:53:57.549 --> 00:53:57.559 align:start position:0%
make life harder for already vulnerable
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
populations or is it the committee's
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
goal to ensure that those vulnerable
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
populations are protected while also
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
balancing the interest of our landlord
 
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
Community as well as our other um and
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
other interests in that and so I just
 
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to just really come up here and
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
really urge the committee to think to
 
00:54:15.789 --> 00:54:15.799 align:start position:0%
really take into consideration
 
00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
especially considering what bill this
 
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
particular amendment is attached to and
 
00:54:22.789 --> 00:54:22.799 align:start position:0%
that there are better ways for us to
 
00:54:25.789 --> 00:54:25.799 align:start position:0%
approach the needs of um balancing
 
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
different interest ensuring that um we
 
00:54:30.349 --> 00:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
are securing housing that we are
 
00:54:32.789 --> 00:54:32.799 align:start position:0%
creating safe communities but targeting
 
00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:35.480 align:start position:0%
already vulnerable populations who will
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
undergo already um difficult processes
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
in creating uh uh process in such a way
 
00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
that their own rights are not protected
 
00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
that we are deputizing landlords to
 
00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:49.160 align:start position:0%
remove tenants that we are sort of
 
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
putting a vulnerable class of people
 
00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
sort of outside the law um I think is is
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
is very alarming and so I look forward
 
00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
to seeing the uh new language for this
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
bill I look forward to representative
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
RADS um introducing that and I look
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
forward to being able to uh uh testify
 
00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:08.680 align:start position:0%
on that as well but again and the
 
00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
crafting of this I really strongly urge
 
00:55:12.549 --> 00:55:12.559 align:start position:0%
you to take into consideration that
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
Public Safety means Public Safety for
 
00:55:16.349 --> 00:55:16.359 align:start position:0%
all thank
 
00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:18.440 align:start position:0%
you and I'm happy to take questions if
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:21.640 align:start position:0%
any I don't see any thank you very much
 
00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:24.470 align:start position:0%
any I don't see any thank you very much
thank

00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm represent Timothy Horgan
 
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
and actually came in today for bills
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
down the hall on education but hopefully
 
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
I can add something to debate I'm I
 
00:55:49.109 --> 00:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
usually sit on the house Judiciary
 
00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
Committee which usually gets uh bills
 
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
about evictions and we get them every
 
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
year um and the so there's always a uh
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
we always get bills to make eviction uh
 
00:56:03.029 --> 00:56:03.039 align:start position:0%
easier and that's not necessarily a good
 
00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
thing this goes way farther than
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
anything else that's ever been submitted
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
so like if um you know if the sponsor
 
00:56:13.549 --> 00:56:13.559 align:start position:0%
the sponsor thinks is a good idea they
 
00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:15.880 align:start position:0%
probably be better off waiting till the
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
next filing period And if the re-elected
 
00:56:19.589 --> 00:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
they can bring it back in 2025 believe
 
00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
me we've seen lots of bills about this
 
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
about this before I know um I do know
 
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
like at least one or two of my
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
constituents I'm Timothy Horan from
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
Durham um so but one to 20 people are
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
worried about it um and they say there
 
00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
scores of stories which show why this
 
00:56:38.589 --> 00:56:38.599 align:start position:0%
bill is needed um I have not heard any
 
00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
of those scores of stories if if you
 
00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
wait till next year submit it we'll have
 
00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
like the usual process would take
 
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
several months and perhaps we can hear
 
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
and evaluate those scores of stories so
 
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
right now I I see nothing that says this
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
pill is needed it goes like very far
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
especially we get law enforcement
 
00:56:58.029 --> 00:56:58.039 align:start position:0%
involved you know before there's any
 
00:56:59.829 --> 00:56:59.839 align:start position:0%
proof like whose property it is or
 
00:57:02.190 --> 00:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
whether you know whether they actually
 
00:57:04.589 --> 00:57:04.599 align:start position:0%
even deserve to be evicted especially
 
00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
the part about taking people's property
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
and letting the owner dispose of it as a
 
00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:11.720 align:start position:0%
see fit that's uh that's like a very
 
00:57:13.829 --> 00:57:13.839 align:start position:0%
extreme measure and I might also add
 
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
since this is in criminal justice and I
 
00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:17.480 align:start position:0%
know there's several Second Amendment
 
00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
very second amendment stall wordss in
 
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
here there's no carve out in here for
 
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
firearms that the that are abandoned um
 
00:57:29.029 --> 00:57:29.039 align:start position:0%
so there's uh that's probably a reason
 
00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
of right there to either that's
 
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
something maybe you might try to amend
 
00:57:34.029 --> 00:57:34.039 align:start position:0%
that bill to put in a car off for
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
firearms but I think that's probably a
 
00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
reason enough right there for many
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
people on this committee to vote no on
 
00:57:41.069 --> 00:57:41.079 align:start position:0%
this amendment you know people's guns
 
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:43.400 align:start position:0%
can be taken away and all their other
 
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
property but I know at least in some
 
00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
people's minds guns are special you know
 
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
there's even more valuable than other
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
properties so I would just
 
00:57:53.349 --> 00:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
say I say this amendment is premature if
 
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
you think it's a good idea I say wait
 
00:57:56.829 --> 00:57:56.839 align:start position:0%
till next year um the Judiciary
 
00:57:58.510 --> 00:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
Committee can deal with them as we deal
 
00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:00.200 align:start position:0%
with these bills every year and I'm also
 
00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
like not particularly enthusiastic about
 
00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:05.720 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill either but um that's
 
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
a matter for another day and most of
 
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
these squatters we're supposed to be
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
worried about are not going to be
 
00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily undocumented immigrants
 
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
anyway most uh most tenants are citizens
 
00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
or uh you know green card holders but so
 
00:58:20.829 --> 00:58:20.839 align:start position:0%
that's that's basically why I think this
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
a was a terrible idea so I urge you to
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh urge you to kill it so I'd be happy
 
00:58:28.589 --> 00:58:28.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you yes so if I'm back
 
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
in judiciary next year if I get
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
reelected I'm I'm sure I'll see more
 
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
eviction bills so thanks thank you
 
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
representative I would like the public
 
00:58:38.589 --> 00:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
to know that the sponsor of the
 
00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
amendment is not the one that makes the
 
00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:42.200 align:start position:0%
decision of where the bills are heard
 
00:58:44.109 --> 00:58:44.119 align:start position:0%
whether it's criminal justice or
 
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
Judiciary is there anybody that wishes
 
00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
to testify on the amendment that has not
 
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
turned in a pain card seeing none I will
 
00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
close the public
 
00:58:56.589 --> 00:58:56.599 align:start position:0%

okay we're going to start our work
 
01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
session on the underlying bill with
 
01:16:22.350 --> 01:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
regards to the amendment we were just
 
01:16:24.270 --> 01:16:24.280 align:start position:0%
talking about um that amendment is going
 
01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
to actually go away and a new Amendment
 
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
will be drafted for a non gerain for
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
another bill and then we'll have another
 
01:16:34.149 --> 01:16:34.159 align:start position:0%
public hearing on it next week um so
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
here the amendment the non-gain
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
amendment that we just heard um is going
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
to um we're going to we're going to get
 
01:16:49.629 --> 01:16:49.639 align:start position:0%
rid of that and there'll be a new
 
01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
non-gain Amendment attached to a new
 
01:16:53.950 --> 01:16:53.960 align:start position:0%
bill that will hear next week so it'll
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
be like a doover
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
so the bill that we just heard we're
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
going to we're going to throw it out
 
01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
bill yeah 563 is still going forward
 
01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
though um so we're going to be talking
 
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
now the am the bill
 
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
itself that's a work session for the
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:27.870 --> 01:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
it said both okay
 
01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
qu I thought it did question for the
 
01:17:33.629 --> 01:17:33.639 align:start position:0%
chair yes sir could you so what you just
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
said and you said it pretty fast we we
 
01:17:38.590 --> 01:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
will have a non-gain Amendment and it
 
01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
will not be associated with this bill be
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
associated with another bill that is
 
01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
correct thank you very much and we'll
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
take that up next week that's fine thank
 
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
you and it will be properly noticed I
 
01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate that is correct but it' be a
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
n for 563 no 563 is now we're going to
 
01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
just deal with 56 de with as the bill as
 
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
introduced yeah I'm cutting cutting that
 
01:18:04.189 --> 01:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
loose everybody understand
 
01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
okay I would think
 
01:18:09.870 --> 01:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
so all right just as a generality on the
 
01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
on the underlying bill I think we're all
 
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
in agreement that it is um very very
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
very very broad um um there there pieces
 
01:18:21.149 --> 01:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
of that bill I understand what the they
 
01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
were going for um but this thing about
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
um using
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
does anyone have a copy of 563 yeah
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
could I could I see your copy okay I got
 
01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:31.790 align:start position:0%
could I could I see your copy okay I got
it

01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
thanks um with
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
particularly the part that I found very
 
01:18:40.189 --> 01:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
Troublesome that said law enforcement
 
01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
agency shall use its best efforts to
 
01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
support the enforcement of federal
 
01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
immigration law I found that extremely
 
01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
disturbing um it's broad it does what
 
01:18:55.470 --> 01:18:55.480 align:start position:0%
what does that even mean um
 
01:18:56.629 --> 01:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
we we've
 
01:18:59.870 --> 01:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
repeatedly said that we want to limit
 
01:19:02.830 --> 01:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
Federal involvement in our in or our low
 
01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
enforcements um interactions as far as
 
01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
enforcing federal law so I feel like
 
01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is very um over Brad in that
 
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
respect so does everyone pretty much
 
01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
agree with that that that section is
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
problematic anyone else want to discuss
 
01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:23.560 align:start position:0%
that no you guys are okay with
 
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
it okay
 
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.510 align:start position:0%
it okay
either

01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
01:19:40.510 --> 01:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
so I think that in the effort of of
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to look the rest of it just
 
01:19:45.229 --> 01:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
seems to be more um more to do with
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
definitions than anything what I'm I'm
 
01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
proposing that the only thing that we
 
01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
should be doing is
 
01:19:55.470 --> 01:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
prohibiting um
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
prohibiting law enforcement from being
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
allowed to cooperate with regard to
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
detainers in other words I don't want
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
law enforcement asking anyone their
 
01:20:07.950 --> 01:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
citizenship status or any of that stuff
 
01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
if someone's arrested for a New
 
01:20:11.470 --> 01:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire crime and they're booked
 
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
during the process of the booking for a
 
01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
violation of the Hampshire law it
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
becomes evident that there's an ice
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
detainer I think our law enforcement
 
01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
should honor that detainer but as far as
 
01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
inquiries about someone's citizenship
 
01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
before their there for another reason uh
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
that goes way too far as far as I'm
 
01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
concerned and um that goes for this
 
01:20:34.669 --> 01:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
thing about um shall use best efforts I
 
01:20:37.390 --> 01:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
feel like that's overly broad further
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
scitec it sounds like you're proposing a
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
one- sentence
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh pretty close to it I would
 
01:20:48.159 --> 01:20:50.950 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh pretty close to it I would
think

01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:54.990 --> 01:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
yeah further discussion
 
01:20:56.910 --> 01:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
represent Manion thank you just throwing
 
01:20:59.390 --> 01:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
this out there so if you uh have
 
01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
occasion to run across somebody for
 
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
traffic violation you don't arrest them
 
01:21:05.149 --> 01:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
however you run their name and a
 
01:21:08.189 --> 01:21:08.199 align:start position:0%
detainer pops up are we prohibiting law
 
01:21:10.669 --> 01:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement from acting on that detainer
 
01:21:11.669 --> 01:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
even though the person isn't under
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
arrest or any New Hampshire offenses it
 
01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
depends there's several kind of
 
01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
detainers in my understanding there's
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
criminal detainers and civil detainers
 
01:21:19.629 --> 01:21:19.639 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:21:22.229 --> 01:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
correct I'm not sure yeah I think we
 
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
would need to find that out if it's if
 
01:21:26.189 --> 01:21:26.199 align:start position:0%
it's if it's a warrant then I would say
 
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
no they have to a warrant but if it's if
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
you have them in custody any anyway
 
01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
could you please notify us type of thing
 
01:21:34.229 --> 01:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
that's different I don't think that we
 
01:21:37.149 --> 01:21:37.159 align:start position:0%
would be arresting on detainers um
 
01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
because they're not a criminal it's not
 
01:21:40.990 --> 01:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
a necessarily a criminal warrant so if
 
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
there's a criminal warrant then yes if
 
01:21:46.189 --> 01:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
there's a ice detainer I think they can
 
01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
notify ice that they've been in contact
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
with that person but they can't take
 
01:21:52.229 --> 01:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
them into custody based on a
 
01:21:54.669 --> 01:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
detainer but I I am going to ask that to
 
01:21:56.229 --> 01:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
make sure but I believe that is the
 
01:21:57.550 --> 01:21:57.560 align:start position:0%
state of the
 
01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:06.270 --> 01:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
Muse yeah I'm I'm not sure that uh that
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
fixing that one particular area actually
 
01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh fixes this legislation um one of the
 
01:22:21.149 --> 01:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
other things that this particular uh
 
01:22:25.870 --> 01:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
this particular Bill does is it uh it it
 
01:22:29.629 --> 01:22:29.639 align:start position:0%
essentially functions as a uh as an
 
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate on local Law
 
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers um
 
01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
and unless we remove things like all of
 
01:22:44.350 --> 01:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
section uh basically the the things that
 
01:22:48.629 --> 01:22:48.639 align:start position:0%
are uh listed in section six of the bill
 
01:22:51.870 --> 01:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
so uh forcing local law enforcement to
 
01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
comply with an immigration retainer uh
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
complying with a request from a federal
 
01:22:58.750 --> 01:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
immigration agency to notify the agency
 
01:23:01.390 --> 01:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
providing uh Federal immigration agency
 
01:23:03.390 --> 01:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
access to inmates for interviews
 
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
participating in any program or
 
01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
agreement authorized under Section 287
 
01:23:10.189 --> 01:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
of the immigration and nationality act
 
01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
whatever that is um there's just a lot
 
01:23:17.070 --> 01:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
of stuff here in in this particular Bill
 
01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh and a lot of things that our police
 
01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
officers I I don't believe are are
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
trained for uh at this St Point um and I
 
01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
think similar to the issue that was
 
01:23:33.390 --> 01:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
raised on the um uh on on the on the
 
01:23:37.070 --> 01:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
squatter Bill once again we have uh you
 
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
know New Hampshire police officers and
 
01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
Law Enforcement Officers sort of thrust
 
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
into situations uh that they don't have
 
01:23:47.149 --> 01:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
experience with and that they're not
 
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
trained for um and that creates
 
01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
situations where we could have a lot of
 
01:23:55.229 --> 01:23:55.239 align:start position:0%
unintended consequen
 
01:23:58.030 --> 01:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
quences um I think the other thing
 
01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
that's worth noting in the context of
 
01:24:03.149 --> 01:24:03.159 align:start position:0%
this particular bill is um you know we
 
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
are not Texas we're not Arizona we are
 
01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
not uh a border state um and the need uh
 
01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
for this I I think one of the things we
 
01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
always have to ask ourselves as a
 
01:24:17.189 --> 01:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
legislators is whether or not there's
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
actually a need for a particular Bill
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
what's what's the problem uh that we're
 
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to solve and I think
 
01:24:27.149 --> 01:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
the problem that we're trying to solve
 
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
with this particular bill um is that Fox
 
01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
News has non-stop 247 coverage of the
 
01:24:37.709 --> 01:24:37.719 align:start position:0%
Southern border crisis and that we would
 
01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
kind of like to have our own little
 
01:24:42.030 --> 01:24:42.040 align:start position:0%
piece of it here in New Hampshire uh and
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I just think that it
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
creates uh a lot of additional problems
 
01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh that we're not prepared to solve at
 
01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:49.629 align:start position:0%
uh that we're not prepared to solve at
this

01:24:49.629 --> 01:24:49.639 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
point well I would say I watched this
 
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
morning and they weren't covering the
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
Border crisis they were covering the um
 
01:24:59.109 --> 01:24:59.119 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional persecution of
 
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
President Trump for a little while um
 
01:25:02.590 --> 01:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
but that being
 
01:25:06.030 --> 01:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
said we have a southern border with a
 
01:25:08.430 --> 01:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
state that advertised itself as a as a
 
01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
sanctuary State and they have actually
 
01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
screamed out for help because they've
 
01:25:16.350 --> 01:25:16.360 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed themselves with their number
 
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
of unduped immigrants so um we are
 
01:25:22.270 --> 01:25:22.280 align:start position:0%
beginning to see an influx into our
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
state and we are a border state State we
 
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
actually border Canada um so I don't
 
01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
know what the Southern versus northern
 
01:25:30.229 --> 01:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
border has to do with it but it's a
 
01:25:33.070 --> 01:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
border but I feel like if we limit this
 
01:25:35.470 --> 01:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
down to things that are already being
 
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
done I'm quite sure we do have training
 
01:25:39.550 --> 01:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
in complying with an immigration
 
01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
detainer um that's not a unfunded
 
01:25:45.229 --> 01:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
mandate um complying with requests for
 
01:25:47.070 --> 01:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
to notify them that's a phone call
 
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's not unfunded mandate providing uh
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
Federal immigration access to interview
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
an inmate also no cost there and
 
01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
participating in any program or
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
agreement authorized by federal law um
 
01:26:00.629 --> 01:26:00.639 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what that means in all
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
honesty so I am going to look it up I
 
01:26:04.149 --> 01:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't advocate for that until I know
 
01:26:06.390 --> 01:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
what it means and providing fidal
 
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
immigration agency with inmates
 
01:26:10.149 --> 01:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
incarceration status or release date
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
also no cost to let them know when the
 
01:26:14.430 --> 01:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
person's expected to be released
 
01:26:17.310 --> 01:26:17.320 align:start position:0%
representative Manion thank you Mr chair
 
01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
yeah on that note as far as unfunded
 
01:26:21.550 --> 01:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
mandates uh we hold people on war inside
 
01:26:23.950 --> 01:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts New York California all
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
the time
 
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
and there's no extra funding to hold
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
that person ice detainer is no different
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
you're holding somebody for another
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
agency whether it's 24 hours or 48 Hours
 
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
um I've heard a lot today about the lack
 
01:26:38.590 --> 01:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
of training our local police have and
 
01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
that only sheriffs know how to evict
 
01:26:42.109 --> 01:26:42.119 align:start position:0%
people from property and only the
 
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
federal government knows how to deal
 
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
with ice detainers that's incorrect we
 
01:26:46.750 --> 01:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
go to the same Police Academy as the
 
01:26:48.510 --> 01:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
sheriff's we have the same training
 
01:26:50.109 --> 01:26:50.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes more training there's training
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
on Ice detainers there's training on
 
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
federal law there's training on local
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
law and state law uh and evictions as
 
01:26:57.310 --> 01:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
well criminal trespass is Criminal
 
01:26:58.830 --> 01:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
Trespass whether it's a sheriff
 
01:27:00.510 --> 01:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
enforcing it or a local police enforcing
 
01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
it so um as far as training goes the
 
01:27:05.910 --> 01:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
training is there just to dispel
 
01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
anyone's uh suspicion of otherwise but
 
01:27:10.510 --> 01:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
it is also not a unfunded mandate the
 
01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
money's there it's already being done in
 
01:27:15.629 --> 01:27:15.639 align:start position:0%
your experience um have you held ice
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
detainers have you had any interaction
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
when your experience with ice as far as
 
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
them coming to talk to people or
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
anything like
 
01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
that I have not personally but my agency
 
01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
has and um like I said it's within 204
 
01:27:30.030 --> 01:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
to 48 hours and outside of that they'll
 
01:27:31.390 --> 01:27:31.400 align:start position:0%
they'll be released if they don't pick
 
01:27:33.229 --> 01:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
them up but it's no different than if
 
01:27:35.590 --> 01:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has a warrant for somebody
 
01:27:37.870 --> 01:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
and uh we we hold them for them and they
 
01:27:41.669 --> 01:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
scenario the role we would play is just
 
01:27:46.109 --> 01:27:46.119 align:start position:0%
notifying them that we have someone in
 
01:27:50.430 --> 01:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
custody for another crime um so again I
 
01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
don't see how this is um this is would
 
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
cost anymore um all it's doing is
 
01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
complying with federal law and and
 
01:28:00.750 --> 01:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
assisting the our federal Partners um
 
01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
without inconveniencing the hampsher
 
01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
citizens because we're not going to be
 
01:28:05.149 --> 01:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
asking them any of these things unless
 
01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
they've been arrested front of the crime
 
01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:28:12.109 --> 01:28:12.119 align:start position:0%
representative oh oh
 
01:28:14.109 --> 01:28:14.119 align:start position:0%
Linda go
 
01:28:17.109 --> 01:28:17.119 align:start position:0%
ahead uh I have had several uh ice
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
detainers and it's a simple phone call
 
01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
they'll either say let them go or hold
 
01:28:23.149 --> 01:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
them uh one of my cases was a hondur
 
01:28:25.149 --> 01:28:25.159 align:start position:0%
national big time drug cartel dealer you
 
01:28:27.229 --> 01:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
could not even tell he was super nice I
 
01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
ran them they said we'll be down in
 
01:28:31.109 --> 01:28:31.119 align:start position:0%
about 5 minutes they came from uh the
 
01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
conquered office they'll also come down
 
01:28:34.830 --> 01:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
from Vermont that's all it is is a phone
 
01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
call and they say yeah yay or nay and
 
01:28:38.229 --> 01:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
that's it there's no sort of unfunded
 
01:28:38.239 --> 01:28:40.189 align:start position:0%
that's it there's no sort of unfunded
mandate

01:28:40.189 --> 01:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
01:28:43.390 --> 01:28:43.400 align:start position:0%
whatsoever is there any time limit as
 
01:28:44.910 --> 01:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
far as how long they can take to come
 
01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:46.430 align:start position:0%
far as how long they can take to come
get

01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
him that would be a court issue uh it's
 
01:28:52.590 --> 01:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
that reasonableness how long to detain
 
01:28:55.149 --> 01:28:55.159 align:start position:0%
someone roadside is kind of the call of
 
01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
myself or the ice agent they were always
 
01:28:58.669 --> 01:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
there very quickly so I can't speak on
 
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
the actual time limit for that so that's
 
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
a roadside stop where they came up as a
 
01:29:06.109 --> 01:29:06.119 align:start position:0%
detainer and you called from the side of
 
01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
the road and they asked yes it was for
 
01:29:10.189 --> 01:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
like a speeding violation I ran the guy
 
01:29:12.189 --> 01:29:12.199 align:start position:0%
he gave me his his information and it
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
popped up on the screen immigration
 
01:29:16.669 --> 01:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement hit call this number I would
 
01:29:20.990 --> 01:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
call and either a y or a and that was it
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
okay um representative herck gather
 
01:29:25.950 --> 01:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:29.669 --> 01:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair for taking my question but
 
01:29:32.350 --> 01:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about this bill and
 
01:29:34.629 --> 01:29:34.639 align:start position:0%
particularly the original bill because
 
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
we heard so much testimony even from our
 
01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:38.189 align:start position:0%
we heard so much testimony even from our
police

01:29:38.189 --> 01:29:38.199 align:start position:0%
police
 
01:29:40.990 --> 01:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
department and I I struggle with that
 
01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
because um we've counted on them in so
 
01:29:46.910 --> 01:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
many aspects of the law and how we treat
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
people and those types of things and um
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%
when they say to us that right now today
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
if someone is um have committed a
 
01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
crime you know they get the regular
 
01:30:02.669 --> 01:30:02.679 align:start position:0%
treatment like anyone else it doesn't
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
matter so if that's the case why are we
 
01:30:08.669 --> 01:30:08.679 align:start position:0%
still doing this with this bill so again
 
01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
this bill just seems like it's trying to
 
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
solve a problem that really doesn't
 
01:30:14.750 --> 01:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
exist here for
 
01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
us we've had many um the border control
 
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
we've had the come before us over the
 
01:30:23.790 --> 01:30:23.800 align:start position:0%
last couple months for different reasons
 
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
and and no one has ever said there was a
 
01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
problem not
 
01:30:30.030 --> 01:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
one not even a law enforcement that was
 
01:30:32.669 --> 01:30:32.679 align:start position:0%
in that area near the
 
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
borders with all the bills that we have
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
heard this year so I guess for me I'm
 
01:30:41.189 --> 01:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
really struggling with this bill the
 
01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
fact that it's even
 
01:30:46.270 --> 01:30:46.280 align:start position:0%
here didn't we hear correct me if I'm
 
01:30:47.950 --> 01:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
wrong I believe we heard there was a
 
01:30:49.990 --> 01:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
mass murderer that was hiding right in
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
our was that is that did we yeah yeah in
 
01:30:55.270 --> 01:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
Ry so that's that's new hampsh sry I
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
think that's a problem um yeah but
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
there's teally the V and all those
 
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
people hiding too who it depend on what
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
you look like come on I don't think mass
 
01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
murder is um anything to do with race at
 
01:31:10.629 --> 01:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
all that was one case of a mass murderer
 
01:31:13.270 --> 01:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
how many mass murderers do we need
 
01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:14.950 align:start position:0%
how many mass murderers do we need
represent

01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
say thank you um just a point of
 
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
clarification so it feels to me like
 
01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
we're having an executive session
 
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
talking about the mer and I'm just
 
01:31:24.910 --> 01:31:24.920 align:start position:0%
trying to clarify what are purposes in a
 
01:31:26.709 --> 01:31:26.719 align:start position:0%
work session in terms of what are we
 
01:31:29.109 --> 01:31:29.119 align:start position:0%
hoping to get out of this time today
 
01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
just because I'm I couldn't fully hear
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
what you're saying at the beginning it I
 
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
don't know it was the audit the rumor
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
myself but I'm just trying to figure out
 
01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
our is our goal that we're trying to see
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
if we can find an amendment to this bill
 
01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
we can all agree on or are we just
 
01:31:44.430 --> 01:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
debating the merits of the
 
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
bill I think both of those two things um
 
01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
a work session is so that the committee
 
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
can come together and look at it and say
 
01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
is there anything in this bill um that
 
01:31:55.669 --> 01:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
we could make better that that would
 
01:31:59.350 --> 01:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
make it um serve a purpose that would be
 
01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
justifiable um okay and and INF further
 
01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
the public safety may I thank you so
 
01:32:10.510 --> 01:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
much so I have to say I I have objection
 
01:32:12.910 --> 01:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
to the underlying premise of the bill
 
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
that that we have all of these
 
01:32:17.390 --> 01:32:17.400 align:start position:0%
challenges and part of the reason for
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
that is you know I have relatives who
 
01:32:23.229 --> 01:32:23.239 align:start position:0%
attempted to come over here in the 1920s
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
and 30s
 
01:32:26.270 --> 01:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
and their boats were turned away because
 
01:32:31.109 --> 01:32:31.119 align:start position:0%
they were um threats to this country um
 
01:32:32.510 --> 01:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
and and so they are no longer my
 
01:32:34.910 --> 01:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
relatives because they all ended up back
 
01:32:36.270 --> 01:32:36.280 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the ocean and then
 
01:32:40.109 --> 01:32:40.119 align:start position:0%
in gas camps um if if we continue to
 
01:32:43.229 --> 01:32:43.239 align:start position:0%
have policies that are anti-immigrant
 
01:32:45.109 --> 01:32:45.119 align:start position:0%
anti-human and
 
01:32:47.950 --> 01:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
anti-human I think It ultimately creates
 
01:32:50.430 --> 01:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
major problems the majority I'm not
 
01:32:52.270 --> 01:32:52.280 align:start position:0%
saying every immigrant but the majority
 
01:32:54.590 --> 01:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
of people who are immigrants to this
 
01:32:57.390 --> 01:32:57.400 align:start position:0%
country whether they come documented or
 
01:32:58.990 --> 01:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
start out documented and become
 
01:33:00.790 --> 01:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
undocumented or whether they ultimately
 
01:33:03.149 --> 01:33:03.159 align:start position:0%
come here without documentation the
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
majority of them are coming because they
 
01:33:07.310 --> 01:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
are desperately trying to find a way to
 
01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
better their lives and I feel like bills
 
01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
like this puts them in a category of
 
01:33:14.310 --> 01:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
making them less than human and puts
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
them in a category where it's easy for
 
01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
people to um discriminate against people
 
01:33:21.109 --> 01:33:21.119 align:start position:0%
purely because they're trying to get out
 
01:33:23.950 --> 01:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
of a desperate situation
 
01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
it's your position that if someone has a
 
01:33:27.550 --> 01:33:27.560 align:start position:0%
detainer on them from ice because
 
01:33:30.510 --> 01:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
they've broken a law be it not showed up
 
01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
for their hearing or or any number of
 
01:33:34.629 --> 01:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
laws that Isis put a detainer on and
 
01:33:36.350 --> 01:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
that includes also convictions for other
 
01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
crimes and other
 
01:33:39.709 --> 01:33:39.719 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions that makes them Less in
 
01:33:42.510 --> 01:33:42.520 align:start position:0%
human no my premise is the way that this
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
bill is written it refers to people
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
using language I personally find
 
01:33:48.870 --> 01:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
offensive oh yeah but we're talking
 
01:33:51.070 --> 01:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
about changing it so I I understand that
 
01:33:54.030 --> 01:33:54.040 align:start position:0%
but I find that the underlying premise
 
01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
of the bill is one that dehumanizes
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
people so the premise of the bill is
 
01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
that there in my understanding because I
 
01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
didn't write it is that there are
 
01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
several communities in the state that
 
01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
have declared themselves so-called
 
01:34:09.669 --> 01:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary States uh cities and they
 
01:34:11.229 --> 01:34:11.239 align:start position:0%
they've prohibited their police
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
departments from cooperating with ice so
 
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
the premise of the bill that is that as
 
01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
a state we don't want our cities and
 
01:34:20.350 --> 01:34:20.360 align:start position:0%
towns deciding which federal laws
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to let their police
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
officers IGN we've also decided as a
 
01:34:24.910 --> 01:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
State we're not going to enforce a
 
01:34:26.350 --> 01:34:26.360 align:start position:0%
number of other federal laws we're not
 
01:34:27.790 --> 01:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
enforcing federal law though here that's
 
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
what I want to change I want to make
 
01:34:30.430 --> 01:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
sure we're not enforcing it we're just
 
01:34:32.189 --> 01:34:32.199 align:start position:0%
recognizing it but we we've determined
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to recognize other
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
federal laws so which ones we there are
 
01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
number of gun laws that we've decided
 
01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
we're not going to which
 
01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
ones we we are not dealing with guns in
 
01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
schools appropriately people walk with a
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
gun in a school but we can't do anything
 
01:34:47.109 --> 01:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
to enforce it based on laws that we
 
01:34:50.669 --> 01:34:50.679 align:start position:0%
passed until they actually start to fire
 
01:34:52.350 --> 01:34:52.360 align:start position:0%
federal law and guns and schools is
 
01:34:53.790 --> 01:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
unless you have a license carry you
 
01:34:56.109 --> 01:34:56.119 align:start position:0%
can't bring and G in a school so we
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
enforce that law I
 
01:35:01.229 --> 01:35:01.239 align:start position:0%
disagree I mean I just I don't want to
 
01:35:03.390 --> 01:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
conflate lawful
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
immigration or actually even unlawful
 
01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
immigration this is this is we're
 
01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
talking about dealing with people that
 
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
who this ice under this president has
 
01:35:16.709 --> 01:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
said should be held we're asking you to
 
01:35:18.870 --> 01:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
hold these for us and we have cities and
 
01:35:22.669 --> 01:35:22.679 align:start position:0%
towns are saying no so I mean does that
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't seem be a safe way to
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
run a state or a country if we can't get
 
01:35:28.750 --> 01:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
people that the federal authorities are
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
saying hey we find this person um needs
 
01:35:33.950 --> 01:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
to be held be they on a terrorist watch
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
list a a mass murderer or or they just
 
01:35:39.030 --> 01:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
didn't show up for their court hearing
 
01:35:41.149 --> 01:35:41.159 align:start position:0%
if if someone has a thing out for being
 
01:35:44.189 --> 01:35:44.199 align:start position:0%
a mass murderer or for being um I foret
 
01:35:46.229 --> 01:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
what the other term you just used was
 
01:35:48.390 --> 01:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
aside from their immigration status
 
01:35:50.149 --> 01:35:50.159 align:start position:0%
presumably there is a different type of
 
01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
retainer as well about them having
 
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
violated some major crime
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
well that's what I was asking him imra
 
01:35:59.590 --> 01:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
yeah is there a difference between a uh
 
01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
a detainer for um for example missing
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
your court date versus a detainer War
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
you've committed a crime therefore
 
01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:08.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely but just as just as there
 
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
should be you know if someone were to be
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts beating a a partner and
 
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
be guilty of of domestic assault and
 
01:36:19.109 --> 01:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
having fled to New Hampshire that person
 
01:36:20.790 --> 01:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
should be held just in the in the same
 
01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
way yeah sure go ahead so in that case
 
01:36:25.470 --> 01:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
in Ry the the crimes were committed in
 
01:36:27.310 --> 01:36:27.320 align:start position:0%
Brazil I believe so we have no Authority
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
or no uh jurisdiction there so there
 
01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
would be no warrant or anything else for
 
01:36:35.149 --> 01:36:35.159 align:start position:0%
us to arrest him on that crime in Brazil
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
this is strictly a detainer because of
 
01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
the person he was that he was held on
 
01:36:42.070 --> 01:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
and Ice wanted him so different than
 
01:36:44.669 --> 01:36:44.679 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and we we honored that and
 
01:36:47.709 --> 01:36:47.719 align:start position:0%
send him back we didn't hold him because
 
01:36:50.229 --> 01:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
of that and and we have a lot of people
 
01:36:52.830 --> 01:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
committing crimes and murders in this
 
01:36:54.109 --> 01:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
state and in other States in this
 
01:36:56.470 --> 01:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
country who are lawful US citizens and
 
01:36:58.430 --> 01:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
it happens all the time but what if that
 
01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
person was in a city or a town that
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
prohibited their police from detaining
 
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:02.790 align:start position:0%
prohibited their police from detaining
that

01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:05.550 --> 01:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
person then there's still ways that ice
 
01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
handles it oh if they don't know the
 
01:37:11.109 --> 01:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
person exists representative Reed thank
 
01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:13.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I think um we need I
 
01:37:15.950 --> 01:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
like to look at it this way um you know
 
01:37:19.390 --> 01:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
we're Public Safety right and we're
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
protecting the Immigrant Community as
 
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
well because people come here the the
 
01:37:26.430 --> 01:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
legitimate people come here for peaceful
 
01:37:29.830 --> 01:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
productive life we're allowing people in
 
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
with that don't that have nefarious
 
01:37:34.270 --> 01:37:34.280 align:start position:0%
histories or motive they're hiding in
 
01:37:37.070 --> 01:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
these communities I feel if they're stop
 
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
if somebody's stopped and they have a
 
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
retainer we're not only protecting the
 
01:37:43.070 --> 01:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
public at as a whole but we're also
 
01:37:45.629 --> 01:37:45.639 align:start position:0%
protecting the IM immigrant communities
 
01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
from people who will be in those
 
01:37:51.310 --> 01:37:51.320 align:start position:0%
communities and possibly posing a threat
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
but because we're not calling I to um
 
01:37:56.589 --> 01:37:56.599 align:start position:0%
decide if they should um come for them
 
01:37:58.550 --> 01:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
or not we're put in a community at risk
 
01:38:01.149 --> 01:38:01.159 align:start position:0%
who would not ordinarily reach out to
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and those um people are
 
01:38:07.390 --> 01:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
hiding in the community potentially
 
01:38:09.790 --> 01:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
harming those communities who will not
 
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
speak out and I use the example of uh
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
migrant workers in North Carolina that
 
01:38:17.229 --> 01:38:17.239 align:start position:0%
come in to harvest the tobacco coton
 
01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:20.440 align:start position:0%
whatever they're a quiet community that
 
01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
sticks to themselves yet we have people
 
01:38:26.709 --> 01:38:26.719 align:start position:0%
coming in um from Venezuela um MS13 and
 
01:38:29.470 --> 01:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
they're infiltrating those communities
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
those communities aren't going to say
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
anything I feel that it's the police
 
01:38:36.430 --> 01:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
that it's a safety thing that if
 
01:38:38.350 --> 01:38:38.360 align:start position:0%
somebody's picked up they have a
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
detainer that I should be notified and
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
it should be dealt with it protects
 
01:38:45.870 --> 01:38:45.880 align:start position:0%
everybody involved legal or not or
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
otherwise and I think I want to
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
reiterate it's important to know we're
 
01:38:52.270 --> 01:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
not proposing or whatever the bill says
 
01:38:54.310 --> 01:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
it it wouldn't coming out of this
 
01:38:56.270 --> 01:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
committee proposed that our law
 
01:38:57.910 --> 01:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement ask anybody about their
 
01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
immigration status at any point um prior
 
01:39:02.430 --> 01:39:02.440 align:start position:0%
to their being arrested and being
 
01:39:05.910 --> 01:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
flagged in the system as being wanted um
 
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
so the this you know we had some um
 
01:39:12.149 --> 01:39:12.159 align:start position:0%
letters from police Chiefs and I gave
 
01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:14.159 align:start position:0%
those their their due attention and it
 
01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
talked about you know interfering in the
 
01:39:17.709 --> 01:39:17.719 align:start position:0%
in the relationships they built in their
 
01:39:18.910 --> 01:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
communities and I think that's
 
01:39:21.229 --> 01:39:21.239 align:start position:0%
invaluable I wouldn't want our police to
 
01:39:22.669 --> 01:39:22.679 align:start position:0%
start going into communities start
 
01:39:24.990 --> 01:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
asking people their immigration status
 
01:39:27.310 --> 01:39:27.320 align:start position:0%
um that's why we have a a federal agency
 
01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
that handles that but this is
 
01:39:32.350 --> 01:39:32.360 align:start position:0%
specifically talking about once someone
 
01:39:34.669 --> 01:39:34.679 align:start position:0%
is violated a New Hampshire law taken
 
01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
into custody for that or stopped for a
 
01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
violation of New Hampshire law and an
 
01:39:44.990 --> 01:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
ice detainer is is is um flagged in
 
01:39:47.070 --> 01:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
their system at that point what we're
 
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
saying to the officer if we are in one
 
01:39:53.709 --> 01:39:53.719 align:start position:0%
of these Sanctuary towns is ignore that
 
01:39:56.030 --> 01:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
and I I I can't in good conscience say
 
01:39:58.109 --> 01:39:58.119 align:start position:0%
to the citizens of New Hampshire this
 
01:40:00.350 --> 01:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
person's wanted federally we're not sure
 
01:40:02.149 --> 01:40:02.159 align:start position:0%
for what exactly it could be anything
 
01:40:04.830 --> 01:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
from murder to to whatever and we're
 
01:40:06.109 --> 01:40:06.119 align:start position:0%
just going to ignore that and let them
 
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
go um that seems incredibly Reckless and
 
01:40:10.910 --> 01:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
it shows a disregard for the federal
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
court system the federal law enforcement
 
01:40:15.629 --> 01:40:15.639 align:start position:0%
system um and I just don't see how we
 
01:40:18.109 --> 01:40:18.119 align:start position:0%
can justify that is as long as we keep
 
01:40:20.589 --> 01:40:20.599 align:start position:0%
it where in the lane it belongs which is
 
01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:23.320 align:start position:0%
someone who has already been processed
 
01:40:26.709 --> 01:40:26.719 align:start position:0%
assessed by this ice agency and they
 
01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
have a lawful um detainer on that person
 
01:40:32.589 --> 01:40:32.599 align:start position:0%
it's not just us randomly picking people
 
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
up representative
 
01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
Murphy oh thank you um not relative to
 
01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
the merits of the bill actually but just
 
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
to the financial impacts I am aware and
 
01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
I don't have all the specifics I wish I
 
01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
did but I know in marac there's actually
 
01:40:47.870 --> 01:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit against the marac police
 
01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
department for their efforts um
 
01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
regarding they they attempted they did
 
01:40:57.270 --> 01:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh detain somebody for ice and Ice EV
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
didn't show up um and um so I and I I
 
01:41:02.910 --> 01:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
wish I'd have to get all the specifics
 
01:41:05.229 --> 01:41:05.239 align:start position:0%
but I do know that they are involved in
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
a in a lawsuit um so it is costing you
 
01:41:12.270 --> 01:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
know a municipality um like trying to to
 
01:41:14.229 --> 01:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
do that yeah I I can you give me that
 
01:41:15.790 --> 01:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
information sure thank you very much
 
01:41:17.910 --> 01:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
because that would be important to know
 
01:41:20.229 --> 01:41:20.239 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
Muse one of the things I just want to
 
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
make sure we're all on the same page
 
01:41:26.109 --> 01:41:26.119 align:start position:0%
about is we're not necessarily talking
 
01:41:28.470 --> 01:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
about um rapists murderers and
 
01:41:30.189 --> 01:41:30.199 align:start position:0%
kidnappers we're also talking about
 
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
people uh who might run a stop sign um
 
01:41:36.910 --> 01:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about people who might be
 
01:41:39.149 --> 01:41:39.159 align:start position:0%
uh uh arrested or cited on a violation
 
01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
level offense um and one of the things
 
01:41:43.550 --> 01:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
that I want to call everybody's
 
01:41:46.229 --> 01:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
attention to is the the letter that uh
 
01:41:49.149 --> 01:41:49.159 align:start position:0%
Chief aldenberg uh my police chief and
 
01:41:51.709 --> 01:41:51.719 align:start position:0%
several other police Chiefs uh sent to
 
01:41:54.669 --> 01:41:54.679 align:start position:0%
us that basically said and I'll read it
 
01:41:57.750 --> 01:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
I'll read you one paragraph to be clear
 
01:41:59.709 --> 01:41:59.719 align:start position:0%
police officers already possess the
 
01:42:01.510 --> 01:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
ability and authority to enforc
 
01:42:03.550 --> 01:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
violations of local state and federal
 
01:42:06.510 --> 01:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
criminal statutes indeed all police
 
01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
departments in New Hampshire coordinate
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
with federal agencies to apprehend
 
01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
individuals no matter what their
 
01:42:14.270 --> 01:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
citizenship status who may have engaged
 
01:42:17.310 --> 01:42:17.320 align:start position:0%
in crimes but in our humble opinion as
 
01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
law enforcement practitioners this
 
01:42:22.229 --> 01:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
legislation is unnecessary and would
 
01:42:24.750 --> 01:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
prohibit agency from promulgating and
 
01:42:26.790 --> 01:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
implementing policies and procedures
 
01:42:28.629 --> 01:42:28.639 align:start position:0%
that suit the needs of the communities
 
01:42:31.990 --> 01:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
they serve one of the things that these
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
police Chiefs are actually trying to
 
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
protect our relationships with members
 
01:42:39.589 --> 01:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
of the community uh and in many cases
 
01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
vulnerable members of the community that
 
01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
have been very hard one uh over a long
 
01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
period of time um uh and that I and that
 
01:42:52.669 --> 01:42:52.679 align:start position:0%
they that they clearly feel uh would be
 
01:42:52.679 --> 01:42:53.669 align:start position:0%
they that they clearly feel uh would be
inject

01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
inject
 
01:42:57.629 --> 01:42:57.639 align:start position:0%
if we passed a bill like this so you
 
01:43:00.350 --> 01:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
know I I I realize we do have some
 
01:43:04.189 --> 01:43:04.199 align:start position:0%
former police officers uh who are on the
 
01:43:05.629 --> 01:43:05.639 align:start position:0%
uh the criminal justice and Public
 
01:43:08.709 --> 01:43:08.719 align:start position:0%
Safety Committee and I rep I respect
 
01:43:11.870 --> 01:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
their opinions and I respect their their
 
01:43:15.550 --> 01:43:15.560 align:start position:0%
expertise uh but we also have uh people
 
01:43:17.669 --> 01:43:17.679 align:start position:0%
who are in law enforcement now who have
 
01:43:20.030 --> 01:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
contacted us on this issue and have
 
01:43:23.229 --> 01:43:23.239 align:start position:0%
weighed in decisively against it
 
01:43:23.239 --> 01:43:24.030 align:start position:0%
weighed in decisively against it
thank

01:43:24.030 --> 01:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:43:28.229 --> 01:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
you thank you um you're you're correct
 
01:43:30.669 --> 01:43:30.679 align:start position:0%
they did weigh indecisively um as it is
 
01:43:33.310 --> 01:43:33.320 align:start position:0%
written and I would be um interested in
 
01:43:35.669 --> 01:43:35.679 align:start position:0%
in possibly changing that but we have to
 
01:43:36.950 --> 01:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
we can't pick and choose when we take
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
their advice they also said it was a
 
01:43:40.950 --> 01:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
horrible idea to legalize a possession
 
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
of 10 milligrams or more of a of a
 
01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
controlled substance and we voted
 
01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
against that so um I think that we have
 
01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
to be pretty uniform Whose advice we
 
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
take and for what um but again I would
 
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
want to change and limit it strictly to
 
01:43:58.669 --> 01:43:58.679 align:start position:0%
and this is happening this isn't um you
 
01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
know they may say in their departments
 
01:44:02.669 --> 01:44:02.679 align:start position:0%
it's not happening but we heard from the
 
01:44:04.870 --> 01:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
senator that this is happening um in
 
01:44:07.149 --> 01:44:07.159 align:start position:0%
several departments where they have been
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
ordered not to honor or notify ice um
 
01:44:12.790 --> 01:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
and and that if that's happening that
 
01:44:15.030 --> 01:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
type of lawlessness can't be can't be
 
01:44:16.910 --> 01:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
allowed in our state because where you
 
01:44:18.510 --> 01:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
have one you're only strong as your
 
01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
weakest link and if we have one town
 
01:44:22.589 --> 01:44:22.599 align:start position:0%
that is not honoring detainers from the
 
01:44:23.669 --> 01:44:23.679 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
01:44:25.109 --> 01:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
and you can't have a ice detainer for
 
01:44:26.910 --> 01:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
running a stop sign that's that's not
 
01:44:29.229 --> 01:44:29.239 align:start position:0%
how that works um if they're ignoring
 
01:44:29.239 --> 01:44:30.669 align:start position:0%
how that works um if they're ignoring
Ice

01:44:30.669 --> 01:44:30.679 align:start position:0%
Ice
 
01:44:33.589 --> 01:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
detainers by not even calling to say
 
01:44:36.030 --> 01:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
that we have this person um I I feel
 
01:44:37.510 --> 01:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
like we're we're putting our entire
 
01:44:41.390 --> 01:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
citizenry at risk um by rolling the dice
 
01:44:43.709 --> 01:44:43.719 align:start position:0%
assuming it's not an important thing and
 
01:44:45.510 --> 01:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
that they won't go on to hurt anyone
 
01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
after they've been released
 
01:44:49.470 --> 01:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
representative Manion thank you Mr chair
 
01:44:51.629 --> 01:44:51.639 align:start position:0%
I just want to go on record uh to
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
because I've been asked to let everyone
 
01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
know that I'm currently in law
 
01:44:56.229 --> 01:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement I'm not a former law
 
01:44:58.030 --> 01:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement off officer I still in
 
01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
currently employed as an law officer
 
01:45:01.390 --> 01:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
just so everyone's aware of that before
 
01:45:03.790 --> 01:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
I give any more testimony or anything
 
01:45:06.870 --> 01:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative
 
01:45:10.430 --> 01:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
Newman oh you good all um oh
 
01:45:12.830 --> 01:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative new sorry that happens to
 
01:45:15.109 --> 01:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
representative Murray too I never see
 
01:45:17.350 --> 01:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
Too Close can't see me over here um I
 
01:45:19.350 --> 01:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
believe uh part of the testimony that we
 
01:45:21.910 --> 01:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
heard is that um there are no Sanctuary
 
01:45:22.990 --> 01:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
cities and that's what the law
 
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement um officers were trying like
 
01:45:27.189 --> 01:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
in the way that we Define them so we're
 
01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
defining law uh Sanctuary cities in
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
different ways right
 
01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
um we keep saying that uh there wouldn't
 
01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
be a detainer issued unless it were for
 
01:45:39.390 --> 01:45:39.400 align:start position:0%
a serious offense for the serious
 
01:45:41.310 --> 01:45:41.320 align:start position:0%
offenses it would seem that even in
 
01:45:44.310 --> 01:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
sanctuary cities um people are being
 
01:45:46.270 --> 01:45:46.280 align:start position:0%
held for crimes regardless of their
 
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
immigration status or anything like that
 
01:45:52.709 --> 01:45:52.719 align:start position:0%
so it comes back to the point why are we
 
01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
why are we doing this like why are we
 
01:45:57.709 --> 01:45:57.719 align:start position:0%
putting this in place because it seems
 
01:46:00.189 --> 01:46:00.199 align:start position:0%
that it is not needed it is unnecessary
 
01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the day what it seems
 
01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
like um or or the impact of it the
 
01:46:09.390 --> 01:46:09.400 align:start position:0%
effect of it would be um further
 
01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
criminalizing and inhibiting um
 
01:46:14.430 --> 01:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
participation from very vulnerable um
 
01:46:15.870 --> 01:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
members of our community that we talk
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
about um if we talk about Public Safety
 
01:46:19.310 --> 01:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
those are the people that were those are
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
part of the people that we're trying to
 
01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
protect and yet we're putting them in a
 
01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:23.750 align:start position:0%
protect and yet we're putting them in a
situation

01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:46:25.709 --> 01:46:25.719 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily and you know with this
 
01:46:29.790 --> 01:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
kind of frame of mind of something that
 
01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
isn't actually happening we're putting
 
01:46:34.990 --> 01:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
something in place that further inhibits
 
01:46:38.310 --> 01:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
people um from from um fully
 
01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
participating in our society and in in
 
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
fully uh advocating for themselves as
 
01:46:45.310 --> 01:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
well um and the public safety part of
 
01:46:47.669 --> 01:46:47.679 align:start position:0%
that of course not only individually and
 
01:46:50.430 --> 01:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
not only in um many different
 
01:46:52.270 --> 01:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
communities in part of our our broader
 
01:46:54.350 --> 01:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
Community but also in the fact that if
 
01:46:58.510 --> 01:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
you actually want to um be able to um
 
01:47:00.430 --> 01:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
know and have people feel comfortable
 
01:47:02.669 --> 01:47:02.679 align:start position:0%
speaking up about something that is
 
01:47:05.229 --> 01:47:05.239 align:start position:0%
going wrong about someone who is
 
01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
actually potentially dangerous or
 
01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
harmful people need to feel comfortable
 
01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
in coming and speaking with law
 
01:47:12.430 --> 01:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement so we're having I feel like
 
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
we're having this conversation about
 
01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
like that having this conversation about
 
01:47:18.910 --> 01:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
an issue that isn't even really an issue
 
01:47:21.589 --> 01:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
at this point in the impact of us acting
 
01:47:24.510 --> 01:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
as if it is and putting further language
 
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
in our in our uh statutes around
 
01:47:31.950 --> 01:47:31.960 align:start position:0%
something that isn't happening is is um
 
01:47:34.669 --> 01:47:34.679 align:start position:0%
is worsening uh is worsening Public
 
01:47:37.629 --> 01:47:37.639 align:start position:0%
Safety rather than um increasing or
 
01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
fixing it yeah
 
01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
okay okay so the the the proposal that I
 
01:47:47.229 --> 01:47:47.239 align:start position:0%
um that I'm making yeah uh you may I'm
 
01:47:49.189 --> 01:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
just going to respond to what she said
 
01:47:52.470 --> 01:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh um The Proposal that I'm making with
 
01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
regard to only the ice detainer portion
 
01:47:57.430 --> 01:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
of it um would have no impact whatsoever
 
01:47:58.669 --> 01:47:58.679 align:start position:0%
on the relationships with the
 
01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
communities on the protected people not
 
01:48:02.270 --> 01:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
feeling safe the only time that would
 
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
even come up is if they were under
 
01:48:06.310 --> 01:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
arrest for a violation of of a of a law
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
so um I'm not sure how any of that stuff
 
01:48:11.229 --> 01:48:11.239 align:start position:0%
would apply to a situation where our law
 
01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement was mandated to um cooperate
 
01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:17.639 align:start position:0%
on a nice detainer so I I understand
 
01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
that as members of our community first
 
01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
of all it's not up to us to decide who
 
01:48:24.709 --> 01:48:24.719 align:start position:0%
or who is not in our community that's up
 
01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
to the federal government and if they're
 
01:48:28.149 --> 01:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
here the federal government let them be
 
01:48:29.629 --> 01:48:29.639 align:start position:0%
here they're entitled to the same
 
01:48:30.910 --> 01:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
protection by law enforcement of
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
everyone else so once we find however
 
01:48:35.189 --> 01:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
through an arrest that they are wanted
 
01:48:37.109 --> 01:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
by immigration I feel like we need to
 
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
honor that as part of the cooperation
 
01:48:41.189 --> 01:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
between the state and federal government
 
01:48:42.910 --> 01:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
um but your point is taken
 
01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:45.390 align:start position:0%
um but your point is taken
representative

01:48:45.390 --> 01:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:48:48.910 --> 01:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
scitec um I'd like to re perhaps focus a
 
01:48:51.589 --> 01:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
little bit more on what you just said uh
 
01:48:53.870 --> 01:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
there's after you blow all there's a lot
 
01:48:56.510 --> 01:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
of foam here but very little beer uh I
 
01:48:58.990 --> 01:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
don't think any of this is necessary uh
 
01:49:00.510 --> 01:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
I think the situation in New Hampshire
 
01:49:03.030 --> 01:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
is working fine the only thing I want to
 
01:49:07.390 --> 01:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
prevent is the aggre if it exists the
 
01:49:10.189 --> 01:49:10.199 align:start position:0%
aggressive Pro prohibition that the
 
01:49:13.149 --> 01:49:13.159 align:start position:0%
local police department won't honor a
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
ice detainer I have no other interest in
 
01:49:15.119 --> 01:49:16.149 align:start position:0%
ice detainer I have no other interest in
the

01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:18.669 --> 01:49:18.679 align:start position:0%
bill I agree wholeheartedly that's
 
01:49:20.070 --> 01:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
basically what I would like to narrow it
 
01:49:22.350 --> 01:49:22.360 align:start position:0%
down to is as a matter of fact I'm even
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
I'm even even willing to um get rid of
 
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
all the sanctuary words I mean that's
 
01:49:28.990 --> 01:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
really irrelevant to me I just want to
 
01:49:30.990 --> 01:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're honoring the law
 
01:49:35.350 --> 01:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
um further discussion representative um
 
01:49:38.589 --> 01:49:38.599 align:start position:0%
Jamber thank you um I want to point out
 
01:49:41.470 --> 01:49:41.480 align:start position:0%
a few things here and I better start
 
01:49:44.109 --> 01:49:44.119 align:start position:0%
with I'm an elected law enforcement
 
01:49:44.119 --> 01:49:45.669 align:start position:0%
with I'm an elected law enforcement
officer

01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:45.679 align:start position:0%
officer
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
um if somebody is pulled over for
 
01:49:52.430 --> 01:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
breaking a motor vehicle law which would
 
01:49:54.109 --> 01:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
have violation
 
01:49:56.750 --> 01:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
level and the police officer goes back
 
01:49:59.830 --> 01:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
to the cruiser runs their uh
 
01:50:02.589 --> 01:50:02.599 align:start position:0%
history and it shows that they have a
 
01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
warrant out of
 
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
Connecticut that police officer is
 
01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
immediately going to call Conneticut and
 
01:50:11.390 --> 01:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
say are you going to come and get them
 
01:50:13.750 --> 01:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
for extradition well they not may not
 
01:50:15.550 --> 01:50:15.560 align:start position:0%
get an answer right away so what does
 
01:50:17.870 --> 01:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
that police officer do they let him go
 
01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
no they take him into custody they honor
 
01:50:23.189 --> 01:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
that arrest warrant out of a a foreign
 
01:50:23.199 --> 01:50:25.229 align:start position:0%
that arrest warrant out of a a foreign
uh

01:50:25.229 --> 01:50:25.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:50:27.950 --> 01:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
entity and they take him to the jail for
 
01:50:32.109 --> 01:50:32.119 align:start position:0%
48 hours so if somebody has a warrant
 
01:50:33.910 --> 01:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
out of California they're going to do
 
01:50:35.990 --> 01:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
the same thing they have a warrant out
 
01:50:37.229 --> 01:50:37.239 align:start position:0%
of Florida they're going to do the same
 
01:50:39.950 --> 01:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
thing so there absolutely no reason
 
01:50:44.669 --> 01:50:44.679 align:start position:0%
why uh if they run that background check
 
01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
and they find that uh there's a detainer
 
01:50:49.510 --> 01:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
from the immigration nationalization
 
01:50:51.830 --> 01:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
service that they shouldn't hold them as
 
01:50:54.870 --> 01:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
well so so we're talking about two
 
01:50:57.709 --> 01:50:57.719 align:start position:0%
different things it it boils down to are
 
01:50:58.990 --> 01:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
we going to
 
01:51:00.870 --> 01:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
honor an
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
extradition agreement and I I think we
 
01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:04.589 align:start position:0%
extradition agreement and I I think we
should

01:51:04.589 --> 01:51:04.599 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:51:08.109 --> 01:51:08.119 align:start position:0%
be well indeed you rais a good point um
 
01:51:10.229 --> 01:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
by by refusing to cooperate with that
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
we're actually extending further um
 
01:51:16.470 --> 01:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
protection to people who are wanted by
 
01:51:18.109 --> 01:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
the federal government than we are
 
01:51:19.790 --> 01:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
people who are wanted by our sister
 
01:51:22.589 --> 01:51:22.599 align:start position:0%
States um if there's a fugitive from J
 
01:51:25.149 --> 01:51:25.159 align:start position:0%
Justice warrant from another state we
 
01:51:27.350 --> 01:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
hold the person but if it's an
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
immigration warrant from the federal
 
01:51:30.669 --> 01:51:30.679 align:start position:0%
government we're going to ignore it that
 
01:51:33.430 --> 01:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make any sense to me um on
 
01:51:35.310 --> 01:51:35.320 align:start position:0%
any level I just can't wrap my mind
 
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
around how that would be good policy I
 
01:51:39.750 --> 01:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
agree our our Law Enforcement Officers
 
01:51:42.790 --> 01:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
should not be enforcing federal law um
 
01:51:44.589 --> 01:51:44.599 align:start position:0%
but this isn't about enforcing federal
 
01:51:46.589 --> 01:51:46.599 align:start position:0%
law this is about holding someone so
 
01:51:48.430 --> 01:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
that the feds can enforce the federal
 
01:51:51.709 --> 01:51:51.719 align:start position:0%
law and they've asked us to do so and it
 
01:51:53.550 --> 01:51:53.560 align:start position:0%
seems to me that people who are coming
 
01:51:55.550 --> 01:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
into the country in the last several
 
01:51:57.790 --> 01:51:57.800 align:start position:0%
years have been granted um work
 
01:52:00.109 --> 01:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
authorizations and all kinds of things
 
01:52:03.310 --> 01:52:03.320 align:start position:0%
so that they probably are having proper
 
01:52:06.830 --> 01:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
documentation so we should respect the
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
the same agency in other words you can't
 
01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
say well it's great that they're letting
 
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
these folks in and giving them this
 
01:52:15.310 --> 01:52:15.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get jobs but we're going
 
01:52:16.709 --> 01:52:16.719 align:start position:0%
to ignore them when they say they want
 
01:52:18.189 --> 01:52:18.199 align:start position:0%
them back for a reason it doesn't make
 
01:52:21.310 --> 01:52:21.320 align:start position:0%
any sense representative Manion thank
 
01:52:23.750 --> 01:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I heard some discussion
 
01:52:25.669 --> 01:52:25.679 align:start position:0%
about this not being needed because it's
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
not happening and we have no Sanctuary
 
01:52:30.149 --> 01:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
cities did we not hear testimony last
 
01:52:31.709 --> 01:52:31.719 align:start position:0%
week that there are some towns that
 
01:52:33.950 --> 01:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
prohibit their law enforcement for
 
01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
enforcing uh ice detainers or or do we
 
01:52:37.709 --> 01:52:37.719 align:start position:0%
not hear
 
01:52:40.510 --> 01:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
that okay thank
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
you um so this is what I'm talking about
 
01:52:44.709 --> 01:52:44.719 align:start position:0%
kind of the definitions of like what is
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
a sanctuary City so um I'm sorry and I
 
01:52:50.669 --> 01:52:50.679 align:start position:0%
wish I did to have uh uh you know an
 
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
example of this is what a sanctuary city
 
01:52:55.149 --> 01:52:55.159 align:start position:0%
is actually my Sheriff spoke and um my
 
01:52:57.149 --> 01:52:57.159 align:start position:0%
uh signed on to that letter and my
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
Sheriff um oversees my city which has is
 
01:53:02.310 --> 01:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
what we would call a sanctuary City I
 
01:53:03.709 --> 01:53:03.719 align:start position:0%
mean there's there are many different
 
01:53:06.229 --> 01:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
communities that have um what they're
 
01:53:08.510 --> 01:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
what they're doing is it's a resolution
 
01:53:10.830 --> 01:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
to say that we are not going to go out
 
01:53:15.069 --> 01:53:15.079 align:start position:0%
of our way um it it it comes back to the
 
01:53:16.390 --> 01:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
idea of the definitions where we're
 
01:53:18.229 --> 01:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
having a conversation about resolving an
 
01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
issue that literally does not exist so
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
yes we can say there are uh uh cities
 
01:53:24.870 --> 01:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
that have passed resolutions that say
 
01:53:26.589 --> 01:53:26.599 align:start position:0%
that they are not going to encourage
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
their Law Enforcement Officers to go out
 
01:53:33.750 --> 01:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
of their way um to um um to chase down
 
01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
people and you know I'm sorry I'm not
 
01:53:36.589 --> 01:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
putting it in the right in the proper
 
01:53:39.390 --> 01:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
terminology but our definition of
 
01:53:41.270 --> 01:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not even in those cities if
 
01:53:43.390 --> 01:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
there is an ice detainer um thing that
 
01:53:45.069 --> 01:53:45.079 align:start position:0%
is for something that is a serious crime
 
01:53:47.310 --> 01:53:47.320 align:start position:0%
they will still be detained it's not
 
01:53:48.830 --> 01:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
they're they're not getting away with
 
01:53:51.470 --> 01:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
anything extra um that would be
 
01:53:52.589 --> 01:53:52.599 align:start position:0%
something that you would keep somebody
 
01:53:53.790 --> 01:53:53.800 align:start position:0%
from another state or something like
 
01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
that it's we're we're we're talking
 
01:53:57.069 --> 01:53:57.079 align:start position:0%
about different things we're talking in
 
01:53:59.149 --> 01:53:59.159 align:start position:0%
circles because we're trying to resolve
 
01:54:00.870 --> 01:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
an issue that doesn't exist in the first
 
01:54:03.629 --> 01:54:03.639 align:start position:0%
place okay so first of all I disagree it
 
01:54:05.589 --> 01:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist we heard we heard
 
01:54:08.109 --> 01:54:08.119 align:start position:0%
testimony that there are towns that are
 
01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
prohibiting their officers from honoring
 
01:54:12.550 --> 01:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
ice detainers second of all I agree with
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
you I don't want to get into the
 
01:54:15.709 --> 01:54:15.719 align:start position:0%
definition of sanctuary policies because
 
01:54:17.709 --> 01:54:17.719 align:start position:0%
you're right some of them it may be so
 
01:54:19.149 --> 01:54:19.159 align:start position:0%
innocuous as saying we're just a
 
01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
welcoming Community versus some of them
 
01:54:23.390 --> 01:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
that say we're not going to enforce any
 
01:54:24.790 --> 01:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
federal law and we don't we don't care
 
01:54:27.790 --> 01:54:27.800 align:start position:0%
if you're here um with papers or not so
 
01:54:28.990 --> 01:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
I don't want to get into that matter of
 
01:54:30.510 --> 01:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
fact I don't think it really belongs in
 
01:54:32.709 --> 01:54:32.719 align:start position:0%
here I think what we should be doing is
 
01:54:34.709 --> 01:54:34.719 align:start position:0%
just focusing on are there towns that
 
01:54:37.350 --> 01:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
are prohibiting their officers
 
01:54:41.589 --> 01:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
from um from enforcing or or notifying
 
01:54:44.470 --> 01:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
ice that they have someone and if so
 
01:54:46.229 --> 01:54:46.239 align:start position:0%
that's what we should address and if
 
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's not happening then you're correct
 
01:54:50.229 --> 01:54:50.239 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't need we don't need the
 
01:54:53.069 --> 01:54:53.079 align:start position:0%
bill so um
 
01:54:56.550 --> 01:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony albeit um second or
 
01:54:59.229 --> 01:54:59.239 align:start position:0%
third hand that it is happening so I I
 
01:55:00.990 --> 01:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
think I'd like to find out more about
 
01:55:03.189 --> 01:55:03.199 align:start position:0%
that um I'd also like to find out from
 
01:55:04.950 --> 01:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy the more details
 
01:55:07.629 --> 01:55:07.639 align:start position:0%
about the mirat case so unless anyone
 
01:55:09.069 --> 01:55:09.079 align:start position:0%
has anything else to add I think maybe
 
01:55:11.910 --> 01:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
we should just um we we have until
 
01:55:15.229 --> 01:55:15.239 align:start position:0%
Wednesday yeah go ahead I just was um
 
01:55:17.149 --> 01:55:17.159 align:start position:0%
for specific clarification the
 
01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
difference between a warrant and a
 
01:55:21.589 --> 01:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
detainer um between those two terms
 
01:55:24.669 --> 01:55:24.679 align:start position:0%
because I has detainers and we've been
 
01:55:26.109 --> 01:55:26.119 align:start position:0%
talking about warrants from other states
 
01:55:27.669 --> 01:55:27.679 align:start position:0%
so I just want to be really clear and
 
01:55:31.189 --> 01:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
then I also wonder in regardless of the
 
01:55:33.430 --> 01:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
specific answer of that question whether
 
01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
the amendment could vacate the entire
 
01:55:37.709 --> 01:55:37.719 align:start position:0%
contents of the bill and just say police
 
01:55:40.629 --> 01:55:40.639 align:start position:0%
departments shall not be told not to
 
01:55:44.109 --> 01:55:44.119 align:start position:0%
enforce federal law Bingo period I like
 
01:55:47.589 --> 01:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
that that yeah we could yeah because at
 
01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
the end of the day I think a lot of it
 
01:55:51.310 --> 01:55:51.320 align:start position:0%
is um semantics so that doesn't really
 
01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
go towards helping the law I I'm sorry I
 
01:55:58.589 --> 01:55:58.599 align:start position:0%
can't I said Bingo um I think a lot of
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
that is just fluff and semantics that
 
01:56:02.350 --> 01:56:02.360 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily contribute to
 
01:56:04.430 --> 01:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
enforcing the law I'm not interested in
 
01:56:06.069 --> 01:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
defining What sanctuary is and what
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary isn't I just want to know our
 
01:56:11.229 --> 01:56:11.239 align:start position:0%
are are are our Law Enforcement Officers
 
01:56:13.750 --> 01:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
being prohibited from cooperating with
 
01:56:16.430 --> 01:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
the immigration and if they are that's
 
01:56:18.189 --> 01:56:18.199 align:start position:0%
what we should address but shouldn't we
 
01:56:20.069 --> 01:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
make it they could not just immigration
 
01:56:24.550 --> 01:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
authorities any area like the DEA the um
 
01:56:26.550 --> 01:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
the the I don't know there's like 10
 
01:56:28.189 --> 01:56:28.199 align:start position:0%
billion different areas of government I
 
01:56:30.350 --> 01:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
I any federal law enforcement agency
 
01:56:34.270 --> 01:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
period I think that we already do um
 
01:56:36.030 --> 01:56:36.040 align:start position:0%
with except for the law we specifically
 
01:56:38.189 --> 01:56:38.199 align:start position:0%
passed exempting certain Firearms
 
01:56:39.709 --> 01:56:39.719 align:start position:0%
regulations I don't think there's any
 
01:56:41.750 --> 01:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
other thing that we don't cooperate with
 
01:56:43.350 --> 01:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
but I could I could put that in there I
 
01:56:45.069 --> 01:56:45.079 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have a problem with
 
01:56:49.510 --> 01:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
that y i yes representative here Gap I
 
01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
agree with the issue around the
 
01:56:53.950 --> 01:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
different or I heard the same things
 
01:56:56.589 --> 01:56:56.599 align:start position:0%
that you heard last week from folks that
 
01:56:59.189 --> 01:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
said that however I have not had a law
 
01:57:01.790 --> 01:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement person to say that so I I
 
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
feel as though that we're listening to
 
01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
um some of the rhetoric that comes with
 
01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:10.199 align:start position:0%
people as they discuss things however I
 
01:57:12.870 --> 01:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
personally would love to hear that from
 
01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
that police department or that chief of
 
01:57:17.950 --> 01:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
police in whatever town or city they
 
01:57:22.430 --> 01:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
claim is um actually ignoring the laws
 
01:57:25.350 --> 01:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
or doesn't um hold people for retainers
 
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
I agree I'm going to make some inquiries
 
01:57:28.830 --> 01:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
to see if I can get some actual Town um
 
01:57:30.990 --> 01:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
yes represent so then we won't have to
 
01:57:34.510 --> 01:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
say that this is a bill that doesn't
 
01:57:37.109 --> 01:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
have any Merit so I just wanted to read
 
01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
from you this is when I say that we are
 
01:57:41.069 --> 01:57:41.079 align:start position:0%
um a sanctuary City welcoming committee
 
01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh welcoming Community what this is what
 
01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
I mean um and I'm just going to skip to
 
01:57:46.430 --> 01:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
the jump this is the part where it says
 
01:57:48.069 --> 01:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
now therefore be it resolved that the
 
01:57:50.950 --> 01:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
city of Keane uh will encourage that uh
 
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
the following policies be adopted within
 
01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:55.679 align:start position:0%
the city of Kean one to inquire into the
 
01:57:58.030 --> 01:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
immigration or citizenship status of an
 
01:58:01.750 --> 01:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
individual where the inquiry relates um
 
01:58:04.030 --> 01:58:04.040 align:start position:0%
uh relates to a legitimate City purpose
 
01:58:06.310 --> 01:58:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh as required by the federal state or
 
01:58:09.069 --> 01:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
local law that is uh otherwise unrelated
 
01:58:10.830 --> 01:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
to the enforcement of civil immigration
 
01:58:14.790 --> 01:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
law two to only assist us uh Immigration
 
01:58:17.910 --> 01:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
and Customs Enforcement um or Customs
 
01:58:19.870 --> 01:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
and Border Protection in actions
 
01:58:21.669 --> 01:58:21.679 align:start position:0%
intended to enforce Federal immigration
 
01:58:23.830 --> 01:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
statutes when required to do so by a
 
01:58:25.510 --> 01:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
federal state or local law that has been
 
01:58:27.589 --> 01:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
deemed enforcable against the city or
 
01:58:31.149 --> 01:58:31.159 align:start position:0%
required of the City by a Judicial Court
 
01:58:34.109 --> 01:58:34.119 align:start position:0%
um uh with competent jurisdiction over
 
01:58:35.750 --> 01:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
the city I'm sorry bad reading number
 
01:58:38.430 --> 01:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
three this is the last one um to only
 
01:58:41.550 --> 01:58:41.560 align:start position:0%
Cooper cooperate with ice or CBP um in a
 
01:58:43.069 --> 01:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
request to detain or report an
 
01:58:44.910 --> 01:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
individual when required to do so by
 
01:58:46.629 --> 01:58:46.639 align:start position:0%
federal state or local law that has been
 
01:58:48.149 --> 01:58:48.159 align:start position:0%
deemed enforcable against the city or
 
01:58:49.709 --> 01:58:49.719 align:start position:0%
required by the city or Judicial Court
 
01:58:51.910 --> 01:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
which competent over the city so what I
 
01:58:53.350 --> 01:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
the the reason I want to say this this
 
01:58:56.189 --> 01:58:56.199 align:start position:0%
is from 2017 so um this is a little bit
 
01:58:59.709 --> 01:58:59.719 align:start position:0%
kind of prior to it uh becoming such a
 
01:59:02.709 --> 01:59:02.719 align:start position:0%
um you know kind of sensationalized
 
01:59:06.069 --> 01:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
issue in my opinion um but at the end of
 
01:59:08.310 --> 01:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
the day I think that's that's the reason
 
01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
why I feel like we're having such a
 
01:59:11.069 --> 01:59:11.079 align:start position:0%
difficult conversation here and why
 
01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
we're tring talking around circles in
 
01:59:15.790 --> 01:59:15.800 align:start position:0%
circles is because what we're what we
 
01:59:19.669 --> 01:59:19.679 align:start position:0%
are trying to um Implement in this law
 
01:59:21.709 --> 01:59:21.719 align:start position:0%
is not actually resolving a problem that
 
01:59:21.719 --> 01:59:22.550 align:start position:0%
is not actually resolving a problem that
exists

01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
exists
 
01:59:25.229 --> 01:59:25.239 align:start position:0%
what it is doing is it is scaring people
 
01:59:27.430 --> 01:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
who are in vulnerable communities and
 
01:59:30.910 --> 01:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
creating um in my opinion um a much more
 
01:59:33.430 --> 01:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
precarious situation for the public
 
01:59:35.669 --> 01:59:35.679 align:start position:0%
safety of all of the members of our
 
01:59:38.430 --> 01:59:38.440 align:start position:0%
community um because we are being kind
 
01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
of uh ginned up to be uh to be concerned
 
01:59:45.229 --> 01:59:45.239 align:start position:0%
about one or two mass murders and so um
 
01:59:46.910 --> 01:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
I I think this
 
01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
is unnecessary and
 
01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
harmful well um I respect your opinion
 
01:59:55.750 --> 01:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
having said that what you just read to
 
01:59:58.990 --> 01:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
me is exactly why we need this law you
 
02:00:01.270 --> 02:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
just said to me that our community will
 
02:00:03.350 --> 02:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
not cooperate with ice unless there's a
 
02:00:04.910 --> 02:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
state or federal law that says we have
 
02:00:08.229 --> 02:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
to do so therefore I suggest that we may
 
02:00:09.790 --> 02:00:09.800 align:start position:0%
need a state law to make your community
 
02:00:11.470 --> 02:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
do that and I apologize for my bad
 
02:00:13.270 --> 02:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
reading because I'm not sure I'll read
 
02:00:16.589 --> 02:00:16.599 align:start position:0%
it that's all right okay um yeah sure
 
02:00:17.870 --> 02:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely go
 
02:00:20.430 --> 02:00:20.440 align:start position:0%
ahead well wanted to point out a couple
 
02:00:22.629 --> 02:00:22.639 align:start position:0%
of things one thing is is
 
02:00:25.069 --> 02:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire is not required under
 
02:00:28.430 --> 02:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
federal law uh to support this in any
 
02:00:32.229 --> 02:00:32.239 align:start position:0%
way uh no New Hampshire matter of fact
 
02:00:35.030 --> 02:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
um no one no law enforcement agency is
 
02:00:37.109 --> 02:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
any state in any state is required to
 
02:00:39.950 --> 02:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
support an ice detainer and and I think
 
02:00:42.069 --> 02:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
representative Cel made a great point
 
02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
when she noted that there's a difference
 
02:00:47.430 --> 02:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
between a warrant uh and a detainer uh
 
02:00:50.149 --> 02:00:50.159 align:start position:0%
Federal immigration law is civil law it
 
02:00:52.470 --> 02:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
is not criminal law
 
02:00:55.350 --> 02:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
um and and I think one of the things
 
02:00:57.990 --> 02:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
where we uh one one of the reasons why
 
02:01:02.350 --> 02:01:02.360 align:start position:0%
I'm opposed to this is I continue to be
 
02:01:03.870 --> 02:01:03.880 align:start position:0%
cautious when it comes to the very
 
02:01:05.910 --> 02:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
slippery slope uh that we could be
 
02:01:09.470 --> 02:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
headed down when we start authorizing uh
 
02:01:12.709 --> 02:01:12.719 align:start position:0%
police officers uh to to do things in
 
02:01:15.550 --> 02:01:15.560 align:start position:0%
the Civil area which which is what this
 
02:01:19.069 --> 02:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
is um I think that there's a very
 
02:01:21.950 --> 02:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
there's a very real danger that um
 
02:01:24.229 --> 02:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
whatever we do uh is going to wind up
 
02:01:26.350 --> 02:01:26.360 align:start position:0%
being challenged in the courts and
 
02:01:29.470 --> 02:01:29.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately our the particular process
 
02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
that we're following uh on on this I
 
02:01:34.310 --> 02:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
don't think is going to give us enough
 
02:01:38.109 --> 02:01:38.119 align:start position:0%
time to get anything in this area right
 
02:01:40.990 --> 02:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
um and I just think we need to be
 
02:01:43.390 --> 02:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
extremely cautious about any changes in
 
02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
this area especially when we're telling
 
02:01:48.990 --> 02:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
people in communities that have put
 
02:01:51.430 --> 02:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
together uh elected boards and elected
 
02:01:53.149 --> 02:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
represent atives that have made
 
02:01:55.350 --> 02:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
decisions based on the feedback they're
 
02:01:56.709 --> 02:01:56.719 align:start position:0%
getting from members in their own
 
02:02:00.390 --> 02:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
Community to enact policies like this um
 
02:02:03.109 --> 02:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
this is one of those conquered things
 
02:02:05.229 --> 02:02:05.239 align:start position:0%
where we're going to be telling people
 
02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
you know in another community that oh no
 
02:02:09.950 --> 02:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
you know once again you don't know best
 
02:02:11.950 --> 02:02:11.960 align:start position:0%
we know best and we'll make the decision
 
02:02:15.430 --> 02:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
for you um I'm pretty sure every single
 
02:02:18.270 --> 02:02:18.280 align:start position:0%
one of our state laws does that criminal
 
02:02:20.550 --> 02:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
law applies across the state I represent
 
02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:22.910 align:start position:0%
law applies across the state I represent
Salem

02:02:22.910 --> 02:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
Salem
 
02:02:25.589 --> 02:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
Not Conquered or the state basically I
 
02:02:26.910 --> 02:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
represent Salem and those are the people
 
02:02:28.950 --> 02:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
that tell me what laws they want to see
 
02:02:32.310 --> 02:02:32.320 align:start position:0%
enacted yeah I think that um with regard
 
02:02:36.350 --> 02:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
to um civil versus criminal uh indeed
 
02:02:38.790 --> 02:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
you are correct um most of the ice
 
02:02:42.149 --> 02:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
things are civil um but a civil detainer
 
02:02:44.750 --> 02:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
to pick somebody up doesn't mean that
 
02:02:46.910 --> 02:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
they're wanted for a civil offense the
 
02:02:49.470 --> 02:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
the the the prime example is the mass
 
02:02:52.229 --> 02:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
murderer um who was working on on a roof
 
02:02:55.750 --> 02:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
and Ry um you know he he it was a ice
 
02:02:58.310 --> 02:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
detainer well that it was for murdering
 
02:03:00.310 --> 02:03:00.320 align:start position:0%
multiple people so you can't just put a
 
02:03:02.109 --> 02:03:02.119 align:start position:0%
blanket these are all civil we need to
 
02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:03.719 align:start position:0%
leave them alone otherwise that
 
02:03:04.990 --> 02:03:05.000 align:start position:0%
gentleman would still be working on
 
02:03:07.550 --> 02:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
roofs in the community of Ry today so I
 
02:03:09.270 --> 02:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
think we we do need to look at it though
 
02:03:12.030 --> 02:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
carefully um representative Murphy thank
 
02:03:14.270 --> 02:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
you just because I don't understand uh
 
02:03:16.229 --> 02:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
how this works would it be possible to
 
02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
your point that that you just made um
 
02:03:20.310 --> 02:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
the difference between the the the
 
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
detainer and the warrant
 
02:03:25.709 --> 02:03:25.719 align:start position:0%
in that situation with that murderer is
 
02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
there a way for uh for a warrant to be
 
02:03:33.229 --> 02:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
issued based on uh
 
02:03:35.669 --> 02:03:35.679 align:start position:0%
um from an extra well from an out of
 
02:03:38.149 --> 02:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
state um there is it's called a fugitive
 
02:03:40.069 --> 02:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
from Justice warrant but for from
 
02:03:42.189 --> 02:03:42.199 align:start position:0%
another country I'm not sure I think
 
02:03:44.750 --> 02:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
that the detainer would be um what they
 
02:03:45.790 --> 02:03:45.800 align:start position:0%
would use but I'm going to make
 
02:03:48.030 --> 02:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
inquiries about that to if there's
 
02:03:50.189 --> 02:03:50.199 align:start position:0%
another way I mean if if it's really
 
02:03:52.470 --> 02:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
like that murderer if there was a Warr
 
02:03:54.109 --> 02:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
Well yeah if there's a criminal detainer
 
02:03:56.270 --> 02:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
versus a civil detainer I would say okay
 
02:03:58.030 --> 02:03:58.040 align:start position:0%
then let's look at the criminal that's a
 
02:04:00.870 --> 02:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
safety issue um so I want to see if
 
02:04:02.069 --> 02:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
there's a difference thank you though
 
02:04:04.229 --> 02:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
for that question all right with that
 
02:04:05.990 --> 02:04:06.000 align:start position:0%

02:04:07.950 --> 02:04:07.960 align:start position:0%

02:04:20.430 --> 02:04:20.440 align:start position:0%
the Avenues I discussed and possibly
 
02:04:21.709 --> 02:04:21.719 align:start position:0%
