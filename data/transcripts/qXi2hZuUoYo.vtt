00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:01.820 align:start position:0%
control of what's going on
 
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 align:start position:0%
and not always be waiting on Concord to
 
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
approve their projects we currently have
 
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 align:start position:0%
17 projects on the list three of which
 
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
are approved there's several hundred
 
00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 align:start position:0%
million dollars that aren't approved and
 
00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
it's unlikely that those will get
 
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
approved in any time frame and even if
 
00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 align:start position:0%
they're approved sometimes the voters in
 
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
the Local District district don't
 
00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 align:start position:0%
approve it so sometimes the schools
 
00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 align:start position:0%
aren't billed this would allow the money
 
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
to go directly to the schools in a much
 
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
more expeditious fashion
 
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to take any questions on
 
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 align:start position:0%
this if there are any right
 
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you Jr I'm sorry
 
00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 align:start position:0%
representative Jr that works thank you
 
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.410 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools what uh is that going to
 
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
be funded the same way yes so um if you
 
00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
look at lines 17 and 18
 
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
um right
 
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 align:start position:0%
um Charter Schools would be recipients
 
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
of this other than vlax vlax is a little
 
00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
bit of an anomaly because vlax is a
 
00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 align:start position:0%
virtual classroom unlike all the other
 
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
charter schools that have some physical
 
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
facility they need to be meet somewhere
 
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 align:start position:0%
part of this is every kid who's in a
 
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
classroom needs a classroom to learn
 
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 align:start position:0%
somewhere whether it's
 
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
um a classroom in the traditional school
 
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 align:start position:0%
or in a charter school
 
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.830 align:start position:0%
or in a charter school
um

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
even parents who homeschool have a
 
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
classroom they pay for it themselves
 
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 align:start position:0%
this doesn't impact the homeschoolers at
 
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
all it wasn't intended to this was
 
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 align:start position:0%
strictly for the public school students
 
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 align:start position:0%
162 approximately 162 000 students that
 
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
are in the public school system
 
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
but this allows the students to have the
 
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
local school board to have some money
 
00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
available to help out the student in
 
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
terms of large capital projects
 
00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
the charter schools you know I have a
 
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
really the base or the fix number of
 
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
students to in other words a even to
 
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 align:start position:0%
rent a place I mean it's very expensive
 
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.809 align:start position:0%
rent a place I mean it's very expensive
and

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
this you know I mean it's they just
 
00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 align:start position:0%
won't uh it won't cover it won't even
 
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
cover a mortgage if they have to buy a
 
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.150 align:start position:0%
cover a mortgage if they have to buy a
place

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 align:start position:0%
I mean even even over time it uh because
 
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 align:start position:0%
you know if they have 200 students
 
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 align:start position:0%
that's 50 000 that's that's going to be
 
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.750 align:start position:0%
that's 50 000 that's that's going to be
very

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
if they have 200 students right it would
 
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
be closer to sixty thousand dollars it's
 
00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
it's a K-8 Charter School let's do that
 
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
as a hypothetical at 300 a student that
 
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
would be sixty thousand dollars that
 
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 align:start position:0%
sixty thousand dollars that charter
 
00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 align:start position:0%
school isn't is not getting today that
 
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
could be available for at least
 
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.390 align:start position:0%
could be available for at least
classrooms

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
classrooms
 
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
um least office space is something like
 
00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 align:start position:0%
twelve dollars a square foot right now
 
00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 align:start position:0%
um commercial office space so right uh
 
00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
um now does this cover over the full 12
 
00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 align:start position:0%
years is this designed to cover the full
 
00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
12 years of the student
 
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
he needs a classroom and this is
 
00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
designed to be the way we should move
 
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 align:start position:0%
forward so we're incentivizing and
 
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
giving the local school boards control
 
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 align:start position:0%
of how they manage their facilities
 
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
right and how much do we have to fund is
 
00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:21.659 align:start position:0%
it 51 million dollars a year over the
 
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
over the 12 years I mean it's going to
 
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 align:start position:0%
have to be changed it might be changed
 
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 align:start position:0%
but this is right those numbers right
 
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
now are based on based on the 300 350
 
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
would be 51 million dollars
 
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
um it is possible future legislatures
 
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
could increase that number and
 
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.670 align:start position:0%
could increase that number and
um

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
it it's a little bit of a departure from
 
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 align:start position:0%
where we have been in terms of building
 
00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
Aid and the reason it's a departure is
 
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 align:start position:0%
the current system has some fundamental
 
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
flaws in terms of of the development
 
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
process to get approval it it it's it's
 
00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
years not weeks and months follow-up now
 
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 align:start position:0%
will it save any other any money in
 
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
other places uh such as having to go and
 
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 align:start position:0%
inspect the schools and uh you know put
 
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
do this ranking system and it wouldn't
 
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
it would
 
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
unravel some of the The Rat's Nest
 
00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 align:start position:0%
relative to the approval process today
 
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
you you go you start a process you put
 
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
together a proposal you have some design
 
00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 align:start position:0%
work done you then send it over to
 
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
conquer they look at it they evaluate it
 
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
that process takes some time
 
00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 align:start position:0%
unfortunate unfortunately it gives the
 
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
current process gives the doe very
 
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
little time is my understanding to
 
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
review the final application at the
 
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 align:start position:0%
board of ed level and then it's got to
 
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 align:start position:0%
go right before the voters to make sure
 
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 align:start position:0%
it ends up on the ballot for the town
 
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
meetings and
 
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.090 align:start position:0%
meetings and
um

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
I would much rather encourage local
 
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 align:start position:0%
schools to have money to set aside that
 
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
they can put into their Capital fund
 
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
that they can figure out whether this is
 
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
for a classroom Edition because they
 
00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 align:start position:0%
need four more new classrooms and they
 
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
can start planning it or it's a major
 
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
I'm using the root the term roof repair
 
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
right they have a huge major Capital
 
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
project they've got to re-roof the whole
 
00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 align:start position:0%
school system it's it's significant
 
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
expense those things can be taken care
 
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
of and this is One Way Concord can help
 
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
those local school Banks and final
 
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
question uh yep who are the agents to
 
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.510 align:start position:0%
question uh yep who are the agents to
expend

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
expend
 
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
yeah the process so so the the money
 
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
um would be sent from the treasury
 
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
Department here to the local school
 
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
boards to be put into Capital funds and
 
00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.430 align:start position:0%
um
apologize

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.490 align:start position:0%

winter snow plowing and annual painting
 
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
and and Landscaping and those things
 
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 align:start position:0%
this is truly about taking and making
 
00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:21.539 align:start position:0%
sure there's infrastructure there
 
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
necessary to support education so one
 
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
more uh I'm sorry too many questions
 
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 align:start position:0%
probably but who is is it the legit in
 
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
other words the legislative body that
 
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 align:start position:0%
you call a public hearing and and have
 
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
the legislative body decide who decides
 
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
what and and who is authorized to spend
 
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
that money actually that could my
 
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
understanding that could vary by talents
 
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
because different towns have different
 
00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
thresholds on when they have to go to
 
00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:50.699 align:start position:0%
their body for expending some towns or
 
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
sb2 towns right some are not some have
 
00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:55.139 align:start position:0%
to manage ten thousand dollar projects
 
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
via a warrant article some don't if it's
 
00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
put into the capital reserve the local
 
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
school board's going to know what they
 
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
can do in that town and not do because
 
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
if you give I and being on a school
 
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
board for 90 years they know that you if
 
00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:10.979 align:start position:0%
you're the agents to expand usually you
 
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
can you hold a public hearing and and
 
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
then you explain the money the goal is
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
to get the money to the local school
 
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
board to allow them to make the
 
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
decisions on how to how best to take
 
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
care of their building so we don't have
 
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
to micromanage from Concord
 
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
thank you representative who for taking
 
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
my question I'm going to try and become
 
00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
because I am so upset about this I can't
 
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
even begin to tell you okay
 
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
um first of all what I understand is you
 
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.589 align:start position:0%
um first of all what I understand is you
are

00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:44.580 align:start position:0%
first of all I just want to say on
 
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
behalf of the Department of Ed Amy does
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
a fabulous job in your comments about
 
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
that I found
 
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
very hurtful and totally incorrect but
 
00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:57.780 align:start position:0%
going on so from what I'm understanding
 
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
this proposal would totally eliminate
 
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
building Aid as it is now we would take
 
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
the money that we have in the current
 
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
budget along with the 75 million dollars
 
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
that is in the governor's hp2 and you
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
would distribute this in that manner um
 
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
just one question with regard to the
 
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
distribution will that distribution go
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
to children who have the efas
 
00:08:26.529 --> 00:08:26.539 align:start position:0%
that's that would be efas yes
 
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:29.220 align:start position:0%
representative efas are students who are
 
00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:30.419 align:start position:0%
no longer in the public school system
 
00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:31.979 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:35.700 align:start position:0%
we have not had a public hearing school
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
districts don't know about this there's
 
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
some rumors out there
 
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:43.260 align:start position:0%
um Concord is here today
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
um they're here because they're hoping
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
that they would get into the yesterday
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
we were having the conversation about
 
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
can we add enough money so that we could
 
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
maybe get Concord in Litchfield um in in
 
00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
the funding process this year now that
 
00:08:59.150 --> 00:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
negates all of this all everything that
 
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
Amy has done all her work is gone it's
 
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
it's thrown out essentially isn't that
 
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.050 align:start position:0%
it's thrown out essentially isn't that
true

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
true
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
so um the current building projects okay
 
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
that are in queue
 
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
um Concord is asking for 70 million
 
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
dollars toward 176 million dollar Middle
 
00:09:20.329 --> 00:09:20.339 align:start position:0%
School yes okay at 195 000 per child per
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
classroom it's right and I did speak
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
with Amy on this and it is I am not in
 
00:09:28.009 --> 00:09:28.019 align:start position:0%
any way attacking Amy we had a
 
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
conversation okay the process is not
 
00:09:32.449 --> 00:09:32.459 align:start position:0%
about a particular individual in the doe
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
the processes are statutes drive a very
 
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
long time between initial application
 
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
okay and approval by the voters and and
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
getting the bonds necessary to build a
 
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
building and that is a statutory issue
 
00:09:45.889 --> 00:09:45.899 align:start position:0%
which is what we're here to address as
 
00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
opposed to a Personnel issue okay yes
 
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
Concord is asking they want a new school
 
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
okay Litchfield also but if I compare
 
00:09:58.009 --> 00:09:58.019 align:start position:0%
those are items number or whatever those
 
00:09:59.690 --> 00:09:59.700 align:start position:0%
are applicants number four and number
 
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
five on the current building Aid list
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
Concord is asking for 70 million dollars
 
00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
for 176 million dollar Middle School
 
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
okay for 900 students and
 
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
Litchfield is asking for if I recall 10
 
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
or 11 million dollars 12 million dollars
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
something like that for a 32 million
 
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
dollar Middle School 4ish 100 students I
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
don't have the exact number I did look
 
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
at both parts of both applications
 
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
um there's a huge disparity between
 
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
those two applications in terms of the
 
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
cost per child and and we do have rules
 
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
and statutes about how many square feet
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
is allowed in an application and how
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
many dollars per square foot is allowed
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
all of that's us in Concord trying to
 
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
tell local school systems how to design
 
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:43.740 align:start position:0%
their buildings I think that process is
 
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
flawed it's not about the individuals
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
who participate it's the process itself
 
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
that could use representative you
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
realize local municipalities have rules
 
00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
with regard to how schools are built how
 
00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
the process is
 
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
towns still will have to go to the
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
voters to get bonds towns will still
 
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
have to go through a variety of things
 
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
to get approval the hope of building Aid
 
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
and we have had a moratorium for 10
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
years 10 years it's been a moratorium
 
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
because of the tail
 
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
now without any understanding school
 
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
districts now are reapplying you have
 
00:11:26.569 --> 00:11:26.579 align:start position:0%
not done any kind of a public hearing
 
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:28.740 align:start position:0%
you have not met with people there's
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
been no feedback and luckily there are
 
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
lots of people here today so maybe we
 
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
can hear from them if you don't mind Mr
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
chair but I just okay first of all I
 
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
have to say I promise you I will never
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
vote on a budget that has this never
 
00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:42.829 align:start position:0%
vote on a budget that has this never
okay

00:11:42.829 --> 00:11:42.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
um with all due respect there was a
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
hearing on this concept scheduled
 
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:50.220 align:start position:0%
several weeks ago where we introduced it
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
for the first time I understand that
 
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
okay so let's not just say there was
 
00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:56.459 align:start position:0%
never a public hearing on this okay
 
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
there was a public hearing
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
misrepresentative I don't want to argue
 
00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:02.579 align:start position:0%
with you okay I just want you to know I
 
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
find this very disturbing
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
being a former assistant superintendent
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
actually working on a an addition to the
 
00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:12.660 align:start position:0%
school at Dunbarton and the work that I
 
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:14.220 align:start position:0%
did with the Department was
 
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:16.740 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily helpful in terms of the
 
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
design of of the work that we did
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what I would have done
 
00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
actually without them the same thing in
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
Goffstown same thing in New Boston
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
I just am very disturbed but I just let
 
00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:29.220 align:start position:0%
me finish my say I just am very
 
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
disturbed by this proposal and I think
 
00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:32.990 align:start position:0%
disturbed by this proposal and I think
that

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
our local school districts
 
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
deserve better than this thank you okay
 
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair and good morning
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
good morning um a couple questions
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
um and I guess a comment uh first of all
 
00:12:48.889 --> 00:12:48.899 align:start position:0%
I'm you know
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
um every Pro every process
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
at these kinds of levels with so much
 
00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:55.019 align:start position:0%
money they're all there's always going
 
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
to be issues where it's fraud where we
 
00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
could do better so I'm open to new ideas
 
00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
um so you know this is I find it
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
interesting I'm not sure I find it
 
00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
usable but I'm open to you know broader
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
discussion about how we might do this
 
00:13:09.889 --> 00:13:09.899 align:start position:0%
better I don't find um I can just do my
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
three questions and maybe you can go
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
through there but if not I'll cycle back
 
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
um I don't find section three is it yeah
 
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
to be really sufficient in terms of the
 
00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:20.220 align:start position:0%
restrictions on how the money is used so
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about uh guard rails in
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
terms of misuse of this money and I
 
00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
don't mean misuse in a nasty way but
 
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
just sort of a misunderstanding of it
 
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
sure I would be curious to see a
 
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
schedule of how this money would accrue
 
00:13:34.009 --> 00:13:34.019 align:start position:0%
over time to see whether or not this
 
00:13:35.569 --> 00:13:35.579 align:start position:0%
would be effective compared to the
 
00:13:38.509 --> 00:13:38.519 align:start position:0%
current model my main concern is that we
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
um this isn't fleshed out enough in my
 
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
mind to know how this is going to play
 
00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
out over time and I would be curious to
 
00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
know you know this is the new model and
 
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
how this would play out this is the old
 
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
model this is what we're doing is there
 
00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:53.579 align:start position:0%
any intersections between the two but I
 
00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
just don't see how we can go forward
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
with this for me with not understanding
 
00:14:01.009 --> 00:14:01.019 align:start position:0%
and not actually seeing how this will
 
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
actually look 10 years down the line how
 
00:14:04.129 --> 00:14:04.139 align:start position:0%
long would it take for a school to
 
00:14:05.569 --> 00:14:05.579 align:start position:0%
accrue enough money to do the project
 
00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:07.399 align:start position:0%
they want to do
 
00:14:10.129 --> 00:14:10.139 align:start position:0%
what happens if they haven't accrued the
 
00:14:11.449 --> 00:14:11.459 align:start position:0%
money and there's an emergency that
 
00:14:12.889 --> 00:14:12.899 align:start position:0%
comes up and they need to do something
 
00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
now and you know because we I've done
 
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:17.220 align:start position:0%
away with this building Aid they're not
 
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
able to do that because they're still
 
00:14:20.329 --> 00:14:20.339 align:start position:0%
accruing money there's a big gap between
 
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:23.220 align:start position:0%
what's now and what's later on so I have
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
real concerns about the transitions how
 
00:14:28.129 --> 00:14:28.139 align:start position:0%
this intersects with local processes
 
00:14:29.449 --> 00:14:29.459 align:start position:0%
that's another thing that I would need
 
00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
to understand what's the difference
 
00:14:32.569 --> 00:14:32.579 align:start position:0%
between the now and the future there's
 
00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
just a big gap for me and I really do
 
00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
like to spend time and I think a lot of
 
00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:38.700 align:start position:0%
time generally because you know your
 
00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
brain is working all the time and coming
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
up with um you know questions that you
 
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
didn't have before about any unforeseen
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
consequences of this and it's a new
 
00:14:48.829 --> 00:14:48.839 align:start position:0%
project there will be unforeseen
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
consequences it'd be nice if we could
 
00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
get most of those if we were good to go
 
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
in this direction and I'm at this point
 
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
I'm totally not comfortable doing this
 
00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
because of these concerns so I just you
 
00:14:59.689 --> 00:14:59.699 align:start position:0%
know to recap there's the restrictions
 
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
on the money of how that would be used I
 
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
see a lot of misuse I don't I would like
 
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
to see a schedule of you know this how
 
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
long would it take for a school to
 
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
accrue enough money you're talking about
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
sixty thousand dollars how long would it
 
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
take to get you know from that sixty
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to a 32 million dollar
 
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
project if you need to rebuild the
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
school it doesn't seem to me that
 
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
there's even that that's possible
 
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
um so I'd like to see the schedules and
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about
 
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
um again if you haven't accrued enough
 
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
money and you have a disaster they're
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
going to have to come to the state
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
anyway I think that's if there's an
 
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
emergency now I believe there are
 
00:15:35.449 --> 00:15:35.459 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to fill that in so I'm open
 
00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:38.519 align:start position:0%
to new ideas and New Concepts but um I
 
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
think this if if there's Merit here it
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
needs a little bit needs a lot more
 
00:15:46.009 --> 00:15:46.019 align:start position:0%
study a lot more planning in terms of
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
how one might do this and um you didn't
 
00:15:50.689 --> 00:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
answer the question I don't think about
 
00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:53.220 align:start position:0%
the current projects in the queue
 
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
um do they just go away I think you we
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
kind of got off on another topic there
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
and so it sounds like this you know well
 
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:01.980 align:start position:0%
one two and three be funded or do they
 
00:16:03.769 --> 00:16:03.779 align:start position:0%
get not funded because of this now which
 
00:16:06.769 --> 00:16:06.779 align:start position:0%
I can't support and even schools that
 
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
are close to being ready to have a
 
00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
project what happens to them does that
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
go away too and again those are things
 
00:16:15.769 --> 00:16:15.779 align:start position:0%
that I can't support this with all those
 
00:16:15.779 --> 00:16:17.629 align:start position:0%
that I can't support this with all those
unknowns

00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
unknowns
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
so um let me answer your three questions
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
I'll start with the third question first
 
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
right line six through ten talk about
 
00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:26.579 align:start position:0%
building projects that were authorized
 
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
and funded already right prior to June
 
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
30th 2023 shall continue
 
00:16:33.889 --> 00:16:33.899 align:start position:0%
this also funds the tail right for
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
obligations that we have had for Bond
 
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
payments to continue so the promise is
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%
that Concord is made are ready to those
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
that have been approved continue that
 
00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
one's an easy one taken care of in the
 
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
very beginning in terms of misuse
 
00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
um under lines 24 through 27
 
00:16:50.699 --> 00:16:51.290 align:start position:0%
um under lines 24 through 27
um

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
I think Capital expenditures are pretty
 
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
clear most of the time local school
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
boards manage things at a capital level
 
00:16:59.930 --> 00:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
things that go back to their capital
 
00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:00.970 align:start position:0%
things that go back to their capital
budget

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:00.980 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:03.540 align:start position:0%
this is not their annual operating
 
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
budget just like we have hb1 hb2 which
 
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:07.860 align:start position:0%
are a budget we also have a capital
 
00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:10.740 align:start position:0%
projects under hb25 capital projects at
 
00:17:11.809 --> 00:17:11.819 align:start position:0%
local school systems are treated
 
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
differently if you think that we need
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
tighter language than that I'm open to
 
00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:18.900 align:start position:0%
suggestions in terms of total costs per
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
school system per child right this build
 
00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:23.819 align:start position:0%
out this plan how many
 
00:17:26.449 --> 00:17:26.459 align:start position:0%
you're gonna we need to look at a school
 
00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:28.980 align:start position:0%
building over 50 years and then how much
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
does it cost to build a building that's
 
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
good for 50 years and how many students
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
right are in that classroom and then do
 
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
the math
 
00:17:39.289 --> 00:17:39.299 align:start position:0%
um I think the number might be closer to
 
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
twice this when I do that level of math
 
00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
right some of this is going to come from
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
the local school board some of this is
 
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
going to come from Concord but if you
 
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
theoretically put 20 students in a
 
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
classroom for 50 years
 
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.970 align:start position:0%
classroom for 50 years
okay

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
um that's a thousand times whatever we
 
00:17:57.289 --> 00:17:57.299 align:start position:0%
have here that we're putting toward that
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
classroom and the question is is if it's
 
00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:02.700 align:start position:0%
300 is that enough times right
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
multiplying it by a thousand to cover
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
the cost of building that one classroom
 
00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
for that period of time I think
 
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
when I do the math 100 is probably the
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
right number roughly speaking in terms
 
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
of ballpark cost per square foot
 
00:18:18.289 --> 00:18:18.299 align:start position:0%
Amy might be a much better person right
 
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
she she spends her time doing this we
 
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
did have a couple conversations
 
00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
we did also talk about Concord right and
 
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
if I follow the current statutory
 
00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:29.700 align:start position:0%
requirements for Concord the ask was 70
 
00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
million the statute caps it somewhere
 
00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
between 28 and 30 million roughly
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
speaking because there's dollars so many
 
00:18:39.049 --> 00:18:39.059 align:start position:0%
square feet are allowed so many dollars
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
per square foot we went through those
 
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
calculations together on the phone and
 
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
rough numbers I didn't do I didn't have
 
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:45.900 align:start position:0%
a calculator with me we're talking
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
roughly 30 million dollars half of what
 
00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:49.559 align:start position:0%
they're asking for
 
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that it makes sense to
 
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
tell the voters in the town we're going
 
00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:55.559 align:start position:0%
to do 176 million dollar project and
 
00:18:57.049 --> 00:18:57.059 align:start position:0%
30 percent of that's going to come from
 
00:18:59.570 --> 00:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
Concord when really it's only about 15
 
00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
percent of that total projects coming
 
00:19:03.529 --> 00:19:03.539 align:start position:0%
from Concord so I I want a transparency
 
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
that happens at the local level as well
 
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
and I
 
00:19:09.529 --> 00:19:09.539 align:start position:0%
I think this is a great way the voters
 
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
can then count on this is how much we're
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
going to have available this year to
 
00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
work on capital projects and Concord
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
routinely sorry Don Martin routinely has
 
00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:20.220 align:start position:0%
put money aside for fire trucks and
 
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
capital reserve projects and and the
 
00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:23.660 align:start position:0%
school and
 
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
the town dump everything puts money
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
aside because they know long term
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to need to do something to
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
do these major Capital expenditures
 
00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:35.220 align:start position:0%
in terms of emergencies that's a great
 
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
question I don't have an answer for you
 
00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
on that one and the reason I don't have
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
an answer is I didn't know about a
 
00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:42.419 align:start position:0%
process where a town suddenly runs into
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
a major issue and comes back to Concord
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
and says we need this money now maybe
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
there is that process I'm not sure where
 
00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:49.380 align:start position:0%
that is in the statute I'd have to look
 
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
it's going forward but
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
by several um
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
sessions of if this happens this is what
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
it looks like if this would go this
 
00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
direction this is what it looks like
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
instead of doing this I mean this is way
 
00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:06.900 align:start position:0%
more than flipping a switch to make the
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
change I think it's a serious change
 
00:20:12.409 --> 00:20:12.419 align:start position:0%
it's an up upheaval kind of a change
 
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
um and so I can't support you know I
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
would support studying this going
 
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
forward because you know maybe there's
 
00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
Merit I'm fine to you know consider
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
alternatives but I'm not fine with
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
shutting the door now opening another
 
00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:26.039 align:start position:0%
door and not knowing where that door is
 
00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:30.409 --> 00:20:30.419 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:20:33.289 --> 00:20:33.299 align:start position:0%
representative for taking questions
 
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
um let me start by saying that I'm
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
trying to understand the intent behind
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
your proposal right and what I hear and
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
please correct me if I'm wrong is that
 
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
you are looking at the current process
 
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
and you feel that it's not really
 
00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
Equitable that some schools get help
 
00:20:51.169 --> 00:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
others don't and you are looking to
 
00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
basically spread the wealth equally or
 
00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
per student in terms of
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know financing every student in the
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
state equally in terms of building Aid
 
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
is that the intent of this
 
00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
public school students right every
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
public school student is to make sure
 
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
that they have access to a classroom
 
00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:10.919 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
um if I just if I can jump please I have
 
00:21:15.049 --> 00:21:15.059 align:start position:0%
it I'm double booked at triple books if
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
I'm in here as well at 10 30. so I have
 
00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a hard cut off at 10 30.
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
fully understood
 
00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:22.980 align:start position:0%
um you already answered the question I
 
00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:24.059 align:start position:0%
was going to ask about the emergency
 
00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
repairs basically by saying that you
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
don't know about process and actually I
 
00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
would love to hear from the committee
 
00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
members or anybody else in the room if
 
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:33.780 align:start position:0%
at this time if a school has a you know
 
00:21:36.289 --> 00:21:36.299 align:start position:0%
boiler breaks down and they need a
 
00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand to repair it and they
 
00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
don't have the funds if there is any
 
00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
state process that you know we would
 
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
want to preserve I'm not aware of any
 
00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
right now we are
 
00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
using building Aid not to fully pay for
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
a school at the end of the day this is
 
00:22:00.169 --> 00:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
Aid it's a portion of the financing
 
00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
right so I I would
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
some of the models that we were asking
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
earlier were you know can all this money
 
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
pay for a classroom in 50 years well it
 
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
needs to pay for a portion of the
 
00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:13.020 align:start position:0%
classroom the town still has to you know
 
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
contribute to that so I would appreciate
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
it if any modeling and Analysis would be
 
00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
on that basis just looking at how much
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
we you know can help
 
00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919 align:start position:0%
so I I think that while there are a lot
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
of questions about how do we handle the
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
transition you know this this is an idea
 
00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
that you know may have married
 
00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
one quick question though and that's my
 
00:22:36.049 --> 00:22:36.059 align:start position:0%
last question
 
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
you are saying projects approved to you
 
00:22:42.649 --> 00:22:42.659 align:start position:0%
know prior to June 30 2023 yes I mean at
 
00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:44.220 align:start position:0%
this point in time we should be pretty
 
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
close to knowing because we have the
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
warrant articles right so we know who
 
00:22:49.789 --> 00:22:49.799 align:start position:0%
got approved and who is not and probably
 
00:22:51.649 --> 00:22:51.659 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education could give
 
00:22:54.409 --> 00:22:54.419 align:start position:0%
us an idea of who they think this is
 
00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
just the three that have been approved
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
right as representative Heath said
 
00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
Concord is currently number four on the
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
list they have not been approved and
 
00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
number five is Litchfield that they have
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
not been do you know if these those two
 
00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
towns had a warrant article this spring
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
no I don't believe they've been approved
 
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
from the state side okay so they would
 
00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
need that approval okay I'm good thank
 
00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
you so much
 
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
one question yes in addition to actually
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
uh Capital Improvements could These
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
funds be used to pay for debt for
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
Capital Improvements
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
could I take my annual payments and pay
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
off the loan I took to build the
 
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.750 align:start position:0%
off the loan I took to build the
building

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:36.950 align:start position:0%
building
hmm

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
it's a great question I don't know that
 
00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
that would be in the current guard rails
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
but if this committee thought that that
 
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
was a wise idea to help start paying
 
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
down local debt as in addition I think
 
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
that could easily be put in line 24
 
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
right foreign even incurring long-term
 
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
debt if this could be yes that's what I
 
00:23:57.649 --> 00:23:57.659 align:start position:0%
mean if it was available that would be
 
00:23:59.870 --> 00:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
an e right that would be an easy change
 
00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.549 align:start position:0%
an e right that would be an easy change
I

00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:01.559 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
can you weigh in yeah so if you wanted
 
00:24:06.409 --> 00:24:06.419 align:start position:0%
to add debt service for Capital or
 
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
Capital Debt Service payments to section
 
00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
Roman 3 online 24 it could easily be
 
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
none yeah
 
00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:15.059 align:start position:0%
that might be a wise way to help local
 
00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:16.919 align:start position:0%
facil right local towns take care of
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
some of their existing Debt Service or
 
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
well what you say you can use it for
 
00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
Debt Service oh yeah sure yeah okay
 
00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
somebody didn't mean
 
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
if you use it for the debt surface that
 
00:24:36.289 --> 00:24:36.299 align:start position:0%
kind of defeats the purpose of using
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
money for building Aid to me it would be
 
00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:42.380 align:start position:0%
not allowed for Debt Service
 
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding is
 
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
this is to help offset the cost of the
 
00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
communities what what this approach does
 
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:52.740 align:start position:0%
is you you're going to get x amount of
 
00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:53.870 align:start position:0%
is you you're going to get x amount of
dollars

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
every year
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
how big what do you want to do you can
 
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
build a new school with it if you want
 
00:25:03.289 --> 00:25:03.299 align:start position:0%
to here's what it's going to be budget
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
yourself accordingly
 
00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
but then we're still talking about how
 
00:25:09.529 --> 00:25:09.539 align:start position:0%
that money can be used and again I think
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
this is part of the modeling what I
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
would like to see
 
00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
um and you reminded me of another
 
00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:14.690 align:start position:0%
um and you reminded me of another
question

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if I'm comfortable with
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
it using for Debt Service because this
 
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
is supposed to be building Aid going
 
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
forward so I'm confused about that and
 
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
then the other question which just I can
 
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
just throw it out is you know it's
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
another thing to consider
 
00:25:25.679 --> 00:25:26.990 align:start position:0%
another thing to consider
um

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
one of the considerations is temporary
 
00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
classrooms which is very different than
 
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
a major renovation major repairs these
 
00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
are just such different buckets in terms
 
00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:36.900 align:start position:0%
of what you do with the school building
 
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
or the school campus that again I'm just
 
00:25:40.799 --> 00:25:42.350 align:start position:0%
or the school campus that again I'm just
uncomfortable

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:46.740 align:start position:0%
I'm not having a good sense of what this
 
00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.350 align:start position:0%
I'm not having a good sense of what this
um

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
what the outcomes would be for some of
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
these things I don't think and you know
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
maybe you can talk to that later on we
 
00:25:57.529 --> 00:25:57.539 align:start position:0%
hear from doe is there building a to put
 
00:25:59.450 --> 00:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
in temporary classrooms now this is a
 
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
different ball of wax it seems so it's
 
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
just there's
 
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
crisscrossing uh the lines are not
 
00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.430 align:start position:0%
crisscrossing uh the lines are not
cleared

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:10.500 align:start position:0%
I know hacking haken is it hicken
 
00:26:12.769 --> 00:26:12.779 align:start position:0%
Phillips or Hackett hackenfels I said it
 
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
okay hacken Phillips had a question so I
 
00:26:15.409 --> 00:26:15.419 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I get a chance to
 
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
answer her question she had her hand up
 
00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
a couple times let me answer that one if
 
00:26:21.769 --> 00:26:21.779 align:start position:0%
I can okay and then
 
00:26:24.169 --> 00:26:24.179 align:start position:0%
you have a question thank you Mr Sharon
 
00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
to not recreate any of the concerns
 
00:26:33.289 --> 00:26:33.299 align:start position:0%
already previously brought although I I
 
00:26:36.049 --> 00:26:36.059 align:start position:0%
must admit I do share concern
 
00:26:36.059 --> 00:26:37.310 align:start position:0%
must admit I do share concern
um

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
furthermore I apologize I'm Switching
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
gears quickly I just came from Joel car
 
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.190 align:start position:0%
gears quickly I just came from Joel car
and

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
um I am just reading this for the first
 
00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
time I'm I'm not sure if everyone else
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
is but so I feel a little bit of
 
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.210 align:start position:0%
is but so I feel a little bit of
um

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:50.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:52.740 align:start position:0%
like urgency to express my questions in
 
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
a way that's
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
um helpful and I too am interested in
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
discussing the future of school building
 
00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:01.580 align:start position:0%
Aid and and oh you know being open to
 
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
suggestions for doing it more
 
00:27:06.529 --> 00:27:06.539 align:start position:0%
appropriately more equitably you know
 
00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
I'm open to finding a better solution
 
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
moving forward because I know this is a
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
chronic problem for our state so with
 
00:27:15.049 --> 00:27:15.059 align:start position:0%
that in mind
 
00:27:15.059 --> 00:27:15.769 align:start position:0%
that in mind
um

00:27:15.769 --> 00:27:15.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
you know I I think I'm mostly concerned
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
with the premise that I believe you've
 
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
stated a few times that I want to make
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
sure I'm correct I'm I'm getting this
 
00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
correctly that you're trying to with
 
00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:32.460 align:start position:0%
this bill to simplify a cost allocation
 
00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
per child per square footage
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
for our districts is that that is
 
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.210 align:start position:0%
for our districts is that that is
correct

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
so I think that premise to begin with
 
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
just for the record is probably
 
00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
funding school buildings across the
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
state is not the same value per student
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
per square foot you know real estate
 
00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
values differ across the state as well
 
00:27:58.730 --> 00:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
as square footage within each of these
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
public school buildings or Char school
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
school buildings um per square foot you
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
know for the instance the cost to build
 
00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:09.059 align:start position:0%
a large gymnasium is much different than
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
the cost to build you know a special
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
education room or
 
00:28:15.529 --> 00:28:15.539 align:start position:0%
um you know disability
 
00:28:15.539 --> 00:28:16.310 align:start position:0%
um you know disability
um

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:20.269 --> 00:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
Corridor so I think we have to just step
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
back from that premise to begin with and
 
00:28:22.559 --> 00:28:23.450 align:start position:0%
back from that premise to begin with and
say

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:23.460 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
we understand that this is a complex
 
00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:28.140 align:start position:0%
issue that has been
 
00:28:30.169 --> 00:28:30.179 align:start position:0%
part of our state struggle for a long
 
00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
time and that you know to simplify
 
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
per cost per child across the states
 
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
maybe not sufficient for what we're
 
00:28:42.289 --> 00:28:42.299 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish and I I think it's
 
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
an interesting idea I'm not trying to
 
00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:46.740 align:start position:0%
poo poo it but I think we need to
 
00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
be pragmatic about our expectations
 
00:28:54.649 --> 00:28:54.659 align:start position:0%
for addressing this real concern
 
00:28:57.649 --> 00:28:57.659 align:start position:0%
um and then I want to say you know just
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
a quick cursory review of you know a
 
00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
couple sections I'm looking at page two
 
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
line 10 you know the minimum
 
00:29:09.769 --> 00:29:09.779 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for the biennium I think
 
00:29:12.289 --> 00:29:12.299 align:start position:0%
it is acknowledged here in our committee
 
00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:14.220 align:start position:0%
that 50 million dollars for school
 
00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:16.980 align:start position:0%
building Aid in each of the next two
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
years is has proven to be insufficient
 
00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
and that we are trying to work on
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
finding solutions to
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
um you know address these ongoing cues
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
of schools who are asking for much more
 
00:29:33.889 --> 00:29:33.899 align:start position:0%
than that but also to consider you know
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
what can our state do moving forward
 
00:29:39.289 --> 00:29:39.299 align:start position:0%
um at a at a level that will actually
 
00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
solve the problem so how can we strive
 
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:44.120 align:start position:0%
to meeting that need which is clearly
 
00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:46.860 align:start position:0%
insufficient at this amount
 
00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
um do you have a question for
 
00:29:51.049 --> 00:29:51.059 align:start position:0%
representative yeah so you know I'm also
 
00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
looking you know I'm also looking at
 
00:29:58.250 --> 00:29:58.260 align:start position:0%
page two line 23 this section you know
 
00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.210 align:start position:0%
page two line 23 this section you know
there's

00:29:59.210 --> 00:29:59.220 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
this fun being set up
 
00:30:06.409 --> 00:30:06.419 align:start position:0%
um through the treasury and it shall be
 
00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
used you know you identify the purpose
 
00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
here but I'm not seeing an explanation
 
00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
about the rules or promises or processes
 
00:30:15.529 --> 00:30:15.539 align:start position:0%
that would be put in place for
 
00:30:18.169 --> 00:30:18.179 align:start position:0%
distribution have you thought through
 
00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:19.980 align:start position:0%
that more adequately I think the
 
00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
question earlier was is this up to local
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
school districts and how would they
 
00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:26.820 align:start position:0%
distribute it but I never actually heard
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
a follow-up to you know the complete
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
answer to that that question okay so I'm
 
00:30:33.529 --> 00:30:33.539 align:start position:0%
out of time but I will do my best to
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
answer it quickly right which is the
 
00:30:36.889 --> 00:30:36.899 align:start position:0%
state treasury will be sending the money
 
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
to the local school board to be put into
 
00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
a capital reserve fund and then the
 
00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:42.539 align:start position:0%
local school board will be tasked with
 
00:30:45.529 --> 00:30:45.539 align:start position:0%
how that that capital reserve fund or
 
00:30:48.769 --> 00:30:48.779 align:start position:0%
Capital project is is then addressed and
 
00:30:51.529 --> 00:30:51.539 align:start position:0%
the goal here is to move and to
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
decentralize control of how building Aid
 
00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:55.740 align:start position:0%
happens from Concord being the one
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's picking winners and losers
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
amongst the various school districts
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
because we haven't funded every project
 
00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:02.820 align:start position:0%
for a very long time and we don't have
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
the money necessary to completely fund
 
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
the entire list to helping all the
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
schools in the state
 
00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
yes it is a little bit of a transition
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
is definitely somewhat of a paradigm
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
shift but I think in the end it yields
 
00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
much better result because local control
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
yields better results for the towns
 
00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.049 align:start position:0%
yields better results for the towns
involved

00:31:20.049 --> 00:31:20.059 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
I would love to take more questions I
 
00:31:24.409 --> 00:31:24.419 align:start position:0%
can come back but I'm definitely double
 
00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
um for the record Mr chair I don't think
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
there was an answer to the question
 
00:31:33.649 --> 00:31:33.659 align:start position:0%
about the distribution process that was
 
00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
addressed other than saying that it's
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
local control but again I think we need
 
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to identify what kind of
 
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:43.740 align:start position:0%
distribution requirements would be you
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
know at the local level that we're
 
00:31:47.389 --> 00:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
talking about so I just I think there's
 
00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
a lot of glaring holes
 
00:31:51.049 --> 00:31:51.059 align:start position:0%
um specifically with that funding
 
00:31:51.059 --> 00:31:52.210 align:start position:0%
um specifically with that funding
distribution

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:52.220 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
point in that section
 
00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.330 align:start position:0%
point in that section
yeah

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
if I may offer an opinion in regards to
 
00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
uh you know the question just asked
 
00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
if I understand correctly right now any
 
00:32:06.889 --> 00:32:06.899 align:start position:0%
money allocated by state for building
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
Aid has can only be spent based on a
 
00:32:12.529 --> 00:32:12.539 align:start position:0%
warrant authorized by Town voters right
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
they have to pass a warrant to receive
 
00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
building a
 
00:32:18.529 --> 00:32:18.539 align:start position:0%
I would have no problem if we decide to
 
00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:20.700 align:start position:0%
go in this direction as a policy putting
 
00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
a similar requirement that any money in
 
00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:25.140 align:start position:0%
that capital reserve account can only be
 
00:32:27.169 --> 00:32:27.179 align:start position:0%
expanded upon the authorization of the
 
00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:31.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
but that's just my you know quick
 
00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:36.500 align:start position:0%
thought on that
 
00:32:39.289 --> 00:32:39.299 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Mr chair
 
00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:42.539 align:start position:0%
um I'm a trustee of the trust funds I
 
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:46.140 align:start position:0%
also been on a school board uh the way I
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
think I think this should go on is have
 
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
the legislative body have a vote
 
00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
a public hearing a vote and then uh not
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
make the school the agent uh the agents
 
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
to expand can be the school board but
 
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
after a public hearing and a legislative
 
00:33:03.889 --> 00:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
body vote
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
I mean that
 
00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:08.220 align:start position:0%
that's the way it works a lot but we see
 
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:11.460 align:start position:0%
warrants all the time uh you know for
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
say a fire truck is the uh the selectman
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
the uh agents to expend or or whoever
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
and that or it could be the fire chief
 
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:22.380 align:start position:0%
and in case of motorbike motor you know
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
like fire trucks so the bait the big
 
00:33:28.009 --> 00:33:28.019 align:start position:0%
thing is the public hearing legislative
 
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
body approval and then the school
 
00:33:33.049 --> 00:33:33.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.909 --> 00:33:58.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
there are enough copies there for the
 
00:34:04.509 --> 00:34:04.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
no that's another one that has to go
 
00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.230 align:start position:0%
no that's another one that has to go
around

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:34:10.849 --> 00:34:10.859 align:start position:0%
that you want it three-hole you might
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:37.849 --> 00:34:37.859 align:start position:0%
well good morning again uh chairman and
 
00:34:41.089 --> 00:34:41.099 align:start position:0%
members of the division two uh for the
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
record my name is Rick Ladd I chair
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
House Education
 
00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.149 align:start position:0%
House Education
um

00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
and I come from Haverhill New Hampshire
 
00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.050 align:start position:0%
and I come from Haverhill New Hampshire
um

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to really communicate
 
00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
with you that I have
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
a great deal of concern regarding this
 
00:35:02.089 --> 00:35:02.099 align:start position:0%
bill I'm not saying I'm I I'm totally
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
against it but I have a lot of concern
 
00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
regarding process here
 
00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
when I came to the hearing when this was
 
00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
discussed here under hb2 there was no
 
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
identification in the hearing process
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
that school building Aid was I was kind
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
of shocked myself after we left a noon
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
time that something was done that I
 
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
didn't see it so I didn't know you and I
 
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
understand the process hb2 you have so
 
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
many components it's very difficult you
 
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
can't put that all on the calendar but
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
let me tell you that during the hearings
 
00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
which we've had in education we've had
 
00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
four bills on school building Aid this
 
00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
year and it's it's taken days to get
 
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
through some of that and the testimony
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
that we're hearing from the public so
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
what I have here are three sheets for
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
you and the first one I'd like to look
 
00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
at right here is this one right here
 
00:35:56.329 --> 00:35:56.339 align:start position:0%
I put that uh quickly together last
 
00:35:58.690 --> 00:35:58.700 align:start position:0%
night when I was watching Penn State
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
beat Texas A M and I'm an Aggie
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
and so at any rate
 
00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
um that's behind me
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
so at any rate what I want to do is try
 
00:36:14.329 --> 00:36:14.339 align:start position:0%
to do a comparison between what we have
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
in current law right now
 
00:36:19.849 --> 00:36:19.859 align:start position:0%
and what this is trying to do
 
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
to maybe what I'll do first is there
 
00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:23.820 align:start position:0%
were several questions which were asked
 
00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:26.339 align:start position:0%
what about emergency aid well Haverhill
 
00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:28.380 align:start position:0%
Middle School had the roof go bad about
 
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
seven years ago totally gone
 
00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
and it was an emergency it had to be
 
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
repaired we were able to obtain
 
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
emergency funds from the state to repair
 
00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:40.980 align:start position:0%
that building it's in statute we had to
 
00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
take the kids for one year and put them
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
in the Armory while we had that roof
 
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
totally removed it's a huge Middle
 
00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:48.069 align:start position:0%
totally removed it's a huge Middle
School

00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:48.079 align:start position:0%
School
 
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
another issue which I'd like to talk
 
00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:53.460 align:start position:0%
about is this moratorium we've just come
 
00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
through with the tail
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
in another couple years we're going to
 
00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
be beyond the major payments on that
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
tail so we're going to have more of that
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars available for use of
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
this and uh I think that's a very
 
00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
important aspect which we need to
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
remember the we have a backlog of
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
buildings needs in this state now as a
 
00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:19.140 align:start position:0%
direct result of the moratorium and
 
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
we've got to somehow get ahead of that
 
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
so in looking at this right here I took
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
a hypothetical building and the average
 
00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
cost of an elementary school is around
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
7.7 million dollars
 
00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
and you can see if you follow through on
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
this sheet
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
and for an elementary student it costs
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
about 295 dollars per square foot per
 
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:39.710 align:start position:0%
about 295 dollars per square foot per
pupil

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
pupil
 
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:41.940 align:start position:0%
and an elementary student needs
 
00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
approximately somewhere between 55 and
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
70 square feet
 
00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
in that facility
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
so if you take a 62 square feet as kind
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
of the middle between the 55 and the 70
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
and multiply that times 400 students
 
00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
which would fit into that building
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
Elementary wise that would be 24.8
 
00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:03.660 align:start position:0%
000 square feet needed in that facility
 
00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:07.380 align:start position:0%
at 295 dollars per pupil you can see
 
00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
that comes out roughly around 7.3
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars so it's close to that
 
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
7.7 as the as the average
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
under this formula
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
we would be appropriating for an
 
00:38:19.849 --> 00:38:19.859 align:start position:0%
elementary student 300 per year
 
00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:22.140 align:start position:0%
multiplied times number of students Etc
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
in that District
 
00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
for a school a size the one I'm talking
 
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
about let's say you have a small
 
00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
Elementary District with 400 that's not
 
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
really small in our state because we
 
00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
have some that are 67 kids 50 kids but
 
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
I'm taking 400 kids
 
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
400 times 300 is 1 120 000 dollars
 
00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
now let's go down below and compare it
 
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
to where and how we do it now compared
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
to what this is proposing
 
00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:50.940 align:start position:0%
under the current formula
 
00:38:53.329 --> 00:38:53.339 align:start position:0%
if a district was one that had a little
 
00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
bit more wealth than the others you'd
 
00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
get 30 percent of the cost that building
 
00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
if the building is 7.7 million dollars
 
00:39:02.569 --> 00:39:02.579 align:start position:0%
that means you would have received from
 
00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:04.740 align:start position:0%
the state 2 million three hundred and
 
00:39:06.349 --> 00:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
80 percent of it's up front 20 percent
 
00:39:10.609 --> 00:39:10.619 align:start position:0%
upon completion
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
under this proposal hb2 you would
 
00:39:17.089 --> 00:39:17.099 align:start position:0%
receive 300 per student per year and it
 
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
would take 19.25 years for you to accrue
 
00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:23.220 align:start position:0%
2 million three hundred and ten thousand
 
00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.950 align:start position:0%
2 million three hundred and ten thousand
dollars

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
now let's go up the ladder a little bit
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
from 30 percent to 60 percent those are
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
the communities which really are in need
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
in this state there are poorer
 
00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
communities they don't have the dollars
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
to build the castle that we'd like to
 
00:39:41.089 --> 00:39:41.099 align:start position:0%
see for our kids
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
so at sixty percent under that formula
 
00:39:46.849 --> 00:39:46.859 align:start position:0%
we have right now in the books they
 
00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:49.980 align:start position:0%
would receive for their Grant four
 
00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
million six hundred twenty thousand
 
00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:58.849 --> 00:39:58.859 align:start position:0%
from the state 80 percent up front 20
 
00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:01.500 align:start position:0%
percent upon completion under this
 
00:40:06.829 --> 00:40:06.839 align:start position:0%
proposal hb2 at 300 per pupil per year
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
it would take 38.5 years for that
 
00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
District to have the money to build that
 
00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.329 align:start position:0%
District to have the money to build that
building

00:40:14.329 --> 00:40:14.339 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
that is not helping our poorer
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
communities we have in this state that's
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
a real fallacy in this bill
 
00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
now last night before I left here late I
 
00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
asked our researcher here to do some
 
00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
research for us there's two states have
 
00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:32.220 align:start position:0%
a similar type funding formula at least
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
on a per pupil basis each year Kentucky
 
00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
and Virginia
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
but then you start delving down into the
 
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
mechanics of that formula and it gets to
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of criteria such as property
 
00:40:46.849 --> 00:40:46.859 align:start position:0%
valuation in regions of the locations in
 
00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
the state demographics it gets into
 
00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
property wealth uh property uh poor
 
00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
towns Etc it gets in those Dynamics and
 
00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
the parts that in the fact even in some
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
of the one of those states there is no
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
building aid for the very very wealthy
 
00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.450 align:start position:0%
building aid for the very very wealthy
community

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:05.339 align:start position:0%
so what we've got to do is before we
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
step off the deep edge here and and and
 
00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:12.900 align:start position:0%
put a policy in place let's go through
 
00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:15.300 align:start position:0%
the process and do it correctly
 
00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
now we've had just heard and I've also I
 
00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
gave to Mickey here two other bills
 
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
which we had here we just finished
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
correcting the school building Aid uh
 
00:41:29.329 --> 00:41:29.339 align:start position:0%
formula we have now with a timeline that
 
00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
works so the the districts know before
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
well before now their their town meeting
 
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
when they're going to have to have a
 
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
warrant put forth what they're going to
 
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
do and they can they can take to that
 
00:41:44.329 --> 00:41:44.339 align:start position:0%
warrant on the condition that we get
 
00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:47.220 align:start position:0%
this you're going to vote Yes or no
 
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
so um on this sheet I still don't want
 
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
to depart from it because I I'm trying
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
to rush so others have an opportunity
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
here there are a number of issues which
 
00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
we have to resolve and we have held one
 
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
of our bill bills back in house
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
education specifically to address what
 
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
you're trying to address right here
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
we're trying to address all those issues
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
associated with school building a and
 
00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:14.220 align:start position:0%
here's a couple of the items is there a
 
00:42:16.849 --> 00:42:16.859 align:start position:0%
way to fund smaller projects alongside
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
larger ones I'm also the chair of the
 
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
public school infrastructure Commission
 
00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:26.220 align:start position:0%
and we've had over 40.3 million dollars
 
00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
some of us go for some it's been
 
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
appropriated by the state uh
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative Heats on that on that and
 
00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:34.140 align:start position:0%
representative hill behind me is on that
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
could this be a way to fund some of
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
those smaller projects we're talking
 
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
about renovation in the future could
 
00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
there be a different pot of money I
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
don't know but it's a thought and it's
 
00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
something we ought to be considering
 
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
how do Charters fit into the process we
 
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
discussed that thoroughly within our
 
00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:54.900 align:start position:0%
house education committee and there are
 
00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
a number of issues which have to be uh
 
00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
discussed what happens if a charter goes
 
00:43:02.569 --> 00:43:02.579 align:start position:0%
out of business
 
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
and they've received a grant who has to
 
00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
pay that within statute it right now it
 
00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
says the resident School District
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
captures that well our Charter has kids
 
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
come through many many districts
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
so there that's part of the cleanup we
 
00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
have to do even when Charter School law
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
we have to do a cleanup and to ensure
 
00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:24.660 align:start position:0%
that the whole process is workable going
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
to the flip side and the back side some
 
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
of the issues that we're looking at
 
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
emergency projects there has to be a way
 
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
to Fund emergency projects we have it in
 
00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:37.260 align:start position:0%
statute right now we work with Amy Clark
 
00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:39.180 align:start position:0%
at the department we want an issue like
 
00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
this and this is stuff that's not just I
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
think I have an emergency process it's
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
built in conjunction with school
 
00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
building code and fire code and it has
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
to be identified by the State Fire
 
00:43:53.089 --> 00:43:53.099 align:start position:0%
Marshal as an emergency project
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
should building Aid pay for Career
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
Technical education
 
00:44:00.589 --> 00:44:00.599 align:start position:0%
the kohlberg project has some CTE in it
 
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
and we are asking well we have another
 
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
pot for a CTE programs
 
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
which is over the light you know and
 
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
it's based upon when a CTE went into
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
business and that and then we go through
 
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
the other 25 and it rotates around
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's not really working
 
00:44:19.609 --> 00:44:19.619 align:start position:0%
right either so by the time it comes
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
around again your your diesel mechanics
 
00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
is so obsolete that you're you're having
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
to really upgrade the whole thing do
 
00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
security and safety issues uh need to
 
00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:32.220 align:start position:0%
rise to the top of the Heat
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
we're looking at that right now too and
 
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
yes we do have a Proviso in the law
 
00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
right now where if you receive so many
 
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
points in the area of safety it does go
 
00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:45.180 align:start position:0%
ahead of some of the other projects
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
should pre presidents be provided in all
 
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
projects that already applied that have
 
00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
been ranked so the next year other
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
projects come in do they go on top of
 
00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
what's already been ranked we have 17
 
00:44:59.150 --> 00:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
projects now three of which we're we're
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
on on the list uh for approving and the
 
00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
dollars which receive in that are not
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
yet the dollars which uh the the state
 
00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
will decide There's issues still they're
 
00:45:11.569 --> 00:45:11.579 align:start position:0%
looking at the standards to make sure
 
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
what the district's asking for
 
00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
agrees or aligns with what the standards
 
00:45:19.069 --> 00:45:19.079 align:start position:0%
are and by the way if you hand this
 
00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:22.380 align:start position:0%
money out in this 300 method it's still
 
00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
State dollars you're going to still have
 
00:45:26.809 --> 00:45:26.819 align:start position:0%
to build those buildings because you're
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
using State Appropriations in
 
00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
conformance with the law that we have
 
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
that the standards have to be filed
 
00:45:36.109 --> 00:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
we've had districts before have gone
 
00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:38.460 align:start position:0%
ahead and built and not built the square
 
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
footage required in the classroom and
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
had to rebuild
 
00:45:44.569 --> 00:45:44.579 align:start position:0%
we don't want to go there and I'm not
 
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
going to say the name of that District
 
00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:48.660 align:start position:0%
but it was within the last several years
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
should charitable trust bequest gifts
 
00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
insurance policies
 
00:45:55.609 --> 00:45:55.619 align:start position:0%
be subtracted from the state Grant
 
00:45:58.010 --> 00:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
right now they are
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
and yet we have one project up in
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
Colebrook which has just been approved
 
00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:05.339 align:start position:0%
where they have had a benefactor come
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
forward and say I have two million
 
00:46:08.650 --> 00:46:08.660 align:start position:0%
dollars I'll help you with your project
 
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
but that won't subtract from the state
 
00:46:14.329 --> 00:46:14.339 align:start position:0%
aid that we presently have in law one of
 
00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
the bills I gave you right here accounts
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
for that and corrects that that will be
 
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
coming to the house in 452.
 
00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
in regard to new construction offset
 
00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
State share a building Grant by sale of
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
any assets that's a problem we have
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
if you have a new facility going in on a
 
00:46:35.569 --> 00:46:35.579 align:start position:0%
different location do the assets come
 
00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
from the old property the old facility
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
go against the the state share or maybe
 
00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
the district's using that for adult
 
00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
vocational education or as a career tech
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
center or as a charter school so we've
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
got to look at there's a lot of Dynamics
 
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
with that equation too
 
00:46:54.109 --> 00:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
and I think that would be inappropriate
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
study methods of ensuring long-term
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
sustainability funding for school
 
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
buildings and identify sources of such
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
funds that has to be done where the
 
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
should State share of Grant be flat
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
funded consider Community wealth income
 
00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:16.980 align:start position:0%
levels grades in schools geographic
 
00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
location demographics that's partially
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to do here but we
 
00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
haven't considered all that other yet
 
00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
should 80 percent be provided
 
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
immediately looking at our own formula
 
00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
right now should that be up front or
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
should we give a lesser amount and
 
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
spread the wealth a little bit more to a
 
00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:34.740 align:start position:0%
few other projects that's to be
 
00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
considered should be 50 50. we've looked
 
00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
at that and that has to be and we will
 
00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
be looking all these issues in the next
 
00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:45.180 align:start position:0%
by November of this year we have a study
 
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
group that's going to be set up based
 
00:47:50.089 --> 00:47:50.099 align:start position:0%
upon the bill we retained
 
00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:53.339 align:start position:0%
access eligibility criteria what are the
 
00:47:57.050 --> 00:47:57.060 align:start position:0%
criteria that we use to rank order all
 
00:47:59.210 --> 00:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
these that has to be looked at too we
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
have now high performance schools with
 
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency we have schools that
 
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
would like to consolidate and and go
 
00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
from three buildings maybe to two
 
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
buildings saving administrative costs
 
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
and all that that's a consideration
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
really should be and that's what they
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
were looking for in the state of Vermont
 
00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
when they went ahead with their act over
 
00:48:19.069 --> 00:48:19.079 align:start position:0%
there and that's what Maine went into
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
when they tried to consolidate all the
 
00:48:23.569 --> 00:48:23.579 align:start position:0%
sads over there and they only had one
 
00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
one District bite on that and that was
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
Rumford Mexico
 
00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:29.220 align:start position:0%
I mentioned that Kentucky and Virginia
 
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
there I have researchers right now
 
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
researching this with the education
 
00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:34.980 align:start position:0%
Commission of the states that
 
00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:36.900 align:start position:0%
information will be coming back to us
 
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
this is part of the communications we're
 
00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:41.460 align:start position:0%
getting back from ECS there are a number
 
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
of ways to fund schools we have not
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
considered all those and we really
 
00:48:45.839 --> 00:48:48.109 align:start position:0%
considered all those and we really
should

00:48:48.109 --> 00:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
and also as you may recall several years
 
00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
ago we put forward building a bill
 
00:48:55.809 --> 00:48:55.819 align:start position:0%
wanting to have a Statewide condition
 
00:48:58.609 --> 00:48:58.619 align:start position:0%
assessment that would have cost at that
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
time 3.3 million dollars for us to have
 
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
teams go out and analyze every facility
 
00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
with an architect engineer policy people
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
so then we can project our 10-year plan
 
00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
what's it really look like what do we
 
00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
have for needs out there where are we
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
going to put our dollars
 
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
3.3 million dollars you can talk to Amy
 
00:49:18.589 --> 00:49:18.599 align:start position:0%
when she comes up here it'd probably be
 
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
higher now but it's it's a process that
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
should be used Montana uses it and they
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
have similar populations we have and
 
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
they found that that's able to save on
 
00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
building eight if you know what you get
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
and you know what you compare you're
 
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
going to have to pay out in another 10
 
00:49:37.069 --> 00:49:37.079 align:start position:0%
years or down the line
 
00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:39.780 align:start position:0%
so the other two sheets I'll quickly
 
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
reference are are there was one
 
00:49:44.569 --> 00:49:44.579 align:start position:0%
Amendment which we did not
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
um uh go ahead and you'll notice that
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
there was a committee which we were also
 
00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:53.220 align:start position:0%
looking at to put in HB 452 which would
 
00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
require the committee study right now
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
but we felt we could do it by holding a
 
00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
bill get on the task immediately rather
 
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
than waiting for a bill to have to be
 
00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
signed in by the governor
 
00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
and so with that we we are already on
 
00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
track for doing exactly what you're
 
00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:10.980 align:start position:0%
doing but I encourage you
 
00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:13.980 align:start position:0%
please do not move forward with a bill
 
00:50:16.609 --> 00:50:16.619 align:start position:0%
that has not received if you're going to
 
00:50:18.349 --> 00:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
deal with something overhauling our
 
00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
entire School building aid process make
 
00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:24.180 align:start position:0%
sure that's properly heard make sure you
 
00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
have these superintendents like
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
superintendent Taylor up in Colebrook
 
00:50:29.809 --> 00:50:29.819 align:start position:0%
who came and testified the other week
 
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
with us and told us I can't use this
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
charitable money to help me with the
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
State Building then I'm trying to cut
 
00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:38.220 align:start position:0%
the cost down of the state
 
00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
so so uh please consider that it's it's
 
00:50:44.329 --> 00:50:44.339 align:start position:0%
a it's one of the areas funding
 
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
methodologies we need to pursue I agree
 
00:50:49.849 --> 00:50:49.859 align:start position:0%
with you but it's not been thoroughly
 
00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
vetted and there's a lot more look at
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
Kentucky look at Virginia and see what
 
00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
they did with this formula it's a lot
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
deeper than this week put on two or
 
00:51:00.829 --> 00:51:00.839 align:start position:0%
three pages here that that's that's too
 
00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
quick a way to try to resolve we're
 
00:51:05.569 --> 00:51:05.579 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get over to the end too
 
00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:07.740 align:start position:0%
fast and too quick I'm afraid we're
 
00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:10.140 align:start position:0%
going to get down that rabbit hole and
 
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
have to really try to climb out of it
 
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
when we find it doesn't really work and
 
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:16.140 align:start position:0%
I'd also be concerned about some of
 
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
these schools which you're approving
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
right now the three possibly four
 
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
because if there are additional dollars
 
00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:24.180 align:start position:0%
left over and some might go to uh
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
Concord are we going to fund them in
 
00:51:29.809 --> 00:51:29.819 align:start position:0%
subsequent years that 20 later on or in
 
00:51:32.329 --> 00:51:32.339 align:start position:0%
based upon the new formula or the
 
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:34.740 align:start position:0%
formula we have right now
 
00:51:36.349 --> 00:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of consideration thank you very
 
00:51:39.049 --> 00:51:39.059 align:start position:0%
much Mr chairman
 
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:40.980 align:start position:0%
thank you with your Indulgence I have
 
00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:42.540 align:start position:0%
two or three questions if I made really
 
00:51:43.849 --> 00:51:43.859 align:start position:0%
quickly so
 
00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:47.220 align:start position:0%
just to start you know by addressing the
 
00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
very last point that representative
 
00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:50.700 align:start position:0%
blood was mentioning I think the bill
 
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
clearly says that the projects were
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
approved by June 2023 will go ahead you
 
00:51:56.809 --> 00:51:56.819 align:start position:0%
know under the current rules and
 
00:51:59.329 --> 00:51:59.339 align:start position:0%
legislation so that they go ahead but my
 
00:52:01.849 --> 00:52:01.859 align:start position:0%
concern is after you pay that 80 then
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
you're into another program how's the 20
 
00:52:07.609 --> 00:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
can be funded I I would argue that the
 
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
current bill language says that the the
 
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
process for the current applications
 
00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
that are approved by then will be
 
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
unchanged and this only talks about
 
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
future building a but of course language
 
00:52:20.569 --> 00:52:20.579 align:start position:0%
can you know be checked right so one
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
question that I had for you
 
00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
um you were talking about the fact that
 
00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:25.609 align:start position:0%
um you were talking about the fact that
um

00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:25.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
it will take up to 38.5 years for a
 
00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:30.660 align:start position:0%
school to get the equivalent you know
 
00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
for a school district to get the
 
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
equivalent amount of money they get up
 
00:52:35.329 --> 00:52:35.339 align:start position:0%
front right now that's an approximation
 
00:52:37.609 --> 00:52:37.619 align:start position:0%
there's no interest we're all talking
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
ballpark numbers right
 
00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:43.380 align:start position:0%
given that the expected life of a school
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
building is longer than that I'm trying
 
00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:47.700 align:start position:0%
to understand why do you feel that's not
 
00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:49.740 align:start position:0%
sufficient in the long term I'm not
 
00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:51.300 align:start position:0%
asking about the current short-term
 
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
disruptions if we would move in a
 
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:55.140 align:start position:0%
direction like this but
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
it seems that we would be giving them
 
00:52:59.390 --> 00:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
more over time because right now they
 
00:53:01.069 --> 00:53:01.079 align:start position:0%
would get eight every you know 50 years
 
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
on when they replace a school building
 
00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
while now they would get it you know
 
00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:06.540 align:start position:0%
about every 40 years at the worst case
 
00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:08.220 align:start position:0%
scenario so I'm trying to understand
 
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
what the concern is with that duration
 
00:53:12.109 --> 00:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
well that's just one building within a
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
school district so you're going to be
 
00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
funding all those schools because uh
 
00:53:18.589 --> 00:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
there's a number of schools that are
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
over a hundred years old
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
um are is there going to be some kind of
 
00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
a priority as to what we hit here uh if
 
00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to be handed out equal
 
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
amounts right now
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
um that that brings up a whole lot of
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
other questions I appreciate that really
 
00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
helps me understand what your concerns
 
00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:43.140 align:start position:0%
we were talking about the um
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
roof emergency that you were mentioning
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
from middle school do you know since
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
you've been through that whether the
 
00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:52.140 align:start position:0%
funds that we got through the states
 
00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:54.180 align:start position:0%
were from the building Aid or they were
 
00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:56.460 align:start position:0%
from a different general fund or a
 
00:53:59.390 --> 00:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
different source
 
00:54:02.089 --> 00:54:02.099 align:start position:0%
it's written underneath the building Aid
 
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
section that chapter of law that there
 
00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
is an emergency process if it's
 
00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
recommended and the commissioner has May
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
waive and move forward with that now you
 
00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
can ask Amy where are the specific
 
00:54:16.549 --> 00:54:16.559 align:start position:0%
dollars come from but I believe it's we
 
00:54:18.290 --> 00:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
have several pots even the pot for
 
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid as well in special
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
education I got you thank you I
 
00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:23.940 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and the very last quick
 
00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:25.370 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and the very last quick
question

00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:25.380 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:26.940 align:start position:0%
um you were talking about the charitable
 
00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
trusts and donations I'm just going to
 
00:54:31.609 --> 00:54:31.619 align:start position:0%
refer to this as donations it is my
 
00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
understanding that you said that right
 
00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:35.220 align:start position:0%
now if the School receives donations
 
00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:37.140 align:start position:0%
that would be taken out of the school
 
00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
building Aid if it were three million
 
00:54:40.609 --> 00:54:40.619 align:start position:0%
dollars the state had and it got two
 
00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
your state will only pray one and is
 
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
this a policy you support or would you
 
00:54:47.329 --> 00:54:47.339 align:start position:0%
like to see that change I support well
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
you'll see it's already in one of the
 
00:54:50.569 --> 00:54:50.579 align:start position:0%
bills there we're taking that out
 
00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
charitable gifts insurance policy all
 
00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
that and leaving now we agree that if
 
00:54:58.490 --> 00:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
there's another source of Revenue coming
 
00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
from the state or federal government
 
00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:05.220 align:start position:0%
that will come out of the you know the
 
00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:07.380 align:start position:0%
uh the three million dollars if that two
 
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars was coming from another
 
00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
state Grant or a Federal grant that two
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars would be taken out that
 
00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
was a unanimous vote 20-0 within the
 
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
education committee so your policy
 
00:55:21.049 --> 00:55:21.059 align:start position:0%
proposal would include
 
00:55:23.569 --> 00:55:23.579 align:start position:0%
essentially taking whatever donations
 
00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
could get out of this process that's in
 
00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
this one right here it's in uh zero one
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
zero one seven eight to four five two
 
00:55:32.809 --> 00:55:32.819 align:start position:0%
that will be coming to the house floor I
 
00:55:39.290 --> 00:55:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
so the the school building aid program
 
00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:48.660 align:start position:0%
is a state aid program that intends to
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
help out the local local municipalities
 
00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:53.460 align:start position:0%
or the school districts
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
and that's why that's why it gets it
 
00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
gets funded in in
 
00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:01.630 align:start position:0%
gets funded in in
um

00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:01.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:03.549 --> 00:56:03.559 align:start position:0%
more of a
 
00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
more of a um
 
00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
more or all at once rather than
 
00:56:14.089 --> 00:56:14.099 align:start position:0%
what this thing what this bill proposes
 
00:56:17.650 --> 00:56:17.660 align:start position:0%
is is it sounds more like operational
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
income we we used to not fund it like
 
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
this we used to fund over the life of
 
00:56:24.829 --> 00:56:24.839 align:start position:0%
the of the bond the state did that but
 
00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
what we did it must have been back 2012
 
00:56:32.809 --> 00:56:32.819 align:start position:0%
11. 11. that we changed to put 80 up
 
00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:34.740 align:start position:0%
front that saves the interest on the
 
00:56:37.849 --> 00:56:37.859 align:start position:0%
part of the town so it helps the towns
 
00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
out and that was our primary goal there
 
00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
thank you one follow-up even before that
 
00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
and when it used to pay
 
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
um a percentage of the finance costs
 
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
that that was intended for capital
 
00:56:56.530 --> 00:56:56.540 align:start position:0%
projects and that's where it went
 
00:57:00.049 --> 00:57:00.059 align:start position:0%
what this what I see in this in this
 
00:57:02.030 --> 00:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
proposal here is
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
300 I don't know three hundred dollars
 
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
three hundred dollars
 
00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
per student comes out of the adequacy
 
00:57:11.349 --> 00:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
money and goes to the school district
 
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's it's more like
 
00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
operational revenue and it's it's
 
00:57:20.089 --> 00:57:20.099 align:start position:0%
this this pot is sooner or later
 
00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to grab that for
 
00:57:23.089 --> 00:57:23.099 align:start position:0%
something else
 
00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:25.619 align:start position:0%
that's a possibility unless you you know
 
00:57:27.650 --> 00:57:27.660 align:start position:0%
indicate it such it can't be changed but
 
00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:30.300 align:start position:0%
we did we have used those monies which
 
00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
have been School building when we went
 
00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
that 540 million dollars down the you
 
00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
know the tube when we had the tail that
 
00:57:38.690 --> 00:57:38.700 align:start position:0%
created we were funding everything but
 
00:57:41.569 --> 00:57:41.579 align:start position:0%
monies can be used to offset your debt
 
00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
service if it's related to the school
 
00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
building a Cusco Capital Construction
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
program there's no problem with that and
 
00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:51.780 align:start position:0%
you've had a little discussion on that
 
00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
today and that's a worthy thing to do
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
that you're going to save money in the
 
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
district by paying off your debt uh so
 
00:57:58.319 --> 00:57:59.510 align:start position:0%
district by paying off your debt uh so
but

00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm just concerned about the process
 
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
you're following here it's a giant leap
 
00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:07.740 align:start position:0%
which I I feel that we definitely need
 
00:58:09.049 --> 00:58:09.059 align:start position:0%
more hearing on
 
00:58:10.849 --> 00:58:10.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for I'm sorry go ahead
 
00:58:16.010 --> 00:58:16.020 align:start position:0%
Joe no go ahead you sure oh thank you
 
00:58:18.589 --> 00:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Joe and thanks for doing this
 
00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
this certainly addresses a lot of the
 
00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
things that have been swirling around in
 
00:58:23.089 --> 00:58:23.099 align:start position:0%
my head and if you just forgive me for
 
00:58:25.790 --> 00:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
overstating what is probably obvious and
 
00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:26.990 align:start position:0%
overstating what is probably obvious and
exaggerated

00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
exaggerated
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
um if you're looking you know in your
 
00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:30.780 align:start position:0%
chart here uh with the 38 and a half
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
years potentially the children of the
 
00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
children in the school would be the ones
 
00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
who benefit from this program the way it
 
00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:38.460 align:start position:0%
is several children who are in the
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
school yes so thank you thank you well
 
00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
yeah I thank Texas Aggies because they
 
00:58:47.569 --> 00:58:47.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:47.579 --> 00:58:49.309 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:58:49.309 --> 00:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh you mentioned
 
00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
that uh you replaced a roof and it was
 
00:58:57.410 --> 00:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
an emergency situation uh you didn't
 
00:58:59.450 --> 00:58:59.460 align:start position:0%
have anything in your capital reserve I
 
00:59:01.970 --> 00:59:01.980 align:start position:0%
mean and and let me before you answer
 
00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
let me explain uh Farmington all right
 
00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
he's a poor school which you always uh
 
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
help us out on
 
00:59:12.650 --> 00:59:12.660 align:start position:0%
but we put money aside for roofs matter
 
00:59:15.049 --> 00:59:15.059 align:start position:0%
of fact all the roofs have been recently
 
00:59:15.059 --> 00:59:17.270 align:start position:0%
of fact all the roofs have been recently
uh

00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
renewed uh made up to Snuff the
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
buildings are in pretty good shape one
 
00:59:24.589 --> 00:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
was built in 1950
 
00:59:28.849 --> 00:59:28.859 align:start position:0%
uh the other two 95 and roughly in the
 
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
2000s and you know in a very they're
 
00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
very serviceable and that's one thing we
 
00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
our operational we we keep we keep our
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
buildings up to Snuff they are in very
 
00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:42.420 align:start position:0%
good shape we have a gym we have uh two
 
00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:45.420 align:start position:0%
gymnasiums that we take one which we
 
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
have an ironic situation because one is
 
00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:49.559 align:start position:0%
owned by the town but it's part of the
 
00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
school but nobody let's not say that but
 
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
that was a charitable gift also and the
 
00:59:56.089 --> 00:59:56.099 align:start position:0%
high school
 
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
we had a five and a half million dollar
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
cost to build a high school a donor gave
 
01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
two million dollars towards that and you
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
know and we we got to build hey it uh
 
01:00:08.809 --> 01:00:08.819 align:start position:0%
it's very serviceable but you know if
 
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
you maintain your buildings your
 
01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:12.780 align:start position:0%
buildings were lost a whole lot longer I
 
01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
I agree with you and that's why several
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
years back when we were looking at
 
01:00:21.289 --> 01:00:21.299 align:start position:0%
school building Aid we require any
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
project that is one million dollars or
 
01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:26.460 align:start position:0%
more to have a clerk of the works that's
 
01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
bonded not just your custodian in the
 
01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:31.380 align:start position:0%
building unfortunately when they put the
 
01:00:33.289 --> 01:00:33.299 align:start position:0%
middle school together back in the early
 
01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:35.940 align:start position:0%
90s in Haverhill New Hampshire
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
the clerk of the works was the custodian
 
01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:41.700 align:start position:0%
and change orders came through and ever
 
01:00:43.089 --> 01:00:43.099 align:start position:0%
left and right
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
within our budgets maintenance is a
 
01:00:46.799 --> 01:00:48.370 align:start position:0%
within our budgets maintenance is a
operational

01:00:48.370 --> 01:00:48.380 align:start position:0%
operational
 
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the school district
 
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
and we also put in our budget
 
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
maintenance money but when we have a
 
01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
total roof structurally that wasn't
 
01:01:01.549 --> 01:01:01.559 align:start position:0%
built properly that had the Kiln benting
 
01:01:04.609 --> 01:01:04.619 align:start position:0%
up and into the attic and rotting out
 
01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
everything up there and then going down
 
01:01:09.049 --> 01:01:09.059 align:start position:0%
everything holding that roof up we had
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
to go well beyond a million dollars
 
01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:12.780 align:start position:0%
that's why we put in effect anytime now
 
01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
that there's something that go where
 
01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
you're looking for State money that's
 
01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
above a million bucks you must have a
 
01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:21.180 align:start position:0%
bonded engineer overseeing that project
 
01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:30.829 --> 01:01:30.839 align:start position:0%
I just want to issue an apology I was
 
01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
way out of line in my comments to the
 
01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
representative who and um I will
 
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
apologize to him as well I clearly took
 
01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:48.589 --> 01:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
anything further chair no I I just
 
01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
wanted to I appreciate your thoughts and
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
the the one variable that this hasn't
 
01:01:56.569 --> 01:01:56.579 align:start position:0%
didn't address was the question I asked
 
01:01:56.579 --> 01:01:57.289 align:start position:0%
didn't address was the question I asked
about

01:01:57.289 --> 01:01:57.299 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:01:59.809 --> 01:01:59.819 align:start position:0%
could this pay debt Debt Service
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
and I have a question in that topic for
 
01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
Mickey or anybody that knows under the
 
01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:10.040 align:start position:0%
governor in the government accounting
 
01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.990 align:start position:0%
governor in the government accounting
definitions

01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:15.660 align:start position:0%
do do it capital projects capital
 
01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
I can tell you can easily legislate that
 
01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
debt service on Capital you know bonds
 
01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:28.140 align:start position:0%
can be a permissible use of these funds
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
as far as a technical question like that
 
01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
I see Mr Dunn in the room he would be an
 
01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
expert from the district level to answer
 
01:02:36.289 --> 01:02:36.299 align:start position:0%
questions like that I would defer to him
 
01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:02:40.510 --> 01:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
one more
 
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
Just One Last Question
 
01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.750 align:start position:0%
Just One Last Question
um

01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
I was asking representative Howell about
 
01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
the intent of this process and you know
 
01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:52.140 align:start position:0%
it was about the equity right where
 
01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
right now there are so many school
 
01:02:55.789 --> 01:02:55.799 align:start position:0%
districts that do not get building Aid
 
01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
and they will never qualify for a
 
01:02:58.970 --> 01:02:58.980 align:start position:0%
building Aid under the current process
 
01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:00.920 align:start position:0%
because it's too cumbersome and just
 
01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
impossible to navigate on unreasonably
 
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
hard to navigate will any of these
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
policy proposals that you are talking
 
01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.510 align:start position:0%
policy proposals that you are talking
about

01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
make that system more fair and you know
 
01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:12.299 align:start position:0%
because right now we kind of have a
 
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
system of haves and have-nots in terms
 
01:03:17.329 --> 01:03:17.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:20.329 --> 01:03:20.339 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if it's necessarily haves
 
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
and have-nots it's we had some districts
 
01:03:25.309 --> 01:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
were very sharp and got on the stick
 
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
right after this moratorium and got
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
their applications in uh we had I don't
 
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
know Amy maybe about six or seven which
 
01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
we've uh approved since that time Romney
 
01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
got it seeing that they didn't have any
 
01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
access to the second floor of the
 
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
building and handicapped parents
 
01:03:42.289 --> 01:03:42.299 align:start position:0%
handicapped kids in a wheelchair
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
couldn't access the second floor they
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't get in the building the same
 
01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:50.540 align:start position:0%
thing occurred in in other locations
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
so those were small districts that had
 
01:03:58.069 --> 01:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
median family incomes which are low even
 
01:03:59.690 --> 01:03:59.700 align:start position:0%
though Romney's right outside of
 
01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
Plymouth uh I I don't know if that
 
01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
that's it I think it's more result of
 
01:04:07.849 --> 01:04:07.859 align:start position:0%
the 10 year moratorium we just came
 
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
through and we piled up all these
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
applications and needs and now we're
 
01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
paying the piper for it and we had a
 
01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
bill which I even I think it must have
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
come through here where in in
 
01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:23.640 align:start position:0%
appropriating the dollars or building
 
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
Aid we were requesting that 50 million
 
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
dollars be appropriated for new or or
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
renovation Construction in each year on
 
01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
top of the debt so the debt right now
 
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
the tail we talked about roughly 25
 
01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the two years we're
 
01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:46.260 align:start position:0%
looking at and and so we're using about
 
01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
49 or 50 million dollars for those three
 
01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
projects maybe a little less than maybe
 
01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
some lap over into a project down below
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
so if we continue to do with that
 
01:05:00.109 --> 01:05:00.119 align:start position:0%
process within several years when that
 
01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
tail is low we're going to be seeing 75
 
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars each year for new
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
construction and renovation I think
 
01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
we're just on the edge of going into an
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
era where we will have the funds I'd
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
love to see more money for new
 
01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
construction renovation I don't think
 
01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
we've ever funded it properly I even
 
01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
tried at one point in time to have it
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
become part of adequacy
 
01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:23.220 align:start position:0%
but it's not a part of adequacy and
 
01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:24.780 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
um the the various cases we've had come
 
01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:30.839 align:start position:0%
Londonderry Claremont they never went
 
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
after building a because at that time we
 
01:05:34.370 --> 01:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
had it in separate pot and we were
 
01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
funding building a I I appreciate it I I
 
01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
just need to say that you know I agree
 
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
that the moratorium created difficulties
 
01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:44.700 align:start position:0%
but that's what happens when the state
 
01:05:46.430 --> 01:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
spends money they don't have you've got
 
01:05:49.309 --> 01:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
to pay the piper so I would uh urge
 
01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
future legislatures to never engage in
 
01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
that type from your Visa card with your
 
01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
MasterCard that's the deal
 
01:06:01.609 --> 01:06:01.619 align:start position:0%
right then uh to follow up on that I it
 
01:06:03.309 --> 01:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
kind of stole my thunder
 
01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
I was going to ask you what is your
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
opinion why we have a moratorium and
 
01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much was answered in the
 
01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
last couple of seconds we were trying to
 
01:06:14.030 --> 01:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
pay off that huge debt right that's a
 
01:06:17.569 --> 01:06:17.579 align:start position:0%
simple one 540 million dollars
 
01:06:20.089 --> 01:06:20.099 align:start position:0%
well we at that time we were trying to
 
01:06:23.329 --> 01:06:23.339 align:start position:0%
sell uh state land because uh the budget
 
01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
was so out of balance and we'll have
 
01:06:27.890 --> 01:06:27.900 align:start position:0%
that all done in year 2041.
 
01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
wow thank you oh I have a question for
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
Mickey if you will uh that 50 million in
 
01:06:36.049 --> 01:06:36.059 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:38.700 align:start position:0%
representative Hallsville is that per
 
01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:40.740 align:start position:0%
year in addition to
 
01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
the regular 50 million
 
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
so what this amendment would do is
 
01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate 50 million a year for the
 
01:06:49.210 --> 01:06:49.220 align:start position:0%
new grant program
 
01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
so yes for that
 
01:06:54.529 --> 01:06:54.539 align:start position:0%
it maintains the tail payments and the
 
01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
payments on the bonds that we have for
 
01:06:58.670 --> 01:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
the the projects prior to approved and
 
01:07:01.490 --> 01:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
funded prior to June 30 2023 but the
 
01:07:02.809 --> 01:07:02.819 align:start position:0%
amount that's in the governor's budget
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
for new projects the 48 million or so
 
01:07:06.529 --> 01:07:06.539 align:start position:0%
that representative ladgis referred to
 
01:07:09.410 --> 01:07:09.420 align:start position:0%
would essentially be reduced and just
 
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
would remain in the education trust fund
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
so the amount in the governor's budget
 
01:07:15.529 --> 01:07:15.539 align:start position:0%
for new projects would come out and be
 
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
offset with 50 million dollars a year
 
01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:19.260 align:start position:0%
for the representative whole Amendment
 
01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:22.130 align:start position:0%
for the representative whole Amendment
like

01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:31.789 align:start position:0%
 
thank you

01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:31.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and committee I'll
 
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
just make a couple comments about the
 
01:07:40.010 --> 01:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
hb2 amendment that was mentioned earlier
 
01:07:41.569 --> 01:07:41.579 align:start position:0%
for you to think about my name is Jack
 
01:07:44.210 --> 01:07:44.220 align:start position:0%
Dunn d-u-n-n I am the business
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
administrator for the Concord School
 
01:07:45.839 --> 01:07:47.150 align:start position:0%
administrator for the Concord School
District

01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
District
 
01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:47.870 align:start position:0%
District
um

01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns I would have with
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
the per pupil just an initially hearing
 
01:07:56.329 --> 01:07:56.339 align:start position:0%
this would be how Bond counsel would
 
01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
feel about it as it related to the
 
01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:01.700 align:start position:0%
steadiness of that Revenue
 
01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
in school districts in trying to borrow
 
01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
money they would see that large sum of
 
01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
money they have to look at their total
 
01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
valuation and they only get a percentage
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
of that for debt so for example for
 
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
Concord we're about a four and a half
 
01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
billion dollars for the Concord School
 
01:08:21.289 --> 01:08:21.299 align:start position:0%
District portion of the city because we
 
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
have two school districts so if five
 
01:08:26.150 --> 01:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
percent of that it's about 225 million
 
01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
that's available for us to borrow
 
01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
okay take out your existing debt which
 
01:08:33.169 --> 01:08:33.179 align:start position:0%
is about 40 million now you're down into
 
01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:36.900 align:start position:0%
the about 170s 180s if we have to borrow
 
01:08:38.450 --> 01:08:38.460 align:start position:0%
all that because we have to make a
 
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
payment year of I'm estimating quickly
 
01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
we get under that program about 1.29
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
million a year if it was 300 per student
 
01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:50.460 align:start position:0%
K to 8 and 350 for high school I think
 
01:08:52.849 --> 01:08:52.859 align:start position:0%
is what the representative mentioned so
 
01:08:55.729 --> 01:08:55.739 align:start position:0%
that kind of debt that you would have
 
01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
available now again this is only for one
 
01:08:59.809 --> 01:08:59.819 align:start position:0%
school that we're looking at in Concord
 
01:09:02.329 --> 01:09:02.339 align:start position:0%
we have other schools that are aging
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
hence why we did the three elementary
 
01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
schools back in 2009 because we looked
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
at generations of students that were
 
01:09:11.809 --> 01:09:11.819 align:start position:0%
just going to be under Perpetual
 
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
construction and that's what we were
 
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about and that's why we took
 
01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
advantage of the program before the
 
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
moratorium but that would be my concern
 
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
by creating an annual fee
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
because this is also subject to
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation every two years they're
 
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
going to look at that as risk that if
 
01:09:28.729 --> 01:09:28.739 align:start position:0%
you're dependent on that to make your
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
debt service payments
 
01:09:32.809 --> 01:09:32.819 align:start position:0%
that is going to increase your interest
 
01:09:34.669 --> 01:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
rates that they're going to charge when
 
01:09:36.829 --> 01:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
Bond Council evaluates that Bond and
 
01:09:39.769 --> 01:09:39.779 align:start position:0%
when an investor buys that so that would
 
01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:42.060 align:start position:0%
be the concern I think maybe a hybrid of
 
01:09:44.269 --> 01:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
having something like that but also Alum
 
01:09:48.169 --> 01:09:48.179 align:start position:0%
sum is not a bad idea to look at but um
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
that would be probably my biggest
 
01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.550 align:start position:0%
that would be probably my biggest
concern

01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
um about the reducing and available debt
 
01:09:59.930 --> 01:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so in Concord the
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
three school buildings that you had
 
01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
surplused yeah did anyone value them
 
01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
yep we had them valued and unsold them
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
yep so what we did in Concord is we had
 
01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:19.020 align:start position:0%
three task force one before the
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
consolidation happened because we went
 
01:10:23.090 --> 01:10:23.100 align:start position:0%
from nine elementaries to five and we
 
01:10:24.530 --> 01:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
did that because you were getting down
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
to where you only had one classroom the
 
01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
Eastman School for example only had 97
 
01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:30.470 align:start position:0%
Eastman School for example only had 97
kids

01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
kids
 
01:10:34.189 --> 01:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
10 15 years earlier it had 280 kids it
 
01:10:36.169 --> 01:10:36.179 align:start position:0%
made no sense because you're also
 
01:10:38.030 --> 01:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
helping pay for those buildings as a
 
01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
state and local taxpayer so
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
what we did is we Consolidated from nine
 
01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
down to five and built three new ones
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
with the old schools
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
of the three task force first was
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
educational second was what to do
 
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
um with the buildings that we needed to
 
01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:56.460 align:start position:0%
build whether it was newer renovate and
 
01:10:57.709 --> 01:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
the third was what are we going to do
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
with those buildings because the biggest
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
thing we didn't want was those buildings
 
01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
closed we wanted them the active reuse
 
01:11:05.450 --> 01:11:05.460 align:start position:0%
right away we wanted them primarily on
 
01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
the tax rolls if we could and get them
 
01:11:10.010 --> 01:11:10.020 align:start position:0%
sold so we had them all valued The
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
Walker School which was rebuilt in 1918
 
01:11:16.130 --> 01:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
the original School burnt down that was
 
01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
sold for 980 000 and that money was put
 
01:11:21.050 --> 01:11:21.060 align:start position:0%
into a capital reserve the board was
 
01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
disciplined enough to put it away and
 
01:11:24.649 --> 01:11:24.659 align:start position:0%
say that's for future building project
 
01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
hence is Project number four on your
 
01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
list so we put that money away then you
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
had the Rumford school that was built in
 
01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:33.900 align:start position:0%
1902 that building was sold to a private
 
01:11:35.810 --> 01:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
investor and he's used for non-profits
 
01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
so that is on the tax rolls as well as
 
01:11:40.189 --> 01:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
The Walker School on the tax rolls that
 
01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
sold for about 450 000 and that money
 
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
again put into a capital reserve
 
01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
the Eastman School built in 1878 burnt
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
down rebuilt 1938. that was sold in I'm
 
01:11:55.370 --> 01:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
sorry that we still own and as soon as
 
01:11:57.410 --> 01:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
we moved out boys and glove Boys and
 
01:11:59.209 --> 01:11:59.219 align:start position:0%
Girls Club moved in and they rent that
 
01:12:01.610 --> 01:12:01.620 align:start position:0%
building in service the children in the
 
01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
capital region area and then the Dame
 
01:12:08.689 --> 01:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
school which was built in 1936 we didn't
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
feel that they the valuation of the city
 
01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:13.739 align:start position:0%
of Concord School District portions
 
01:12:16.850 --> 01:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
about 400 4.5 billion the value on the
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
pentacle side is about maybe 500 million
 
01:12:24.010 --> 01:12:24.020 align:start position:0%
even though the Concord School District
 
01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
portion of the taxpayers paid for that
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
school we didn't want to double tax the
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
city of Concord residents we sold that
 
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
building to them for one dollar
 
01:12:39.050 --> 01:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
and in return if they ever try to sell
 
01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
it it reverts back to the school
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
district so nobody's going to gain on
 
01:12:43.850 --> 01:12:43.860 align:start position:0%
anybody but the reason why is they
 
01:12:45.169 --> 01:12:45.179 align:start position:0%
wanted to build a community center on
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
that side of the river and we didn't
 
01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
want to see taking several hundred
 
01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in taxpayer money from
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
the city residents to give it to the
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
school district whose residents also pay
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
school tax uh because we felt that that
 
01:12:59.149 --> 01:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
could move that project along further
 
01:13:01.370 --> 01:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
within a year of Us closing our schools
 
01:13:03.290 --> 01:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
all the buildings were an active reuse
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
were on the tax rolls and that was the
 
01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
goal I'm glad you came in it's a
 
01:13:09.050 --> 01:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
different story than what we heard from
 
01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:10.010 align:start position:0%
different story than what we heard from
the

01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:11.270 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:12.900 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:18.780 align:start position:0%
person ahead of the school
 
01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
said you gave away to and sold one and I
 
01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
thought why are you giving it away when
 
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
you need the asset yeah and we Dame we
 
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
felt was different because it was our
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
sister government the city of Concord
 
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
did you know we are autonomous school
 
01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
board so we are separate from the city
 
01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:37.140 align:start position:0%
but we work very well together because
 
01:13:38.689 --> 01:13:38.699 align:start position:0%
we all have the same people paying the
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
bill I think that was the superintendent
 
01:13:42.770 --> 01:13:42.780 align:start position:0%
that gave us that testimony we gave two
 
01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
away and I thought then you're asking us
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
for more money when that represents
 
01:13:50.209 --> 01:13:50.219 align:start position:0%
money that you gave away no but your
 
01:13:51.770 --> 01:13:51.780 align:start position:0%
testimony is quite different and I think
 
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
you were the one that was working on it
 
01:13:56.090 --> 01:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:14:00.649 --> 01:14:00.659 align:start position:0%
for being here thanks uh
 
01:14:02.810 --> 01:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
what's the equalized evaluation of
 
01:14:04.669 --> 01:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
Concord if you know
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation right four four and
 
01:14:08.810 --> 01:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
a half billion four and a half billion
 
01:14:11.450 --> 01:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
but for the city of concord's school
 
01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
district portion yes right but all of
 
01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
the city I don't know what that is I'm
 
01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
going to say it's close to five because
 
01:14:20.450 --> 01:14:20.460 align:start position:0%
then you gotta count the Merrimack
 
01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:23.719 align:start position:0%
Valley School District and
 
01:14:26.570 --> 01:14:26.580 align:start position:0%
is that under the Concord Banner it's
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
under city of Concord so when we get the
 
01:14:31.370 --> 01:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
ms-1 we get our portion and then
 
01:14:34.010 --> 01:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
Merrimack gets their portion
 
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:45.610 --> 01:14:45.620 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and
 
01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
non-government accounting is called
 
01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:49.149 align:start position:0%
non-government accounting is called
fasby

01:14:49.149 --> 01:14:49.159 align:start position:0%
fasby
 
01:14:55.010 --> 01:14:55.020 align:start position:0%
in the government is Gatsby is Gatsby
 
01:14:57.229 --> 01:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
like Fast be have definitions of what
 
01:15:00.290 --> 01:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
capital in capital projects Capital
 
01:15:02.990 --> 01:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
Investments are yes okay thank you
 
01:15:04.970 --> 01:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
okay very helpful you're welcome
 
01:15:12.649 --> 01:15:12.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:12.659 --> 01:15:20.149 align:start position:0%
 
please

01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
so again for the record my name is Amy
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
Clark and I'm with the Department of
 
01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:25.140 align:start position:0%
Education in the school building aid
 
01:15:28.010 --> 01:15:28.020 align:start position:0%
program falls under my Bureau so I guess
 
01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
I would just want to clarify a couple of
 
01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
things I mean I have tons of notes
 
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
um so this is the first time I've seen
 
01:15:35.689 --> 01:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
this amendment so it's hard to like
 
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
really digest it
 
01:15:41.090 --> 01:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
um I just went through the club right uh
 
01:15:43.970 --> 01:15:43.980 align:start position:0%
so I think that my my short my somewhat
 
01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
long list of questions could probably
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
grow into a couple pages of questions uh
 
01:15:49.729 --> 01:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
after reading it through but
 
01:15:51.890 --> 01:15:51.900 align:start position:0%
um just a couple of things the way I
 
01:15:53.570 --> 01:15:53.580 align:start position:0%
read it again just sitting in my seat
 
01:15:54.770 --> 01:15:54.780 align:start position:0%
just now
 
01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:56.450 align:start position:0%
just now
um

01:15:56.450 --> 01:15:56.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:58.370 --> 01:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
to be clear the department of education
 
01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
does not have that list of 17 projects
 
01:16:02.810 --> 01:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
that you um that we're referring to
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
those projects are not approved by the
 
01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
department those are ranked by the
 
01:16:09.290 --> 01:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
department they don't become approved
 
01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
until other things happen uh Warren
 
01:16:13.490 --> 01:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
articles have passed
 
01:16:15.850 --> 01:16:15.860 align:start position:0%
um they're under a contract with their
 
01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
contractor and they're ready to go so in
 
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
this the line seven it talks about
 
01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh that this would everybody prior to
 
01:16:30.770 --> 01:16:30.780 align:start position:0%
June 30th 2023 that's approved that is
 
01:16:33.410 --> 01:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
not going to include any of the projects
 
01:16:36.410 --> 01:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
on the list of 17. so I just want to
 
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
clarify that that doesn't fund
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
any the way I read it doesn't fund any
 
01:16:44.090 --> 01:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
of the schools on that list
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
quick question if I may think Mr
 
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
chairman and sorry for you know jumping
 
01:16:49.130 --> 01:16:49.140 align:start position:0%
in but
 
01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
I hear what you are saying that
 
01:16:52.669 --> 01:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
technically the word approved does not
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
apply to the ones that we refer to as a
 
01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:56.460 align:start position:0%
proof because they still have to go
 
01:16:59.209 --> 01:16:59.219 align:start position:0%
through the propyl Hoops say that the
 
01:17:01.610 --> 01:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
sponsor or the uh proposed legislation
 
01:17:04.149 --> 01:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
would be whether men that date to 2024
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
you know June 30 2024 with that in
 
01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:11.940 align:start position:0%
effect result in you know the projects
 
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
that we're gonna you know finalize being
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
approved if you know being eligible for
 
01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
the state aid so would they be approved
 
01:17:21.169 --> 01:17:21.179 align:start position:0%
you know if they go through the warrant
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
with the approval application for
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
whichever project should be eligible be
 
01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
complete by June 30 2024.
 
01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:31.020 align:start position:0%
um so if that date was changed to 2024
 
01:17:33.169 --> 01:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
the way I think we would interpret it
 
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
would be if money was appropriated we
 
01:17:37.729 --> 01:17:37.739 align:start position:0%
would start at the top of the list and
 
01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
work down through so we'd offer that
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
money until we ran out
 
01:17:44.810 --> 01:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
um if you made it to 2025 then we would
 
01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
do that for year one of the biennium and
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
again for year two of the biennium which
 
01:17:50.930 --> 01:17:50.940 align:start position:0%
would be an affect the way the law is
 
01:17:53.570 --> 01:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
right now thank you
 
01:17:55.970 --> 01:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
uh so I wanted to point that out that um
 
01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
that I thought that that was um
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
something to
 
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
um and I love I love when people do math
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
problems because it gets us Engineers
 
01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:04.250 align:start position:0%
problems because it gets us Engineers
excited

01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
excited
 
01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
01:18:07.610 --> 01:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
um love that um representative Vlad made
 
01:18:09.709 --> 01:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
an attempt but I I think that he was
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
watching the a game at the time so I'm
 
01:18:16.010 --> 01:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
gonna uh um give him partial credit
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
um I hope he forgives me for that
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
um but the I think I don't have his hand
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
out in front of me but I think I heard
 
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
him say 50 square feet per pupil perhaps
 
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
um I think he might be talking about
 
01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
classroom space so when you look at
 
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
square footage for a building that's
 
01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
probably somewhat accurate per pupil for
 
01:18:36.649 --> 01:18:36.659 align:start position:0%
classroom space but of course the school
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
building is not classroom space
 
01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
um cafeteria space gym space we actually
 
01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
have a term we call tear space which is
 
01:18:46.970 --> 01:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
like all the space the walls take up the
 
01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
hallways and so forth we are really
 
01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
looking at for a small school
 
01:18:55.850 --> 01:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
120 square feet all the way up to about
 
01:18:57.530 --> 01:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
200 square feet
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
so the law actually caps it up to 168
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
square feet it's been a while since
 
01:19:03.770 --> 01:19:03.780 align:start position:0%
we've seen one of those schools that
 
01:19:07.490 --> 01:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
small for that size so I would take
 
01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
those years that he took and at least
 
01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
multiply them by three I did the back
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
calculation I took his same approach
 
01:19:17.090 --> 01:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
which I really love so I might give him
 
01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
some extra credit for that and used his
 
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
same approach and it looked like to
 
01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
compare it to the existing program if
 
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
you were a 30 right now our rates differ
 
01:19:29.209 --> 01:19:29.219 align:start position:0%
between 30 and 60 percent if you were a
 
01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
more affluent community at 30 percent it
 
01:19:34.010 --> 01:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
would take you an equivalent of 66 years
 
01:19:36.890 --> 01:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
then I used 120 square feet per student
 
01:19:39.709 --> 01:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
for high schools that's probably much
 
01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:42.300 align:start position:0%
much higher than that if you're at a 66
 
01:19:46.490 --> 01:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
6 I'm sorry a 60 Grant Community
 
01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
um less affluent it would take 132 years
 
01:19:53.209 --> 01:19:53.219 align:start position:0%
at 120 square feet per pupil at 550 a
 
01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:59.450 --> 01:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm just trying to wrap my
 
01:20:01.370 --> 01:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
head around what you are saying and you
 
01:20:03.530 --> 01:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure I understood it
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
correctly you are saying that basically
 
01:20:09.050 --> 01:20:09.060 align:start position:0%
if we spread the same amount of money
 
01:20:10.490 --> 01:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
that we are currently spending on
 
01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
building Aid and we send it equally to
 
01:20:17.209 --> 01:20:17.219 align:start position:0%
all schools that would result in
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
basically um you know this uh
 
01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:21.890 align:start position:0%
basically um you know this uh
funding

01:20:21.890 --> 01:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:20:24.890 --> 01:20:24.900 align:start position:0%
not even coming close to the level of
 
01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
funding that we currently give to a
 
01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
school that gets approved that's correct
 
01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:20:32.090 --> 01:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
um I'll just repeat my numbers in case
 
01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to do that again but it's
 
01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
my numbers were quickly based on
 
01:20:40.610 --> 01:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
um 120 square feet per per student at
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
550 square feet uh 550 dollars per
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
square foot which is about what we're at
 
01:20:47.810 --> 01:20:47.820 align:start position:0%
I mean because all of those numbers
 
01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
would change with inflation and so forth
 
01:20:52.669 --> 01:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
but right would you agree I mean my my
 
01:20:55.490 --> 01:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
personal opinion is that indicates that
 
01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
that whole system of Have and Have Nots
 
01:20:59.689 --> 01:20:59.699 align:start position:0%
is pretty much built into the system
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
because I hear you say and I don't want
 
01:21:03.530 --> 01:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
to put words in your mouth I'm genuinely
 
01:21:06.050 --> 01:21:06.060 align:start position:0%
trying to understand this
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
would it be fair to say that
 
01:21:12.169 --> 01:21:12.179 align:start position:0%
that indicates that at the current level
 
01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
of funding we would never be able to
 
01:21:16.130 --> 01:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
equity and equitably help everybody
 
01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
because we basically you know would need
 
01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
way more funds to just keep paying these
 
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
levels of building Aid if everybody
 
01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
would be applying that is a fair
 
01:21:28.010 --> 01:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
statement yes I appreciate it and as I
 
01:21:29.870 --> 01:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
said I'm I'm trying really hard to wrap
 
01:21:31.130 --> 01:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
my head around this because it's
 
01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
complicated and I don't want to
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
misunderstand or mistake something that
 
01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
you said so I appreciate you taking the
 
01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:38.450 align:start position:0%
you said so I appreciate you taking the
time

01:21:38.450 --> 01:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
um another one of my comments I just
 
01:21:41.450 --> 01:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out I representative
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
Buco I think mentioned this was um
 
01:21:45.169 --> 01:21:45.179 align:start position:0%
comparing Capital costs to operational
 
01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
costs when I read this bill it does
 
01:21:49.729 --> 01:21:49.739 align:start position:0%
speak to me a little bit more like you
 
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
were saying operationally
 
01:21:54.649 --> 01:21:54.659 align:start position:0%
um If This Were because for Capital
 
01:21:56.810 --> 01:21:56.820 align:start position:0%
we're really talking about
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
um saving this money you know if this
 
01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
had been in place 40 years ago and
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
nobody touched that money I'm looking
 
01:22:05.870 --> 01:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
around the room nobody touched that
 
01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
money for 40 years yeah maybe that
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
program would if it was adequately
 
01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
funded be a reasonable amount of money
 
01:22:14.810 --> 01:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
for schools to tap into
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
um how that happens probably this bill
 
01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
would need to flush that out on how it
 
01:22:22.490 --> 01:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't disappear in 40 years
 
01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
um however if it was more of an
 
01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
operational fund uh maintenance fund
 
01:22:29.630 --> 01:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
then that actually might make sense
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
because schools are using
 
01:22:33.890 --> 01:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
um boiler Replacements roof Replacements
 
01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
window repair things like that it does
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
seem like more of a an operational setup
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
than a capital setup but not that
 
01:22:44.570 --> 01:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
there's not a way to do it but just that
 
01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
that was my thought on it as well and
 
01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:55.610 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:22:55.610 --> 01:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:58.420 --> 01:22:58.430 align:start position:0%
uh I think somebody asked about
 
01:22:58.430 --> 01:22:58.790 align:start position:0%
uh I think somebody asked about
[Music]

01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:02.390 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:05.330 --> 01:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
temporary classrooms emergency repairs
 
01:23:06.890 --> 01:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
and a lot of that stuff is in the
 
01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
building Aid law temporary classrooms
 
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
building Aid doesn't pay for there's a
 
01:23:13.370 --> 01:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
lot of things that probably could be
 
01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:15.300 align:start position:0%
fleshed out and and trying to make sure
 
01:23:16.610 --> 01:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
that you're targeting the things that
 
01:23:19.550 --> 01:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
you're looking to Target uh and then I
 
01:23:21.649 --> 01:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
guess I'll just say that I'm I'm happy
 
01:23:23.689 --> 01:23:23.699 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions if you have
 
01:23:26.630 --> 01:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
questions about the program
 
01:23:30.910 --> 01:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
to that point if we did if we did use
 
01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
Gatsby definitions would that satisfy
 
01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
the instead of trying to Define all
 
01:23:40.490 --> 01:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
these things can be used for if we if we
 
01:23:43.250 --> 01:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
just said section session such of gasbee
 
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with it I mean I'd have
 
01:23:47.570 --> 01:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
to read through it to see if and the
 
01:23:48.770 --> 01:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
only thing that I would be able to say
 
01:23:50.930 --> 01:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
is whether it's similar to building Aid
 
01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
and versus what you know maybe that
 
01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
maybe even if it's not similar to
 
01:23:55.550 --> 01:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
building Aid you're still that's still
 
01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
something you'd want to Target
 
01:24:00.770 --> 01:24:00.780 align:start position:0%
um and and maybe this is the intent but
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
um I'll also say that um a lot of times
 
01:24:05.810 --> 01:24:05.820 align:start position:0%
uh the focus in our school buildings is
 
01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:08.820 align:start position:0%
the gymnasium uh it is what people that
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
drives uh some of the funding so uh if
 
01:24:13.970 --> 01:24:13.980 align:start position:0%
that really is left up to the community
 
01:24:15.890 --> 01:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
to tip into those funds whenever they
 
01:24:17.630 --> 01:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
want I think you may see some really
 
01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
nice gyms
 
01:24:22.010 --> 01:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
um whereas uh building Aid there are a
 
01:24:24.530 --> 01:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
lot of myths on building Aid
 
01:24:25.970 --> 01:24:25.980 align:start position:0%
um I was trying to think of a good
 
01:24:28.370 --> 01:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
analogy the other day and um I think it
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
was well anyway so you know essentially
 
01:24:33.770 --> 01:24:33.780 align:start position:0%
the you know I
 
01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
I'm putting myself on record saying this
 
01:24:37.790 --> 01:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
I realize this but um essentially like
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
I'm holding a bunch of acorns right and
 
01:24:42.169 --> 01:24:42.179 align:start position:0%
these acorns like represent square
 
01:24:44.450 --> 01:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
footage for schools and we only have so
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
much that we give up to schools
 
01:24:48.649 --> 01:24:48.659 align:start position:0%
um and we we treat them all the same
 
01:24:51.229 --> 01:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
what they do with their local portion
 
01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
and if they want to go gather more
 
01:24:55.010 --> 01:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
acorns they can we don't prohibit them
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
from doing that but we are not paying
 
01:24:59.390 --> 01:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
for a bigger school for one District
 
01:25:01.310 --> 01:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
versus another District now
 
01:25:03.530 --> 01:25:03.540 align:start position:0%
theoretically like
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
um it will be bigger because it's based
 
01:25:08.030 --> 01:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
on more students or I think or more
 
01:25:10.130 --> 01:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
special education spaces but they're all
 
01:25:13.010 --> 01:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
playing on the same set of rules and I
 
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify that that
 
01:25:17.090 --> 01:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
um that I'm not giving any more acorns
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
to anybody else but they may be asking
 
01:25:23.209 --> 01:25:23.219 align:start position:0%
for more acorns so um so there I I have
 
01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
officially embarrassed myself so I like
 
01:25:28.850 --> 01:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
the Acres you're welcome thank you Mr
 
01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:34.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:36.890 --> 01:25:36.900 align:start position:0%
again I'm coming back to My Equity
 
01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
question what do you think skips the
 
01:25:41.930 --> 01:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
squirrels that don't ask for our acorns
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
from coming to you and asking for acorns
 
01:25:46.729 --> 01:25:46.739 align:start position:0%
and seeing a much longer list of capital
 
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
projects waiting for our funding because
 
01:25:50.810 --> 01:25:50.820 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
right now it seems that there are
 
01:25:54.649 --> 01:25:54.659 align:start position:0%
certain towns that just don't ever
 
01:25:57.290 --> 01:25:57.300 align:start position:0%
either get approved or they never even
 
01:25:59.390 --> 01:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
apply do you have any thoughts on why
 
01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
that may happen because it is a major
 
01:26:04.850 --> 01:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
concern of mine I I do I probably have a
 
01:26:09.290 --> 01:26:09.300 align:start position:0%
strong opinion on that um I I so
 
01:26:11.570 --> 01:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
building Aid has been very volatile and
 
01:26:13.370 --> 01:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
even you know so was it in a moratorium
 
01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
and I realized we talked about the board
 
01:26:17.149 --> 01:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
Army already but even then it doesn't
 
01:26:19.970 --> 01:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
come out with any consistent funding I
 
01:26:21.169 --> 01:26:21.179 align:start position:0%
actually think you have there's three
 
01:26:24.350 --> 01:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
other bills that try to Target that
 
01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
um a minimum level of funding would
 
01:26:30.169 --> 01:26:30.179 align:start position:0%
certainly help schools plan and a
 
01:26:30.179 --> 01:26:31.850 align:start position:0%
certainly help schools plan and a
dedicated

01:26:31.850 --> 01:26:31.860 align:start position:0%
dedicated
 
01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
um fund you know if you I think House
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 actually established a dedicated
 
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.250 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 actually established a dedicated
fund

01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:26:38.930 --> 01:26:38.940 align:start position:0%
um build a building Aid fund I think
 
01:26:42.050 --> 01:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
it's called so having a steady stream of
 
01:26:44.689 --> 01:26:44.699 align:start position:0%
funding a reliable source of funding
 
01:26:47.330 --> 01:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
will allow people allow school districts
 
01:26:50.209 --> 01:26:50.219 align:start position:0%
to plan building Aid has only been out
 
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
of a moratorium now for
 
01:26:54.890 --> 01:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
um for two going on three bienniums so
 
01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:56.410 align:start position:0%
um for two going on three bienniums so
2020

01:26:56.410 --> 01:26:56.420 align:start position:0%
2020
 
01:26:58.669 --> 01:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
you had to apply ahead of time
 
01:27:00.410 --> 01:27:00.420 align:start position:0%
representative Vlad already said House
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
Bill 452 is working we've been working
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
really hard with trying to work with
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
those timelines to kind of help those
 
01:27:09.709 --> 01:27:09.719 align:start position:0%
timelines out but the first biennium is
 
01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
kind of like a wash because nobody knew
 
01:27:13.970 --> 01:27:13.980 align:start position:0%
building Aid was coming out of a
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
moratorium so then the second biennium
 
01:27:18.770 --> 01:27:18.780 align:start position:0%
which now we're
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
um is the biennium we're in right now is
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
this really the first shot that schools
 
01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
had at applying for building Aid I had
 
01:27:28.490 --> 01:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
there's a two-step process in applying
 
01:27:30.229 --> 01:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
for building Aid one is you submit a
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
letter called an intent to fund letter
 
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
that letter was due January of 2020.
 
01:27:40.729 --> 01:27:40.739 align:start position:0%
January of 2020 I had 50 schools tell me
 
01:27:42.110 --> 01:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
that they were going to apply for
 
01:27:45.229 --> 01:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
building Aid come July of 2020 when you
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
actually have to submit the application
 
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
there was only 12 applicants that
 
01:27:52.490 --> 01:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
submitted applications so obviously
 
01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
priorities have shifted a lot so I think
 
01:27:56.940 --> 01:27:58.070 align:start position:0%
priorities have shifted a lot so I think
um

01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:00.290 --> 01:28:00.300 align:start position:0%
the the goal I think with the
 
01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:02.820 align:start position:0%
legislation is to build a list of
 
01:28:05.149 --> 01:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
schools and have that list for you all
 
01:28:09.169 --> 01:28:09.179 align:start position:0%
to see what the ask is uh and for them
 
01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:12.300 align:start position:0%
to get picked off as they go and if that
 
01:28:14.810 --> 01:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
list was established we could do that we
 
01:28:17.110 --> 01:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
now have a list of 17 I think House Bill
 
01:28:20.229 --> 01:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
452 especially with the amendment will
 
01:28:22.729 --> 01:28:22.739 align:start position:0%
allow that list to flow a little bit
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
better and for schools to say if you
 
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
were really needed the state's help
 
01:28:30.890 --> 01:28:30.900 align:start position:0%
you'll get in line if you don't you then
 
01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
you might go ahead and build on your own
 
01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:34.370 align:start position:0%
you might go ahead and build on your own
which

01:28:34.370 --> 01:28:34.380 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:35.090 align:start position:0%
which
um

01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
which is obviously a local decision
 
01:28:38.990 --> 01:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
whether that they'd want to do that just
 
01:28:41.570 --> 01:28:41.580 align:start position:0%
a very quick follow-up
 
01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
you said you know if you don't need
 
01:28:46.090 --> 01:28:46.100 align:start position:0%
States help
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
obviously Windham did build a project
 
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
without State help and we knew full well
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
we were not gonna get any
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
would you say that's the only reason why
 
01:28:56.450 --> 01:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
schools don't apply or are there are
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
other reasons for you know smaller
 
01:29:00.530 --> 01:29:00.540 align:start position:0%
school districts to never apply even
 
01:29:02.450 --> 01:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
though they may need School help
 
01:29:05.149 --> 01:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
uh I think so I I care what you're
 
01:29:07.149 --> 01:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
saying I'm sure that other towns wanted
 
01:29:10.850 --> 01:29:10.860 align:start position:0%
would appreciate that Assistance or
 
01:29:13.370 --> 01:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
um want that to be added to their their
 
01:29:16.010 --> 01:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
reduce their tax rates as well but I
 
01:29:19.129 --> 01:29:19.139 align:start position:0%
think other schools uh
 
01:29:23.209 --> 01:29:23.219 align:start position:0%
the house bill 452 I think allows those
 
01:29:25.250 --> 01:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
schools to stay on the list so even
 
01:29:27.770 --> 01:29:27.780 align:start position:0%
though smaller projects will start to
 
01:29:30.590 --> 01:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
creep up the list so I hope that schools
 
01:29:32.450 --> 01:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
will be able to take that message of oh
 
01:29:34.490 --> 01:29:34.500 align:start position:0%
we might not be able to build in next
 
01:29:37.970 --> 01:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
year but we maybe by year three we'll
 
01:29:39.770 --> 01:29:39.780 align:start position:0%
get our project built
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
um and I think that they would be
 
01:29:42.649 --> 01:29:42.659 align:start position:0%
applying for building Aid if they knew
 
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
that that list was going to be built
 
01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:45.590 align:start position:0%
that that list was going to be built
upon

01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
upon
 
01:29:50.770 --> 01:29:50.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:55.370 --> 01:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
yeah I know I I've been thinking and I
 
01:29:56.990 --> 01:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
was going to ask you a question yeah
 
01:30:01.129 --> 01:30:01.139 align:start position:0%
maybe that light's on but this one is no
 
01:30:03.370 --> 01:30:03.380 align:start position:0%
uh oh
 
01:30:07.370 --> 01:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
you're thinking go ahead yeah
 
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
20 years ago
 
01:30:12.050 --> 01:30:12.060 align:start position:0%
we were looking at things that sizes of
 
01:30:13.970 --> 01:30:13.980 align:start position:0%
the schools in different sizes
 
01:30:16.910 --> 01:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
I thought we'd passed as a law
 
01:30:19.610 --> 01:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
elementary schools 120 square feet per
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
pupil middle schools 140 square feet per
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
pupil and high school's 160 square feet
 
01:30:28.850 --> 01:30:28.860 align:start position:0%
there was some acreage in there as well
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
I argued that at the time in my own town
 
01:30:34.129 --> 01:30:34.139 align:start position:0%
of Kingston where they were building a
 
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
school for 200 square feet per pupil and
 
01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
I thought this is really crazy and
 
01:30:41.689 --> 01:30:41.699 align:start position:0%
there's been problems ever since with
 
01:30:43.729 --> 01:30:43.739 align:start position:0%
leaving a whole Wing empty and now
 
01:30:45.129 --> 01:30:45.139 align:start position:0%
they've moved the
 
01:30:47.689 --> 01:30:47.699 align:start position:0%
Middle School into the what had been the
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
high school because this mismanagement
 
01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
that was going on
 
01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
you didn't mention those figures are you
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
still using them we are yes and a matter
 
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
of fact there's three other figures
 
01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
because it depends on if you're you have
 
01:31:00.410 --> 01:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
a population of more than 250 students
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
or less than 250 but yes the that range
 
01:31:04.850 --> 01:31:04.860 align:start position:0%
is still exists in law and that's the
 
01:31:07.129 --> 01:31:07.139 align:start position:0%
range we use and that 550 per square
 
01:31:10.010 --> 01:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
foot seems awful higher this piece from
 
01:31:12.790 --> 01:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative Ladd that says
 
01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
295 square feet per pupil uh so that
 
01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:18.900 align:start position:0%
wasn't square footage but um cost is
 
01:31:20.990 --> 01:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about as full cost
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
um us construction costs right now
 
01:31:27.410 --> 01:31:27.420 align:start position:0%
um it it depends on whether you're
 
01:31:29.629 --> 01:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
talking about construction costs or
 
01:31:32.530 --> 01:31:32.540 align:start position:0%
project costs construction costs run
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
about 250 dollars square foot right now
 
01:31:38.930 --> 01:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
um we've had that's Pro that doesn't
 
01:31:40.729 --> 01:31:40.739 align:start position:0%
include um construction costs are
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
probably 12 percent higher now than they
 
01:31:44.510 --> 01:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
were last year so those are last year's
 
01:31:46.669 --> 01:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
numbers so we're getting close to 300 a
 
01:31:48.830 --> 01:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
square foot for construction project
 
01:31:51.530 --> 01:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
costs include architect engineering fees
 
01:31:53.689 --> 01:31:53.699 align:start position:0%
site work site development Furniture
 
01:31:56.270 --> 01:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
fixtures equipment legal fees so forth
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
that brings you closer to 250 uh closer
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
to 550 square foot on average thank you
 
01:32:07.250 --> 01:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:09.530 --> 01:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:32:11.050 --> 01:32:11.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:32:14.930 --> 01:32:14.940 align:start position:0%
as always very helpful
 
01:32:22.490 --> 01:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:24.290 --> 01:32:24.300 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any additional
 
01:32:29.570 --> 01:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:32.750 --> 01:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
01:32:36.110 --> 01:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
that being the case uh
 
01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:37.729 align:start position:0%
that being the case uh
oh

01:32:37.729 --> 01:32:37.739 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:32:40.189 --> 01:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
I thought you were heading out I don't
 
01:32:40.199 --> 01:32:41.590 align:start position:0%
I thought you were heading out I don't
know

01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:32:44.209 --> 01:32:44.219 align:start position:0%
Mark manganello Bureau of school finance
 
01:32:46.250 --> 01:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
department of education I haven't had
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
much time to look over this amendment
 
01:32:49.790 --> 01:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
but just a couple things uh to point out
 
01:32:51.890 --> 01:32:51.900 align:start position:0%
to think about
 
01:32:55.250 --> 01:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
um the bill allocates the funding based
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
on admr average daily membership in
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
Residence so that goes to where the
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
student lives within a particular School
 
01:33:03.770 --> 01:33:03.780 align:start position:0%
District not where the student is
 
01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:06.300 align:start position:0%
educated so we have um I didn't do the
 
01:33:07.850 --> 01:33:07.860 align:start position:0%
math but we have approximately about we
 
01:33:09.770 --> 01:33:09.780 align:start position:0%
have 180 school districts approximately
 
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
and about 15 of those school districts
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
don't have schools so they tuition all
 
01:33:15.709 --> 01:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
their students they're financially
 
01:33:17.450 --> 01:33:17.460 align:start position:0%
responsible for educating the students
 
01:33:19.370 --> 01:33:19.380 align:start position:0%
so the District of Albany sends all
 
01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
their students to Conway the school
 
01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
district of Conway the District of
 
01:33:24.649 --> 01:33:24.659 align:start position:0%
Albany does not have a school but they
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
are financially responsible for
 
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
educating the students that live in
 
01:33:28.610 --> 01:33:28.620 align:start position:0%
Albany and so they happen to have
 
01:33:30.110 --> 01:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
tuition agreement with another school
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
district and they send those students to
 
01:33:34.669 --> 01:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
that school district if this amendment
 
01:33:37.570 --> 01:33:37.580 align:start position:0%
were to pass and it funds based on admr
 
01:33:40.790 --> 01:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
Albany would receive money money that
 
01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
according to the amendment is restricted
 
01:33:44.450 --> 01:33:44.460 align:start position:0%
to be spent on Capital expenditures but
 
01:33:47.149 --> 01:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
Albany does not have a school so a
 
01:33:49.250 --> 01:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
potential consideration would be to
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
allocate based on adma where the student
 
01:33:54.110 --> 01:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
is educated not where the student is
 
01:33:57.470 --> 01:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
living so just a technical thing to to
 
01:33:59.870 --> 01:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
chew on there another thing to think
 
01:34:02.330 --> 01:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
about and um I've I've passed the
 
01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
amendment over to Dr Ray
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
I do not set uh the department of
 
01:34:09.169 --> 01:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
education does not Implement tax policy
 
01:34:11.810 --> 01:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
dra implements tax policy so this would
 
01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
have ramifications for tax policy that I
 
01:34:16.189 --> 01:34:16.199 align:start position:0%
don't know how dra would would
 
01:34:18.530 --> 01:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
implement it but one of the questions I
 
01:34:20.209 --> 01:34:20.219 align:start position:0%
would have for Dra and and they would
 
01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
work with the Department of Education as
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
far as how this would impact school
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
taxes is if we give out 50 million
 
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
dollars in fiscal year 24 all of the
 
01:34:31.550 --> 01:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
budgets for fiscally not all the budgets
 
01:34:33.169 --> 01:34:33.179 align:start position:0%
a bunch of districts have just had town
 
01:34:34.490 --> 01:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
meeting they've set their budgets for
 
01:34:36.649 --> 01:34:36.659 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24. if they did not
 
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate money for a capital reserve
 
01:34:40.370 --> 01:34:40.380 align:start position:0%
fund which this funding is designed to
 
01:34:41.870 --> 01:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
go to
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be an appropriation so
 
01:34:44.750 --> 01:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
there would be Revenue coming in without
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
an appropriation and the question I
 
01:34:49.310 --> 01:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
would have for Dra is would dra apply
 
01:34:51.169 --> 01:34:51.179 align:start position:0%
that automatically against the tax rate
 
01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
I would say no because it's restricted
 
01:34:56.930 --> 01:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
but that's something dra would need to
 
01:34:59.570 --> 01:34:59.580 align:start position:0%
think about so
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
having this go on fiscal year 24 with
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
the budgets already in place a city can
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
do Appropriations on demand they get the
 
01:35:07.850 --> 01:35:07.860 align:start position:0%
legislative body together
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
um of districts most districts most
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
school districts they have to have a
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
town meeting to get an appropriation so
 
01:35:16.189 --> 01:35:16.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure for fiscal year 24 most
 
01:35:17.689 --> 01:35:17.699 align:start position:0%
Appropriations have been set at town
 
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
meeting where they're having town
 
01:35:21.169 --> 01:35:21.179 align:start position:0%
meeting this Saturday they'll have it um
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
before the budget passes likely
 
01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:25.070 align:start position:0%
before the budget passes likely
um

01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:26.510 --> 01:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
just something to consider about there's
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
always this tax implication whenever you
 
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
give out Revenue in a year in which the
 
01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
Appropriations have already been set it
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
creates tax rate setting challenges so
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
just a couple two things to think about
 
01:35:37.679 --> 01:35:38.830 align:start position:0%
just a couple two things to think about
it

01:35:38.830 --> 01:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:35:41.689 --> 01:35:41.699 align:start position:0%
I just um wanted to ask you and thank
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:47.930 --> 01:35:47.940 align:start position:0%
emergency projects come to mind right no
 
01:35:50.209 --> 01:35:50.219 align:start position:0%
money appropriated you have to ask for
 
01:35:51.890 --> 01:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
aid from the state and obviously you
 
01:35:54.649 --> 01:35:54.659 align:start position:0%
have to appropriate it does that require
 
01:35:56.930 --> 01:35:56.940 align:start position:0%
a special meeting
 
01:35:59.090 --> 01:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
there's I believe there's a provision in
 
01:36:02.570 --> 01:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
RSA third I think it's 3211 uh 32 colon
 
01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
11 where you can have an emergency you
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
can have the commissioner approve it but
 
01:36:07.850 --> 01:36:07.860 align:start position:0%
you have to have a revenue source to
 
01:36:09.770 --> 01:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
back it so if the state were to give you
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
money for an emergency project you could
 
01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
you could it's a streamlined process
 
01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
where the commissioner can basically
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
authorize it
 
01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
um I think Commissioner of dra and
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
education authorizes it
 
01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
um under the municipal Finance act
 
01:36:26.090 --> 01:36:26.100 align:start position:0%
um that's a very unique situation so if
 
01:36:28.430 --> 01:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
you had a a terrible thing happen but
 
01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:30.300 align:start position:0%
you had money to come in then you could
 
01:36:31.850 --> 01:36:31.860 align:start position:0%
have the appropriation on a streamlined
 
01:36:34.010 --> 01:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
fashion to get the money in the normal
 
01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
emergency process is to do it's it's RSA
 
01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
197 colon 3 you have to go petition a
 
01:36:42.050 --> 01:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
judge to say we need additional
 
01:36:43.729 --> 01:36:43.739 align:start position:0%
Appropriations those Appropriations come
 
01:36:46.370 --> 01:36:46.380 align:start position:0%
from taxpayers not a backed Revenue
 
01:36:46.380 --> 01:36:47.510 align:start position:0%
from taxpayers not a backed Revenue
Source

01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
Source
 
01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
um you have to have a town meeting you
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
have to get a judge to approve it you
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
have to get 50 voter turnout that's the
 
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
normal process thank you just a very
 
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up
 
01:36:58.490 --> 01:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
so if say we you know at some point
 
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
decided to do this technically uh we you
 
01:37:03.410 --> 01:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
don't foresee any issues if the funds
 
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
will start coming in the second year of
 
01:37:06.169 --> 01:37:06.179 align:start position:0%
the bi anymore just talking about
 
01:37:08.570 --> 01:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
concerns about money in the first year
 
01:37:10.189 --> 01:37:10.199 align:start position:0%
of the biennium where the appropriation
 
01:37:12.709 --> 01:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
process is already complete yeah in this
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
particular concern for uh as far as how
 
01:37:18.410 --> 01:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
to manage this from a tax rate setting
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
perspective it gets more complicated for
 
01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 it will be less
 
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
complicated in the future years era will
 
01:37:26.810 --> 01:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
still need to set a policy as far as how
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
they want to manage this but but it
 
01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:30.300 align:start position:0%
becomes more complicated and after the
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
budget's already been set
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
sure yeah thank you thank you for being
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
here uh couldn't you uh modify 3211
 
01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
and just allow it for this Kappa Reserve
 
01:37:46.129 --> 01:37:46.139 align:start position:0%
fund and have to allow the special
 
01:37:46.139 --> 01:37:47.750 align:start position:0%
fund and have to allow the special
meeting

01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
and you know within within 3211. um
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
within 32 11 or within hb2 within um
 
01:37:56.209 --> 01:37:56.219 align:start position:0%
within this amendment if you wanted to
 
01:37:56.219 --> 01:37:58.189 align:start position:0%
within this amendment if you wanted to
say

01:37:58.189 --> 01:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
um the governing body if you wanted to
 
01:38:02.629 --> 01:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
Grant the ultimately the state has full
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
authority to give power to the political
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
subdivision so if you wanted to say
 
01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
something to the effect of
 
01:38:10.910 --> 01:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
the governing body shall have the uh
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
authority to appropriate this funding
 
01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
something like that in this bill that
 
01:38:17.629 --> 01:38:17.639 align:start position:0%
would make the appropriation there
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
without going through the legislative
 
01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:20.270 align:start position:0%
without going through the legislative
body

01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
body
 
01:38:23.090 --> 01:38:23.100 align:start position:0%
um well I uh if I if I made interrupt
 
01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
here you need you need a warrant to
 
01:38:27.770 --> 01:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
establish a capital reserve fund correct
 
01:38:30.890 --> 01:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
so I mean that's we could do it within
 
01:38:32.810 --> 01:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
hp2 then you could do it with yeah you
 
01:38:34.250 --> 01:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
could create a new process that doesn't
 
01:38:36.050 --> 01:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
involve you could create a more
 
01:38:37.310 --> 01:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
streamlined process than current current
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
law it'll end up in 32 basically though
 
01:38:42.169 --> 01:38:42.179 align:start position:0%
right I mean it sort of
 
01:38:46.189 --> 01:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
32 is your budget law 32 32 just has a
 
01:38:48.110 --> 01:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
particular provision that where you'd
 
01:38:50.689 --> 01:38:50.699 align:start position:0%
want to put that what you're describing
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
you might want to put it in a different
 
01:38:54.590 --> 01:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
RSA but but you could put it into law
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you and a quick follow-up since we
 
01:38:59.330 --> 01:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
are already dipping the weeds we may as
 
01:39:02.090 --> 01:39:02.100 align:start position:0%
well dig a little bit deeper
 
01:39:04.189 --> 01:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
um obviously this issue arises from the
 
01:39:05.810 --> 01:39:05.820 align:start position:0%
fact that we would be sending the money
 
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
to the town the state would hand the
 
01:39:08.930 --> 01:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
money off to the town and the town would
 
01:39:12.770 --> 01:39:12.780 align:start position:0%
need an appropriate place to hold it
 
01:39:15.770 --> 01:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
um is there any other situation where
 
01:39:18.169 --> 01:39:18.179 align:start position:0%
you've seen the state you know say this
 
01:39:19.729 --> 01:39:19.739 align:start position:0%
is the money that I want to send you
 
01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
once you have your vehicle I will send
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
it to you and in the meantime I'll hold
 
01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
it or would that be a very Arcane and
 
01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
strange solution I'm just trying to
 
01:39:30.110 --> 01:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
think out loud and I know I may end up
 
01:39:32.209 --> 01:39:32.219 align:start position:0%
in a bad corner but so it's it's
 
01:39:32.219 --> 01:39:33.890 align:start position:0%
in a bad corner but so it's it's
typically

01:39:33.890 --> 01:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
typically
 
01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
uh most grants operate on a
 
01:39:37.070 --> 01:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
reimbursement basement so the
 
01:39:38.689 --> 01:39:38.699 align:start position:0%
expenditure is already there
 
01:39:41.330 --> 01:39:41.340 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not aware of any grant that this
 
01:39:43.729 --> 01:39:43.739 align:start position:0%
grant is novel in a sense that it it's
 
01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:46.860 align:start position:0%
it's it's creates a it's funding for a
 
01:39:49.010 --> 01:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
reserve fund and so just basically to
 
01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
feed a reserve fund all you need is an
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
appropriation at the local level so
 
01:39:54.050 --> 01:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
that's that's the only missing component
 
01:39:55.610 --> 01:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
no most grants are done on an
 
01:39:57.169 --> 01:39:57.179 align:start position:0%
expenditure reimbursement basis so the
 
01:39:58.610 --> 01:39:58.620 align:start position:0%
expenditure is already there the
 
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
expenditure is there then the
 
01:40:00.890 --> 01:40:00.900 align:start position:0%
Appropriations already there then the
 
01:40:01.790 --> 01:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
revenue is going to back the
 
01:40:04.189 --> 01:40:04.199 align:start position:0%
appropriation and it's just a a wash but
 
01:40:05.629 --> 01:40:05.639 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit unique I'm just
 
01:40:07.850 --> 01:40:07.860 align:start position:0%
trying to figure it out because as you
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
said you do need a word Antarctica you
 
01:40:11.450 --> 01:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
know whether it's in a special meeting
 
01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
or in a regular meeting to create that
 
01:40:15.649 --> 01:40:15.659 align:start position:0%
capital reserve fund and there is a
 
01:40:17.570 --> 01:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
theoretical possibility voters in a town
 
01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
strangers may be they would not approve
 
01:40:21.950 --> 01:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
this vehicle to keep money from the
 
01:40:24.110 --> 01:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
state and then what and I did a quick
 
01:40:25.790 --> 01:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
analysis it looks about half of school
 
01:40:27.050 --> 01:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
districts have money in a capital
 
01:40:28.370 --> 01:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
reserve fund
 
01:40:32.629 --> 01:40:32.639 align:start position:0%
so so some some districts and a school a
 
01:40:33.590 --> 01:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
district that doesn't have a school
 
01:40:34.729 --> 01:40:34.739 align:start position:0%
would have no interest in a capital
 
01:40:37.010 --> 01:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
reserve fund um so some districts do not
 
01:40:44.510 --> 01:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:55.970 --> 01:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:55.980 --> 01:40:57.410 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:40:57.410 --> 01:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:41:04.370 --> 01:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
well based on the testimony we've heard
 
01:41:08.270 --> 01:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
today I think this needs a little more
 
01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:09.530 align:start position:0%
today I think this needs a little more
homework

01:41:09.530 --> 01:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
homework
 
01:41:11.390 --> 01:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
so I don't think we're in a position to
 
01:41:13.010 --> 01:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
take any action on this at this time
 
01:41:15.290 --> 01:41:15.300 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr chair I
 
01:41:17.810 --> 01:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
heartedly I also
 
01:41:20.990 --> 01:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
a pretty big task already
 
01:41:22.850 --> 01:41:22.860 align:start position:0%
I think maybe we've allocated enough
 
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
expense of resources in time today to
 
01:41:27.410 --> 01:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
this issue and maybe
 
01:41:29.810 --> 01:41:29.820 align:start position:0%
considering the other work before us we
 
01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:30.709 align:start position:0%
considering the other work before us we
should

01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
um move on consider moving on
 
01:41:36.770 --> 01:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
we will break for lunch and Hope
 
01:41:44.870 --> 01:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
now through to next November and that we
 
01:41:50.030 --> 01:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
get some we get some support from
 
01:41:52.250 --> 01:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
Finance people here to be on that
 
01:41:53.629 --> 01:41:53.639 align:start position:0%
because we're looking at all these
 
01:41:55.010 --> 01:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
topics and issues and I really
 
01:41:57.709 --> 01:41:57.719 align:start position:0%
appreciate the admr and adma issue
 
01:41:59.870 --> 01:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
whereas we have a number of kids up my
 
01:42:02.270 --> 01:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
way their High School experience is in
 
01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:03.229 align:start position:0%
way their High School experience is in
Vermont

01:42:03.229 --> 01:42:03.239 align:start position:0%
Vermont
 
01:42:05.090 --> 01:42:05.100 align:start position:0%
and we're certainly not going to be
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
funding uh Capital costs in Vermont and
 
01:42:10.189 --> 01:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
yet they have no High School within
 
01:42:13.310 --> 01:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
their K-8 district and but they have
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
they have 9 through 12 students that
 
01:42:18.770 --> 01:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
they tuition out uh so that's a huge
 
01:42:20.450 --> 01:42:20.460 align:start position:0%
issue right here that was just brought
 
01:42:21.649 --> 01:42:21.659 align:start position:0%
up that you were going to have to
 
01:42:24.890 --> 01:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
sometime how Rectify that but I'd we are
 
01:42:28.609 --> 01:42:28.619 align:start position:0%
going forward with this study and and uh
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
without having to have any commission or
 
01:42:32.270 --> 01:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
committee set up by the legislature
 
01:42:34.010 --> 01:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
we're doing it as a subcommittee of a
 
01:42:36.649 --> 01:42:36.659 align:start position:0%
bill we have I welcome people to attend
 
01:42:39.290 --> 01:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
and work with us on that
 
01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
just a quick question thank you Mr chair
 
01:42:43.729 --> 01:42:43.739 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking the
 
01:42:43.739 --> 01:42:45.229 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking the
question

01:42:45.229 --> 01:42:45.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:42:47.629 --> 01:42:47.639 align:start position:0%
when we talk about school districts that
 
01:42:49.850 --> 01:42:49.860 align:start position:0%
tuition out their students right would
 
01:42:52.970 --> 01:42:52.980 align:start position:0%
it be a fair statement to say that the
 
01:42:54.770 --> 01:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
costs for maintaining the building by
 
01:42:57.410 --> 01:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
whatever District educates the kids are
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
passed to the town that you know pay
 
01:43:01.729 --> 01:43:01.739 align:start position:0%
tuition in one form or another
 
01:43:04.189 --> 01:43:04.199 align:start position:0%
well I was talking primarily about those
 
01:43:05.810 --> 01:43:05.820 align:start position:0%
which were sending the St Johnsbury
 
01:43:09.709 --> 01:43:09.719 align:start position:0%
Academy up in St Johnsbury Vermont uh
 
01:43:12.169 --> 01:43:12.179 align:start position:0%
we're paying around at twenty thousand
 
01:43:14.209 --> 01:43:14.219 align:start position:0%
twenty point two thousand dollar tuition
 
01:43:15.410 --> 01:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
costs I'm sure they're building
 
01:43:18.290 --> 01:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
something in but that's an independent
 
01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:19.250 align:start position:0%
something in but that's an independent
school

01:43:19.250 --> 01:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:43:21.649 --> 01:43:21.659 align:start position:0%
that's approved by the state of New
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the state of Vermont so it
 
01:43:27.470 --> 01:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
it's just a complicated issue how we
 
01:43:32.270 --> 01:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:34.490 --> 01:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
it's taking our note yeah thank you
 
01:43:37.070 --> 01:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:43:39.770 --> 01:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
thank you again for being here and
 
01:43:42.229 --> 01:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
you'll probably in your travels
 
01:43:45.709 --> 01:43:45.719 align:start position:0%
all right uh have you heard of a bottom
 
01:43:47.330 --> 01:43:47.340 align:start position:0%
to the waterfall
 
01:43:49.970 --> 01:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
of the decrease in population of a
 
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
number of students in the state because
 
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
that you know
 
01:43:55.370 --> 01:43:55.380 align:start position:0%
I don't know I don't know where it's
 
01:43:57.890 --> 01:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
going but there is a bottom that uh
 
01:44:01.129 --> 01:44:01.139 align:start position:0%
somebody predicting uh we're seeing that
 
01:44:03.050 --> 01:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
waterfall effect throughout New England
 
01:44:05.570 --> 01:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
we're not just seeing it in K through 12
 
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
our colleges are really hurting as a
 
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
result of that in fact that's why you
 
01:44:12.530 --> 01:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
see Maine underscoring our tuition rates
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
being they're trying to drag them all
 
01:44:16.910 --> 01:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
over at their in-state tuition now and
 
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
Amherst is doing the same thing and
 
01:44:20.990 --> 01:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
Lowell's doing the same thing to us so
 
01:44:24.109 --> 01:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
uh this is a huge huge issue our
 
01:44:26.330 --> 01:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
demographic you know it was up to 210
 
01:44:28.729 --> 01:44:28.739 align:start position:0%
215 000 kids when we started here
 
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
exactly and now we're down what 160 4
 
01:44:34.729 --> 01:44:34.739 align:start position:0%
000. it's in it's in 150s actually it's
 
01:44:37.729 --> 01:44:37.739 align:start position:0%
huge according to the commissioner
 
01:44:39.770 --> 01:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
and that's so you haven't heard
 
01:44:42.410 --> 01:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
basically uh well I've heard it hello at
 
01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
the University level that we're dealing
 
01:44:45.169 --> 01:44:45.179 align:start position:0%
with this and we're dealing that's
 
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
impacting our Capital costs too and and
 
01:44:49.189 --> 01:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
what we're doing for new construction
 
01:44:51.770 --> 01:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
and where the emphasis
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
the governor is going to put 9 million
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
in the hockey rink I think that's a
 
01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
great idea but
 
01:44:59.390 --> 01:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
um it's it's uh
 
01:45:01.970 --> 01:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
it's an issue that's compounded
 
01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
everywhere you look and we're also
 
01:45:05.570 --> 01:45:05.580 align:start position:0%
dealing with the issue then like at
 
01:45:08.570 --> 01:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
Plymouth state that they have no housing
 
01:45:11.209 --> 01:45:11.219 align:start position:0%
now for their students uh especially in
 
01:45:13.490 --> 01:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
the Master's level and so they have
 
01:45:16.729 --> 01:45:16.739 align:start position:0%
that's an issue there it's we have these
 
01:45:18.530 --> 01:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
places all through the state which have
 
01:45:20.750 --> 01:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
different needs and and every one of
 
01:45:22.490 --> 01:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
them similar well except for a few
 
01:45:24.530 --> 01:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
schools districts in South where we know
 
01:45:27.050 --> 01:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
the demographic is growing
 
01:45:29.570 --> 01:45:29.580 align:start position:0%
but that's that's a rarity in this state
 
01:45:31.550 --> 01:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
right now it's it's going the other
 
01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
all right thank you after lunch we will
 
01:45:41.169 --> 01:45:41.179 align:start position:0%
be taking up adequacy
 
01:45:43.310 --> 01:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
and also
 
01:45:45.709 --> 01:45:45.719 align:start position:0%
um we've got to finish up
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
so enjoy your lunch we'll see you back
 
01:45:57.590 --> 01:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:16.730 --> 02:59:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:16.740 --> 02:59:26.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:59:26.990 --> 02:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:31.070 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:59:31.070 --> 02:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:43.849 --> 02:59:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:43.859 --> 02:59:53.330 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:59:53.330 --> 02:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:56.530 --> 02:59:56.540 align:start position:0%
we have a sheet that was just passed out
 
02:59:59.030 --> 02:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
looks like this and there's some extras
 
03:00:01.849 --> 03:00:01.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:05.269 --> 03:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
one does have it for anybody that's here
 
03:00:06.650 --> 03:00:06.660 align:start position:0%
who wants to take a look at the same
 
03:00:06.660 --> 03:00:19.250 align:start position:0%
who wants to take a look at the same
thing

03:00:19.250 --> 03:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:23.570 --> 03:00:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:26.389 --> 03:00:26.399 align:start position:0%
and actually Mickey put this together
 
03:00:30.469 --> 03:00:30.479 align:start position:0%
for me based on my wild ideas which I'm
 
03:00:32.389 --> 03:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
now backing off on just so you know up
 
03:00:34.630 --> 03:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
front uh
 
03:00:38.469 --> 03:00:38.479 align:start position:0%
yeah once you hit the total button
 
03:00:40.670 --> 03:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
that wasn't a good idea
 
03:00:40.680 --> 03:00:42.230 align:start position:0%
that wasn't a good idea
uh

03:00:42.230 --> 03:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:00:43.910 --> 03:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
what this is
 
03:00:50.990 --> 03:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:53.450 --> 03:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
so if you remember when we met losing
 
03:00:56.030 --> 03:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
track of days welcome to the Wednesday I
 
03:00:58.130 --> 03:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
think perhaps we discussed the
 
03:00:59.750 --> 03:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
governor's Ed funding formula I walked
 
03:01:01.309 --> 03:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
us through a very detailed spreadsheet
 
03:01:03.769 --> 03:01:03.779 align:start position:0%
of that and that was the one that looked
 
03:01:05.330 --> 03:01:05.340 align:start position:0%
like this
 
03:01:08.030 --> 03:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
and one of the consensuses my takeaway
 
03:01:10.969 --> 03:01:10.979 align:start position:0%
from that day's work session was to
 
03:01:12.830 --> 03:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
run some numbers and see what it looked
 
03:01:16.250 --> 03:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
like if we reduced the increase proposed
 
03:01:18.050 --> 03:01:18.060 align:start position:0%
to the base Aid and the free reduced
 
03:01:21.230 --> 03:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
lunch Aid category of differentiated Aid
 
03:01:23.210 --> 03:01:23.220 align:start position:0%
and allocated those funds in the more
 
03:01:25.309 --> 03:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
targeted Aid components of the formula
 
03:01:27.830 --> 03:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
so this is the taking from the left and
 
03:01:29.150 --> 03:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
adding to the right we've heard that
 
03:01:31.130 --> 03:01:31.140 align:start position:0%
terminology and staying within the
 
03:01:33.410 --> 03:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget
 
03:01:35.570 --> 03:01:35.580 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for the biennium
 
03:01:35.580 --> 03:01:36.769 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for the biennium
so

03:01:36.769 --> 03:01:36.779 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:01:38.630 --> 03:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
I think we've talked about this and
 
03:01:40.250 --> 03:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
those who have done this for years know
 
03:01:42.290 --> 03:01:42.300 align:start position:0%
there's countless ways to do Ed funding
 
03:01:43.730 --> 03:01:43.740 align:start position:0%
there's so many different components so
 
03:01:46.610 --> 03:01:46.620 align:start position:0%
many variables different Grant amounts
 
03:01:49.330 --> 03:01:49.340 align:start position:0%
different thresholds so there's there's
 
03:01:51.650 --> 03:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
almost infinite ways to come up with it
 
03:01:54.170 --> 03:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
so this is just one right so this
 
03:01:55.790 --> 03:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
document here it's a Word document set
 
03:01:57.889 --> 03:01:57.899 align:start position:0%
up and a landscape orientation on the
 
03:02:01.550 --> 03:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
legal I tried to build out breakout
 
03:02:03.050 --> 03:02:03.060 align:start position:0%
rather the different components of the
 
03:02:04.610 --> 03:02:04.620 align:start position:0%
Ed funding formula
 
03:02:06.290 --> 03:02:06.300 align:start position:0%
in the current law
 
03:02:07.910 --> 03:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
the middle represents the governor's
 
03:02:10.429 --> 03:02:10.439 align:start position:0%
recommended budget and the far right
 
03:02:12.349 --> 03:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
represents what I'm calling proposal
 
03:02:14.750 --> 03:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
number one so we've one thing I've
 
03:02:16.610 --> 03:02:16.620 align:start position:0%
learned and Mark can remember this from
 
03:02:18.650 --> 03:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
four years ago if we don't number
 
03:02:20.630 --> 03:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
different scenarios it's really hard to
 
03:02:23.210 --> 03:02:23.220 align:start position:0%
keep track so this was number one so
 
03:02:25.370 --> 03:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
that's so you may see if if I run
 
03:02:26.809 --> 03:02:26.819 align:start position:0%
numbers again over the weekend on Monday
 
03:02:28.550 --> 03:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
maybe I'll have numbers three four and
 
03:02:30.290 --> 03:02:30.300 align:start position:0%
four whatever so I that's that's what
 
03:02:33.349 --> 03:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
number one rep represents there
 
03:02:36.230 --> 03:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
so the main differences here
 
03:02:38.990 --> 03:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
starting on that first row across this
 
03:02:40.610 --> 03:02:40.620 align:start position:0%
is your cost of an adequate education so
 
03:02:42.170 --> 03:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
these are the cost factors your base and
 
03:02:43.969 --> 03:02:43.979 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch special education
 
03:02:45.889 --> 03:02:45.899 align:start position:0%
English language Learners and third
 
03:02:47.450 --> 03:02:47.460 align:start position:0%
grade reading
 
03:02:50.450 --> 03:02:50.460 align:start position:0%
you'll see in current law the amounts
 
03:02:53.510 --> 03:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
are the same in both years and under
 
03:02:55.370 --> 03:02:55.380 align:start position:0%
current law if you recall we have a
 
03:02:57.889 --> 03:02:57.899 align:start position:0%
biennial CPI adjustment which is why the
 
03:02:59.570 --> 03:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
amounts are the same for fiscal 24 and
 
03:02:59.580 --> 03:03:01.610 align:start position:0%
amounts are the same for fiscal 24 and
25.

03:03:01.610 --> 03:03:01.620 align:start position:0%
25.
 
03:03:03.469 --> 03:03:03.479 align:start position:0%
jumping over to the governor's column
 
03:03:05.570 --> 03:03:05.580 align:start position:0%
you'll see the big increase for base so
 
03:03:07.849 --> 03:03:07.859 align:start position:0%
from 3866 up to forty seven hundred
 
03:03:10.610 --> 03:03:10.620 align:start position:0%
dollars and the big increase for fnr so
 
03:03:14.870 --> 03:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
from just under 1933 up to 2500. special
 
03:03:16.550 --> 03:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
education English language Learners
 
03:03:18.950 --> 03:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
remain the same
 
03:03:20.929 --> 03:03:20.939 align:start position:0%
third grade reading is repealed and
 
03:03:22.790 --> 03:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
you'll notice the second year
 
03:03:25.190 --> 03:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal 25 it's different numbers than
 
03:03:26.630 --> 03:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
the first year and that's because the
 
03:03:28.969 --> 03:03:28.979 align:start position:0%
governor's budget includes changing that
 
03:03:31.490 --> 03:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
biennial CPI adjustment to an annual two
 
03:03:35.450 --> 03:03:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:38.469 --> 03:03:38.479 align:start position:0%
on the bottom of that cell you'll see
 
03:03:41.050 --> 03:03:41.060 align:start position:0%
898.9 million and 24
 
03:03:45.769 --> 03:03:45.779 align:start position:0%
916.8 million in 2025 compared to the
 
03:03:47.450 --> 03:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
previous column to the left you'll see
 
03:03:49.070 --> 03:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
there's a that's where most of the jump
 
03:03:51.290 --> 03:03:51.300 align:start position:0%
is if if not really all and the
 
03:03:55.190 --> 03:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget
 
03:03:58.429 --> 03:03:58.439 align:start position:0%
jumping over to proposal number one
 
03:04:01.730 --> 03:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
it basically makes no material changes
 
03:04:04.010 --> 03:04:04.020 align:start position:0%
or significant changes rather to the the
 
03:04:06.050 --> 03:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
amounts except just rounds them up to
 
03:04:09.110 --> 03:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:11.570 --> 03:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
why I did this I don't know the
 
03:04:13.849 --> 03:04:13.859 align:start position:0%
direction to was to essentially take it
 
03:04:15.650 --> 03:04:15.660 align:start position:0%
and I think my brain likes round numbers
 
03:04:20.389 --> 03:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
and rather than having the uh 3 866
 
03:04:22.910 --> 03:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
dollars and 18 cents I thought 3 900 was
 
03:04:25.550 --> 03:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
a nice round number so again all these
 
03:04:27.050 --> 03:04:27.060 align:start position:0%
are variables that can be changed in
 
03:04:28.429 --> 03:04:28.439 align:start position:0%
statute whatever committee the direction
 
03:04:31.070 --> 03:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
the committee wants to go so proposal
 
03:04:32.809 --> 03:04:32.819 align:start position:0%
number one does include
 
03:04:34.790 --> 03:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
an increase to the cost of an adequate
 
03:04:36.950 --> 03:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
education in each of the components base
 
03:04:39.110 --> 03:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
fnr sped and English language learners
 
03:04:41.630 --> 03:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
but not nearly to the extent of the
 
03:04:43.730 --> 03:04:43.740 align:start position:0%
governors which you'll see in that next
 
03:04:47.690 --> 03:04:47.700 align:start position:0%
row down 755 million dollars versus 898
 
03:04:50.090 --> 03:04:50.100 align:start position:0%
but compared to current law it's about 7
 
03:04:52.490 --> 03:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
million Statewide which is somewhat
 
03:04:53.750 --> 03:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
rounding you know and that's what these
 
03:04:56.090 --> 03:04:56.100 align:start position:0%
essentially are is rounded up
 
03:04:57.969 --> 03:04:57.979 align:start position:0%
but also does maintain the two percent
 
03:04:59.990 --> 03:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
annual increase that the governor's
 
03:05:02.389 --> 03:05:02.399 align:start position:0%
budget recommends
 
03:05:04.130 --> 03:05:04.140 align:start position:0%
which you see that breakout in the next
 
03:05:06.710 --> 03:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
subset so Aid component adjustments
 
03:05:08.690 --> 03:05:08.700 align:start position:0%
I talked about the CPI adjustment that's
 
03:05:10.250 --> 03:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
in current law the biennial CPI
 
03:05:13.010 --> 03:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
adjustment the middle column two percent
 
03:05:14.750 --> 03:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
adjustment the governor's recommended
 
03:05:16.610 --> 03:05:16.620 align:start position:0%
house pill to on the cost of an adequate
 
03:05:18.530 --> 03:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
education that first subset we just went
 
03:05:18.540 --> 03:05:19.730 align:start position:0%
education that first subset we just went
through

03:05:19.730 --> 03:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
through
 
03:05:22.429 --> 03:05:22.439 align:start position:0%
in The Proposal I applied the two
 
03:05:24.590 --> 03:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
percent annual adjustment to not only
 
03:05:26.809 --> 03:05:26.819 align:start position:0%
the cost of an adequate education but
 
03:05:28.490 --> 03:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
also to the additional Aid based on free
 
03:05:30.830 --> 03:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch to the fiscal capacity
 
03:05:32.690 --> 03:05:32.700 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid and the extraordinary
 
03:05:34.910 --> 03:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
needs Grant both on the grants and the
 
03:05:37.670 --> 03:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
thresholds so those equalized valuation
 
03:05:40.429 --> 03:05:40.439 align:start position:0%
per pupil thresholds are fixed in
 
03:05:42.710 --> 03:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
statute currently so this two percent
 
03:05:44.929 --> 03:05:44.939 align:start position:0%
would apply to those thresholds which
 
03:05:46.849 --> 03:05:46.859 align:start position:0%
would align with what we usually see for
 
03:05:48.769 --> 03:05:48.779 align:start position:0%
valuations increasing over time and for
 
03:05:51.969 --> 03:05:51.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:51.979 --> 03:05:53.690 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:05:53.690 --> 03:05:53.700 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:05:55.670 --> 03:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
any questions to this point or should I
 
03:05:55.680 --> 03:05:58.849 align:start position:0%
any questions to this point or should I
proceed

03:05:58.849 --> 03:05:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:02.450 --> 03:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:04.370 --> 03:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
never mind sorry we're just discussing
 
03:06:11.210 --> 03:06:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:12.889 --> 03:06:12.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:06:16.309 --> 03:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh making in the first box
 
03:06:18.889 --> 03:06:18.899 align:start position:0%
where it's current law
 
03:06:22.670 --> 03:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
you said both years this is 24 or 25 and
 
03:06:24.410 --> 03:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
both years are the same
 
03:06:26.210 --> 03:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
that's the way current law would be that
 
03:06:28.010 --> 03:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
both years would stay the same under
 
03:06:29.929 --> 03:06:29.939 align:start position:0%
current law the adjustment to those
 
03:06:32.870 --> 03:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
amounts occurs every biennium so that's
 
03:06:35.389 --> 03:06:35.399 align:start position:0%
why it's the same for 24 and 25. thank
 
03:06:35.399 --> 03:06:38.809 align:start position:0%
why it's the same for 24 and 25. thank
you

03:06:38.809 --> 03:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:41.389 --> 03:06:41.399 align:start position:0%
swept and the governors and this
 
03:06:45.769 --> 03:06:45.779 align:start position:0%
proposal won uh from the statutory 363
 
03:06:50.690 --> 03:06:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:53.570 --> 03:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
on page two so this is where I started
 
03:06:53.580 --> 03:06:54.710 align:start position:0%
on page two so this is where I started
to

03:06:54.710 --> 03:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:06:56.630 --> 03:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
try to do what the committee had kind of
 
03:06:58.969 --> 03:06:58.979 align:start position:0%
guided me towards which was targeting
 
03:07:01.190 --> 03:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
some of the AIDS so that first row we
 
03:07:02.929 --> 03:07:02.939 align:start position:0%
went over we really reduced the cost of
 
03:07:04.910 --> 03:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
an adequate education components so now
 
03:07:07.730 --> 03:07:07.740 align:start position:0%
it's reallocating those those dollars to
 
03:07:09.730 --> 03:07:09.740 align:start position:0%
the targeted components so the first is
 
03:07:11.990 --> 03:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
additionally based on frame reduced
 
03:07:13.670 --> 03:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
lunch and I put slash relief funding
 
03:07:13.680 --> 03:07:14.690 align:start position:0%
lunch and I put slash relief funding
because

03:07:14.690 --> 03:07:14.700 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:07:16.790 --> 03:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
relief funding under current law and the
 
03:07:17.929 --> 03:07:17.939 align:start position:0%
additional Aid and free and reduced
 
03:07:20.870 --> 03:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
lunch that's in House Bill 529 are
 
03:07:23.510 --> 03:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
very similar they're almost identical so
 
03:07:26.090 --> 03:07:26.100 align:start position:0%
rather than build out another F and R
 
03:07:28.370 --> 03:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
category I just superseded it
 
03:07:28.380 --> 03:07:29.750 align:start position:0%
category I just superseded it
essentially

03:07:29.750 --> 03:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
03:07:32.570 --> 03:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
so in current law the scale of those
 
03:07:35.990 --> 03:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
grants goes from 150 to 600 per f r
 
03:07:39.050 --> 03:07:39.060 align:start position:0%
student based on how elevated your
 
03:07:40.969 --> 03:07:40.979 align:start position:0%
friend reduce lunch population is among
 
03:07:43.130 --> 03:07:43.140 align:start position:0%
your total students but then that Grant
 
03:07:45.170 --> 03:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
amount is prorated to 17 and a half
 
03:07:46.670 --> 03:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year so that's why
 
03:07:48.469 --> 03:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the far left 17 and a half
 
03:07:50.090 --> 03:07:50.100 align:start position:0%
million per year is associated with
 
03:07:52.429 --> 03:07:52.439 align:start position:0%
relief funding
 
03:07:55.790 --> 03:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
the governor proposed repealing this Aid
 
03:07:57.050 --> 03:07:57.060 align:start position:0%
component so that's why there's nothing
 
03:07:58.370 --> 03:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
here for the Governor's recommended
 
03:08:01.250 --> 03:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
column and then in proposal one this is
 
03:08:03.170 --> 03:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
essentially the language from House Bill
 
03:08:05.750 --> 03:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
529 would replace
 
03:08:07.910 --> 03:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
the relief funding as it is so there
 
03:08:09.110 --> 03:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
would be no
 
03:08:11.929 --> 03:08:11.939 align:start position:0%
17 and a half million dollar proration
 
03:08:13.790 --> 03:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
anyway the formula would just run how it
 
03:08:15.530 --> 03:08:15.540 align:start position:0%
how it runs and based on the data we're
 
03:08:18.170 --> 03:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
using is about 16.7 in the first year
 
03:08:21.950 --> 03:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:24.410 --> 03:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
another component of House Bill 529 was
 
03:08:26.510 --> 03:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity Aid
 
03:08:29.570 --> 03:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
so the amounts on here for the next two
 
03:08:32.990 --> 03:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
components is where I uh
 
03:08:34.730 --> 03:08:34.740 align:start position:0%
just put in plugs for lack of a better
 
03:08:37.370 --> 03:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
term so 350 dollars per pupil but kept
 
03:08:40.250 --> 03:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
the 600 000 to 1.6 million dollar
 
03:08:42.889 --> 03:08:42.899 align:start position:0%
thresholds so this would be 350 per
 
03:08:42.899 --> 03:08:44.030 align:start position:0%
thresholds so this would be 350 per
pupil

03:08:44.030 --> 03:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
pupil
 
03:08:45.830 --> 03:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
and then it would be scaled down to zero
 
03:08:47.750 --> 03:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
depending on where that Town's equalized
 
03:08:50.330 --> 03:08:50.340 align:start position:0%
valuation per pupil fell between 600 000
 
03:08:53.690 --> 03:08:53.700 align:start position:0%
and 1.6 million so Statewide it's 13.7
 
03:08:56.210 --> 03:08:56.220 align:start position:0%
and 15.2 million respectively in fiscal
 
03:08:59.210 --> 03:08:59.220 align:start position:0%
24 and 25.
 
03:09:01.610 --> 03:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
the big targeted component of proposal
 
03:09:03.889 --> 03:09:03.899 align:start position:0%
number one would be extraordinary needs
 
03:09:05.210 --> 03:09:05.220 align:start position:0%
Grant so this is a Formula that
 
03:09:06.469 --> 03:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
currently exists our component that
 
03:09:07.809 --> 03:09:07.819 align:start position:0%
currently exists
 
03:09:11.450 --> 03:09:11.460 align:start position:0%
under current law at 650 per f r student
 
03:09:13.730 --> 03:09:13.740 align:start position:0%
not for every student just per F and R
 
03:09:16.250 --> 03:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
student based on the equalized valuation
 
03:09:18.349 --> 03:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
per F and R pupil that's the difference
 
03:09:20.570 --> 03:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
between extraordinary needs
 
03:09:23.150 --> 03:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
and fiscal capacity disparity Aid so
 
03:09:26.030 --> 03:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Blends equalized
 
03:09:29.269 --> 03:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
valuation and fnr
 
03:09:31.429 --> 03:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
in current law it's about 9.7 million
 
03:09:33.170 --> 03:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
dollars associated with this grant
 
03:09:33.180 --> 03:09:35.090 align:start position:0%
dollars associated with this grant
Statewide

03:09:35.090 --> 03:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
03:09:37.429 --> 03:09:37.439 align:start position:0%
this was uh essentially unchanged and
 
03:09:38.929 --> 03:09:38.939 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget for 24
 
03:09:41.389 --> 03:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
and 25. there are s it does uh
 
03:09:43.610 --> 03:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
accelerate in the future years and 26
 
03:09:46.670 --> 03:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
and Beyond and I'll get to I think I
 
03:09:47.809 --> 03:09:47.819 align:start position:0%
actually have that noted here so
 
03:09:49.969 --> 03:09:49.979 align:start position:0%
beginning in fiscal 26 it's increased by
 
03:09:52.730 --> 03:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
50 each of the next five biennia
 
03:09:55.370 --> 03:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
and I think we've talked about this we
 
03:09:57.110 --> 03:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
usually just do a two-year look in the
 
03:09:59.510 --> 03:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
finance committee I know the department
 
03:10:01.910 --> 03:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
and the governor's office did a 10-year
 
03:10:03.590 --> 03:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
forecast I don't have anything on that
 
03:10:05.570 --> 03:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
for any of the proposals that I'll
 
03:10:09.290 --> 03:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:13.010 --> 03:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
very quickly if you think it's useful if
 
03:10:15.110 --> 03:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
not necessary for this cycle if not
 
03:10:16.610 --> 03:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
necessarily for this cycle because we
 
03:10:18.769 --> 03:10:18.779 align:start position:0%
only have a few days but for future work
 
03:10:21.050 --> 03:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
I I would appreciate if you'd explored
 
03:10:22.730 --> 03:10:22.740 align:start position:0%
with the governor's office if they would
 
03:10:24.290 --> 03:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
want to you know share or work together
 
03:10:26.750 --> 03:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
on those models so maybe we can acquire
 
03:10:29.389 --> 03:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
some that some of that ability to
 
03:10:31.610 --> 03:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
forecast for the longer term I do agree
 
03:10:33.469 --> 03:10:33.479 align:start position:0%
that for this cycle we are we have what
 
03:10:35.750 --> 03:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
we have and we're out of time but maybe
 
03:10:37.849 --> 03:10:37.859 align:start position:0%
for the future that may uh help
 
03:10:40.790 --> 03:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
everybody uh you know see things through
 
03:10:43.910 --> 03:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:47.090 --> 03:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
so proposal number one the equalized
 
03:10:49.610 --> 03:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
valuation per pupil or excuse me for
 
03:10:51.050 --> 03:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch people for
 
03:10:55.070 --> 03:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
Extraordinary needs as a 3 500 per pupil
 
03:10:57.290 --> 03:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
Grant so this is a massive increase this
 
03:10:59.269 --> 03:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
is where most of the targeting and
 
03:11:00.830 --> 03:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
proposal one occurs is in the
 
03:11:03.050 --> 03:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant section so
 
03:11:04.630 --> 03:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
that's where you'll see
 
03:11:07.849 --> 03:11:07.859 align:start position:0%
51.7 million and 54 million as opposed
 
03:11:09.710 --> 03:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
to just under 10 million per year under
 
03:11:11.150 --> 03:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
current law
 
03:11:11.160 --> 03:11:15.710 align:start position:0%
current law
foreign

03:11:15.710 --> 03:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:17.750 --> 03:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
just so you know I'm the one that put my
 
03:11:19.730 --> 03:11:19.740 align:start position:0%
thumb on the scale on this
 
03:11:21.410 --> 03:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
when we were talking about it last week
 
03:11:23.769 --> 03:11:23.779 align:start position:0%
and I said well why don't we try to
 
03:11:26.510 --> 03:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
reconfigure this so that this
 
03:11:30.410 --> 03:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
poor quote poor towns got a bigger
 
03:11:33.410 --> 03:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
piece so that that was my thumb pretty
 
03:11:36.590 --> 03:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
heavy thumb as it turns out
 
03:11:40.969 --> 03:11:40.979 align:start position:0%
question right uh yeah I have uh an
 
03:11:44.870 --> 03:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
issue because free reduced is based on
 
03:11:47.510 --> 03:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
the forms that have turned in
 
03:11:49.490 --> 03:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
and that's a big problem for my school
 
03:11:51.530 --> 03:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
because like I've said before we have
 
03:11:54.170 --> 03:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
about 760 students
 
03:11:58.010 --> 03:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
and 144 have not turned into forms as
 
03:11:59.450 --> 03:11:59.460 align:start position:0%
opposed to last
 
03:12:03.410 --> 03:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
term this proposal makes no
 
03:12:06.110 --> 03:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
no changes to any of that process so so
 
03:12:09.050 --> 03:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
that that issue is a real one that we've
 
03:12:10.490 --> 03:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
discussed a lot in this committee
 
03:12:12.830 --> 03:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
applies to current law the governor's
 
03:12:14.690 --> 03:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
plan and this other proposal so that's
 
03:12:16.490 --> 03:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
not I don't know where the committee
 
03:12:18.410 --> 03:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
wants to go to deal with that situation
 
03:12:22.490 --> 03:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
but I think the the uh value
 
03:12:25.849 --> 03:12:25.859 align:start position:0%
valuation equalized valuation takes that
 
03:12:28.190 --> 03:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
into account that that will but still
 
03:12:30.530 --> 03:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
you're you know your 144 short so that
 
03:12:32.510 --> 03:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
that skews the
 
03:12:34.250 --> 03:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
what what you have
 
03:12:37.490 --> 03:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
by a great margin not a little margin
 
03:12:39.830 --> 03:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
even even with equalized valuation but
 
03:12:42.650 --> 03:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
the equalized valuations I understand it
 
03:12:44.750 --> 03:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
for 529
 
03:12:47.349 --> 03:12:47.359 align:start position:0%
was in lieu of
 
03:12:51.170 --> 03:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
the head count for free right free and
 
03:12:54.950 --> 03:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
reduced right right so it it
 
03:12:57.590 --> 03:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
says this town deserves more because of
 
03:13:01.070 --> 03:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
its valuation per student not how many
 
03:13:03.650 --> 03:13:03.660 align:start position:0%
forms you got right right well that's I
 
03:13:05.030 --> 03:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
just want to make you know I just want
 
03:13:06.349 --> 03:13:06.359 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that's that's what's
 
03:13:08.570 --> 03:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
happening because I I was in agreement
 
03:13:12.469 --> 03:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
with 529 and what Farmington gets
 
03:13:15.469 --> 03:13:15.479 align:start position:0%
so in The Proposal one column the three
 
03:13:17.389 --> 03:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
targeted Aid that I just walked through
 
03:13:19.550 --> 03:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
the relief funding fiscal capacity and
 
03:13:21.110 --> 03:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
then extraordinary needs the easy way to
 
03:13:23.450 --> 03:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
look at those is one is targeted based
 
03:13:25.010 --> 03:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
on just free and reduced lunch one is
 
03:13:26.510 --> 03:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
targeted based on just equalized
 
03:13:28.370 --> 03:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
valuation and the third is targeted on
 
03:13:31.610 --> 03:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
both okay so it this is kind of a wave
 
03:13:33.230 --> 03:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
and when you look at the columns and I
 
03:13:35.210 --> 03:13:35.220 align:start position:0%
don't have a town by town with the
 
03:13:36.650 --> 03:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
details when you look at the columns
 
03:13:38.750 --> 03:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
some towns will get one some will get
 
03:13:40.730 --> 03:13:40.740 align:start position:0%
the other some may get two of the three
 
03:13:42.410 --> 03:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
some may get so it's
 
03:13:44.809 --> 03:13:44.819 align:start position:0%
it's a way to cast a wider net to Target
 
03:13:46.910 --> 03:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
based on those criteria
 
03:13:48.950 --> 03:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
and if you look at this you can see what
 
03:13:53.690 --> 03:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:55.550 --> 03:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
so the other major difference between
 
03:13:57.950 --> 03:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
the this proposal one and the governors
 
03:13:59.630 --> 03:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
and current law is the stabilization
 
03:14:02.510 --> 03:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
Grant so under current law that amount
 
03:14:04.429 --> 03:14:04.439 align:start position:0%
is still the amount calculated back in
 
03:14:06.950 --> 03:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal 12. that's unchanged
 
03:14:08.809 --> 03:14:08.819 align:start position:0%
in the governor's recommended budget the
 
03:14:10.309 --> 03:14:10.319 align:start position:0%
stabilization Grant was repealed
 
03:14:12.349 --> 03:14:12.359 align:start position:0%
completely and replaced with a hold
 
03:14:14.510 --> 03:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
harmless which we'll get to here shortly
 
03:14:17.090 --> 03:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
and then proposal one this assumes a
 
03:14:18.969 --> 03:14:18.979 align:start position:0%
five percent reduction per year
 
03:14:22.610 --> 03:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
so going to a 95 of the stabilization of
 
03:14:26.870 --> 03:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal 24 and 90 of it in fiscal 25.
 
03:14:29.150 --> 03:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
if this committee were to
 
03:14:31.670 --> 03:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
explore a phase out of that we would you
 
03:14:33.230 --> 03:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
would just need to consider what would
 
03:14:35.330 --> 03:14:35.340 align:start position:0%
you want the law to be in fiscal 26 and
 
03:14:37.969 --> 03:14:37.979 align:start position:0%
Beyond so like I said this this I'm only
 
03:14:39.650 --> 03:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
calculating two years at this point but
 
03:14:41.510 --> 03:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
should we draft an amendment for a plan
 
03:14:43.370 --> 03:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
you would want to have some law in place
 
03:14:45.830 --> 03:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
to apply beyond the biennium okay thank
 
03:14:48.410 --> 03:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair Mickey quick question
 
03:14:51.410 --> 03:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
I thought we were the governor's plan
 
03:14:53.750 --> 03:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
was to end the stabilization in 10 years
 
03:14:56.269 --> 03:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
you are saying five percent a year that
 
03:14:58.190 --> 03:14:58.200 align:start position:0%
implies 20 years
 
03:15:01.070 --> 03:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
so the governor's plan eliminates the
 
03:15:03.050 --> 03:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
stabilization Grant the old the one I
 
03:15:04.849 --> 03:15:04.859 align:start position:0%
was into it immediately and replaces it
 
03:15:06.230 --> 03:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
with a whole harmless right that would
 
03:15:07.849 --> 03:15:07.859 align:start position:0%
be phased out in 10 years
 
03:15:10.429 --> 03:15:10.439 align:start position:0%
what this proposal here does is keeps
 
03:15:12.290 --> 03:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
the stabilization Grant as we know it
 
03:15:15.769 --> 03:15:15.779 align:start position:0%
intact less five percent per year
 
03:15:17.450 --> 03:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
so it's you've got the stabilization
 
03:15:19.490 --> 03:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
which was what is an originally a whole
 
03:15:21.110 --> 03:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
harmless but we refer to that as a
 
03:15:23.450 --> 03:15:23.460 align:start position:0%
stabilization the governor eliminates
 
03:15:24.769 --> 03:15:24.779 align:start position:0%
that and replaces it with a new hold
 
03:15:30.070 --> 03:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:33.830 --> 03:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
forget the numbers for now
 
03:15:35.690 --> 03:15:35.700 align:start position:0%
given what happened the last time we
 
03:15:37.550 --> 03:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
tried to keep the stabilization Grant
 
03:15:40.370 --> 03:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
and we remove it over time it may not be
 
03:15:42.650 --> 03:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
a position that I can be comfortable
 
03:15:45.710 --> 03:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
with at all but again conclusions at the
 
03:15:47.750 --> 03:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
end and so on and so forth and you bring
 
03:15:50.929 --> 03:15:50.939 align:start position:0%
up a good point uh six years ago seven
 
03:15:52.429 --> 03:15:52.439 align:start position:0%
years ago or now whatever it was we did
 
03:15:54.230 --> 03:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
a four percent reduction in law lasted
 
03:15:56.530 --> 03:15:56.540 align:start position:0%
two years and was repealed essentially
 
03:16:01.849 --> 03:16:01.859 align:start position:0%
yeah the reason you see a slower burn if
 
03:16:05.150 --> 03:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
you will of the stabilization Grant is
 
03:16:07.190 --> 03:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
my direction when I left the other day
 
03:16:09.170 --> 03:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
was stay within the governor's
 
03:16:11.750 --> 03:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
parameters of total spending but Target
 
03:16:14.030 --> 03:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
Aid and
 
03:16:17.150 --> 03:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
it's hard to Target Aid to towns that
 
03:16:18.710 --> 03:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
rely on the stabilization while also
 
03:16:20.929 --> 03:16:20.939 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the stabilization so to
 
03:16:23.210 --> 03:16:23.220 align:start position:0%
to bring the stabilization down
 
03:16:25.309 --> 03:16:25.319 align:start position:0%
significantly or gone all the way it's
 
03:16:27.050 --> 03:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
near impossible based on the
 
03:16:28.550 --> 03:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
appropriation levels and the governor's
 
03:16:30.170 --> 03:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
recommended budget to give additional
 
03:16:31.969 --> 03:16:31.979 align:start position:0%
money to some of those needier
 
03:16:34.190 --> 03:16:34.200 align:start position:0%
communities so that's why it's like this
 
03:16:36.650 --> 03:16:36.660 align:start position:0%
but again this is uh not a
 
03:16:38.809 --> 03:16:38.819 align:start position:0%
recommendation in any way it's just a
 
03:16:42.250 --> 03:16:42.260 align:start position:0%
illustration appreciated
 
03:16:46.130 --> 03:16:46.140 align:start position:0%
right uh thank you uh does this which
 
03:16:49.250 --> 03:16:49.260 align:start position:0%
which proposal does the chart of towns
 
03:16:52.610 --> 03:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
what's that equal to is that the one the
 
03:16:54.950 --> 03:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
right hand right hand side the right
 
03:16:58.910 --> 03:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:02.510 --> 03:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
so you'll see on that stabilization row
 
03:17:04.790 --> 03:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
about 157 million dollars a year as
 
03:17:05.809 --> 03:17:05.819 align:start position:0%
current law
 
03:17:09.349 --> 03:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
this would go to 149 and 141.7
 
03:17:12.170 --> 03:17:12.180 align:start position:0%
respectively or 24 and 25 so you see
 
03:17:13.990 --> 03:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
that phase out certainly it's still
 
03:17:18.110 --> 03:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
mostly there but again this to to
 
03:17:21.290 --> 03:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
achieve the directives I this is just
 
03:17:23.389 --> 03:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
what this model it maintains most of
 
03:17:25.670 --> 03:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
that stabilization Grant
 
03:17:28.429 --> 03:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
questions that really was my question
 
03:17:33.950 --> 03:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
but it the 149 and the one 41 those are
 
03:17:36.050 --> 03:17:36.060 align:start position:0%
the costs those are costs
 
03:17:38.210 --> 03:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
that's just how much the stabilization
 
03:17:41.210 --> 03:17:41.220 align:start position:0%
grants Statewide would be uh would would
 
03:17:43.190 --> 03:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
total so you'll and the current loss
 
03:17:45.530 --> 03:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
Statewide it's about 157 million dollars
 
03:17:48.710 --> 03:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
in this proposal one it's down to 149
 
03:17:52.429 --> 03:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
and 141. thank you so the whole harmless
 
03:17:54.969 --> 03:17:54.979 align:start position:0%
Grant uh this is where the governor
 
03:17:57.230 --> 03:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
recognized that some towns perhaps would
 
03:17:59.330 --> 03:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
be uh getting less money so there's a
 
03:18:01.429 --> 03:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
whole harmless Grant to ensure that no
 
03:18:04.550 --> 03:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
total adequacy Grant plus swept would be
 
03:18:08.450 --> 03:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
less than what the 2024 preliminary
 
03:18:09.830 --> 03:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
published estimates were by the
 
03:18:11.210 --> 03:18:11.220 align:start position:0%
Department of Education so those came
 
03:18:13.969 --> 03:18:13.979 align:start position:0%
out in November and that is the Baseline
 
03:18:15.410 --> 03:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
for the hold harmless so whatever
 
03:18:17.809 --> 03:18:17.819 align:start position:0%
everything up to this point calculates
 
03:18:20.090 --> 03:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
in the governor's plan if that ends up
 
03:18:21.530 --> 03:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
being less than what they would have
 
03:18:23.510 --> 03:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
received under the published preliminary
 
03:18:25.250 --> 03:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
estimate they get an amount equal to
 
03:18:27.670 --> 03:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
that difference so that's why you'd see
 
03:18:29.990 --> 03:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
many of the towns on the town by town
 
03:18:31.429 --> 03:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
that we went through last week would
 
03:18:33.710 --> 03:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
have zero most of those are attributable
 
03:18:35.630 --> 03:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
to either they're in excess webtown so
 
03:18:37.010 --> 03:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
they're just not impacted by the
 
03:18:39.469 --> 03:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal or they're held
 
03:18:41.690 --> 03:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
harmless so basically everything adding
 
03:18:43.370 --> 03:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
up in House Bill 2 as it came to you
 
03:18:44.870 --> 03:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
would just equal the same amount that
 
03:18:46.250 --> 03:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
they got the year before so that's why
 
03:18:48.710 --> 03:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
that column difference column is zero
 
03:18:50.990 --> 03:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
question yeah this is something I've
 
03:18:52.550 --> 03:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
always been puzzling over and I guess
 
03:18:54.889 --> 03:18:54.899 align:start position:0%
I'm finally brave enough to ask it
 
03:18:54.899 --> 03:18:55.429 align:start position:0%
I'm finally brave enough to ask it
um

03:18:55.429 --> 03:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:57.349 --> 03:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
with regards to
 
03:18:58.550 --> 03:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
you know the history of the
 
03:19:00.349 --> 03:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
stabilization grants with regards to the
 
03:19:02.929 --> 03:19:02.939 align:start position:0%
home heartless Grant with your proposal
 
03:19:05.690 --> 03:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
um where it's going down from 95 90 you
 
03:19:06.950 --> 03:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
know it's there's still a reduction
 
03:19:09.710 --> 03:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
going across time and presumably the
 
03:19:11.210 --> 03:19:11.220 align:start position:0%
schools are still going to need those
 
03:19:13.490 --> 03:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
funds across time so where is the
 
03:19:15.530 --> 03:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
expectation that where is going who's
 
03:19:17.690 --> 03:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
going to fill in those funds that five
 
03:19:19.250 --> 03:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
percent the 10 you know what I mean
 
03:19:20.630 --> 03:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
there's like we're always reducing stuff
 
03:19:22.070 --> 03:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
but the school's not reducing anything
 
03:19:24.530 --> 03:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
so where does that get filled back in
 
03:19:27.590 --> 03:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
so the way and for the record I I know
 
03:19:29.389 --> 03:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
you didn't mean my proposal but this
 
03:19:30.889 --> 03:19:30.899 align:start position:0%
isn't my I know you didn't mean that but
 
03:19:33.230 --> 03:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
for the record not my proposal um what
 
03:19:35.870 --> 03:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
this formula would do is the two percent
 
03:19:38.090 --> 03:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
increase annual increase both in the
 
03:19:39.889 --> 03:19:39.899 align:start position:0%
cost and adequate Education Plus those
 
03:19:41.450 --> 03:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
targeted Aid components are going to go
 
03:19:43.550 --> 03:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
up two percent every year so that'll cut
 
03:19:45.170 --> 03:19:45.180 align:start position:0%
into the stabilization loss over time
 
03:19:46.929 --> 03:19:46.939 align:start position:0%
similar to the governor's approach of
 
03:19:49.550 --> 03:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
enhancing extraordinary needs over a
 
03:19:50.750 --> 03:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
decade while phasing out the whole
 
03:19:50.760 --> 03:19:54.110 align:start position:0%
decade while phasing out the whole
harmless

03:19:54.110 --> 03:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:56.330 --> 03:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
since I'm new just trying to understand
 
03:19:58.849 --> 03:19:58.859 align:start position:0%
this correctly
 
03:19:58.859 --> 03:19:59.690 align:start position:0%
this correctly
um

03:19:59.690 --> 03:19:59.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:02.990 --> 03:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
I think the governor's intent in getting
 
03:20:04.849 --> 03:20:04.859 align:start position:0%
rid of the stabilization grants and
 
03:20:07.190 --> 03:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
replacing it with a different uh you
 
03:20:10.010 --> 03:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
know approach to you know for now to
 
03:20:12.889 --> 03:20:12.899 align:start position:0%
make sure nobody loses dollars out of it
 
03:20:17.110 --> 03:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
was to remove the um very likely
 
03:20:20.450 --> 03:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of our choice to
 
03:20:22.550 --> 03:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
guarantee stabilization Aid at Dollar
 
03:20:24.290 --> 03:20:24.300 align:start position:0%
levels regardless of the number of
 
03:20:27.170 --> 03:20:27.180 align:start position:0%
students which is basically resulting in
 
03:20:29.210 --> 03:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
sometimes getting way more than they
 
03:20:31.070 --> 03:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
should reasonably get but because we
 
03:20:32.870 --> 03:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
made a promise and that's the formula
 
03:20:34.849 --> 03:20:34.859 align:start position:0%
that's what it is and it is my
 
03:20:37.309 --> 03:20:37.319 align:start position:0%
understanding Governor wanted to fix it
 
03:20:38.870 --> 03:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
in a way in which nobody would lose
 
03:20:40.790 --> 03:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
money so we don't have the whole we are
 
03:20:43.730 --> 03:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
getting less money is just
 
03:20:46.429 --> 03:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
changing things so that you know this
 
03:20:48.469 --> 03:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
will slowly get taken out of the system
 
03:20:50.510 --> 03:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
without anybody losing a dollar in the
 
03:20:51.769 --> 03:20:51.779 align:start position:0%
process so
 
03:20:54.050 --> 03:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
do I sorry I'm just trying to wrap my
 
03:20:55.610 --> 03:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
head around it am I under am I
 
03:20:58.309 --> 03:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
characterizing that correctly I I think
 
03:21:01.010 --> 03:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
the governor's office so Adam crapo from
 
03:21:02.450 --> 03:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
the governor's office is here and I
 
03:21:04.610 --> 03:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
think at some point perhaps he can no
 
03:21:06.469 --> 03:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
way I got it speak to the governor's
 
03:21:10.010 --> 03:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
intents could we use the governor's
 
03:21:10.020 --> 03:21:12.050 align:start position:0%
intents could we use the governor's
approach

03:21:12.050 --> 03:21:12.060 align:start position:0%
approach
 
03:21:18.170 --> 03:21:18.180 align:start position:0%
and and on this proposal one
 
03:21:21.170 --> 03:21:21.180 align:start position:0%
and do away with have a substitute for
 
03:21:21.180 --> 03:21:23.389 align:start position:0%
and do away with have a substitute for
stabilization

03:21:23.389 --> 03:21:23.399 align:start position:0%
stabilization
 
03:21:25.969 --> 03:21:25.979 align:start position:0%
because the home holds the stabilization
 
03:21:27.889 --> 03:21:27.899 align:start position:0%
and basically the hold harmless of doing
 
03:21:29.210 --> 03:21:29.220 align:start position:0%
the same thing
 
03:21:33.830 --> 03:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:37.010 --> 03:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
they they the stabilization did the same
 
03:21:38.570 --> 03:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
thing as the whole harmless back in
 
03:21:41.210 --> 03:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
2012. it's it's not quite Apples to
 
03:21:45.190 --> 03:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
Apples any longer so by
 
03:21:47.809 --> 03:21:47.819 align:start position:0%
maintaining the old stabilization and we
 
03:21:49.490 --> 03:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
know that that's based on very old data
 
03:21:51.530 --> 03:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
and very old information and then doing
 
03:21:53.750 --> 03:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
targeted Aid above and beyond that
 
03:21:55.670 --> 03:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
that would generate additional funds
 
03:21:56.870 --> 03:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
going to
 
03:21:59.690 --> 03:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
needier towns in this biennium
 
03:22:02.090 --> 03:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
versus keeping them flat at what current
 
03:22:03.769 --> 03:22:03.779 align:start position:0%
law would have given those needier towns
 
03:22:05.630 --> 03:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
by just doing a whole harmless and
 
03:22:07.730 --> 03:22:07.740 align:start position:0%
that's and that's a policy decision for
 
03:22:09.769 --> 03:22:09.779 align:start position:0%
the committee but that's the that's the
 
03:22:10.910 --> 03:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
main difference of really what you're
 
03:22:12.830 --> 03:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
trying to achieve with with this
 
03:22:16.490 --> 03:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
proposal so just to rephrase if if the
 
03:22:19.730 --> 03:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
higher uh contributions to the town
 
03:22:22.670 --> 03:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
kicks in then the whole hold harmless
 
03:22:26.870 --> 03:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:28.910 --> 03:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
in theory yeah so the more Target the
 
03:22:30.650 --> 03:22:30.660 align:start position:0%
more Aid you do the less hold harmless
 
03:22:32.809 --> 03:22:32.819 align:start position:0%
would be necessary right yeah it's but I
 
03:22:34.250 --> 03:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
can tell you it's
 
03:22:37.309 --> 03:22:37.319 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult for 240 plus
 
03:22:39.590 --> 03:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
communities in their issues to craft a
 
03:22:41.630 --> 03:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
formula and some of those stabilization
 
03:22:44.330 --> 03:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
grants for certain towns are
 
03:22:45.590 --> 03:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna pick on Berlin I always pick
 
03:22:47.389 --> 03:22:47.399 align:start position:0%
on Berlin their their stabilization
 
03:22:49.670 --> 03:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
Grant is a greater dollar amount than
 
03:22:51.170 --> 03:22:51.180 align:start position:0%
their calculated cost of an adequate
 
03:22:51.180 --> 03:22:52.190 align:start position:0%
their calculated cost of an adequate
education

03:22:52.190 --> 03:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:22:55.969 --> 03:22:55.979 align:start position:0%
so to take that entirely away for Berlin
 
03:22:57.769 --> 03:22:57.779 align:start position:0%
and to try to
 
03:22:59.870 --> 03:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
make that up in a targeted Aid component
 
03:23:02.330 --> 03:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
it's it just can't happen not especially
 
03:23:05.030 --> 03:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
within the the appropriation levels in
 
03:23:06.290 --> 03:23:06.300 align:start position:0%
house bill one as they came to the
 
03:23:07.550 --> 03:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
governor's appropriation levels and
 
03:23:10.309 --> 03:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
that's that's part of the issue so
 
03:23:12.410 --> 03:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
it really depends on your policy with
 
03:23:14.150 --> 03:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
this what direction you want to go and
 
03:23:17.090 --> 03:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
how you want to carry carry it on uh but
 
03:23:19.130 --> 03:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
it is a difficult thing for sure okay
 
03:23:20.809 --> 03:23:20.819 align:start position:0%
well let's go through it then we'll
 
03:23:24.290 --> 03:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
revisit so just finishing up quickly
 
03:23:26.510 --> 03:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
hold harmless Grant yes the governor's
 
03:23:28.070 --> 03:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
recommended budget does phase that out
 
03:23:31.729 --> 03:23:31.739 align:start position:0%
over over uh 10 years uh
 
03:23:35.590 --> 03:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
in total 87.1 million in fiscal 24 and
 
03:23:38.030 --> 03:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
79.7 million in fiscal 25 are
 
03:23:40.370 --> 03:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
attributable to the hold harmless in the
 
03:23:41.630 --> 03:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
03:23:44.450 --> 03:23:44.460 align:start position:0%
The Proposal one also carries a hold
 
03:23:47.510 --> 03:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
harmless but it's it's much smaller and
 
03:23:49.910 --> 03:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
mainly because stabilization Grant is
 
03:23:51.889 --> 03:23:51.899 align:start position:0%
still intact so there's a lot more
 
03:23:54.229 --> 03:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
targeted Aid in proposal one which
 
03:23:56.510 --> 03:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
necessitates less of a hold harmless at
 
03:23:57.769 --> 03:23:57.779 align:start position:0%
the end of the day
 
03:24:00.830 --> 03:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
lastly the final row across I summarized
 
03:24:02.570 --> 03:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
the total appropriation including
 
03:24:04.670 --> 03:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
adequacy grants and the swept which is
 
03:24:07.309 --> 03:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
raised locally and retained locally and
 
03:24:09.650 --> 03:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
uh so you can see the governor's budget
 
03:24:12.530 --> 03:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
was about 120 million over the biennium
 
03:24:14.690 --> 03:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
more than current law and this proposal
 
03:24:16.370 --> 03:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
one stays basically at the same level
 
03:24:20.450 --> 03:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:23.870 --> 03:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:26.410 --> 03:24:26.420 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:24:28.670 --> 03:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
if there's any other questions would be
 
03:24:28.680 --> 03:24:34.130 align:start position:0%
if there's any other questions would be
thumb

03:24:34.130 --> 03:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:34.140 --> 03:24:37.610 align:start position:0%
 
s

03:24:37.610 --> 03:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:40.969 --> 03:24:40.979 align:start position:0%
I I want just on the last row on the
 
03:24:42.889 --> 03:24:42.899 align:start position:0%
totals can you just go over what you
 
03:24:46.670 --> 03:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:48.769 --> 03:24:48.779 align:start position:0%
so under current law for the biennium if
 
03:24:50.210 --> 03:24:50.220 align:start position:0%
you made no changes the estimate is
 
03:24:50.220 --> 03:24:51.130 align:start position:0%
you made no changes the estimate is
about

03:24:51.130 --> 03:24:51.140 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:24:54.050 --> 03:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
1.925 billion dollars thank you
 
03:24:55.849 --> 03:24:55.859 align:start position:0%
and and the governor's recommended
 
03:24:58.490 --> 03:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
budget and and what total of uh this
 
03:25:00.650 --> 03:25:00.660 align:start position:0%
proposal one comes out to is about the
 
03:25:03.290 --> 03:25:03.300 align:start position:0%
same just over two billion dollars 2.044
 
03:25:07.870 --> 03:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:10.429 --> 03:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
technical question here
 
03:25:10.439 --> 03:25:11.269 align:start position:0%
technical question here
um

03:25:11.269 --> 03:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:15.469 --> 03:25:15.479 align:start position:0%
since you know the proposals are
 
03:25:17.330 --> 03:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
you know they are similar in dollars
 
03:25:20.150 --> 03:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
right in here so what we try to do with
 
03:25:22.309 --> 03:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
this model is to
 
03:25:24.830 --> 03:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
change priorities of certain you know
 
03:25:26.450 --> 03:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
move funds from one pocket to the other
 
03:25:29.150 --> 03:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
but end up with a similar total budget
 
03:25:31.190 --> 03:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
so we can see that whether the second
 
03:25:31.200 --> 03:25:32.510 align:start position:0%
so we can see that whether the second
proposal

03:25:32.510 --> 03:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
03:25:35.929 --> 03:25:35.939 align:start position:0%
is has more Merit right
 
03:25:38.269 --> 03:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
is that what we're trying to do just you
 
03:25:40.490 --> 03:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
know my my takeaway from our last
 
03:25:42.889 --> 03:25:42.899 align:start position:0%
meeting was to the governor's increase
 
03:25:45.110 --> 03:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
was mainly in the cost of an adequate
 
03:25:47.450 --> 03:25:47.460 align:start position:0%
education portion which is a across the
 
03:25:50.030 --> 03:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
board and to essentially reduce that and
 
03:25:51.950 --> 03:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
then take those funds and Target them so
 
03:25:53.929 --> 03:25:53.939 align:start position:0%
yes but get to the same bottom line so
 
03:25:55.729 --> 03:25:55.739 align:start position:0%
then we have the same bottom line and we
 
03:25:57.229 --> 03:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
can see how the money moves from one
 
03:25:59.929 --> 03:25:59.939 align:start position:0%
town to the other right what what I may
 
03:26:02.030 --> 03:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
ask if at all possible and I know it's
 
03:26:03.769 --> 03:26:03.779 align:start position:0%
not something you have on you right now
 
03:26:06.050 --> 03:26:06.060 align:start position:0%
I know that we already have a list of
 
03:26:07.910 --> 03:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
how the towns do Under the governor
 
03:26:09.590 --> 03:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
proposals and now we have the list of
 
03:26:12.170 --> 03:26:12.180 align:start position:0%
how the towns do here if we could merge
 
03:26:15.170 --> 03:26:15.180 align:start position:0%
those and have them side by side and we
 
03:26:16.910 --> 03:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
may have to go to printing landscape
 
03:26:20.210 --> 03:26:20.220 align:start position:0%
instead of uh this way but it would be
 
03:26:23.150 --> 03:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
kind of nice to see how the money moves
 
03:26:24.830 --> 03:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
around without having to take two
 
03:26:26.690 --> 03:26:26.700 align:start position:0%
separate spreadsheets identify the same
 
03:26:28.250 --> 03:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
town and you know
 
03:26:30.410 --> 03:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
I know not for today but maybe for when
 
03:26:33.349 --> 03:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
we meet tomorrow or yep and I thought of
 
03:26:33.359 --> 03:26:34.250 align:start position:0%
we meet tomorrow or yep and I thought of
that

03:26:34.250 --> 03:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:26:36.170 --> 03:26:36.180 align:start position:0%
too late today to produce but I can
 
03:26:37.550 --> 03:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
certainly put that and that probably
 
03:26:39.830 --> 03:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to at least see the
 
03:26:42.590 --> 03:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
town by Town differences I uh but yes
 
03:26:44.269 --> 03:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
you do have the information on two
 
03:26:46.010 --> 03:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
different documents right now so it's it
 
03:26:48.530 --> 03:26:48.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't do the math yeah so appreciate
 
03:26:48.540 --> 03:26:50.210 align:start position:0%
doesn't do the math yeah so appreciate
it

03:26:50.210 --> 03:26:50.220 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:26:53.570 --> 03:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
Mary thank you Mr chair we had talked a
 
03:26:55.729 --> 03:26:55.739 align:start position:0%
little bit about maybe adding um maybe
 
03:26:58.969 --> 03:26:58.979 align:start position:0%
20 million in each year that biennium is
 
03:27:01.190 --> 03:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
still is that still on the table for
 
03:27:01.200 --> 03:27:02.570 align:start position:0%
still is that still on the table for
discussion

03:27:02.570 --> 03:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
03:27:07.610 --> 03:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:09.469 --> 03:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
that depends where you want to put the
 
03:27:11.809 --> 03:27:11.819 align:start position:0%
20 million so again
 
03:27:14.630 --> 03:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
um this was just an illustration of if
 
03:27:18.110 --> 03:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
you built out 529s if you layered 529 on
 
03:27:20.210 --> 03:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
top of essentially the governor's plan
 
03:27:22.370 --> 03:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
here's a way to do it and spend the same
 
03:27:23.750 --> 03:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
dollars that's a different approach than
 
03:27:26.870 --> 03:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
the governors from here ideally I would
 
03:27:28.610 --> 03:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
have some specifics if you want me to
 
03:27:30.530 --> 03:27:30.540 align:start position:0%
run like a committee consensus for
 
03:27:32.469 --> 03:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
instance rather than be
 
03:27:34.610 --> 03:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
coming up with what I think might be
 
03:27:36.290 --> 03:27:36.300 align:start position:0%
good you know I maybe did that a little
 
03:27:37.309 --> 03:27:37.319 align:start position:0%
bit more than I should have with this
 
03:27:39.469 --> 03:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
one as it is so I'd like it I can tell
 
03:27:41.690 --> 03:27:41.700 align:start position:0%
you this uh in Hampton the tar and
 
03:27:41.700 --> 03:27:43.070 align:start position:0%
you this uh in Hampton the tar and
feathers

03:27:43.070 --> 03:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
feathers
 
03:27:47.030 --> 03:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
are getting in place for their rep
 
03:27:49.250 --> 03:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
because what what this effectively did
 
03:27:51.830 --> 03:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
was take the increase in the base
 
03:27:51.840 --> 03:27:53.330 align:start position:0%
was take the increase in the base
away

03:27:53.330 --> 03:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
away
 
03:27:56.330 --> 03:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
so while it's been stated we're going to
 
03:27:59.150 --> 03:27:59.160 align:start position:0%
increase the base adequacy by X
 
03:28:02.090 --> 03:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
uh this takes it away so I don't I don't
 
03:28:04.250 --> 03:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
get to go back home again
 
03:28:08.570 --> 03:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
so I think it was a well-intended idea
 
03:28:11.630 --> 03:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
not not the right answer
 
03:28:14.690 --> 03:28:14.700 align:start position:0%
because I like living in Hampton so but
 
03:28:16.429 --> 03:28:16.439 align:start position:0%
if you know I think I agree with you
 
03:28:17.690 --> 03:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
about I think that this is a good
 
03:28:19.729 --> 03:28:19.739 align:start position:0%
starting point and it gives for me
 
03:28:22.490 --> 03:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
visually at this point there are levers
 
03:28:24.710 --> 03:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
that we can lift up and down uh with you
 
03:28:26.389 --> 03:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
and on page one
 
03:28:28.190 --> 03:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
um you maintain or this proposal
 
03:28:30.349 --> 03:28:30.359 align:start position:0%
maintains the base of the 3900 as
 
03:28:33.110 --> 03:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
opposed to the 4700 you've got levers
 
03:28:34.849 --> 03:28:34.859 align:start position:0%
now with your program of let's see what
 
03:28:36.590 --> 03:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
it looks like if we move the base up to
 
03:28:38.750 --> 03:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
4200 so there still is an increase
 
03:28:40.550 --> 03:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
overall here but this still leaves more
 
03:28:42.590 --> 03:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
targeted money on this side that we can
 
03:28:44.690 --> 03:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
use for for the other programs to answer
 
03:28:46.610 --> 03:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
that question I asked that question he
 
03:28:49.070 --> 03:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
had an answer for it yeah I'm sure every
 
03:28:51.889 --> 03:28:51.899 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars is 16 million
 
03:28:54.710 --> 03:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
every 100 increase on this is a 16
 
03:29:08.330 --> 03:29:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:09.889 --> 03:29:09.899 align:start position:0%
that's fine I mean that's so that's
 
03:29:22.250 --> 03:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:27.950 --> 03:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:31.010 --> 03:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
an estimate uh without a lot of support
 
03:29:33.349 --> 03:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
this is what we need so I think there's
 
03:29:35.290 --> 03:29:35.300 align:start position:0%
maybe a little room there
 
03:29:41.889 --> 03:29:41.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:51.070 --> 03:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:53.750 --> 03:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
if I may just quickly address the point
 
03:29:55.010 --> 03:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
just made
 
03:29:57.590 --> 03:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
um I think the 16 million was a forecast
 
03:30:00.110 --> 03:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
of what uh the you know we estimate
 
03:30:02.750 --> 03:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
those expenses may be and I think that
 
03:30:05.570 --> 03:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
we do need to keep in mind that you know
 
03:30:08.570 --> 03:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
a law that has a cost and we have to
 
03:30:10.010 --> 03:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
account for that in the budget so I
 
03:30:11.750 --> 03:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
would just look for any funds in other
 
03:30:15.290 --> 03:30:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:17.150 --> 03:30:17.160 align:start position:0%
these are very intriguing discussions
 
03:30:18.650 --> 03:30:18.660 align:start position:0%
right what happens when you move money
 
03:30:20.330 --> 03:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
from the left side to the right side and
 
03:30:21.830 --> 03:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
I think this committee really needs to
 
03:30:23.510 --> 03:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
explore that because
 
03:30:26.510 --> 03:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
it does change the way certain issues
 
03:30:28.190 --> 03:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
may get addressed and it may very well
 
03:30:29.990 --> 03:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
make the formula more fair and I think
 
03:30:31.729 --> 03:30:31.739 align:start position:0%
that's our job to do in the next three
 
03:30:31.739 --> 03:30:33.290 align:start position:0%
that's our job to do in the next three
days

03:30:33.290 --> 03:30:33.300 align:start position:0%
days
 
03:30:36.469 --> 03:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
um but you know I would probably not
 
03:30:39.469 --> 03:30:39.479 align:start position:0%
argue in you know for taking from there
 
03:30:41.450 --> 03:30:41.460 align:start position:0%
EFA funds are in here
 
03:30:44.530 --> 03:30:44.540 align:start position:0%
it's not like those if you
 
03:30:50.210 --> 03:30:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:51.950 --> 03:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
it's out of the trust but I'm talking
 
03:30:53.690 --> 03:30:53.700 align:start position:0%
about the adequacy but you know to your
 
03:30:55.010 --> 03:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
point I would have to argue that it's a
 
03:30:58.429 --> 03:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
guesstimate it's not based in re um real
 
03:31:00.110 --> 03:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
um predictions of the future it's a
 
03:31:02.809 --> 03:31:02.819 align:start position:0%
guesstimate so there's there's a gray
 
03:31:08.650 --> 03:31:08.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:12.190 --> 03:31:12.200 align:start position:0%
I don't care if you get done huh
 
03:31:14.929 --> 03:31:14.939 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair could I just weigh in for a
 
03:31:18.950 --> 03:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
moment um so I represent one of the
 
03:31:21.229 --> 03:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
um excess swept towns
 
03:31:23.210 --> 03:31:23.220 align:start position:0%
um or or towns with a higher property
 
03:31:27.469 --> 03:31:27.479 align:start position:0%
value similarly to you and Hanover New
 
03:31:32.570 --> 03:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and lime and um
 
03:31:37.130 --> 03:31:37.140 align:start position:0%
um it is my Town's commitment to
 
03:31:40.790 --> 03:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
um to not be too overzealous in the you
 
03:31:42.769 --> 03:31:42.779 align:start position:0%
know the governor's proposal our
 
03:31:42.779 --> 03:31:43.849 align:start position:0%
know the governor's proposal our
position

03:31:43.849 --> 03:31:43.859 align:start position:0%
position
 
03:31:45.650 --> 03:31:45.660 align:start position:0%
which I've been told
 
03:31:49.670 --> 03:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
um is that we have an obligation to help
 
03:31:51.650 --> 03:31:51.660 align:start position:0%
the rest of the states poorer
 
03:31:51.660 --> 03:31:52.910 align:start position:0%
the rest of the states poorer
communities

03:31:52.910 --> 03:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
communities
 
03:31:55.250 --> 03:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
with their educational needs and you
 
03:31:58.190 --> 03:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
know part of part of our commitment to
 
03:32:00.110 --> 03:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
our state and you know for our
 
03:32:02.330 --> 03:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
businesses and for our you know
 
03:32:05.090 --> 03:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
educational system is to to make sure
 
03:32:07.070 --> 03:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
the students coming out regardless of
 
03:32:10.849 --> 03:32:10.859 align:start position:0%
what ZIP code can be wonderful workers
 
03:32:12.469 --> 03:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
regardless of where they land in New
 
03:32:13.849 --> 03:32:13.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so
 
03:32:13.859 --> 03:32:14.929 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so
so

03:32:14.929 --> 03:32:14.939 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:32:17.389 --> 03:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
you know hanovers and limes position is
 
03:32:19.250 --> 03:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
that if we have to give a little from
 
03:32:21.349 --> 03:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
our own benefit to help the rest of the
 
03:32:23.030 --> 03:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
state it's only going to help our whole
 
03:32:25.130 --> 03:32:25.140 align:start position:0%
community so we would all benefit in
 
03:32:26.750 --> 03:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
that so
 
03:32:26.760 --> 03:32:27.650 align:start position:0%
that so
um

03:32:27.650 --> 03:32:27.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:30.469 --> 03:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
you know it's not I'm not going to
 
03:32:34.130 --> 03:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
receive the same kind of um pushback or
 
03:32:37.130 --> 03:32:37.140 align:start position:0%
reception as you will receive but I
 
03:32:37.990 --> 03:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
think that there are other
 
03:32:40.010 --> 03:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
representatives and towns across the
 
03:32:41.750 --> 03:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
state who will agree with our position
 
03:32:45.110 --> 03:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
as well is that for everyone who may
 
03:32:45.120 --> 03:32:46.190 align:start position:0%
as well is that for everyone who may
receive

03:32:46.190 --> 03:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
receive
 
03:32:48.769 --> 03:32:48.779 align:start position:0%
a little difficulty with making this
 
03:32:50.809 --> 03:32:50.819 align:start position:0%
decision there will be another town
 
03:32:53.690 --> 03:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
pushing for it so you know as evenly
 
03:32:55.550 --> 03:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
divided as the house is right now I
 
03:32:58.190 --> 03:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
think you can see that to be possibly a
 
03:33:00.469 --> 03:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
very accurate or a true statement in
 
03:33:02.269 --> 03:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
that you know there are plenty of people
 
03:33:05.269 --> 03:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
on both sides of the issue right now
 
03:33:08.269 --> 03:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
yeah just wanted to add that I'm kind of
 
03:33:10.250 --> 03:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
in the same boat as representative as
 
03:33:11.990 --> 03:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative Hayden Phillips I come
 
03:33:14.330 --> 03:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
from a town where if we take money from
 
03:33:15.769 --> 03:33:15.779 align:start position:0%
the left side and put it in the right
 
03:33:17.809 --> 03:33:17.819 align:start position:0%
side I am reducing funding to my own
 
03:33:19.670 --> 03:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
town but
 
03:33:21.710 --> 03:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
um as much as I'm elected by my own town
 
03:33:24.170 --> 03:33:24.180 align:start position:0%
to represent them it's my darn job to
 
03:33:26.710 --> 03:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
make this fair for the entire state so
 
03:33:29.150 --> 03:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
everything is a consideration and
 
03:33:31.070 --> 03:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
obviously I don't want to hurt my town
 
03:33:34.010 --> 03:33:34.020 align:start position:0%
but I think it's our job to do this in
 
03:33:35.809 --> 03:33:35.819 align:start position:0%
the best interest of everybody in the
 
03:33:39.530 --> 03:33:39.540 align:start position:0%
state and you know regardless of the uh
 
03:33:40.910 --> 03:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:33:43.130 --> 03:33:43.140 align:start position:0%
emails I may be getting if anybody's
 
03:33:45.290 --> 03:33:45.300 align:start position:0%
watching and I'm one of the people who
 
03:33:47.210 --> 03:33:47.220 align:start position:0%
actually tell us people what I'm doing
 
03:33:49.070 --> 03:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
in the legislature so sooner or later
 
03:33:51.290 --> 03:33:51.300 align:start position:0%
the questions will be here but again I
 
03:33:53.269 --> 03:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
see our job to do what's right for
 
03:33:55.849 --> 03:33:55.859 align:start position:0%
everybody and you know
 
03:33:58.250 --> 03:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman yeah one of the
 
03:34:00.650 --> 03:34:00.660 align:start position:0%
dirty words in the in the state as far
 
03:34:02.570 --> 03:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
as this concern is donut towns and
 
03:34:06.290 --> 03:34:06.300 align:start position:0%
that's you know if we can do it without
 
03:34:08.870 --> 03:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
being that that that being involved uh
 
03:34:10.670 --> 03:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
you know and and you know I appreciate
 
03:34:12.410 --> 03:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
come from a poor town
 
03:34:14.570 --> 03:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
you know that you're willing to help us
 
03:34:16.969 --> 03:34:16.979 align:start position:0%
out I mean but like stabilization
 
03:34:18.830 --> 03:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
stabilization joke
 
03:34:21.889 --> 03:34:21.899 align:start position:0%
because those numbers are so far off and
 
03:34:23.389 --> 03:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really reflect actually
 
03:34:25.729 --> 03:34:25.739 align:start position:0%
what's happening in the town and I I'm
 
03:34:27.830 --> 03:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
not I'm not going to say why because it
 
03:34:31.190 --> 03:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
would incriminate me but uh I'm like I
 
03:34:34.070 --> 03:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
can be off the stand now Mr chairman
 
03:34:36.590 --> 03:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
Mary just thank Mr chair so it sounds
 
03:34:39.229 --> 03:34:39.239 align:start position:0%
like we all kind of agree on the fact
 
03:34:41.690 --> 03:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to achieve what we had
 
03:34:44.030 --> 03:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
discussed before that we want
 
03:34:46.370 --> 03:34:46.380 align:start position:0%
more Equity
 
03:34:49.670 --> 03:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
um delivered to those communities who
 
03:34:52.969 --> 03:34:52.979 align:start position:0%
are less able that are less able to pay
 
03:34:56.030 --> 03:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
and the question is what is the best
 
03:34:57.769 --> 03:34:57.779 align:start position:0%
route to do that
 
03:35:01.309 --> 03:35:01.319 align:start position:0%
without causing too much heartache in
 
03:35:03.410 --> 03:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
the more wealthy towns
 
03:35:06.290 --> 03:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
and I truly think that maybe thinking
 
03:35:09.550 --> 03:35:09.560 align:start position:0%
just we do have money in the trust fund
 
03:35:13.729 --> 03:35:13.739 align:start position:0%
that we could draw upon and I think
 
03:35:16.130 --> 03:35:16.140 align:start position:0%
first I want to thank Mickey too Mickey
 
03:35:19.070 --> 03:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
has done unbelievable work he's been
 
03:35:21.469 --> 03:35:21.479 align:start position:0%
working on these formula for day and
 
03:35:23.090 --> 03:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
night and he's going way above and
 
03:35:25.490 --> 03:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
beyond I I think we probably have the
 
03:35:27.830 --> 03:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
most Superstar LBA person in the world
 
03:35:31.550 --> 03:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
because he really has worked a lot but
 
03:35:34.389 --> 03:35:34.399 align:start position:0%
um he's given us some potential ideas
 
03:35:38.269 --> 03:35:38.279 align:start position:0%
and now it's up to us to think about
 
03:35:41.269 --> 03:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
if if we truly believe
 
03:35:44.389 --> 03:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
that we all want to see more equitable
 
03:35:47.750 --> 03:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
distribution of funds for those towns
 
03:35:49.490 --> 03:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
that need it the most what's the best
 
03:35:52.010 --> 03:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
way to do it
 
03:35:55.429 --> 03:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
is that our assumption yes
 
03:35:58.130 --> 03:35:58.140 align:start position:0%
thank you uh what what is the five
 
03:36:01.849 --> 03:36:01.859 align:start position:0%
percent uh stabilization equal
 
03:36:04.010 --> 03:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
about 8 million I think somewhere around
 
03:36:04.020 --> 03:36:05.450 align:start position:0%
about 8 million I think somewhere around
there

03:36:05.450 --> 03:36:05.460 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:36:09.050 --> 03:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
was my thought would be to increase the
 
03:36:09.060 --> 03:36:10.370 align:start position:0%
was my thought would be to increase the
base

03:36:10.370 --> 03:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
base
 
03:36:12.170 --> 03:36:12.180 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
03:36:17.150 --> 03:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
by 300 which would equal 38 38 Grand
 
03:36:19.670 --> 03:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
I mean 38 million 38 Grand right yeah
 
03:36:19.680 --> 03:36:21.070 align:start position:0%
I mean 38 million 38 Grand right yeah
right

03:36:21.070 --> 03:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:36:24.530 --> 03:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
and I will say that that number is a
 
03:36:27.349 --> 03:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
a raw number just on the ADM 160 000
 
03:36:29.870 --> 03:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
whatever there depending on what formula
 
03:36:31.190 --> 03:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
you do the rest of the way there could
 
03:36:33.349 --> 03:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
be some netting involved with so if you
 
03:36:34.729 --> 03:36:34.739 align:start position:0%
increase some over here but you still
 
03:36:36.530 --> 03:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
maintain a big hold harmless it may cut
 
03:36:37.670 --> 03:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
into how much you need for the whole
 
03:36:40.429 --> 03:36:40.439 align:start position:0%
harmless and it may net out so uh it's
 
03:36:42.650 --> 03:36:42.660 align:start position:0%
not always an easy math exercise so just
 
03:36:44.389 --> 03:36:44.399 align:start position:0%
add this column and add that one right
 
03:36:45.950 --> 03:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't always sum on the other end
 
03:36:47.330 --> 03:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
just because of some netting that may
 
03:36:48.769 --> 03:36:48.779 align:start position:0%
occur so just putting that disclaimer
 
03:36:52.370 --> 03:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:57.290 --> 03:36:57.300 align:start position:0%
my attitude right now is to increase by
 
03:36:59.030 --> 03:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
48 million I'm sorry I did the math
 
03:37:01.070 --> 03:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
wrong uh
 
03:37:05.450 --> 03:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
48 million in the base
 
03:37:10.250 --> 03:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:10.260 --> 03:37:13.309 align:start position:0%
 
4100

03:37:13.309 --> 03:37:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:16.010 --> 03:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
and then I think that they'll put the
 
03:37:19.010 --> 03:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:22.729 --> 03:37:22.739 align:start position:0%
it may not so for some time I can tell
 
03:37:25.490 --> 03:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
you that you know for excess webtowns
 
03:37:27.650 --> 03:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
for you to get additional money you'd
 
03:37:29.210 --> 03:37:29.220 align:start position:0%
have to no longer be in excess swept
 
03:37:32.210 --> 03:37:32.220 align:start position:0%
town so it really depends on Hampton's
 
03:37:34.729 --> 03:37:34.739 align:start position:0%
it is adding 300 in base enough to kick
 
03:37:36.229 --> 03:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
you over to tip you over to getting a
 
03:37:37.670 --> 03:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
state Grant or are you still going to be
 
03:37:39.530 --> 03:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
in excess swept town and it'll be a
 
03:37:41.210 --> 03:37:41.220 align:start position:0%
different number for Hampton or Hanover
 
03:37:44.269 --> 03:37:44.279 align:start position:0%
or Windham so and but I can run that and
 
03:37:46.370 --> 03:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
see what it looks like I don't think
 
03:37:48.950 --> 03:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
right now
 
03:37:53.570 --> 03:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
that calculation is at the local level
 
03:37:55.550 --> 03:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
I don't think the town the
 
03:37:57.530 --> 03:37:57.540 align:start position:0%
superintendent of schools is sitting
 
03:37:58.790 --> 03:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
there with the calculator you know
 
03:38:01.550 --> 03:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
having an understanding all I with the
 
03:38:03.590 --> 03:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
superintendent of school is seeing is
 
03:38:05.809 --> 03:38:05.819 align:start position:0%
the base is not going to go to 4 700
 
03:38:08.210 --> 03:38:08.220 align:start position:0%
it's going to go to
 
03:38:10.910 --> 03:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
39 here but if we take it to 41 so it's
 
03:38:12.469 --> 03:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
not going to go to 47 it's going to go
 
03:38:13.910 --> 03:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
to 41.
 
03:38:16.190 --> 03:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
and I'll run that but you may end up
 
03:38:18.170 --> 03:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
seeing no change in some of the excess
 
03:38:19.309 --> 03:38:19.319 align:start position:0%
swept towns that's the only thing I'm
 
03:38:22.070 --> 03:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
saying but but if but if but if you want
 
03:38:23.809 --> 03:38:23.819 align:start position:0%
to sell an increase of that or not sell
 
03:38:25.849 --> 03:38:25.859 align:start position:0%
but message that then have that be part
 
03:38:28.130 --> 03:38:28.140 align:start position:0%
of the plan then absolutely I just I'm
 
03:38:30.110 --> 03:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
just looking at one number to say get
 
03:38:33.710 --> 03:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
get the base up to 4 100 and everything
 
03:38:35.809 --> 03:38:35.819 align:start position:0%
else stays the same
 
03:38:38.030 --> 03:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
yeah you know I think we're agreeing I
 
03:38:39.410 --> 03:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
might even propose to go a little bit
 
03:38:41.389 --> 03:38:41.399 align:start position:0%
higher but I think to try to do it that
 
03:38:43.610 --> 03:38:43.620 align:start position:0%
way it's a cell to say we've increased
 
03:38:45.710 --> 03:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
the base adequacy for everybody and we
 
03:38:47.750 --> 03:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
have also increased money for targeted
 
03:38:50.150 --> 03:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
schools and what we do for all the you
 
03:38:51.410 --> 03:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
know for students around the state
 
03:38:53.450 --> 03:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
benefits the entire State regardless of
 
03:38:55.309 --> 03:38:55.319 align:start position:0%
where you live but I agree that we need
 
03:38:57.290 --> 03:38:57.300 align:start position:0%
to you know we can take away the entire
 
03:38:59.150 --> 03:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
increase to the base but I think we can
 
03:39:00.889 --> 03:39:00.899 align:start position:0%
split that difference it's not exactly
 
03:39:03.290 --> 03:39:03.300 align:start position:0%
the right phrase but raise that up and
 
03:39:05.090 --> 03:39:05.100 align:start position:0%
use that extra money to
 
03:39:07.010 --> 03:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
um do the targeted programs and I guess
 
03:39:08.450 --> 03:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
that won't be as much as what you've put
 
03:39:10.550 --> 03:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
in the targeted programs but it's still
 
03:39:12.889 --> 03:39:12.899 align:start position:0%
a way forward and once we have a sense
 
03:39:15.229 --> 03:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
of that as representative he said there
 
03:39:16.550 --> 03:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
may be money in the trust fund that we
 
03:39:18.469 --> 03:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
can use to boost that targeted side of
 
03:39:20.630 --> 03:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
the program
 
03:39:23.870 --> 03:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
yeah if I may ask Mickey because I think
 
03:39:27.889 --> 03:39:27.899 align:start position:0%
this is a reasonable approach and um you
 
03:39:29.330 --> 03:39:29.340 align:start position:0%
know we just gotta figure out the
 
03:39:31.309 --> 03:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
numbers right and we only have a few
 
03:39:33.889 --> 03:39:33.899 align:start position:0%
hours pretty much left
 
03:39:33.899 --> 03:39:34.429 align:start position:0%
hours pretty much left
um

03:39:34.429 --> 03:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:37.070 --> 03:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
so um I just wanted to ask Nikki you
 
03:39:39.830 --> 03:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
know how unwieldy is the spreadsheet is
 
03:39:42.170 --> 03:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
it something that I could maybe ask you
 
03:39:45.229 --> 03:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
to share that you know whatever
 
03:39:47.870 --> 03:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet is generated in a way in
 
03:39:49.929 --> 03:39:49.939 align:start position:0%
which you know you have the
 
03:39:52.550 --> 03:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
parameters of the various changes that
 
03:39:54.889 --> 03:39:54.899 align:start position:0%
you made and I can try to play with the
 
03:39:56.570 --> 03:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
model a little until tomorrow or maybe
 
03:39:58.510 --> 03:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
on a Sunday before we get here because
 
03:40:01.250 --> 03:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
if if we have to ask you to do something
 
03:40:03.110 --> 03:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
and you bring it back to us tomorrow and
 
03:40:04.429 --> 03:40:04.439 align:start position:0%
then we ask you to do one more thing we
 
03:40:06.050 --> 03:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
have two shots to ask you for something
 
03:40:08.570 --> 03:40:08.580 align:start position:0%
before we gotta reach a conclusion if
 
03:40:10.790 --> 03:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
that spreadsheet is manageable
 
03:40:13.490 --> 03:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
we I could you know every member could
 
03:40:15.530 --> 03:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
play with it and say hey I think the
 
03:40:18.050 --> 03:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
best balance is that this this number
 
03:40:20.210 --> 03:40:20.220 align:start position:0%
and we can try to you know figure it out
 
03:40:22.010 --> 03:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
with that is that something that can be
 
03:40:25.070 --> 03:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
shared and handled reasonably well or
 
03:40:27.410 --> 03:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
what is the rule that would prevent that
 
03:40:28.969 --> 03:40:28.979 align:start position:0%
from being shared I don't you know I'm
 
03:40:31.010 --> 03:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
new there's no rule our policy is
 
03:40:32.750 --> 03:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
generally not to share our workbooks
 
03:40:34.610 --> 03:40:34.620 align:start position:0%
just because okay that's fine the
 
03:40:36.410 --> 03:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
quality control really so we just worry
 
03:40:38.630 --> 03:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
about it going out and getting used and
 
03:40:40.729 --> 03:40:40.739 align:start position:0%
looking like oh our LBA calculated this
 
03:40:42.290 --> 03:40:42.300 align:start position:0%
when there could have been something
 
03:40:44.809 --> 03:40:44.819 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not what I use is not
 
03:40:46.370 --> 03:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
really something for public consumption
 
03:40:48.769 --> 03:40:48.779 align:start position:0%
or or another user the alternative to
 
03:40:50.269 --> 03:40:50.279 align:start position:0%
that is for me to get your cell phone
 
03:40:51.889 --> 03:40:51.899 align:start position:0%
number and you should be available in a
 
03:40:53.630 --> 03:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
week but that doesn't mean that we can't
 
03:40:55.370 --> 03:40:55.380 align:start position:0%
talk offline and try to come up with
 
03:40:57.650 --> 03:40:57.660 align:start position:0%
something that may be a tool that a
 
03:40:58.969 --> 03:40:58.979 align:start position:0%
member could use this weekend if you
 
03:41:00.710 --> 03:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
want to try to I appreciate it very much
 
03:41:02.809 --> 03:41:02.819 align:start position:0%
I'm really encouraged Mr chair about
 
03:41:05.030 --> 03:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
where this discussion is going
 
03:41:06.170 --> 03:41:06.180 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to throw another
 
03:41:06.180 --> 03:41:07.309 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to throw another
element

03:41:07.309 --> 03:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
element
 
03:41:09.950 --> 03:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
um in the mix so um
 
03:41:11.929 --> 03:41:11.939 align:start position:0%
my understanding from from our
 
03:41:13.309 --> 03:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
conversation is that it sounds like
 
03:41:15.469 --> 03:41:15.479 align:start position:0%
there's an appetite to
 
03:41:17.090 --> 03:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
if not completely get rid of
 
03:41:20.030 --> 03:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
stabilization to find some sort of happy
 
03:41:22.550 --> 03:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
medium balance in which stabilization
 
03:41:25.370 --> 03:41:25.380 align:start position:0%
can be reduced but you know continue to
 
03:41:28.010 --> 03:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
fall off the the tail
 
03:41:28.020 --> 03:41:28.790 align:start position:0%
fall off the the tail
um

03:41:28.790 --> 03:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:31.969 --> 03:41:31.979 align:start position:0%
you know to be phased out over time and
 
03:41:33.710 --> 03:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
um is there is there I'm asking the
 
03:41:35.389 --> 03:41:35.399 align:start position:0%
committee is there like a comfort level
 
03:41:37.550 --> 03:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
from a starting point maybe we can give
 
03:41:40.490 --> 03:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
Mickey two scenarios to kind of
 
03:41:42.590 --> 03:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
play with the stabilization numbers as
 
03:41:44.269 --> 03:41:44.279 align:start position:0%
well so that when we're looking at this
 
03:41:46.309 --> 03:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
new base we also have
 
03:41:49.550 --> 03:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
you know like a stabilization at 50 or a
 
03:41:51.710 --> 03:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
stabilization at 75 percent or you know
 
03:41:53.809 --> 03:41:53.819 align:start position:0%
whatever it is to start looking at what
 
03:41:55.729 --> 03:41:55.739 align:start position:0%
that number would look like to see you
 
03:41:56.809 --> 03:41:56.819 align:start position:0%
know obviously we're gonna have a little
 
03:41:58.849 --> 03:41:58.859 align:start position:0%
bit of cushion it sounds like with the
 
03:42:00.950 --> 03:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
new base number from the governor's
 
03:42:00.960 --> 03:42:03.050 align:start position:0%
new base number from the governor's
total

03:42:03.050 --> 03:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
total
 
03:42:04.910 --> 03:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
um amount so it sounds like
 
03:42:06.830 --> 03:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
stabilization may also be able to be
 
03:42:06.840 --> 03:42:08.210 align:start position:0%
stabilization may also be able to be
tweaked

03:42:08.210 --> 03:42:08.220 align:start position:0%
tweaked
 
03:42:11.750 --> 03:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
um and I think part of this is semantics
 
03:42:11.760 --> 03:42:13.490 align:start position:0%
um and I think part of this is semantics
because

03:42:13.490 --> 03:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:42:16.250 --> 03:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
make hole
 
03:42:19.809 --> 03:42:19.819 align:start position:0%
has a a ceiling on it where
 
03:42:23.210 --> 03:42:23.220 align:start position:0%
stabilization has a fixed dollar amount
 
03:42:26.570 --> 03:42:26.580 align:start position:0%
so because I I look at make hole a form
 
03:42:29.030 --> 03:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
of stabilization
 
03:42:29.040 --> 03:42:31.030 align:start position:0%
of stabilization
so

03:42:31.030 --> 03:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:42:34.790 --> 03:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
so perhaps perhaps one thing that may
 
03:42:36.410 --> 03:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
help is
 
03:42:37.849 --> 03:42:37.859 align:start position:0%
do you want to look at the education
 
03:42:39.769 --> 03:42:39.779 align:start position:0%
trust fund where we are with that and
 
03:42:42.229 --> 03:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
maybe if we start settling on some of
 
03:42:43.790 --> 03:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
the items in there you'll have a clear
 
03:42:46.010 --> 03:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
idea of where your what your balance is
 
03:42:47.450 --> 03:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
and what you want to leave whether you
 
03:42:49.070 --> 03:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
want to drain it to zero or leave some
 
03:42:50.870 --> 03:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
balance in the education trust fund it
 
03:42:52.729 --> 03:42:52.739 align:start position:0%
may back into how much money you have
 
03:42:55.670 --> 03:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
for this before we go there yeah just
 
03:43:00.410 --> 03:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:03.410 --> 03:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
I agree with chairman emmeric that right
 
03:43:05.389 --> 03:43:05.399 align:start position:0%
now you know the funding is not really
 
03:43:07.490 --> 03:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
removed it's just put in a different
 
03:43:10.190 --> 03:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
formula and a different way of doing it
 
03:43:11.809 --> 03:43:11.819 align:start position:0%
so stabilization is essentially
 
03:43:14.030 --> 03:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
immediately placed
 
03:43:17.150 --> 03:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
I I want to say that I don't think I can
 
03:43:20.330 --> 03:43:20.340 align:start position:0%
support any form of budget that still
 
03:43:22.969 --> 03:43:22.979 align:start position:0%
has the stabilization as is again
 
03:43:24.830 --> 03:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
because of the history where we we know
 
03:43:26.809 --> 03:43:26.819 align:start position:0%
we know it has to be removed we try to
 
03:43:29.870 --> 03:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
remove it it got reversed if we leave it
 
03:43:31.910 --> 03:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
in place as it is and start committing
 
03:43:34.309 --> 03:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
the same thing will happen and we just
 
03:43:37.010 --> 03:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
cannot do that again so
 
03:43:39.469 --> 03:43:39.479 align:start position:0%
because what we are doing here is
 
03:43:41.510 --> 03:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
essentially you know it's just creating
 
03:43:43.370 --> 03:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
formulas that will not harm the
 
03:43:47.090 --> 03:43:47.100 align:start position:0%
stabilization towns but remove the
 
03:43:49.250 --> 03:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
stabilization altogether and solving
 
03:43:51.290 --> 03:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
that issue that is really the only
 
03:43:53.690 --> 03:43:53.700 align:start position:0%
outcome and the only you know process
 
03:43:55.670 --> 03:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm comfortable with at this
 
03:43:57.830 --> 03:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
time because again it it does make
 
03:43:59.870 --> 03:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
everybody you know
 
03:44:02.750 --> 03:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
whole but it doesn't have this trap
 
03:44:05.090 --> 03:44:05.100 align:start position:0%
where we could end up reverting to that
 
03:44:07.550 --> 03:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
situation which I cannot support so I
 
03:44:09.950 --> 03:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
guess it's a long answer but
 
03:44:12.110 --> 03:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
before before we did carry on did you
 
03:44:13.670 --> 03:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
want to hear from Adam in the governor's
 
03:44:15.229 --> 03:44:15.239 align:start position:0%
office well this stuff's fresh in your
 
03:44:16.849 --> 03:44:16.859 align:start position:0%
head before we by all means let me step
 
03:44:31.090 --> 03:44:31.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:33.769 --> 03:44:33.779 align:start position:0%
how are you I'm Adam crapo uh with the
 
03:44:35.090 --> 03:44:35.100 align:start position:0%
governor's office
 
03:44:38.090 --> 03:44:38.100 align:start position:0%
so I think I what I'm hearing today is I
 
03:44:40.790 --> 03:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
I think with the proposal that the
 
03:44:42.769 --> 03:44:42.779 align:start position:0%
governor put forward actually gets us
 
03:44:44.630 --> 03:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
pretty close to where you guys are
 
03:44:46.450 --> 03:44:46.460 align:start position:0%
thinking to be honest
 
03:44:49.190 --> 03:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
and the reason why I think that is
 
03:44:52.490 --> 03:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
because we we are increasing base and we
 
03:44:54.590 --> 03:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
are increasing fnr on the left hand side
 
03:44:56.150 --> 03:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
of the formula
 
03:44:58.190 --> 03:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
um but what we're doing while we're
 
03:45:01.190 --> 03:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
doing that is we are get we are phasing
 
03:45:02.809 --> 03:45:02.819 align:start position:0%
out stabilization or we're getting rid
 
03:45:04.070 --> 03:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
of stabilization we're phasing out the
 
03:45:07.190 --> 03:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
whole harmless that fills in the gap for
 
03:45:10.550 --> 03:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
towns who who lose some funding
 
03:45:10.560 --> 03:45:11.450 align:start position:0%
towns who who lose some funding
um

03:45:11.450 --> 03:45:11.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:14.570 --> 03:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
over time and so
 
03:45:16.729 --> 03:45:16.739 align:start position:0%
the other piece of that is we're also
 
03:45:19.429 --> 03:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
over over the 10 years every two years
 
03:45:21.710 --> 03:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
we're increasing extraordinary needs
 
03:45:24.229 --> 03:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
grants which basically it's the most
 
03:45:26.570 --> 03:45:26.580 align:start position:0%
efficient way I think to Target Aid
 
03:45:30.469 --> 03:45:30.479 align:start position:0%
under our formula uh to the neediest
 
03:45:32.210 --> 03:45:32.220 align:start position:0%
towns if you will
 
03:45:35.330 --> 03:45:35.340 align:start position:0%
um you are taking fnra or f r numbers
 
03:45:37.070 --> 03:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
and you're looking at that and you're
 
03:45:39.229 --> 03:45:39.239 align:start position:0%
also looking at property evaluations and
 
03:45:42.530 --> 03:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
you're looking at that and I think you
 
03:45:44.570 --> 03:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
know we we have two-year estimates here
 
03:45:46.670 --> 03:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
but I think that kind of paints a
 
03:45:49.309 --> 03:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
partial picture right of where where
 
03:45:52.729 --> 03:45:52.739 align:start position:0%
this formula is going because some towns
 
03:45:55.010 --> 03:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
are receiving additional funding in the
 
03:45:58.250 --> 03:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
first two years and some aren't but over
 
03:46:01.309 --> 03:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
time as stabilization phases out and or
 
03:46:04.450 --> 03:46:04.460 align:start position:0%
uh the whole harmless phases out and
 
03:46:08.570 --> 03:46:08.580 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary needs grants phases in
 
03:46:11.090 --> 03:46:11.100 align:start position:0%
um at greater amounts the towns that
 
03:46:13.670 --> 03:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
have extraordinary needs grants now uh
 
03:46:15.229 --> 03:46:15.239 align:start position:0%
will likely I mean should property
 
03:46:18.050 --> 03:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
valuations and enrollment stay
 
03:46:19.790 --> 03:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
similar I mean it's going to change over
 
03:46:21.950 --> 03:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
time but and it's sort of difficult to
 
03:46:24.710 --> 03:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
predict that over the 10 years right
 
03:46:26.690 --> 03:46:26.700 align:start position:0%
um they will see an increase in eight
 
03:46:30.050 --> 03:46:30.060 align:start position:0%
and so I think that is the purpose of
 
03:46:32.450 --> 03:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
the proposal is to
 
03:46:32.460 --> 03:46:33.110 align:start position:0%
the proposal is to
um

03:46:33.110 --> 03:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:35.750 --> 03:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
you know it's the get rid of
 
03:46:38.450 --> 03:46:38.460 align:start position:0%
stabilization grants which are based on
 
03:46:40.910 --> 03:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
Antiquated data
 
03:46:42.590 --> 03:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
um you know make some towns whole
 
03:46:44.990 --> 03:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
through the whole harmless and while
 
03:46:47.210 --> 03:46:47.220 align:start position:0%
that whole harmless phases out you are
 
03:46:51.410 --> 03:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
introducing additional Aid to the towns
 
03:46:54.889 --> 03:46:54.899 align:start position:0%
that I I would say need it the most
 
03:46:57.410 --> 03:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
um and and that's that's sort of I guess
 
03:46:59.330 --> 03:46:59.340 align:start position:0%
my pitch for that
 
03:47:00.950 --> 03:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
um but I think it gets I think it gets
 
03:47:03.170 --> 03:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
us pretty close to to what you're what
 
03:47:06.950 --> 03:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
you're describing in this committee
 
03:47:09.769 --> 03:47:09.779 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
03:47:11.870 --> 03:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
you Adam it's been nice meeting you and
 
03:47:13.670 --> 03:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
working with you
 
03:47:16.429 --> 03:47:16.439 align:start position:0%
um my my big concern is
 
03:47:19.910 --> 03:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
we somehow have changed and I think Mark
 
03:47:22.610 --> 03:47:22.620 align:start position:0%
you can agree we every year we've done
 
03:47:25.670 --> 03:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
something pretty close
 
03:47:28.729 --> 03:47:28.739 align:start position:0%
um 10 years is a long time in the world
 
03:47:31.429 --> 03:47:31.439 align:start position:0%
of funding and administrations change
 
03:47:34.729 --> 03:47:34.739 align:start position:0%
and people come in and go out and their
 
03:47:36.769 --> 03:47:36.779 align:start position:0%
ideas tend to go with them
 
03:47:40.429 --> 03:47:40.439 align:start position:0%
so my concern is that that
 
03:47:43.010 --> 03:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
you have a lot of good stuff I like a
 
03:47:44.929 --> 03:47:44.939 align:start position:0%
lot of the ideas that are in there but
 
03:47:46.429 --> 03:47:46.439 align:start position:0%
my fear is that they won't be
 
03:47:49.969 --> 03:47:49.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:52.790 --> 03:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
understood and that and that obviously
 
03:47:55.370 --> 03:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
is up to you know legislatures in the
 
03:47:59.510 --> 03:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
future and and future Governors however
 
03:48:02.510 --> 03:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
um I I do think that
 
03:48:04.610 --> 03:48:04.620 align:start position:0%
under this proposal is a long-term
 
03:48:07.910 --> 03:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
proposal I think the idea was to fix
 
03:48:10.849 --> 03:48:10.859 align:start position:0%
this formula in perpetuity and do the
 
03:48:12.469 --> 03:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
right thing for the state instead of
 
03:48:13.969 --> 03:48:13.979 align:start position:0%
kind of looking at it into to your
 
03:48:18.710 --> 03:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
increments and I think for for you know
 
03:48:21.050 --> 03:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
how long I can remember on this we kind
 
03:48:22.729 --> 03:48:22.739 align:start position:0%
of look at it to your increments and
 
03:48:24.050 --> 03:48:24.060 align:start position:0%
then we throw all these Band-Aids on
 
03:48:26.389 --> 03:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
that's how we have so many pieces of the
 
03:48:26.399 --> 03:48:27.550 align:start position:0%
that's how we have so many pieces of the
formula

03:48:27.550 --> 03:48:27.560 align:start position:0%
formula
 
03:48:31.010 --> 03:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately that we have relief
 
03:48:32.510 --> 03:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
Aid where it's like 17 and a half
 
03:48:35.330 --> 03:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
million here we have um third grade
 
03:48:37.670 --> 03:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
reading aid which I think it's less than
 
03:48:39.050 --> 03:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
a million rate mark
 
03:48:41.690 --> 03:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
yeah or two million uh we have little
 
03:48:43.190 --> 03:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
pieces here and there it makes it very
 
03:48:46.429 --> 03:48:46.439 align:start position:0%
complicated for the average member of
 
03:48:47.990 --> 03:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
the public to pick the thing up and say
 
03:48:50.150 --> 03:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
this is how my school is funded this is
 
03:48:50.160 --> 03:48:51.530 align:start position:0%
this is how my school is funded this is
how

03:48:51.530 --> 03:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
how
 
03:48:53.929 --> 03:48:53.939 align:start position:0%
you know we we do things here in New
 
03:48:56.330 --> 03:48:56.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I think the idea was not
 
03:48:59.090 --> 03:48:59.100 align:start position:0%
only to fund the neediest towns over
 
03:49:00.110 --> 03:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
time while they're still while
 
03:49:02.210 --> 03:49:02.220 align:start position:0%
stabilization phases out increased base
 
03:49:04.309 --> 03:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
aid for every school
 
03:49:06.290 --> 03:49:06.300 align:start position:0%
um increase for f r for every every
 
03:49:08.030 --> 03:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
school who has free kids with free
 
03:49:09.950 --> 03:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
introduced lunch
 
03:49:09.960 --> 03:49:10.490 align:start position:0%
introduced lunch
um

03:49:10.490 --> 03:49:10.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:14.809 --> 03:49:14.819 align:start position:0%
I think that's that's the most I think
 
03:49:16.729 --> 03:49:16.739 align:start position:0%
that what you're describing this this
 
03:49:18.830 --> 03:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
actually accomplishes what what you guys
 
03:49:21.410 --> 03:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
are talking about well just to follow up
 
03:49:21.420 --> 03:49:22.910 align:start position:0%
are talking about well just to follow up
on

03:49:22.910 --> 03:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:49:25.550 --> 03:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
we've talked about the f r numbers and
 
03:49:28.670 --> 03:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
my concerns our school districts um
 
03:49:31.490 --> 03:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
they're seeing drops in enrollment the
 
03:49:35.450 --> 03:49:35.460 align:start position:0%
fnr numbers are totally skewed down
 
03:49:35.460 --> 03:49:37.370 align:start position:0%
fnr numbers are totally skewed down
words

03:49:37.370 --> 03:49:37.380 align:start position:0%
words
 
03:49:40.309 --> 03:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
um so our school districts are going to
 
03:49:43.130 --> 03:49:43.140 align:start position:0%
get hit because we've we've been on
 
03:49:45.469 --> 03:49:45.479 align:start position:0%
numbers that were pre-covered and now
 
03:49:48.110 --> 03:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
we're on actuals and the actuals are so
 
03:49:52.210 --> 03:49:52.220 align:start position:0%
different from what they were in 2019
 
03:49:54.650 --> 03:49:54.660 align:start position:0%
this budget doesn't really accommodate
 
03:49:57.889 --> 03:49:57.899 align:start position:0%
for that for those losses
 
03:50:00.710 --> 03:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
so I think the attempt in this budget
 
03:50:02.750 --> 03:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
was to account for should the
 
03:50:04.250 --> 03:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
legislature move forward with Medicaid
 
03:50:07.429 --> 03:50:07.439 align:start position:0%
direct certification it would add folks
 
03:50:12.410 --> 03:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
to the to uh the fnr uh category and you
 
03:50:14.450 --> 03:50:14.460 align:start position:0%
would see an increase in funding that
 
03:50:17.809 --> 03:50:17.819 align:start position:0%
way so I think it does include that
 
03:50:20.510 --> 03:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
um in in our projections and so I think
 
03:50:24.349 --> 03:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
that an attempt was made to try to uh
 
03:50:25.729 --> 03:50:25.739 align:start position:0%
solve that issue that you that you bring
 
03:50:25.739 --> 03:50:27.309 align:start position:0%
solve that issue that you that you bring
up

03:50:27.309 --> 03:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:50:32.510 --> 03:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh just a second Mickey if we took the
 
03:50:32.520 --> 03:50:33.650 align:start position:0%
uh just a second Mickey if we took the
uh

03:50:33.650 --> 03:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:50:37.729 --> 03:50:37.739 align:start position:0%
equalized value of what and instead of F
 
03:50:39.050 --> 03:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
and R numbers
 
03:50:42.950 --> 03:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:47.030 --> 03:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm asking you both instead of
 
03:50:49.550 --> 03:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
using the fnr forms that are turned in
 
03:50:53.150 --> 03:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
for the count we use the valuation per
 
03:50:53.160 --> 03:50:57.950 align:start position:0%
for the count we use the valuation per
student

03:50:57.950 --> 03:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:00.950 --> 03:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
if you follow me
 
03:51:02.690 --> 03:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll give Adam first crack because
 
03:51:04.190 --> 03:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
there's f r is in a couple different
 
03:51:06.889 --> 03:51:06.899 align:start position:0%
spots in the point so I'll let Adam take
 
03:51:08.870 --> 03:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
first crack so on the left hand side of
 
03:51:11.570 --> 03:51:11.580 align:start position:0%
the formula we have fnr and that and
 
03:51:14.750 --> 03:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
that gives a set amount to every uh
 
03:51:16.610 --> 03:51:16.620 align:start position:0%
school who has fnr students So based on
 
03:51:19.490 --> 03:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
the the the enrollment there and then on
 
03:51:20.809 --> 03:51:20.819 align:start position:0%
the right hand side of the formula under
 
03:51:23.330 --> 03:51:23.340 align:start position:0%
our proposal we have extraordinary needs
 
03:51:26.450 --> 03:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
grants which basically takes the
 
03:51:28.309 --> 03:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
property valuation of the equalized
 
03:51:31.070 --> 03:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
valuation in each town and accounts for
 
03:51:34.370 --> 03:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
that and accounts for the number of f r
 
03:51:37.790 --> 03:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
students and targets Aid in that way and
 
03:51:40.910 --> 03:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
so over time uh extraordinary needs
 
03:51:45.110 --> 03:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
grants increase uh 50 every two years in
 
03:51:47.690 --> 03:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
in our proposal and so that was our way
 
03:51:50.389 --> 03:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
of okay saying okay stabilization's
 
03:51:52.130 --> 03:51:52.140 align:start position:0%
phasing out
 
03:51:54.349 --> 03:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
um that is it's based on Antiquated data
 
03:51:56.210 --> 03:51:56.220 align:start position:0%
but we recognize that there are going to
 
03:51:57.769 --> 03:51:57.779 align:start position:0%
be towns out there that will need
 
03:52:01.610 --> 03:52:01.620 align:start position:0%
additional funding who who are I
 
03:52:03.710 --> 03:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
I guess we would refer them as the
 
03:52:06.050 --> 03:52:06.060 align:start position:0%
neediest communities and that's where
 
03:52:07.670 --> 03:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
that Aid is targeted and we think it's
 
03:52:09.530 --> 03:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
it's the most efficient way to Target
 
03:52:11.090 --> 03:52:11.100 align:start position:0%
that Aid
 
03:52:11.100 --> 03:52:11.809 align:start position:0%
that Aid
um

03:52:11.809 --> 03:52:11.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:15.830 --> 03:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:18.530 --> 03:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
yeah were you were you suggesting
 
03:52:20.570 --> 03:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
replacing fnr with something that was
 
03:52:22.190 --> 03:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
more based on equalized valuation for
 
03:52:23.929 --> 03:52:23.939 align:start position:0%
people so that's straight up that I
 
03:52:25.550 --> 03:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
think I mean
 
03:52:26.990 --> 03:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
on the right side of the formula
 
03:52:28.670 --> 03:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
certainly so that's where fiscal
 
03:52:30.050 --> 03:52:30.060 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity Aid is so that's
 
03:52:32.389 --> 03:52:32.399 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation per pupil paid a
 
03:52:34.490 --> 03:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
grant per pupil no fnr is part of that
 
03:52:38.030 --> 03:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
formula uh but you do have 70 plus
 
03:52:39.410 --> 03:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
million dollars in the cost of an
 
03:52:41.030 --> 03:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
adequate education relative to f r
 
03:52:43.250 --> 03:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
counts I don't know what data set we
 
03:52:45.290 --> 03:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
could replace that with
 
03:52:47.389 --> 03:52:47.399 align:start position:0%
right off the top of my head unless you
 
03:52:50.929 --> 03:52:50.939 align:start position:0%
did some sort of proration of valuation
 
03:52:52.969 --> 03:52:52.979 align:start position:0%
and State against total pupils or
 
03:52:56.050 --> 03:52:56.060 align:start position:0%
something or if you took Medicaid
 
03:53:00.469 --> 03:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
students which we've got per town I
 
03:53:02.030 --> 03:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
don't know Mark can probably speak to
 
03:53:04.250 --> 03:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
the validity of the data so we do have
 
03:53:07.429 --> 03:53:07.439 align:start position:0%
some data I think as of uh one July 22
 
03:53:10.610 --> 03:53:10.620 align:start position:0%
as far as by Town ages 15 to 18 year old
 
03:53:13.570 --> 03:53:13.580 align:start position:0%
Medicaid precipit or uh
 
03:53:15.349 --> 03:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
members I don't know what the right term
 
03:53:16.910 --> 03:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
is I'm not division three
 
03:53:19.790 --> 03:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
um enrolled and we can apply that as a
 
03:53:22.670 --> 03:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
you know as a each town as a percentage
 
03:53:25.190 --> 03:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
of State total and apply that to ADM but
 
03:53:26.990 --> 03:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
I would defer to mark because we won't
 
03:53:28.550 --> 03:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
have really any sort of uniquely
 
03:53:30.469 --> 03:53:30.479 align:start position:0%
identifiable data even with a direct
 
03:53:33.229 --> 03:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
cert for a couple years
 
03:53:35.330 --> 03:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
so as far as the left side of the
 
03:53:36.769 --> 03:53:36.779 align:start position:0%
formula we haven't brought up the
 
03:53:38.990 --> 03:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
lawsuits in the Constitution yet but the
 
03:53:40.969 --> 03:53:40.979 align:start position:0%
left side of the formula is is what's
 
03:53:44.929 --> 03:53:44.939 align:start position:0%
under litigation so if you were to so
 
03:53:46.490 --> 03:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
what the governor's proposed is
 
03:53:48.050 --> 03:53:48.060 align:start position:0%
increasing the left side of the formula
 
03:53:49.610 --> 03:53:49.620 align:start position:0%
so that doesn't really create a legal
 
03:53:51.410 --> 03:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
liability since we've increased it if
 
03:53:53.690 --> 03:53:53.700 align:start position:0%
you were to decrease substantially from
 
03:53:55.130 --> 03:53:55.140 align:start position:0%
the left side
 
03:53:56.750 --> 03:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
um that would increase our legal
 
03:53:59.090 --> 03:53:59.100 align:start position:0%
exposure so I so and I know you're not
 
03:54:00.349 --> 03:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
proposing that
 
03:54:01.670 --> 03:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
um so just something to consider when
 
03:54:03.050 --> 03:54:03.060 align:start position:0%
you're when you're working with the left
 
03:54:05.030 --> 03:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
side it's always a little dicey in a
 
03:54:06.349 --> 03:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
sense that I know you're not considering
 
03:54:08.870 --> 03:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
that so but the the I think what you're
 
03:54:12.229 --> 03:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
talking about is taking the fnr holding
 
03:54:13.849 --> 03:54:13.859 align:start position:0%
that is basically a hold harmless you're
 
03:54:16.969 --> 03:54:16.979 align:start position:0%
guaranteed your F and R numbers if what
 
03:54:18.530 --> 03:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
we could do is if your Medicaid numbers
 
03:54:21.110 --> 03:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
out of town level happen to be higher
 
03:54:22.429 --> 03:54:22.439 align:start position:0%
for a community
 
03:54:24.650 --> 03:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
you'll be paid those instead right and
 
03:54:26.510 --> 03:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
and ballpark I don't think I've ran that
 
03:54:26.520 --> 03:54:27.410 align:start position:0%
and ballpark I don't think I've ran that
but

03:54:27.410 --> 03:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:54:29.150 --> 03:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
that would basically be like bringing in
 
03:54:31.309 --> 03:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct cert now
 
03:54:32.929 --> 03:54:32.939 align:start position:0%
um but not matching it to students and
 
03:54:34.790 --> 03:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
not feeding kids so what that would cost
 
03:54:37.370 --> 03:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
is approximately over 22 million dollars
 
03:54:39.950 --> 03:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
but you would need legislation to do
 
03:54:41.570 --> 03:54:41.580 align:start position:0%
that and that legislation would have to
 
03:54:43.969 --> 03:54:43.979 align:start position:0%
be detailed and described how DHHS is
 
03:54:45.830 --> 03:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
going to give us that data what is the
 
03:54:47.210 --> 03:54:47.220 align:start position:0%
snapshot of their data are they going to
 
03:54:49.010 --> 03:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
use pre-pandemic data which would cost
 
03:54:50.750 --> 03:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
around 22 million dollars are they going
 
03:54:52.130 --> 03:54:52.140 align:start position:0%
to use current data which would cost
 
03:54:53.389 --> 03:54:53.399 align:start position:0%
more like
 
03:54:55.910 --> 03:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
42 million dollars so that's that's the
 
03:54:57.110 --> 03:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
challenge as far as you'd have to just
 
03:54:59.210 --> 03:54:59.220 align:start position:0%
you design a new Grant which would need
 
03:55:01.370 --> 03:55:01.380 align:start position:0%
new hp2 language which would need to be
 
03:55:01.380 --> 03:55:03.769 align:start position:0%
new hp2 language which would need to be
implemented

03:55:03.769 --> 03:55:03.779 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
03:55:03.779 --> 03:55:04.750 align:start position:0%
implemented
okay

03:55:04.750 --> 03:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:55:07.550 --> 03:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
just to speak to that point
 
03:55:09.349 --> 03:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
um it's something that I've taken quite
 
03:55:12.889 --> 03:55:12.899 align:start position:0%
a bit of Mickey's time of uh over uh in
 
03:55:16.429 --> 03:55:16.439 align:start position:0%
the last few weeks and um
 
03:55:19.969 --> 03:55:19.979 align:start position:0%
I genuinely do not think we will have
 
03:55:23.150 --> 03:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
the time to research it properly by the
 
03:55:25.550 --> 03:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
time we gotta finalize the budget
 
03:55:28.370 --> 03:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
which pains me greatly because it is
 
03:55:30.830 --> 03:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
something that I think is in dire need
 
03:55:32.510 --> 03:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
of addressing
 
03:55:34.910 --> 03:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
um and I just don't know exactly how to
 
03:55:37.010 --> 03:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
move forward because if I say the word
 
03:55:40.189 --> 03:55:40.199 align:start position:0%
we should study it that's used to mean
 
03:55:42.290 --> 03:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
something entirely different in a lot of
 
03:55:43.910 --> 03:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
places but
 
03:55:46.429 --> 03:55:46.439 align:start position:0%
I think we need to find a way to keep
 
03:55:48.710 --> 03:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
working on this while recognizing that
 
03:55:50.929 --> 03:55:50.939 align:start position:0%
we may just not have the time to address
 
03:55:53.269 --> 03:55:53.279 align:start position:0%
it this cycle which again I'm very
 
03:55:54.950 --> 03:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
unhappy about because it's something
 
03:55:56.830 --> 03:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
that really bothers me
 
03:55:59.450 --> 03:55:59.460 align:start position:0%
for now I will say that the proposed
 
03:56:02.150 --> 03:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
Governor budget because they do change a
 
03:56:03.889 --> 03:56:03.899 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff on the right hand of the
 
03:56:05.510 --> 03:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
formula and they put quite a bit of
 
03:56:07.309 --> 03:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
money there that tends to be allocated
 
03:56:09.170 --> 03:56:09.180 align:start position:0%
in different ways so it will hedge
 
03:56:12.530 --> 03:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
against some of those losses by towns
 
03:56:15.590 --> 03:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
that have artificially low F and R
 
03:56:18.590 --> 03:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
numbers the problem right now if we use
 
03:56:20.689 --> 03:56:20.699 align:start position:0%
current Medicaid numbers which was
 
03:56:22.610 --> 03:56:22.620 align:start position:0%
brought up the number would be higher it
 
03:56:24.110 --> 03:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
would be higher because people haven't
 
03:56:25.849 --> 03:56:25.859 align:start position:0%
been allowed to draw people off the
 
03:56:27.830 --> 03:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid so now those are inflated so
 
03:56:30.229 --> 03:56:30.239 align:start position:0%
now we have fnr numbers that are under
 
03:56:32.090 --> 03:56:32.100 align:start position:0%
counted and Medicaid enrollment that's
 
03:56:34.250 --> 03:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
over counted go figure
 
03:56:37.910 --> 03:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
right so I just I
 
03:56:40.070 --> 03:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
I hate saying that I don't think we have
 
03:56:42.650 --> 03:56:42.660 align:start position:0%
time to uh deal with that in this budget
 
03:56:44.870 --> 03:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
cycle and we may want to stick to doing
 
03:56:46.849 --> 03:56:46.859 align:start position:0%
fnr and finding an official or
 
03:56:49.429 --> 03:56:49.439 align:start position:0%
unofficial way to continue working on
 
03:56:51.889 --> 03:56:51.899 align:start position:0%
that to have some really good models
 
03:56:54.590 --> 03:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
to drive future policy decisions on but
 
03:56:57.650 --> 03:56:57.660 align:start position:0%
I just to to that point
 
03:56:59.689 --> 03:56:59.699 align:start position:0%
three covet numbers
 
03:57:03.610 --> 03:57:03.620 align:start position:0%
have a ratio of the student population
 
03:57:06.110 --> 03:57:06.120 align:start position:0%
that are on Medicaid
 
03:57:09.950 --> 03:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
I mean that ratio could be used against
 
03:57:12.710 --> 03:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
current current student populations that
 
03:57:16.250 --> 03:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:18.050 --> 03:57:18.060 align:start position:0%
you follow me
 
03:57:19.969 --> 03:57:19.979 align:start position:0%
so let's say School District had 100
 
03:57:22.790 --> 03:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
students six percent or Medicaid
 
03:57:25.010 --> 03:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
recipients we'll use six percent of the
 
03:57:27.889 --> 03:57:27.899 align:start position:0%
population now for SNR
 
03:57:30.950 --> 03:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
f r if that's not
 
03:57:32.389 --> 03:57:32.399 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's going to do it
 
03:57:35.030 --> 03:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
because it uh you know like Farmington
 
03:57:37.550 --> 03:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
has a close to 50 percent you know it's
 
03:57:40.010 --> 03:57:40.020 align:start position:0%
it's less than 50 percent but it's it's
 
03:57:42.650 --> 03:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
in an area and six percent is I just
 
03:57:44.689 --> 03:57:44.699 align:start position:0%
made that up oh okay I'm sorry no I just
 
03:57:47.150 --> 03:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
made it no no but I'm your number would
 
03:57:50.809 --> 03:57:50.819 align:start position:0%
come out to 50 right well it's whatever
 
03:57:53.030 --> 03:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's all I'm saying is creating a
 
03:57:55.070 --> 03:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
factor that can be used as an estimate
 
03:57:57.650 --> 03:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
for this in the short term so so if you
 
03:57:59.630 --> 03:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
want to make it a block grant that would
 
03:58:01.790 --> 03:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
be very budget controlled
 
03:58:01.800 --> 03:58:02.929 align:start position:0%
be very budget controlled
um

03:58:02.929 --> 03:58:02.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:04.309 --> 03:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
otherwise you set a dollar amount you
 
03:58:05.210 --> 03:58:05.220 align:start position:0%
would like to allocate in that
 
03:58:07.370 --> 03:58:07.380 align:start position:0%
methodology but to
 
03:58:09.889 --> 03:58:09.899 align:start position:0%
to mix it with f and r
 
03:58:11.570 --> 03:58:11.580 align:start position:0%
so in that situation take the Medicaid
 
03:58:13.250 --> 03:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
you have Medicaid say you have um the
 
03:58:14.450 --> 03:58:14.460 align:start position:0%
Medicaid data we have isn't just
 
03:58:16.490 --> 03:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
students it's it's students in district
 
03:58:19.610 --> 03:58:19.620 align:start position:0%
schools the students 5 through 18 uh uh
 
03:58:21.410 --> 03:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
or participants five through eighteen
 
03:58:23.150 --> 03:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
they could be in a charter school they
 
03:58:24.410 --> 03:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
could be in an EFA they could be
 
03:58:26.210 --> 03:58:26.220 align:start position:0%
homeschooled um so you take that number
 
03:58:27.590 --> 03:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
and then you would apply it against a
 
03:58:29.210 --> 03:58:29.220 align:start position:0%
district school base so it's going to be
 
03:58:31.189 --> 03:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
kind of a higher percentage because in
 
03:58:32.750 --> 03:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
the numerator you're including students
 
03:58:33.710 --> 03:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
that are not necessarily in the
 
03:58:35.150 --> 03:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
denominator so it's going to be a high
 
03:58:36.349 --> 03:58:36.359 align:start position:0%
percentage but you could apply that
 
03:58:36.359 --> 03:58:37.849 align:start position:0%
percentage but you could apply that
percentage

03:58:37.849 --> 03:58:37.859 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
03:58:37.859 --> 03:58:38.450 align:start position:0%
percentage
um

03:58:38.450 --> 03:58:38.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:40.309 --> 03:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:58:42.410 --> 03:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
I haven't run the numbers for that but
 
03:58:44.809 --> 03:58:44.819 align:start position:0%
it's it's going to cost money more money
 
03:58:46.010 --> 03:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
than currently I just don't know how
 
03:58:47.870 --> 03:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
much because you would never want to
 
03:58:49.610 --> 03:58:49.620 align:start position:0%
if a student if there's we have
 
03:58:50.990 --> 03:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
information that there's an fnr student
 
03:58:52.670 --> 03:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
in a school we would never want to fund
 
03:58:54.290 --> 03:58:54.300 align:start position:0%
them less than that
 
03:58:56.689 --> 03:58:56.699 align:start position:0%
um of course currently so it's going to
 
03:58:58.849 --> 03:58:58.859 align:start position:0%
be an add-on it's going to be a Max
 
03:59:00.710 --> 03:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
formula where you either get your
 
03:59:02.090 --> 03:59:02.100 align:start position:0%
minimum F and R numbers you're holding
 
03:59:04.309 --> 03:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
or this new Medicaid percentage number
 
03:59:06.650 --> 03:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
so I have not run the numbers on that I
 
03:59:08.510 --> 03:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
imagine it would cost multi-million
 
03:59:10.790 --> 03:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
dollars so but it would be one way to to
 
03:59:12.650 --> 03:59:12.660 align:start position:0%
Target Aid based on Medicaid population
 
03:59:15.290 --> 03:59:15.300 align:start position:0%
similar to Target a based on property
 
03:59:17.450 --> 03:59:17.460 align:start position:0%
values and targeting a based on F R
 
03:59:19.370 --> 03:59:19.380 align:start position:0%
numbers targeting Aid so it's another
 
03:59:21.530 --> 03:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
vehicle to Target Aid another data set
 
03:59:22.969 --> 03:59:22.979 align:start position:0%
we can use
 
03:59:24.469 --> 03:59:24.479 align:start position:0%
um I just don't have any language or
 
03:59:26.710 --> 03:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
numbers in front of you right now sure
 
03:59:29.030 --> 03:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
this is some data that I have worked
 
03:59:31.370 --> 03:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
with and done the a greater than a
 
03:59:34.969 --> 03:59:34.979 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or fnr type of idea okay uh I
 
03:59:36.650 --> 03:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
think I think the numbers part of it
 
03:59:39.590 --> 03:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
isn't that hard to run the calculation I
 
03:59:40.849 --> 03:59:40.859 align:start position:0%
think the hardest part and this is where
 
03:59:43.490 --> 03:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
I'm going to defer back to Mark is
 
03:59:45.830 --> 03:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
how we would Define that data I don't
 
03:59:49.309 --> 03:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
know like how easy would you say it is
 
03:59:52.309 --> 03:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
to legislate doing what this discussion
 
03:59:55.550 --> 03:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
is talking about as far as
 
03:59:57.170 --> 03:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
anything's possible uh the decision
 
03:59:58.670 --> 03:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
you'd have to make let me rephrase that
 
04:00:02.090 --> 04:00:02.100 align:start position:0%
between now and Tuesday uh so I'd have
 
04:00:03.950 --> 04:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
to go back back to my office
 
04:00:06.349 --> 04:00:06.359 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I
 
04:00:08.750 --> 04:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
the the every time you do something
 
04:00:10.670 --> 04:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
rushed there's the probability that a
 
04:00:12.469 --> 04:00:12.479 align:start position:0%
huge error will occur so
 
04:00:14.150 --> 04:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
um we could get it done but there's a
 
04:00:15.769 --> 04:00:15.779 align:start position:0%
high risk of an error occurring but the
 
04:00:17.210 --> 04:00:17.220 align:start position:0%
date I'm sorry to take over the
 
04:00:19.429 --> 04:00:19.439 align:start position:0%
questions here and uh is that data
 
04:00:21.170 --> 04:00:21.180 align:start position:0%
definable like what Medicaid has shared
 
04:00:22.189 --> 04:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
with you
 
04:00:24.170 --> 04:00:24.180 align:start position:0%
or is that so I basically when we got
 
04:00:26.510 --> 04:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
the data from Medicaid we said
 
04:00:28.370 --> 04:00:28.380 align:start position:0%
give us the data
 
04:00:31.189 --> 04:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
so that it best replicates the fnr data
 
04:00:34.490 --> 04:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
and then they ran a query I did not know
 
04:00:35.870 --> 04:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know the parameters that they
 
04:00:37.729 --> 04:00:37.739 align:start position:0%
plugged in to run their query so you
 
04:00:40.070 --> 04:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
could it would be fungible in a sense
 
04:00:41.809 --> 04:00:41.819 align:start position:0%
that uh we would the law would have to
 
04:00:43.070 --> 04:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
say or the legislation would have to say
 
04:00:47.030 --> 04:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
it is the intent of uh the department of
 
04:00:49.130 --> 04:00:49.140 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services shall query
 
04:00:51.710 --> 04:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
their DHHS data with the best intent of
 
04:00:53.570 --> 04:00:53.580 align:start position:0%
it'd be squishy best intent of
 
04:00:55.729 --> 04:00:55.739 align:start position:0%
satisfying the f r data set and then
 
04:00:56.870 --> 04:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
you'd want to choose important time
 
04:00:58.790 --> 04:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
snapshot and that snapshot either
 
04:01:00.769 --> 04:01:00.779 align:start position:0%
pre-covered or after coveted um probably
 
04:01:02.330 --> 04:01:02.340 align:start position:0%
a frozen snapshot is what you'd want to
 
04:01:04.729 --> 04:01:04.739 align:start position:0%
do to really make it less squishy
 
04:01:04.739 --> 04:01:06.050 align:start position:0%
do to really make it less squishy
oh

04:01:06.050 --> 04:01:06.060 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:01:08.210 --> 04:01:08.220 align:start position:0%
just a quick comment on the Frozen
 
04:01:11.450 --> 04:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
snapshot every year that goes by its
 
04:01:13.670 --> 04:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
poorer quality data I mean we really
 
04:01:15.889 --> 04:01:15.899 align:start position:0%
don't have an ideal solution right now
 
04:01:17.990 --> 04:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
because the pre-covy data is Old Town
 
04:01:19.729 --> 04:01:19.739 align:start position:0%
has changed those percentages change
 
04:01:22.130 --> 04:01:22.140 align:start position:0%
people do better people do worse you
 
04:01:24.050 --> 04:01:24.060 align:start position:0%
know God knows and by the way the impact
 
04:01:26.090 --> 04:01:26.100 align:start position:0%
of Kobe is very real towns that may have
 
04:01:28.070 --> 04:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
been in good shape Rico it may not be in
 
04:01:29.689 --> 04:01:29.699 align:start position:0%
that great of a shape right now and we'd
 
04:01:31.250 --> 04:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
be measuring them based on how well they
 
04:01:33.769 --> 04:01:33.779 align:start position:0%
were doing before covet current Medicaid
 
04:01:36.050 --> 04:01:36.060 align:start position:0%
numbers inflated because no Dropout
 
04:01:38.809 --> 04:01:38.819 align:start position:0%
current fnrm are numbers you know
 
04:01:42.550 --> 04:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
understated because of I mean right now
 
04:01:45.710 --> 04:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
three days
 
04:01:49.550 --> 04:01:49.560 align:start position:0%
I have no suggestion on how we can do
 
04:01:51.290 --> 04:01:51.300 align:start position:0%
something by Tuesday it's just first
 
04:01:54.530 --> 04:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
time from here on about Solutions
 
04:01:57.550 --> 04:01:57.560 align:start position:0%
yeah not state
 
04:02:00.790 --> 04:02:00.800 align:start position:0%
you gotta push forward
 
04:02:02.689 --> 04:02:02.699 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a joke I was gonna tell
 
04:02:04.010 --> 04:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
Mickey I'm skiing in Vermont this
 
04:02:06.729 --> 04:02:06.739 align:start position:0%
weekend so so it's very unlikely though
 
04:02:11.630 --> 04:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:13.670 --> 04:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
so that so that I guess that's that's my
 
04:02:15.229 --> 04:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
pitch for the Governor's proposal I
 
04:02:18.050 --> 04:02:18.060 align:start position:0%
think uh yeah I think it accomplishes
 
04:02:20.389 --> 04:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
pretty pretty close to what you're
 
04:02:23.750 --> 04:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish if you also include
 
04:02:25.849 --> 04:02:25.859 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct certification in it
 
04:02:29.090 --> 04:02:29.100 align:start position:0%
because in 2026 that'll kick in
 
04:02:31.189 --> 04:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
um yeah I can't speak to how long it
 
04:02:34.729 --> 04:02:34.739 align:start position:0%
would take to draft legislation on on uh
 
04:02:36.170 --> 04:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
you know using Medicaid numbers instead
 
04:02:39.530 --> 04:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
of f r uh and all of that
 
04:02:42.590 --> 04:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
um but but you know interested to if
 
04:02:43.670 --> 04:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
that that's a direction that the
 
04:02:45.769 --> 04:02:45.779 align:start position:0%
committee wants to move in open to open
 
04:02:55.969 --> 04:02:55.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:55.979 --> 04:02:56.929 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:02:56.929 --> 04:02:56.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:58.790 --> 04:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
I got some data back in the office I
 
04:03:00.650 --> 04:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
asked researcher upstairs to do some of
 
04:03:02.630 --> 04:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
the following of these high school kids
 
04:03:05.330 --> 04:03:05.340 align:start position:0%
and in terms of f r
 
04:03:07.610 --> 04:03:07.620 align:start position:0%
and we're seeing that between our
 
04:03:10.250 --> 04:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
freshmen and our sophomores there's a 10
 
04:03:14.330 --> 04:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
drop with Juniors and seniors why can't
 
04:03:17.830 --> 04:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
we not then take a an average of the
 
04:03:20.689 --> 04:03:20.699 align:start position:0%
freshman sophomore year and apply that
 
04:03:24.110 --> 04:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
to the other side this uh the uh junior
 
04:03:26.150 --> 04:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
and seniors that would certainly Elevate
 
04:03:28.070 --> 04:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
you know the f r a little bit if we're
 
04:03:31.969 --> 04:03:31.979 align:start position:0%
talking f r what about K-8 k for through
 
04:03:34.429 --> 04:03:34.439 align:start position:0%
eight are higher than the first two
 
04:03:35.809 --> 04:03:35.819 align:start position:0%
years of high school
 
04:03:38.510 --> 04:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh there's a higher percentage you see
 
04:03:41.150 --> 04:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
your drop-off occur significantly when
 
04:03:45.290 --> 04:03:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:47.570 --> 04:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
yeah even that that's been forever
 
04:03:52.490 --> 04:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:52.500 --> 04:03:54.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:03:54.229 --> 04:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:03:56.570 --> 04:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
other than defining the problem what
 
04:03:58.070 --> 04:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
whether the system would go with the
 
04:03:59.689 --> 04:03:59.699 align:start position:0%
governor's plan since it takes into
 
04:04:01.490 --> 04:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
account a lot of what we were talking
 
04:04:01.500 --> 04:04:05.809 align:start position:0%
account a lot of what we were talking
about

04:04:05.809 --> 04:04:05.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:07.910 --> 04:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
I mean respectfully
 
04:04:07.920 --> 04:04:08.809 align:start position:0%
I mean respectfully
um

04:04:08.809 --> 04:04:08.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:11.929 --> 04:04:11.939 align:start position:0%
I am personally uh in my based on my
 
04:04:13.490 --> 04:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
constituents request I am personally
 
04:04:15.349 --> 04:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
closer to the proposal number one than
 
04:04:16.849 --> 04:04:16.859 align:start position:0%
to the governor's recommended I think
 
04:04:16.859 --> 04:04:18.410 align:start position:0%
to the governor's recommended I think
that

04:04:18.410 --> 04:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:04:20.330 --> 04:04:20.340 align:start position:0%
um you know when I'm looking at the list
 
04:04:23.030 --> 04:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
of the towns that do best under the
 
04:04:24.830 --> 04:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal I'm noticing towns
 
04:04:28.849 --> 04:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
like my own Hanover and Bedford who are
 
04:04:31.010 --> 04:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
already doing really well but when I
 
04:04:33.769 --> 04:04:33.779 align:start position:0%
compare you know how under the
 
04:04:35.689 --> 04:04:35.699 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal
 
04:04:38.030 --> 04:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
um Berlin is doing I I realize that
 
04:04:39.889 --> 04:04:39.899 align:start position:0%
there is more work that could be done to
 
04:04:42.349 --> 04:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
help those you know more needy
 
04:04:44.450 --> 04:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
communities and I think that
 
04:04:48.170 --> 04:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
um you know while we can message the win
 
04:04:49.849 --> 04:04:49.859 align:start position:0%
of the increase based under proposal
 
04:04:52.130 --> 04:04:52.140 align:start position:0%
number one and Target
 
04:04:54.050 --> 04:04:54.060 align:start position:0%
um more direct Aid to the needier tones
 
04:04:56.809 --> 04:04:56.819 align:start position:0%
or the the more um vulnerable towns I
 
04:04:58.370 --> 04:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
think that in those districts I think
 
04:04:59.750 --> 04:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
that that's just
 
04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
more of my personal mission today and
 
04:05:07.010 --> 04:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
um I would like to see possibly some
 
04:05:09.110 --> 04:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
more tweaking of proposal number one
 
04:05:10.790 --> 04:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to going completely with
 
04:05:13.130 --> 04:05:13.140 align:start position:0%
just cutting off stabilization I think
 
04:05:15.769 --> 04:05:15.779 align:start position:0%
that the net result of cut completely
 
04:05:18.769 --> 04:05:18.779 align:start position:0%
repealing stabilization is not replaced
 
04:05:23.389 --> 04:05:23.399 align:start position:0%
by this hold harmless clause and not com
 
04:05:25.250 --> 04:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
um in this like gradual phase out over
 
04:05:28.910 --> 04:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
time while increasing you know the the
 
04:05:30.349 --> 04:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
um the other components like the
 
04:05:33.290 --> 04:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant I think you
 
04:05:34.790 --> 04:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
know if I'm looking at the overall
 
04:05:37.570 --> 04:05:37.580 align:start position:0%
picture we haven't reached
 
04:05:41.030 --> 04:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh the more equitable distribution that
 
04:05:45.590 --> 04:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
we're trying to achieve so um my my vote
 
04:05:46.729 --> 04:05:46.739 align:start position:0%
if it came down to that Governor
 
04:05:48.950 --> 04:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
proposal or proposal number one it would
 
04:05:50.450 --> 04:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
definitely be proposal number one at
 
04:05:51.950 --> 04:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
this point I couldn't support the
 
04:05:51.960 --> 04:05:53.150 align:start position:0%
this point I couldn't support the
governor's

04:05:53.150 --> 04:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
04:05:55.610 --> 04:05:55.620 align:start position:0%
plan as is I think we can do better than
 
04:05:57.290 --> 04:05:57.300 align:start position:0%
that I think we we've already discussed
 
04:05:59.330 --> 04:05:59.340 align:start position:0%
how we can do better than that so that's
 
04:06:01.070 --> 04:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
my opinion
 
04:06:04.790 --> 04:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
right uh question uh
 
04:06:07.790 --> 04:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
representative Hank and Phillips uh
 
04:06:09.710 --> 04:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
would you increase that to 4100 for
 
04:06:11.870 --> 04:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
basic under that
 
04:06:15.349 --> 04:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
under uh one yeah and I'm inclined to
 
04:06:17.150 --> 04:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
say it's possible to do more I'd like to
 
04:06:19.429 --> 04:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
see Mickey run another tweak of proposal
 
04:06:20.929 --> 04:06:20.939 align:start position:0%
number one to see what that would look
 
04:06:23.150 --> 04:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
like I think we can do better yeah yeah
 
04:06:25.269 --> 04:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
okay I'm good with that
 
04:06:28.490 --> 04:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
at this point in time the best spot in
 
04:06:30.170 --> 04:06:30.180 align:start position:0%
my opinion is to continue with the
 
04:06:32.689 --> 04:06:32.699 align:start position:0%
formulas and structure of proposed by
 
04:06:35.210 --> 04:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
the governor but I do agree that moving
 
04:06:36.769 --> 04:06:36.779 align:start position:0%
some money from the left to the right
 
04:06:38.750 --> 04:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
side an amount of money to be estimated
 
04:06:40.670 --> 04:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
leaving the bottom line
 
04:06:43.370 --> 04:06:43.380 align:start position:0%
the same or maybe adjusting it depending
 
04:06:45.110 --> 04:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
we still don't know exactly how much
 
04:06:48.170 --> 04:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
money we have available yet but
 
04:06:50.330 --> 04:06:50.340 align:start position:0%
well I know for this proposal I'm
 
04:06:51.950 --> 04:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
talking about the overall division two
 
04:06:53.929 --> 04:06:53.939 align:start position:0%
budget and whether we need to find some
 
04:06:56.090 --> 04:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
savings somewhere but while we talk
 
04:06:57.710 --> 04:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
about this I would leave the bottom line
 
04:07:00.830 --> 04:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
untouched and I would you know again
 
04:07:02.570 --> 04:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
estimate a couple of those things the
 
04:07:03.889 --> 04:07:03.899 align:start position:0%
one thing that I want to express a
 
04:07:05.570 --> 04:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
concern for is again the left side of
 
04:07:08.990 --> 04:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
the formula has a legal liability side
 
04:07:11.570 --> 04:07:11.580 align:start position:0%
to it so I would like to see some
 
04:07:14.090 --> 04:07:14.100 align:start position:0%
significant increases in there to make
 
04:07:15.889 --> 04:07:15.899 align:start position:0%
sure that we have less exposure I
 
04:07:18.170 --> 04:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
believe the comment was that if we would
 
04:07:20.689 --> 04:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
cut the funding on the left side we may
 
04:07:23.150 --> 04:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
see liability I just wanted to ask were
 
04:07:24.650 --> 04:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
you talking about cutting it from its
 
04:07:26.269 --> 04:07:26.279 align:start position:0%
current value or from the proposed
 
04:07:28.610 --> 04:07:28.620 align:start position:0%
Governor's values in the past there's
 
04:07:30.830 --> 04:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
been cases there is the Dover case in
 
04:07:34.550 --> 04:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
2016 where students based multiple
 
04:07:36.229 --> 04:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
communities joined over and they sued
 
04:07:37.849 --> 04:07:37.859 align:start position:0%
the state and were successful because
 
04:07:39.830 --> 04:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
there was a cap on how quickly your
 
04:07:41.809 --> 04:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
students can grow we would have joined
 
04:07:43.790 --> 04:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
that lawsuit if there was a need to yes
 
04:07:46.010 --> 04:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
so some communities had a lot of growth
 
04:07:47.630 --> 04:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
in student student growth but the
 
04:07:49.370 --> 04:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
legislature had a law that said your
 
04:07:51.469 --> 04:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
growth is capped at x amount and they
 
04:07:53.030 --> 04:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
basically kept what is a constitutional
 
04:07:55.550 --> 04:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
education as defined by the state and
 
04:07:57.410 --> 04:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
the court said that is unconstitutional
 
04:07:59.929 --> 04:07:59.939 align:start position:0%
so there's ways to Tinker with the left
 
04:08:02.870 --> 04:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
side that probably increases your legal
 
04:08:04.729 --> 04:08:04.739 align:start position:0%
liability and has no legal or has
 
04:08:06.889 --> 04:08:06.899 align:start position:0%
minimal legal liability but yeah that's
 
04:08:09.050 --> 04:08:09.060 align:start position:0%
just a factor to always think about but
 
04:08:12.290 --> 04:08:12.300 align:start position:0%
basically decreasing from the governor's
 
04:08:14.389 --> 04:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
number while still increasing
 
04:08:16.929 --> 04:08:16.939 align:start position:0%
significantly from the current number
 
04:08:20.689 --> 04:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
should put us in a good legal situation
 
04:08:23.269 --> 04:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
yeah increasing increasing above current
 
04:08:26.150 --> 04:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
law is likely not going to increase your
 
04:08:28.250 --> 04:08:28.260 align:start position:0%
legal liability it shouldn't
 
04:08:29.929 --> 04:08:29.939 align:start position:0%
um now the third right grade readings
 
04:08:32.030 --> 04:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
out so that is a decrease on the left
 
04:08:35.650 --> 04:08:35.660 align:start position:0%
side so that's more than compensated
 
04:08:38.090 --> 04:08:38.100 align:start position:0%
if you're thrown in base
 
04:08:40.610 --> 04:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it's it's hard to say what
 
04:08:42.050 --> 04:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
a judge would say or the litigation's
 
04:08:43.849 --> 04:08:43.859 align:start position:0%
gonna go and go
 
04:08:46.490 --> 04:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
one last follow-up
 
04:08:49.429 --> 04:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
um if any drops because of the removal
 
04:08:52.070 --> 04:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
of the third grade are more than made up
 
04:08:54.950 --> 04:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
by the uh you know base adequacy
 
04:08:57.950 --> 04:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
you are saying that that should put us
 
04:08:59.389 --> 04:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
in a better place than we are today
 
04:09:02.150 --> 04:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
legal liability wise yeah I'm not a I'm
 
04:09:03.410 --> 04:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
not a Supreme Court Justice so I can't
 
04:09:06.110 --> 04:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
answer that with authority of course
 
04:09:08.570 --> 04:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
um but um but yeah I think that's a
 
04:09:10.309 --> 04:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
general Paradigm in which to view the
 
04:09:12.170 --> 04:09:12.180 align:start position:0%
the funding formula that if you're taken
 
04:09:13.729 --> 04:09:13.739 align:start position:0%
away from here but you've more than more
 
04:09:16.429 --> 04:09:16.439 align:start position:0%
than equaled it on in the same in the
 
04:09:17.510 --> 04:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
same side of the formula the
 
04:09:18.710 --> 04:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
Constitutional side of the formula
 
04:09:21.110 --> 04:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
you're definitely fine or you should be
 
04:09:21.120 --> 04:09:21.889 align:start position:0%
you're definitely fine or you should be
fine

04:09:21.889 --> 04:09:21.899 align:start position:0%
fine
 
04:09:24.889 --> 04:09:24.899 align:start position:0%
um the also um the amendments in hp2 it
 
04:09:27.229 --> 04:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
removes third grade reading as a
 
04:09:28.790 --> 04:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
component of the cost of an adequate
 
04:09:30.889 --> 04:09:30.899 align:start position:0%
education so it takes it out
 
04:09:32.210 --> 04:09:32.220 align:start position:0%
um takes out the funding but also makes
 
04:09:33.710 --> 04:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
out takes it out as part of the building
 
04:09:36.170 --> 04:09:36.180 align:start position:0%
blocks of adequacy so how the courts
 
04:09:37.610 --> 04:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
want to interpret that I don't know God
 
04:09:39.469 --> 04:09:39.479 align:start position:0%
knows yeah but they'll probably go it's
 
04:09:40.849 --> 04:09:40.859 align:start position:0%
a decision of the legislature that this
 
04:09:42.229 --> 04:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
is not part of a constitutional adequate
 
04:09:43.910 --> 04:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
education anymore and it's been taken
 
04:09:45.170 --> 04:09:45.180 align:start position:0%
out so they'll probably view it as
 
04:09:46.969 --> 04:09:46.979 align:start position:0%
understate law it's not a liability
 
04:09:50.330 --> 04:09:50.340 align:start position:0%
anymore pretty appreciate it thank you
 
04:09:52.490 --> 04:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
Mary thank you do you think it's
 
04:09:54.530 --> 04:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
possible that we could hear from
 
04:09:58.729 --> 04:09:58.739 align:start position:0%
occasion um a chair lad and um ranking
 
04:10:02.150 --> 04:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
member uh Vice ranking member uh luno
 
04:10:04.010 --> 04:10:04.020 align:start position:0%
they've been really
 
04:10:07.849 --> 04:10:07.859 align:start position:0%
um involved in this quite a bit and they
 
04:10:10.010 --> 04:10:10.020 align:start position:0%
might have some input I'd love to hear
 
04:10:11.389 --> 04:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
what they have to say
 
04:10:14.510 --> 04:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
I I just quite frankly we the equity
 
04:10:17.150 --> 04:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
thing is disturbing just going with the
 
04:10:19.070 --> 04:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
it would take 10 years to get where they
 
04:10:20.809 --> 04:10:20.819 align:start position:0%
want to get which I think is marvelous
 
04:10:25.809 --> 04:10:25.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:28.130 --> 04:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
since I haven't had a chance to say
 
04:10:28.140 --> 04:10:29.210 align:start position:0%
since I haven't had a chance to say
anything

04:10:29.210 --> 04:10:29.220 align:start position:0%
anything
 
04:10:32.630 --> 04:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm Mel Myler and I from Merrimack 9
 
04:10:34.729 --> 04:10:34.739 align:start position:0%
and I'm the ranking Dem
 
04:10:37.309 --> 04:10:37.319 align:start position:0%
uh Rick and I frankly have been working
 
04:10:38.510 --> 04:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
on this
 
04:10:41.150 --> 04:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
for a number of years we are both on the
 
04:10:44.170 --> 04:10:44.180 align:start position:0%
uh Commission in 2018
 
04:10:47.450 --> 04:10:47.460 align:start position:0%
about looked at this and from that
 
04:10:50.050 --> 04:10:50.060 align:start position:0%
several of us thought that the umberger
 
04:10:52.610 --> 04:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
review of that summer did not go far
 
04:10:55.250 --> 04:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
enough and we then created the school
 
04:10:57.410 --> 04:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
funding commission at which time
 
04:10:59.750 --> 04:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative luno basically came in
 
04:11:01.070 --> 04:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
and shared that
 
04:11:04.189 --> 04:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
and so I just want to comment uh as I've
 
04:11:05.870 --> 04:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
been listening to this I'm very
 
04:11:05.880 --> 04:11:07.309 align:start position:0%
been listening to this I'm very
encouraged

04:11:07.309 --> 04:11:07.319 align:start position:0%
encouraged
 
04:11:09.349 --> 04:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
by the conversation
 
04:11:11.269 --> 04:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we've been trying
 
04:11:13.550 --> 04:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
to deal with for some time is how do you
 
04:11:16.550 --> 04:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
begin to Target Aid into those schools
 
04:11:18.769 --> 04:11:18.779 align:start position:0%
that are are really in need
 
04:11:21.950 --> 04:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
your conversations today has basically
 
04:11:24.650 --> 04:11:24.660 align:start position:0%
given me hope that maybe we're going
 
04:11:27.889 --> 04:11:27.899 align:start position:0%
there this time back to representative
 
04:11:30.830 --> 04:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
Petrie's concern when he raised the
 
04:11:33.309 --> 04:11:33.319 align:start position:0%
issue of donor towns Etc
 
04:11:35.510 --> 04:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
one of the things we found in the
 
04:11:37.370 --> 04:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
commission that really was a guiding
 
04:11:39.170 --> 04:11:39.180 align:start position:0%
principle for us
 
04:11:43.070 --> 04:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
was to look not at my kid my students
 
04:11:44.929 --> 04:11:44.939 align:start position:0%
but our children
 
04:11:47.150 --> 04:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
and as we begin to look at how do we
 
04:11:50.269 --> 04:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
create a strong Workforce across the
 
04:11:53.269 --> 04:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
state not just in those wealthy towns
 
04:11:55.670 --> 04:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
but across the state
 
04:11:58.010 --> 04:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
to help those districts that need
 
04:12:00.410 --> 04:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
additional funding that can provide a
 
04:12:02.990 --> 04:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
greater Equity of the opportunity for
 
04:12:05.150 --> 04:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
kids particularly in those areas that
 
04:12:07.490 --> 04:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
are that are impo that are underserved
 
04:12:10.550 --> 04:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
that are impoverished this does
 
04:12:13.189 --> 04:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
help and I think the conversations about
 
04:12:16.070 --> 04:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
at least that I'm hearing from you that
 
04:12:19.070 --> 04:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
the our kids looking at all of our kids
 
04:12:22.130 --> 04:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
uh has been a at least from my
 
04:12:25.370 --> 04:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
perspective a very important shiblet as
 
04:12:27.530 --> 04:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
we look at school funding so I want to
 
04:12:29.030 --> 04:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
compliment you for that I know you still
 
04:12:31.309 --> 04:12:31.319 align:start position:0%
have got more work to do but it seems to
 
04:12:34.309 --> 04:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
me that the philosophic issue of how do
 
04:12:35.809 --> 04:12:35.819 align:start position:0%
we deal with all of this with our
 
04:12:38.510 --> 04:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
children in schools is very important I
 
04:12:40.550 --> 04:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make that comment I'm not
 
04:12:41.830 --> 04:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
a numbers guy
 
04:12:44.809 --> 04:12:44.819 align:start position:0%
these guys are the numbers guys but I
 
04:12:47.389 --> 04:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
try to provide a philosophical look at
 
04:12:49.250 --> 04:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
how we begin to move forward and I'm
 
04:12:51.349 --> 04:12:51.359 align:start position:0%
very pleased with that and thank you Mr
 
04:12:53.210 --> 04:12:53.220 align:start position:0%
chair for allowing me at least to sure
 
04:12:59.210 --> 04:12:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:59.220 --> 04:13:00.590 align:start position:0%
 
tonight

04:13:00.590 --> 04:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
tonight
 
04:13:04.189 --> 04:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'll invite Dave up here
 
04:13:07.610 --> 04:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
um I I concur that you have to do
 
04:13:09.769 --> 04:13:09.779 align:start position:0%
something with the left-hand side we
 
04:13:11.750 --> 04:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
have two court cases coming against us
 
04:13:13.610 --> 04:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:13:16.309 --> 04:13:16.319 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
04:13:19.070 --> 04:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
I think we need to get by this somehow
 
04:13:22.189 --> 04:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
and continue to try to get by it so
 
04:13:25.550 --> 04:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
increasing base is important however to
 
04:13:28.910 --> 04:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
the degree perhaps that I I've seen come
 
04:13:31.309 --> 04:13:31.319 align:start position:0%
forward from the on the governor's side
 
04:13:34.130 --> 04:13:34.140 align:start position:0%
I would I would take some of that and
 
04:13:36.650 --> 04:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
maybe put some of it
 
04:13:40.130 --> 04:13:40.140 align:start position:0%
um still on that side of the formula I I
 
04:13:42.889 --> 04:13:42.899 align:start position:0%
I've spoken before about
 
04:13:44.630 --> 04:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
um special education differentiated
 
04:13:44.640 --> 04:13:45.650 align:start position:0%
um special education differentiated
eight

04:13:45.650 --> 04:13:45.660 align:start position:0%
eight
 
04:13:48.110 --> 04:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
there's a place where 14 million dollars
 
04:13:50.450 --> 04:13:50.460 align:start position:0%
would significantly if we use that
 
04:13:53.150 --> 04:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
weighted formula of the three weighted
 
04:13:56.630 --> 04:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
categories and doe has that information
 
04:13:58.550 --> 04:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
it's something that just we have to do
 
04:14:00.710 --> 04:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
legislatively and it'll happen
 
04:14:03.170 --> 04:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
so that's one way of of keeping some on
 
04:14:06.530 --> 04:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
the left hand side I'm also
 
04:14:08.630 --> 04:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
reflective of everything we did in the
 
04:14:10.490 --> 04:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
commission study in in the umberger
 
04:14:14.150 --> 04:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
report stabilization has to go now how
 
04:14:17.030 --> 04:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
fast we get it you know I agree with you
 
04:14:19.370 --> 04:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman that
 
04:14:22.250 --> 04:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
um we we need to do that but you know if
 
04:14:24.229 --> 04:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
we spread it over so many years future
 
04:14:27.050 --> 04:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
legislators are going to go after that
 
04:14:29.269 --> 04:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
again and we're going to lose it
 
04:14:32.150 --> 04:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
so I the shorter period of time we can
 
04:14:35.450 --> 04:14:35.460 align:start position:0%
do it and make this thing work is better
 
04:14:37.429 --> 04:14:37.439 align:start position:0%
um whether we can do it in seven years I
 
04:14:38.450 --> 04:14:38.460 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
04:14:40.429 --> 04:14:40.439 align:start position:0%
um that would be a decrease of what
 
04:14:42.889 --> 04:14:42.899 align:start position:0%
around 15 percent
 
04:14:42.899 --> 04:14:44.750 align:start position:0%
around 15 percent
annually

04:14:44.750 --> 04:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
annually
 
04:14:47.630 --> 04:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
um I think that should be a Target
 
04:14:51.410 --> 04:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
um and um I'm really oppositional to
 
04:14:51.420 --> 04:14:53.150 align:start position:0%
um and um I'm really oppositional to
having

04:14:53.150 --> 04:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
having
 
04:14:55.250 --> 04:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary needs with you know we
 
04:14:59.330 --> 04:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
have 17.5 million there or what nine and
 
04:15:03.110 --> 04:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
then we 14.9 elsewhere in in the relief
 
04:15:05.150 --> 04:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
um that's all got to stop we've got to
 
04:15:07.070 --> 04:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
have one area and I I agree the
 
04:15:08.630 --> 04:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs is the best place
 
04:15:10.490 --> 04:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
and how we work that working with
 
04:15:12.590 --> 04:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
physical capacity Spirit Aid as well in
 
04:15:12.600 --> 04:15:13.729 align:start position:0%
physical capacity Spirit Aid as well in
there

04:15:13.729 --> 04:15:13.739 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:15:13.739 --> 04:15:14.570 align:start position:0%
there
um

04:15:14.570 --> 04:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:17.689 --> 04:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
I would I would suggest that
 
04:15:20.030 --> 04:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
um there must be a blending of the the
 
04:15:22.490 --> 04:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
the two reports you got here where we
 
04:15:24.830 --> 04:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
can have that third one as the blend and
 
04:15:27.229 --> 04:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
and somehow attract that but you've got
 
04:15:29.030 --> 04:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
to leave it some on that left-hand side
 
04:15:30.889 --> 04:15:30.899 align:start position:0%
or we're going to be back in the
 
04:15:32.689 --> 04:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
courtroom and we're going you know we're
 
04:15:33.910 --> 04:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
going to have the man across the street
 
04:15:36.170 --> 04:15:36.180 align:start position:0%
trying to spend more our money in
 
04:15:38.030 --> 04:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
defense of what we have done as a state
 
04:15:40.429 --> 04:15:40.439 align:start position:0%
and I I know we can avoid that if we're
 
04:15:41.689 --> 04:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
a little bit more careful when we plug
 
04:15:45.050 --> 04:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
it there I do know that that's and you
 
04:15:47.990 --> 04:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
know that by putting more there you're
 
04:15:49.790 --> 04:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
you're strengthening the position of the
 
04:15:51.950 --> 04:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
wealthy community and the the poorer
 
04:15:54.889 --> 04:15:54.899 align:start position:0%
committee at towns and we're not
 
04:15:57.170 --> 04:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
necessarily striking out and hitting the
 
04:15:58.550 --> 04:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
poor ones the way we need on the right
 
04:16:02.150 --> 04:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
hand side so you got to find that that
 
04:16:04.189 --> 04:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
comfortable area and I think it's that
 
04:16:05.929 --> 04:16:05.939 align:start position:0%
third report somehow
 
04:16:07.309 --> 04:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
represent little you might have
 
04:16:08.929 --> 04:16:08.939 align:start position:0%
something sure sure thank you very much
 
04:16:10.370 --> 04:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd and thank you very
 
04:16:12.650 --> 04:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
much members of the committee Mr chair
 
04:16:14.570 --> 04:16:14.580 align:start position:0%
um I I too agree with everything
 
04:16:16.910 --> 04:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
Representatives Miler and Ladd uh have
 
04:16:19.130 --> 04:16:19.140 align:start position:0%
said with regards to
 
04:16:21.950 --> 04:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
um being here and and hearing the the uh
 
04:16:23.809 --> 04:16:23.819 align:start position:0%
the conversation the discussion and the
 
04:16:26.330 --> 04:16:26.340 align:start position:0%
excellent questions all day
 
04:16:29.090 --> 04:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
um I I think it really shows an
 
04:16:29.100 --> 04:16:30.290 align:start position:0%
um I I think it really shows an
incredible

04:16:30.290 --> 04:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
incredible
 
04:16:33.050 --> 04:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
um interest on the part of um of
 
04:16:35.210 --> 04:16:35.220 align:start position:0%
division two and the finance committee
 
04:16:39.050 --> 04:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
uh and the governor's office to um to to
 
04:16:42.050 --> 04:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
to to do something meaningful for um for
 
04:16:43.729 --> 04:16:43.739 align:start position:0%
public school funding across the state
 
04:16:48.290 --> 04:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
uh I also am I'm am really
 
04:16:51.590 --> 04:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
um it's refreshing to to hear the
 
04:16:54.050 --> 04:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
comments that that you've all made that
 
04:16:54.060 --> 04:16:55.070 align:start position:0%
comments that that you've all made that
really

04:16:55.070 --> 04:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:16:57.110 --> 04:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
um uh reflect I think the discipline
 
04:17:00.050 --> 04:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
that you're all using in terms of not
 
04:17:01.550 --> 04:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
opening up a spreadsheet and going right
 
04:17:04.070 --> 04:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
down to the town you live in but uh but
 
04:17:06.290 --> 04:17:06.300 align:start position:0%
looking at what what it's doing to our
 
04:17:08.809 --> 04:17:08.819 align:start position:0%
to our most vulnerable and I know that's
 
04:17:11.510 --> 04:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
an overused word but communities with
 
04:17:11.520 --> 04:17:12.830 align:start position:0%
an overused word but communities with
with

04:17:12.830 --> 04:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:17:14.630 --> 04:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
um lots of students from low-income
 
04:17:14.640 --> 04:17:15.830 align:start position:0%
um lots of students from low-income
families

04:17:15.830 --> 04:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
families
 
04:17:19.010 --> 04:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
um lots of students in general and lots
 
04:17:20.809 --> 04:17:20.819 align:start position:0%
of students from places with low
 
04:17:24.469 --> 04:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
property valuations so um so obviously
 
04:17:27.349 --> 04:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
our our largest cities come to mind
 
04:17:29.150 --> 04:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
um you know first there but all also a
 
04:17:33.650 --> 04:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
lot of our towns and um and and I think
 
04:17:36.110 --> 04:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
the the one thing that really jumps out
 
04:17:38.330 --> 04:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
for me from uh from this morning in the
 
04:17:40.370 --> 04:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
in this afternoon's conversation
 
04:17:43.729 --> 04:17:43.739 align:start position:0%
someone used the term happy medium
 
04:17:47.210 --> 04:17:47.220 align:start position:0%
um and and it may be that that that is
 
04:17:49.189 --> 04:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
what we're uh we're looking for here
 
04:17:51.110 --> 04:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
something that as representative
 
04:17:53.689 --> 04:17:53.699 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd said strikes that
 
04:17:56.090 --> 04:17:56.100 align:start position:0%
balance of of of
 
04:17:58.010 --> 04:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
um accomplishing some of the the goals
 
04:18:00.290 --> 04:18:00.300 align:start position:0%
that we all agree on that we need to be
 
04:18:02.450 --> 04:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
uh tapering up we need to be whittling
 
04:18:02.460 --> 04:18:03.769 align:start position:0%
uh tapering up we need to be whittling
away

04:18:03.769 --> 04:18:03.779 align:start position:0%
away
 
04:18:06.110 --> 04:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
um stabilization maybe with maybe
 
04:18:09.710 --> 04:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
chopping away uh stabilization
 
04:18:13.130 --> 04:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
um but uh as as Mr landrigan said that's
 
04:18:17.389 --> 04:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
really hard to do and um uh you know in
 
04:18:20.570 --> 04:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
in in trying to make sure that that uh
 
04:18:23.269 --> 04:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
that some of the the districts that have
 
04:18:23.279 --> 04:18:24.889 align:start position:0%
that some of the the districts that have
the

04:18:24.889 --> 04:18:24.899 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:18:29.090 --> 04:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
lowest property valuations the highest
 
04:18:31.790 --> 04:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
pockets of poverty and the highest tax
 
04:18:34.070 --> 04:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
rates in the state so thinking Berlin
 
04:18:37.309 --> 04:18:37.319 align:start position:0%
thinking Newport that they don't get
 
04:18:39.830 --> 04:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
um you know that they don't get hurt and
 
04:18:43.309 --> 04:18:43.319 align:start position:0%
uh and so uh so I I think I think there
 
04:18:46.550 --> 04:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
is an opportunity for for a a happy
 
04:18:49.130 --> 04:18:49.140 align:start position:0%
medium type type proposal that
 
04:18:51.170 --> 04:18:51.180 align:start position:0%
accomplishes what the governor is
 
04:18:54.170 --> 04:18:54.180 align:start position:0%
looking to do with um moving us away
 
04:18:58.670 --> 04:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
from the the crutch of stabilization
 
04:19:01.969 --> 04:19:01.979 align:start position:0%
um increasing uh the uh the base cost of
 
04:19:04.309 --> 04:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
adequacy so the cost of the goods in the
 
04:19:08.090 --> 04:19:08.100 align:start position:0%
bag and um and and making sure that
 
04:19:11.630 --> 04:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
we're providing some relief for um for
 
04:19:13.849 --> 04:19:13.859 align:start position:0%
well let me say the other way relief for
 
04:19:16.070 --> 04:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
students in terms of you know better
 
04:19:19.070 --> 04:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
outcomes and relief from taxpayers in
 
04:19:21.830 --> 04:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
terms of skyrocketing property tax rates
 
04:19:23.630 --> 04:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:19:26.450 --> 04:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
um and and I think we can we can do it
 
04:19:29.630 --> 04:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
pretty close staying within the um the
 
04:19:29.640 --> 04:19:31.010 align:start position:0%
pretty close staying within the um the
the cost

04:19:31.010 --> 04:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
the cost
 
04:19:34.070 --> 04:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
um uh framework that that the governor
 
04:19:37.610 --> 04:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
uh has has put forward uh the house a
 
04:19:40.570 --> 04:19:40.580 align:start position:0%
few weeks ago did pass you know the the
 
04:19:42.830 --> 04:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
education committee unanimously the
 
04:19:46.370 --> 04:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
house on a Voice vote Hospital 529 which
 
04:19:48.050 --> 04:19:48.060 align:start position:0%
has been referred to a few times here
 
04:19:49.429 --> 04:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
which which
 
04:19:52.429 --> 04:19:52.439 align:start position:0%
um I think touches just about I mean not
 
04:19:55.429 --> 04:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily touch touch some
 
04:19:57.229 --> 04:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
of the wealthiest property wealthiest
 
04:19:59.330 --> 04:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
students but it certainly touch touches
 
04:20:02.210 --> 04:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
many of those and so many
 
04:20:04.610 --> 04:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
um municipalities across across the
 
04:20:07.250 --> 04:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
state and um and you know I think if
 
04:20:10.849 --> 04:20:10.859 align:start position:0%
something like that was uh was was maybe
 
04:20:14.870 --> 04:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
used in conjunction with a and and Mr
 
04:20:18.610 --> 04:20:18.620 align:start position:0%
landergan has it um in The Proposal here
 
04:20:22.849 --> 04:20:22.859 align:start position:0%
uh but um but maybe um maybe you know
 
04:20:25.370 --> 04:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
step you know stepping up the force on
 
04:20:26.889 --> 04:20:26.899 align:start position:0%
on that
 
04:20:29.269 --> 04:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
we might be able to see a distribution
 
04:20:32.510 --> 04:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
that's really good for good for places
 
04:20:35.210 --> 04:20:35.220 align:start position:0%
like Manchester and Nashua but also good
 
04:20:37.750 --> 04:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
for the some of the smaller
 
04:20:40.070 --> 04:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
districts and towns that are really
 
04:20:42.050 --> 04:20:42.060 align:start position:0%
struggling too and I appreciate the
 
04:20:45.170 --> 04:20:45.180 align:start position:0%
comments from uh from um uh Hanover
 
04:20:47.750 --> 04:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
Windham and and Newcastle uh with
 
04:20:51.110 --> 04:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
respect to how they you know their
 
04:20:54.290 --> 04:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
responsibility that that they see
 
04:20:56.929 --> 04:20:56.939 align:start position:0%
um Statewide so thank you
 
04:20:58.610 --> 04:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
I think that was the intent of trying to
 
04:21:01.130 --> 04:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
get some 529 in this
 
04:21:03.950 --> 04:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
but we actually retained it
 
04:21:03.960 --> 04:21:10.130 align:start position:0%
but we actually retained it
520

04:21:10.130 --> 04:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:12.229 --> 04:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
say thank you I want to thank Mickey and
 
04:21:13.670 --> 04:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
I hope his children will still recognize
 
04:21:16.130 --> 04:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
him when this is over and for going well
 
04:21:20.030 --> 04:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
above and beyond and any other cycle and
 
04:21:21.650 --> 04:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
to add to that
 
04:21:24.530 --> 04:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to to get a broader picture
 
04:21:26.689 --> 04:21:26.699 align:start position:0%
of how these things how things go up and
 
04:21:28.130 --> 04:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
down if you push one lever and the other
 
04:21:30.410 --> 04:21:30.420 align:start position:0%
lever uh my grandson has that trait from
 
04:21:32.630 --> 04:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
me too I do believe if we could get a
 
04:21:35.210 --> 04:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
scheme if we moved as um representative
 
04:21:38.750 --> 04:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
Higgins has suggested the 4100 and also
 
04:21:40.849 --> 04:21:40.859 align:start position:0%
one for 4200
 
04:21:42.590 --> 04:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
um to see how that plays out towards the
 
04:21:45.650 --> 04:21:45.660 align:start position:0%
end and if it's also possible to raise
 
04:21:48.889 --> 04:21:48.899 align:start position:0%
the um around the sped just I mean it's
 
04:21:51.830 --> 04:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
a small amount but to 2100 for you know
 
04:21:53.809 --> 04:21:53.819 align:start position:0%
for both years so that's like four
 
04:21:55.130 --> 04:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets with four different
 
04:21:57.469 --> 04:21:57.479 align:start position:0%
variables in there is that reasonable to
 
04:21:58.849 --> 04:21:58.859 align:start position:0%
ask or are you just going to jump out
 
04:22:01.370 --> 04:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
the window or throw me out the window
 
04:22:05.030 --> 04:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
foreign so running these are not overly
 
04:22:06.650 --> 04:22:06.660 align:start position:0%
difficult presenting them back to you
 
04:22:07.490 --> 04:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
will be a little difficult with
 
04:22:09.410 --> 04:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
production and getting it and that makes
 
04:22:11.450 --> 04:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
sense I think one of the biggest
 
04:22:13.670 --> 04:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
variables and then backing going back
 
04:22:15.170 --> 04:22:15.180 align:start position:0%
from there is how much you're looking to
 
04:22:17.450 --> 04:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
spend in total to make sure your
 
04:22:19.010 --> 04:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
budget's balance your education trust
 
04:22:21.590 --> 04:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
fund has the resources to cover a plan
 
04:22:23.269 --> 04:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
how much do you want to allocate to Ed
 
04:22:24.530 --> 04:22:24.540 align:start position:0%
funding and then we can maybe work
 
04:22:26.570 --> 04:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
backwards in the components to fit into
 
04:22:28.429 --> 04:22:28.439 align:start position:0%
that total spend and that's where I
 
04:22:29.929 --> 04:22:29.939 align:start position:0%
think we were going earlier with kind of
 
04:22:31.250 --> 04:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
look at the education trust fund with
 
04:22:32.870 --> 04:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
where you are with your decisions to
 
04:22:36.050 --> 04:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
this point but but certainly I can give
 
04:22:38.990 --> 04:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
you a couple you know a menu or you know
 
04:22:40.429 --> 04:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
a cafeteria whatever they call there's
 
04:22:43.729 --> 04:22:43.739 align:start position:0%
like a chain a term for this and give
 
04:22:45.769 --> 04:22:45.779 align:start position:0%
you some more options for for next week
 
04:22:47.450 --> 04:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
I don't think I'm going to be able to
 
04:22:50.030 --> 04:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
get this into a usable you know for
 
04:22:51.349 --> 04:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
folks to work over the weekend anything
 
04:22:53.630 --> 04:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
like that but I am happy to sit with
 
04:22:55.849 --> 04:22:55.859 align:start position:0%
folks and I've done this in the past a
 
04:22:58.130 --> 04:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
smaller group and run numbers kind of as
 
04:22:59.269 --> 04:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to see if we can make
 
04:23:01.130 --> 04:23:01.140 align:start position:0%
something work too
 
04:23:01.140 --> 04:23:02.809 align:start position:0%
something work too
um

04:23:02.809 --> 04:23:02.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:02.819 --> 04:23:05.330 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:23:05.330 --> 04:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:23:07.189 --> 04:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where I'm at with with
 
04:23:07.199 --> 04:23:08.330 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where I'm at with with
this

04:23:08.330 --> 04:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:23:10.429 --> 04:23:10.439 align:start position:0%
we're looking for a sweet spot we're not
 
04:23:11.809 --> 04:23:11.819 align:start position:0%
going to find it but we're looking for
 
04:23:15.229 --> 04:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
something that kind of at least hits all
 
04:23:17.150 --> 04:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
parts of the Target and I think you can
 
04:23:18.050 --> 04:23:18.060 align:start position:0%
get there
 
04:23:20.450 --> 04:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
and for me it's I'm spinning my wheels
 
04:23:22.370 --> 04:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
without knowing how much of that total
 
04:23:24.469 --> 04:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
on the far right column can that equal
 
04:23:26.210 --> 04:23:26.220 align:start position:0%
and that's what I think once you solve
 
04:23:28.130 --> 04:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
that I can give you a little bit and
 
04:23:29.450 --> 04:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
over here with the governor's approach
 
04:23:31.309 --> 04:23:31.319 align:start position:0%
give you a little bit here with 529 and
 
04:23:33.650 --> 04:23:33.660 align:start position:0%
targeted and present some options in the
 
04:23:33.660 --> 04:23:34.370 align:start position:0%
targeted and present some options in the
middle

04:23:34.370 --> 04:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
middle
 
04:23:34.380 --> 04:23:35.750 align:start position:0%
middle
oh

04:23:35.750 --> 04:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:23:38.330 --> 04:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
the trust fund is not necessarily an
 
04:23:41.630 --> 04:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
increase in budget spending
 
04:23:43.490 --> 04:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
I'm asking a question I'm not making a
 
04:23:43.500 --> 04:23:44.870 align:start position:0%
I'm asking a question I'm not making a
statement

04:23:44.870 --> 04:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
statement
 
04:23:48.530 --> 04:23:48.540 align:start position:0%
so if we flip to that page six of the
 
04:23:51.110 --> 04:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
this packet the our usual tracking
 
04:23:54.050 --> 04:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
sheets packet 96 million and folks I'm
 
04:23:55.130 --> 04:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
sorry you probably don't have one of
 
04:24:00.010 --> 04:24:00.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:02.510 --> 04:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
the tracking documents
 
04:24:04.910 --> 04:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
we're all set if you're all set
 
04:24:07.070 --> 04:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
well I gotta I got a question for
 
04:24:09.349 --> 04:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd all right yeah it's
 
04:24:13.130 --> 04:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:15.710 --> 04:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
core and and actually uh representative
 
04:24:17.809 --> 04:24:17.819 align:start position:0%
Murray hit on this too
 
04:24:19.790 --> 04:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
how much of a correlation is it between
 
04:24:23.389 --> 04:24:23.399 align:start position:0%
the percentage of sped and poverty the
 
04:24:29.030 --> 04:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:32.210 --> 04:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
special education whether you have TBI
 
04:24:34.490 --> 04:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
traumatic brain injury or orthopedically
 
04:24:37.070 --> 04:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
handicapped or a speech you know if
 
04:24:39.290 --> 04:24:39.300 align:start position:0%
there was that everybody in Boston would
 
04:24:40.570 --> 04:24:40.580 align:start position:0%
have an IEP
 
04:24:44.150 --> 04:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
so there is no no relationship there
 
04:24:46.790 --> 04:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
there's there is a relationship of
 
04:24:48.349 --> 04:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
course when we're looking at overall
 
04:24:51.650 --> 04:24:51.660 align:start position:0%
achievement and a poverty yes that there
 
04:24:54.110 --> 04:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
that is definitely identified
 
04:24:56.570 --> 04:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
so if you're looking at trying to
 
04:24:59.570 --> 04:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
increase our our growth and our
 
04:25:02.150 --> 04:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
achievement levels within the state then
 
04:25:03.769 --> 04:25:03.779 align:start position:0%
you have to direct the money to where
 
04:25:05.510 --> 04:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's best needed and that's with those
 
04:25:07.389 --> 04:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
districts which are hurting
 
04:25:10.610 --> 04:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
but there's nothing there the the reason
 
04:25:12.590 --> 04:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
why I've mentioned special education and
 
04:25:14.630 --> 04:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
are differentiated before because you
 
04:25:18.349 --> 04:25:18.359 align:start position:0%
know and I know that we have children
 
04:25:20.750 --> 04:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
that are very expansive in terms of
 
04:25:22.729 --> 04:25:22.739 align:start position:0%
providing a service in the first seventy
 
04:25:24.650 --> 04:25:24.660 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars is that of the school
 
04:25:28.070 --> 04:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
district now if we Elevate the amount
 
04:25:29.570 --> 04:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
we're getting in differentiated Aid
 
04:25:31.250 --> 04:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
which we know that you can't deliver
 
04:25:32.990 --> 04:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
some of these services at the pricing
 
04:25:35.450 --> 04:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
that we're providing under special ed so
 
04:25:38.450 --> 04:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
that helps offer some rationale for
 
04:25:40.010 --> 04:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
those that are looking at what's our
 
04:25:41.990 --> 04:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
commitment to that left-hand side of the
 
04:25:44.210 --> 04:25:44.220 align:start position:0%
formula we're putting some dollars there
 
04:25:46.490 --> 04:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
where it's necessary we start the
 
04:25:50.210 --> 04:25:50.220 align:start position:0%
weighted formula and then we in future
 
04:25:52.969 --> 04:25:52.979 align:start position:0%
years we see how this works and maybe
 
04:25:54.849 --> 04:25:54.859 align:start position:0%
even build upon it
 
04:25:57.769 --> 04:25:57.779 align:start position:0%
there is a definite need as expressed by
 
04:26:00.050 --> 04:26:00.060 align:start position:0%
the 39 States in this country that do
 
04:26:01.490 --> 04:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
that right now
 
04:26:03.649 --> 04:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
and it's it's difficult for me to
 
04:26:05.510 --> 04:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
comprehend why we're funding all the
 
04:26:07.729 --> 04:26:07.739 align:start position:0%
differentiated AIDS special ed kids with
 
04:26:10.309 --> 04:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
one figure only when we have 13
 
04:26:12.889 --> 04:26:12.899 align:start position:0%
different IEPs which are significantly
 
04:26:14.630 --> 04:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
different from each other
 
04:26:16.910 --> 04:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
so so you're saying we should put more
 
04:26:19.189 --> 04:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
money in a special ed in the
 
04:26:21.469 --> 04:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid should we should we
 
04:26:24.170 --> 04:26:24.180 align:start position:0%
step it within within the spread uh you
 
04:26:26.510 --> 04:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
you have the flexibility the primary
 
04:26:29.689 --> 04:26:29.699 align:start position:0%
goal that we have in in education policy
 
04:26:32.570 --> 04:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
right now is for all to recognize that
 
04:26:34.429 --> 04:26:34.439 align:start position:0%
there should be weighted components
 
04:26:37.429 --> 04:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
within differentiated Aid now we started
 
04:26:39.170 --> 04:26:39.180 align:start position:0%
at two thousand dollars plus basically
 
04:26:42.050 --> 04:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
that's what we're at and we multiplied
 
04:26:44.149 --> 04:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
it by two and then by three to get to
 
04:26:46.790 --> 04:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
those other categories uh you you could
 
04:26:48.950 --> 04:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
you could multiply it a little lower uh
 
04:26:50.689 --> 04:26:50.699 align:start position:0%
I hope not a great deal because we're
 
04:26:52.729 --> 04:26:52.739 align:start position:0%
not really putting in significant
 
04:26:54.469 --> 04:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
dollars when we talk about our whole
 
04:26:57.290 --> 04:26:57.300 align:start position:0%
budget for Education when we're talking
 
04:27:00.889 --> 04:27:00.899 align:start position:0%
perhaps 15 million dollars or at most at
 
04:27:05.030 --> 04:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:07.070 --> 04:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
but there is some fudge room there as
 
04:27:08.210 --> 04:27:08.220 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about with base
 
04:27:10.189 --> 04:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
adequacy and that and and on the right
 
04:27:12.950 --> 04:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
hand side so it's finding that sweet
 
04:27:15.590 --> 04:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
spot as I've heard people talking about
 
04:27:21.469 --> 04:27:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:23.290 --> 04:27:23.300 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to
 
04:27:25.670 --> 04:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
representative Vlad addressed it very
 
04:27:28.370 --> 04:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
well but I just want to reinforce that I
 
04:27:29.870 --> 04:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
don't think there is any correlation
 
04:27:32.090 --> 04:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
between poverty and special education
 
04:27:34.250 --> 04:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
needs if anything sometimes that provide
 
04:27:36.649 --> 04:27:36.659 align:start position:0%
really good Services end up attracting
 
04:27:38.269 --> 04:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
families to move over because the
 
04:27:40.010 --> 04:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
schools will properly handle their kids
 
04:27:42.530 --> 04:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
so if we look into one it may be even be
 
04:27:43.790 --> 04:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
reverse but I don't think there is
 
04:27:45.710 --> 04:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
enough of a variation to consider that
 
04:27:47.570 --> 04:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
part of the policy I agree with
 
04:27:49.370 --> 04:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
representative land that if we want to
 
04:27:51.530 --> 04:27:51.540 align:start position:0%
handle that we got to look at the costs
 
04:27:53.809 --> 04:27:53.819 align:start position:0%
not the percentages of students or
 
04:27:57.830 --> 04:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:01.849 --> 04:28:01.859 align:start position:0%
well and if if I may uh in the past we
 
04:28:04.670 --> 04:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
have a matter of fact uh my first term
 
04:28:07.670 --> 04:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
there was two students from Nashua
 
04:28:11.389 --> 04:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
schools it was 750 000 a piece and
 
04:28:13.070 --> 04:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
that's you know the weighted formula
 
04:28:14.809 --> 04:28:14.819 align:start position:0%
that representative Ladd talked about
 
04:28:16.189 --> 04:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
was uh
 
04:28:17.570 --> 04:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
you know that's
 
04:28:20.210 --> 04:28:20.220 align:start position:0%
maybe we should look at stepping that
 
04:28:23.450 --> 04:28:23.460 align:start position:0%
special ed you know right for where it's
 
04:28:25.729 --> 04:28:25.739 align:start position:0%
neat or or either that or if there is
 
04:28:27.830 --> 04:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
you know catastrophic a like that maybe
 
04:28:30.790 --> 04:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
changing that a little bit
 
04:28:34.370 --> 04:28:34.380 align:start position:0%
I mean Now's the Time well well we're
 
04:28:36.410 --> 04:28:36.420 align:start position:0%
there's nobody to hand the ball to we're
 
04:28:36.420 --> 04:28:37.250 align:start position:0%
there's nobody to hand the ball to we're
it

04:28:37.250 --> 04:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:28:39.469 --> 04:28:39.479 align:start position:0%
well that's that's the whole thing here
 
04:28:41.090 --> 04:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
trying to mix
 
04:28:41.100 --> 04:28:42.110 align:start position:0%
trying to mix
what

04:28:42.110 --> 04:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:28:44.330 --> 04:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
what can ask representative Murray
 
04:28:55.250 --> 04:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:55.260 --> 04:28:56.389 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:28:56.389 --> 04:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:00.110 --> 04:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
so is this is this document give us an
 
04:29:01.849 --> 04:29:01.859 align:start position:0%
outline of what's left on the left side
 
04:29:03.170 --> 04:29:03.180 align:start position:0%
and what's on the right side that's what
 
04:29:07.510 --> 04:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:10.910 --> 04:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
as a blueprint uh yeah I think uh doe
 
04:29:12.469 --> 04:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
put that together to kind of break out
 
04:29:14.389 --> 04:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
the components of the formula
 
04:29:16.429 --> 04:29:16.439 align:start position:0%
yes right
 
04:29:19.010 --> 04:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
this this has just the
 
04:29:23.510 --> 04:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:26.090 --> 04:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
right on the on the right hand side when
 
04:29:27.469 --> 04:29:27.479 align:start position:0%
we keep talking about the right hand
 
04:29:28.969 --> 04:29:28.979 align:start position:0%
side what's over here is additional
 
04:29:31.189 --> 04:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
Grant relief Aid extraordinary needs
 
04:29:33.889 --> 04:29:33.899 align:start position:0%
stabilization and hold harmless is that
 
04:29:38.809 --> 04:29:38.819 align:start position:0%
yep is that the right side yes thank you
 
04:29:40.910 --> 04:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
okay so on page six of the education
 
04:29:43.670 --> 04:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
trust fund online 22 is where you'll see
 
04:29:46.729 --> 04:29:46.739 align:start position:0%
the line that ties to this whole
 
04:29:48.050 --> 04:29:48.060 align:start position:0%
discussion that we're talking about so
 
04:29:49.729 --> 04:29:49.739 align:start position:0%
that the amounts that are carried in
 
04:29:52.010 --> 04:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
there now for division two's places the
 
04:29:53.870 --> 04:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
governors so
 
04:29:55.370 --> 04:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
um and that was approximately the same
 
04:29:57.050 --> 04:29:57.060 align:start position:0%
as the other proposal that was the idea
 
04:29:59.750 --> 04:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
was to stay around the same number so
 
04:30:02.330 --> 04:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
if if we did add additional funds in
 
04:30:04.490 --> 04:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
this area those appropriation amounts
 
04:30:05.929 --> 04:30:05.939 align:start position:0%
would increase and of course it would
 
04:30:08.510 --> 04:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
decrease your ending position so as you
 
04:30:09.710 --> 04:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
stand right now with the revenue
 
04:30:11.149 --> 04:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
projections with the house bill 2
 
04:30:13.550 --> 04:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
provision relative to the uh
 
04:30:17.510 --> 04:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh swap of uh split of business taxes
 
04:30:19.429 --> 04:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
and some of the other decisions we've
 
04:30:22.189 --> 04:30:22.199 align:start position:0%
made to this point there's 96 million
 
04:30:23.570 --> 04:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
dollars remaining at the in the
 
04:30:25.309 --> 04:30:25.319 align:start position:0%
education trust fund at the end of June
 
04:30:28.790 --> 04:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:31.910 --> 04:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
I can leave it with that or uh I don't
 
04:30:33.050 --> 04:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
know if there's any questions to that
 
04:30:36.110 --> 04:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
point how does that correlate to uh this
 
04:30:37.670 --> 04:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
third call is that
 
04:30:40.849 --> 04:30:40.859 align:start position:0%
are they that's this is the governor's
 
04:30:42.830 --> 04:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
numbers well these the governors they're
 
04:30:44.750 --> 04:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
approximately the same it's it's
 
04:30:48.349 --> 04:30:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:50.929 --> 04:30:50.939 align:start position:0%
but if we if we increase it to 4 100 or
 
04:30:53.090 --> 04:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
4200 that all that's going to do is eat
 
04:30:55.490 --> 04:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
into the fund and that's and that's the
 
04:30:57.649 --> 04:30:57.659 align:start position:0%
question is do you want to increase
 
04:31:00.229 --> 04:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
those numbers to something else which
 
04:31:01.849 --> 04:31:01.859 align:start position:0%
would eat into the fund yes it would
 
04:31:03.110 --> 04:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
change your bottom line but that would
 
04:31:04.790 --> 04:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
give flexibility with coming up with
 
04:31:06.290 --> 04:31:06.300 align:start position:0%
this I'm going to use it again The Sweet
 
04:31:09.530 --> 04:31:09.540 align:start position:0%
Spot you know the the third uh sheet
 
04:31:11.149 --> 04:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
that you want me to work on which I can
 
04:31:11.159 --> 04:31:12.530 align:start position:0%
that you want me to work on which I can
do

04:31:12.530 --> 04:31:12.540 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:31:15.110 --> 04:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
I'm I think I'm misunderstanding
 
04:31:18.590 --> 04:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
something doesn't page six and the 96
 
04:31:22.250 --> 04:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
million in Surplus reflect
 
04:31:22.260 --> 04:31:23.090 align:start position:0%
million in Surplus reflect
um

04:31:23.090 --> 04:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:26.090 --> 04:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposal
 
04:31:28.370 --> 04:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
um so I mean changing our formula you
 
04:31:29.990 --> 04:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
know to 41
 
04:31:30.000 --> 04:31:30.830 align:start position:0%
know to 41
um

04:31:30.830 --> 04:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:33.050 --> 04:31:33.060 align:start position:0%
and using the rest of that money on the
 
04:31:34.849 --> 04:31:34.859 align:start position:0%
other side of the formula won't change
 
04:31:36.889 --> 04:31:36.899 align:start position:0%
the 96 million if we're working within
 
04:31:38.990 --> 04:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget we're still left
 
04:31:41.090 --> 04:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
with a 96 million every well this is
 
04:31:42.290 --> 04:31:42.300 align:start position:0%
where I'm confused because I'm hearing
 
04:31:43.790 --> 04:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
two different The Proposal I walked
 
04:31:45.290 --> 04:31:45.300 align:start position:0%
through today stayed within that but
 
04:31:48.649 --> 04:31:48.659 align:start position:0%
we're discussing now adding to it so
 
04:31:51.349 --> 04:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
that's that's where my my question is if
 
04:31:53.570 --> 04:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
you wanted to spend more in total than
 
04:31:55.010 --> 04:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
the governor that's the line it would be
 
04:31:56.870 --> 04:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
reflected my second point is that you
 
04:31:59.389 --> 04:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
know we have we are facing
 
04:32:01.550 --> 04:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
um the situation where we have and
 
04:32:03.889 --> 04:32:03.899 align:start position:0%
surplus in the education trust fund it
 
04:32:06.349 --> 04:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
appears as Surplus may continue you know
 
04:32:08.090 --> 04:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
no one's going to predict the economy
 
04:32:10.729 --> 04:32:10.739 align:start position:0%
but um it seems like it would be very
 
04:32:12.889 --> 04:32:12.899 align:start position:0%
appropriate use of the education trust
 
04:32:15.649 --> 04:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
fund to use it for education and worry
 
04:32:18.170 --> 04:32:18.180 align:start position:0%
less about moving it to the general fund
 
04:32:20.710 --> 04:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
for other programs
 
04:32:23.510 --> 04:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
no no but I'm saying there's a proposal
 
04:32:25.670 --> 04:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
to change what's going into the
 
04:32:27.170 --> 04:32:27.180 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and I'm saying
 
04:32:29.210 --> 04:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
maybe that's not necessarily a good
 
04:32:31.130 --> 04:32:31.140 align:start position:0%
thing to do because it seems better are
 
04:32:32.570 --> 04:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
used for the education trust fund money
 
04:32:35.149 --> 04:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
is the education that's my thought and
 
04:32:37.729 --> 04:32:37.739 align:start position:0%
that's why I said but to the point of
 
04:32:40.370 --> 04:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
why is it decreasing every 100 dollars
 
04:32:43.849 --> 04:32:43.859 align:start position:0%
you add to the base is 16 million
 
04:32:47.330 --> 04:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
so if we had three in
 
04:32:47.340 --> 04:32:49.189 align:start position:0%
so if we had three in
ches

04:32:49.189 --> 04:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
ches
 
04:32:51.590 --> 04:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
and and like I said that there may be
 
04:32:52.910 --> 04:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
netting associated with depending on
 
04:32:54.769 --> 04:32:54.779 align:start position:0%
which plan you use so if you go from the
 
04:32:55.910 --> 04:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
governor's plan
 
04:32:59.809 --> 04:32:59.819 align:start position:0%
and increase 100 on the base you might
 
04:33:01.429 --> 04:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
not see a 16 million on the other end
 
04:33:02.630 --> 04:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
because it may chip into the hold
 
04:33:03.950 --> 04:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
harmless that's required so there's
 
04:33:05.330 --> 04:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
going to be some netting involved in
 
04:33:08.269 --> 04:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
that 48 million but the point is we're
 
04:33:10.970 --> 04:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
going to spend the money we were holding
 
04:33:15.551 --> 04:33:15.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:17.990 --> 04:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
distributed differently a little more
 
04:33:19.730 --> 04:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
aggressively to the media communities
 
04:33:21.769 --> 04:33:21.779 align:start position:0%
than the even the governor's plan but
 
04:33:23.869 --> 04:33:23.879 align:start position:0%
can I still I'm still feeling that
 
04:33:25.551 --> 04:33:25.561 align:start position:0%
there's a disconnect and maybe it's
 
04:33:28.609 --> 04:33:28.619 align:start position:0%
probably mine but this 96 million is
 
04:33:31.131 --> 04:33:31.141 align:start position:0%
reflective of what's left after the
 
04:33:33.470 --> 04:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
governor's budget what we're proposing
 
04:33:34.970 --> 04:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
is to stay right now what we're
 
04:33:37.189 --> 04:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
proposing is a hybrid system where we
 
04:33:38.810 --> 04:33:38.820 align:start position:0%
stay within the governor's budget so
 
04:33:41.029 --> 04:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
there would still be the 96 million
 
04:33:43.849 --> 04:33:43.859 align:start position:0%
that's what the proposal one is yeah
 
04:33:46.010 --> 04:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
staying with them so that leaves us 96
 
04:33:47.709 --> 04:33:47.719 align:start position:0%
million to pull 20 million or whatever
 
04:33:50.090 --> 04:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
additional to Target every time you add
 
04:33:53.269 --> 04:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
a hundred dollars to the 3 900 it costs
 
04:33:55.551 --> 04:33:55.561 align:start position:0%
16 million dollars in the budget yes but
 
04:33:58.609 --> 04:33:58.619 align:start position:0%
that's not I guess I'm not being clear
 
04:33:58.619 --> 04:33:59.390 align:start position:0%
that's not I guess I'm not being clear
um

04:33:59.390 --> 04:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:59.400 --> 04:34:00.709 align:start position:0%
um
yes

04:34:00.709 --> 04:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:34:02.029 --> 04:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
um I get that maybe you can tell because
 
04:34:04.429 --> 04:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
I'm not doing it
 
04:34:06.109 --> 04:34:06.119 align:start position:0%
um you're doing great keep it up you
 
04:34:07.490 --> 04:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
know um
 
04:34:09.230 --> 04:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
staying within the governor's budget
 
04:34:11.570 --> 04:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
still would leave us regardless of how
 
04:34:13.609 --> 04:34:13.619 align:start position:0%
we hybrid it out with moving up to 41
 
04:34:15.289 --> 04:34:15.299 align:start position:0%
and moving stay or moving this to
 
04:34:17.150 --> 04:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
keeping it 47 and keeping maintaining
 
04:34:19.310 --> 04:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget we still will have
 
04:34:21.830 --> 04:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
96 if we stay within those parameters we
 
04:34:24.170 --> 04:34:24.180 align:start position:0%
still have 96 million in Surplus that we
 
04:34:26.869 --> 04:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
can tap into to increase the targeted
 
04:34:28.849 --> 04:34:28.859 align:start position:0%
age beyond what the governor's budget is
 
04:34:30.349 --> 04:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
proposing and Beyond what we're
 
04:34:31.789 --> 04:34:31.799 align:start position:0%
proposing within the governor's
 
04:34:33.650 --> 04:34:33.660 align:start position:0%
parameters does that make sense am I on
 
04:34:36.590 --> 04:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:36.600 --> 04:34:38.769 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:34:38.769 --> 04:34:38.779 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:34:42.289 --> 04:34:42.299 align:start position:0%
just because we could and I agree that
 
04:34:44.150 --> 04:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
we could it doesn't necessarily mean
 
04:34:46.369 --> 04:34:46.379 align:start position:0%
that we should but I do acknowledge that
 
04:34:50.170 --> 04:34:50.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:54.230 --> 04:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
when you're saying add 11 on what are
 
04:34:57.650 --> 04:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
you saying 1100 no no I'm saying
 
04:34:59.590 --> 04:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:35:03.410 --> 04:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
proposal one yeah stays with it within
 
04:35:07.010 --> 04:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
the governor's parameters
 
04:35:07.020 --> 04:35:08.390 align:start position:0%
the governor's parameters
but

04:35:08.390 --> 04:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:35:11.570 --> 04:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
I would prefer that the base in proposal
 
04:35:15.410 --> 04:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
one become proposal 2 move to some
 
04:35:16.869 --> 04:35:16.879 align:start position:0%
higher number
 
04:35:19.609 --> 04:35:19.619 align:start position:0%
4100 4200
 
04:35:21.890 --> 04:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
but every time we do that we're reducing
 
04:35:25.131 --> 04:35:25.141 align:start position:0%
the bottom line on page six by 16
 
04:35:28.189 --> 04:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
million dollars per hundred that's 48
 
04:35:31.070 --> 04:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
that we're taking half of it so it
 
04:35:33.650 --> 04:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
depends if uh it depends which plan you
 
04:35:35.330 --> 04:35:35.340 align:start position:0%
use so if we let's say we started with
 
04:35:37.609 --> 04:35:37.619 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget that doesn't have
 
04:35:39.230 --> 04:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
the any of the targeted Aid except for
 
04:35:40.609 --> 04:35:40.619 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary needs in its current
 
04:35:42.830 --> 04:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
form and the big hold harmless if you
 
04:35:44.330 --> 04:35:44.340 align:start position:0%
increase that by
 
04:35:46.551 --> 04:35:46.561 align:start position:0%
you know from 3 900 to something you're
 
04:35:48.830 --> 04:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
going to reduce the whole harmless
 
04:35:50.029 --> 04:35:50.039 align:start position:0%
that's required so it's not going to be
 
04:35:52.490 --> 04:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
a 16 million dollar increase okay but
 
04:35:54.010 --> 04:35:54.020 align:start position:0%
whatever it comes out
 
04:35:57.289 --> 04:35:57.299 align:start position:0%
some number so
 
04:35:57.299 --> 04:36:00.410 align:start position:0%
some number so
yes

04:36:00.410 --> 04:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:03.650 --> 04:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
we're eating our seed for no
 
04:36:05.869 --> 04:36:05.879 align:start position:0%
this isn't Seed corn this is this is
 
04:36:05.879 --> 04:36:09.949 align:start position:0%
this isn't Seed corn this is this is
extra

04:36:09.949 --> 04:36:09.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:11.689 --> 04:36:11.699 align:start position:0%
so I guess a question I have for the
 
04:36:13.429 --> 04:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
committee is we've heard from all about
 
04:36:15.590 --> 04:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
all I'm going to say four including
 
04:36:17.090 --> 04:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
stabilization is
 
04:36:19.551 --> 04:36:19.561 align:start position:0%
stabilization out completely or is there
 
04:36:22.250 --> 04:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
any sort of appetite to phase it in any
 
04:36:24.289 --> 04:36:24.299 align:start position:0%
way because that will drive a lot of
 
04:36:26.929 --> 04:36:26.939 align:start position:0%
this calculation as well
 
04:36:30.051 --> 04:36:30.061 align:start position:0%
I think I think
 
04:36:31.369 --> 04:36:31.379 align:start position:0%
the point that it's even cold
 
04:36:33.650 --> 04:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
stabilization is the problem
 
04:36:36.170 --> 04:36:36.180 align:start position:0%
if we could call it XYZ or something
 
04:36:36.180 --> 04:36:37.250 align:start position:0%
if we could call it XYZ or something
else

04:36:37.250 --> 04:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
else
 
04:36:40.910 --> 04:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh but as long as it's calculated in
 
04:36:40.920 --> 04:36:42.709 align:start position:0%
uh but as long as it's calculated in
here

04:36:42.709 --> 04:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:36:44.869 --> 04:36:44.879 align:start position:0%
next term they can decide oh we're going
 
04:36:46.910 --> 04:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
to put it back and not reduce it I think
 
04:36:48.949 --> 04:36:48.959 align:start position:0%
your idea of reducing it
 
04:36:50.449 --> 04:36:50.459 align:start position:0%
is good
 
04:36:53.090 --> 04:36:53.100 align:start position:0%
but if we reduced it by 15 percent
 
04:36:55.970 --> 04:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:58.010 --> 04:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
what does that do and that's a question
 
04:37:00.170 --> 04:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
I have for the committee is there is
 
04:37:02.570 --> 04:37:02.580 align:start position:0%
that an option to do because we've heard
 
04:37:05.529 --> 04:37:05.539 align:start position:0%
I think the consensus is
 
04:37:07.970 --> 04:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
stabilization is old and the idea is to
 
04:37:09.470 --> 04:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
get rid of it at some point but is the
 
04:37:11.750 --> 04:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
intent to go all or nothing or is there
 
04:37:16.131 --> 04:37:16.141 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:18.470 --> 04:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
Mary yeah you've been playing this game
 
04:37:20.150 --> 04:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
the longest
 
04:37:22.849 --> 04:37:22.859 align:start position:0%
well it's such a drastic change if we
 
04:37:26.750 --> 04:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
could go maybe with like 15 percent
 
04:37:30.949 --> 04:37:30.959 align:start position:0%
and keep 15 and reduce the rest
 
04:37:30.959 --> 04:37:32.570 align:start position:0%
and keep 15 and reduce the rest
and

04:37:32.570 --> 04:37:32.580 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:37:34.789 --> 04:37:34.799 align:start position:0%
then the following year we'll reduce It
 
04:37:36.709 --> 04:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
Again by another five percent so it
 
04:37:40.010 --> 04:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
would really be gone in three years
 
04:37:43.429 --> 04:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
but just I just feel like by taking it
 
04:37:46.609 --> 04:37:46.619 align:start position:0%
all away immediately
 
04:37:49.369 --> 04:37:49.379 align:start position:0%
um makes it very difficult well Mickey's
 
04:37:51.529 --> 04:37:51.539 align:start position:0%
proposal was to take it out of 20 over
 
04:37:53.209 --> 04:37:53.219 align:start position:0%
20 years
 
04:37:54.830 --> 04:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
not representative Ladd said something
 
04:37:57.051 --> 04:37:57.061 align:start position:0%
about 15 a year
 
04:37:59.810 --> 04:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
so it was a seven year fall off right
 
04:37:59.820 --> 04:38:02.209 align:start position:0%
so it was a seven year fall off right
okay

04:38:02.209 --> 04:38:02.219 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:38:05.869 --> 04:38:05.879 align:start position:0%
well no I'm happy with 15 percent
 
04:38:12.529 --> 04:38:12.539 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:14.209 --> 04:38:14.219 align:start position:0%
when you say make it up like keep it in
 
04:38:16.310 --> 04:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
the formula how would I make it that's a
 
04:38:19.369 --> 04:38:19.379 align:start position:0%
reducer by 15 a year
 
04:38:21.410 --> 04:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
what does that do
 
04:38:29.230 --> 04:38:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:31.490 --> 04:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
we didn't have stabilization but we did
 
04:38:33.529 --> 04:38:33.539 align:start position:0%
have 27 million there in terms of hold
 
04:38:33.539 --> 04:38:34.609 align:start position:0%
have 27 million there in terms of hold
harmless

04:38:34.609 --> 04:38:34.619 align:start position:0%
harmless
 
04:38:36.109 --> 04:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
so if you were to get rid of your
 
04:38:37.551 --> 04:38:37.561 align:start position:0%
stabilization you're probably going to
 
04:38:38.990 --> 04:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
have to end up with some hold harmless
 
04:38:41.330 --> 04:38:41.340 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the way here
 
04:38:42.830 --> 04:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
um and you may be calling a different
 
04:38:45.650 --> 04:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
name well maybe still the same animal
 
04:38:48.170 --> 04:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
but it's a hold harmless is certainly
 
04:38:50.929 --> 04:38:50.939 align:start position:0%
curious a different connotation
 
04:38:53.990 --> 04:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
with all of us than than uh
 
04:38:56.570 --> 04:38:56.580 align:start position:0%
if we call it hold harmless
 
04:38:58.910 --> 04:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
and but it doesn't it doesn't
 
04:39:02.209 --> 04:39:02.219 align:start position:0%
cap itself like the governor's version
 
04:39:03.529 --> 04:39:03.539 align:start position:0%
well the governor's trying to get rid of
 
04:39:05.689 --> 04:39:05.699 align:start position:0%
stabilization I I understand that's a
 
04:39:07.369 --> 04:39:07.379 align:start position:0%
good move I'm just changing the name
 
04:39:09.949 --> 04:39:09.959 align:start position:0%
yeah okay because that's all he all he
 
04:39:11.330 --> 04:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
did was change the name but it changed
 
04:39:13.551 --> 04:39:13.561 align:start position:0%
the criteria the calculation criteria so
 
04:39:16.070 --> 04:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
two versions of hold Timeless whole time
 
04:39:18.529 --> 04:39:18.539 align:start position:0%
was born in whole time was too
 
04:39:20.810 --> 04:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
we really mean old harmless this time so
 
04:39:22.609 --> 04:39:22.619 align:start position:0%
what we did what we did was because we
 
04:39:25.490 --> 04:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
increased the base in the fnr it reduced
 
04:39:28.010 --> 04:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
the need for for some towns to have
 
04:39:31.910 --> 04:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
their stabilization right and so
 
04:39:34.010 --> 04:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
um it made it so that the whole harmless
 
04:39:36.830 --> 04:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
was 87 million rather than
 
04:39:36.840 --> 04:39:37.810 align:start position:0%
was 87 million rather than
um

04:39:37.810 --> 04:39:37.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:41.270 --> 04:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
156 million whatever it is now
 
04:39:43.970 --> 04:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
um so when you if you're looking to
 
04:39:45.948 --> 04:39:45.958 align:start position:0%
increase bass in F and R in the left
 
04:39:48.170 --> 04:39:48.180 align:start position:0%
side of the formula you're going to need
 
04:39:51.170 --> 04:39:51.180 align:start position:0%
less for stabilization hold harmless or
 
04:39:53.868 --> 04:39:53.878 align:start position:0%
stabilization whatever you're calling it
 
04:39:53.878 --> 04:39:55.070 align:start position:0%
stabilization whatever you're calling it
um so

04:39:55.070 --> 04:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:39:57.530 --> 04:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
that's that when you add stuff on one
 
04:39:59.208 --> 04:39:59.218 align:start position:0%
side it affects the other side so that's
 
04:40:01.970 --> 04:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
I'll that's all I'm saying on that
 
04:40:01.980 --> 04:40:02.930 align:start position:0%
I'll that's all I'm saying on that
um

04:40:02.930 --> 04:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:02.940 --> 04:40:04.910 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:40:04.910 --> 04:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:40:07.310 --> 04:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
regardless of what you call it I we call
 
04:40:14.150 --> 04:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:17.208 --> 04:40:17.218 align:start position:0%
um I guess would you have to consider
 
04:40:19.610 --> 04:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
who benefits by keeping it in there
 
04:40:22.010 --> 04:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
because that that's where your fight
 
04:40:24.288 --> 04:40:24.298 align:start position:0%
will be and and you'll do all this and
 
04:40:27.890 --> 04:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
you'll end up not getting any of it
 
04:40:27.900 --> 04:40:29.208 align:start position:0%
you'll end up not getting any of it
no

04:40:29.208 --> 04:40:29.218 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:40:31.250 --> 04:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
it's not what I was what I was trying to
 
04:40:32.750 --> 04:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
say was that
 
04:40:35.330 --> 04:40:35.340 align:start position:0%
you have to consider who benefits by
 
04:40:37.130 --> 04:40:37.140 align:start position:0%
keeping the formula in there
 
04:40:40.670 --> 04:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
because they'll be the ones that will
 
04:40:42.890 --> 04:40:42.900 align:start position:0%
stop you from doing what you're trying
 
04:40:45.590 --> 04:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:48.650 --> 04:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
I don't know I guess I made I guess I
 
04:40:50.270 --> 04:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
think you're saying that this requires
 
04:40:51.948 --> 04:40:51.958 align:start position:0%
some sophisticated messaging
 
04:40:54.350 --> 04:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
stabilization hold harmless is all is
 
04:40:56.650 --> 04:40:56.660 align:start position:0%
it's all political
 
04:40:59.630 --> 04:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
money it's it that has no cost there's
 
04:41:02.630 --> 04:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
no cost so this is I think I can answer
 
04:41:04.310 --> 04:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
your question so stabilization grants
 
04:41:06.650 --> 04:41:06.660 align:start position:0%
are based on Antiquated data it's 2006
 
04:41:10.490 --> 04:41:10.500 align:start position:0%
2006 data the that was funded in 2012.
 
04:41:10.500 --> 04:41:11.390 align:start position:0%
2006 data the that was funded in 2012.
right

04:41:11.390 --> 04:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:41:13.550 --> 04:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
we're eliminating that in the governor's
 
04:41:15.530 --> 04:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
proposal and we're providing a whole
 
04:41:18.470 --> 04:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
harmless of 87 million because we're
 
04:41:21.650 --> 04:41:21.660 align:start position:0%
also increasing base and fnr and when
 
04:41:25.010 --> 04:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
you do that some towns receive
 
04:41:28.670 --> 04:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
extra funding whereas it reduces the
 
04:41:30.350 --> 04:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
need for state for for a whole harmless
 
04:41:32.628 --> 04:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:41:34.788 --> 04:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
what we're fundamentally doing is we're
 
04:41:37.070 --> 04:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
correcting the formula going into the
 
04:41:39.230 --> 04:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
future where we're not using old data
 
04:41:41.750 --> 04:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
anymore we're we're and we're phasing
 
04:41:43.868 --> 04:41:43.878 align:start position:0%
out that hold harmless in favor of other
 
04:41:48.110 --> 04:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
targeted uh pieces of Aid and so you're
 
04:41:50.628 --> 04:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
no longer it solves the problem of no of
 
04:41:54.230 --> 04:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
using old Antiquated data I think that
 
04:41:56.990 --> 04:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
was that was the main driver behind that
 
04:41:58.970 --> 04:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:42:01.070 --> 04:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
if I could just add one important
 
04:42:01.080 --> 04:42:02.090 align:start position:0%
if I could just add one important
element

04:42:02.090 --> 04:42:02.100 align:start position:0%
element
 
04:42:03.890 --> 04:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
the reason why we still have a hold
 
04:42:06.050 --> 04:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
harmless is to make sure that nobody
 
04:42:07.850 --> 04:42:07.860 align:start position:0%
loses a dollar as a result of us
 
04:42:10.310 --> 04:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
eliminated stabilization people are just
 
04:42:13.610 --> 04:42:13.620 align:start position:0%
gonna wait until the new formula catches
 
04:42:15.350 --> 04:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
up with them and then they'll join the
 
04:42:17.750 --> 04:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
rest of the crowd in uh you know
 
04:42:19.850 --> 04:42:19.860 align:start position:0%
starting to increase but until that
 
04:42:21.350 --> 04:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
happens they will have to wait until
 
04:42:22.970 --> 04:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
everybody catches up with them but
 
04:42:24.470 --> 04:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
nobody loses a dollar because the major
 
04:42:27.170 --> 04:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
concern about removing stabilization is
 
04:42:28.970 --> 04:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
that towns have been budgeting based on
 
04:42:31.550 --> 04:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
it and if we make a major cut suddenly
 
04:42:33.530 --> 04:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
there will be a disruptive impact this
 
04:42:35.628 --> 04:42:35.638 align:start position:0%
ensures that we get rid of stabilization
 
04:42:38.690 --> 04:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
but there will never be that type of
 
04:42:40.550 --> 04:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
impact and that's really the best way in
 
04:42:42.050 --> 04:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
which we can do this it ain't perfect
 
04:42:44.690 --> 04:42:44.700 align:start position:0%
there is still an imbalance for a while
 
04:42:46.788 --> 04:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
until a formula catches up there is
 
04:42:48.410 --> 04:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
always the risk that somebody in the
 
04:42:50.090 --> 04:42:50.100 align:start position:0%
future may Tinker with it and make it
 
04:42:52.788 --> 04:42:52.798 align:start position:0%
worse but as of now I genuinely see this
 
04:42:55.010 --> 04:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
as the absolute best way in which we can
 
04:42:56.930 --> 04:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
tackle this problem that we all know
 
04:42:58.970 --> 04:42:58.980 align:start position:0%
needs to be solved so I would really
 
04:43:01.010 --> 04:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
want to leave that as it is because I
 
04:43:05.090 --> 04:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:07.970 --> 04:43:07.980 align:start position:0%
yes just a quick thank you Mr chair so
 
04:43:09.590 --> 04:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
question Adam
 
04:43:09.600 --> 04:43:10.368 align:start position:0%
question Adam
um

04:43:10.368 --> 04:43:10.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:12.530 --> 04:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
your formula
 
04:43:15.470 --> 04:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
takes 10 years correct to get to where
 
04:43:18.170 --> 04:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
we want to be and that's more equitable
 
04:43:21.110 --> 04:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
distribution of the formula across the
 
04:43:21.120 --> 04:43:22.490 align:start position:0%
distribution of the formula across the
state

04:43:22.490 --> 04:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:43:24.288 --> 04:43:24.298 align:start position:0%
that's what we want
 
04:43:26.330 --> 04:43:26.340 align:start position:0%
is there a way
 
04:43:26.340 --> 04:43:27.770 align:start position:0%
is there a way
to

04:43:27.770 --> 04:43:27.780 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:43:33.708 --> 04:43:33.718 align:start position:0%
collapse your formula into two years so
 
04:43:39.470 --> 04:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
we achieve your goal in less time
 
04:43:41.930 --> 04:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
I would I would add that
 
04:43:44.628 --> 04:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
what you when you do that
 
04:43:48.050 --> 04:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
um it may be a too quick of a very
 
04:43:49.368 --> 04:43:49.378 align:start position:0%
expensive it would be very expensive
 
04:43:51.288 --> 04:43:51.298 align:start position:0%
yeah and and it would reduce
 
04:43:54.050 --> 04:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
stabilization so or or hold harmless so
 
04:43:58.128 --> 04:43:58.138 align:start position:0%
quickly that some towns may lose a lot
 
04:44:01.128 --> 04:44:01.138 align:start position:0%
of funding very quickly
 
04:44:04.128 --> 04:44:04.138 align:start position:0%
um if that makes sense so I
 
04:44:07.208 --> 04:44:07.218 align:start position:0%
I think maybe reducing the 10 years
 
04:44:10.430 --> 04:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
maybe okay but I I don't I don't know
 
04:44:14.990 --> 04:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:15.000 --> 04:44:18.110 align:start position:0%
 
excited

04:44:18.110 --> 04:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:19.850 --> 04:44:19.860 align:start position:0%
there's there's almost an infinite
 
04:44:21.050 --> 04:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
amount of scenarios you can run in
 
04:44:22.550 --> 04:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
variables you can put into the formula
 
04:44:24.170 --> 04:44:24.180 align:start position:0%
but there's there's kind of two ways to
 
04:44:26.570 --> 04:44:26.580 align:start position:0%
get rid of the stabilization there's the
 
04:44:28.550 --> 04:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
um there's the governor's
 
04:44:31.070 --> 04:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
proposal which basically gets rid of all
 
04:44:33.890 --> 04:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
stabilization so 157 million dollars but
 
04:44:35.270 --> 04:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
replaces it with a new hold harmless
 
04:44:37.788 --> 04:44:37.798 align:start position:0%
Grant so he essentially got rid of
 
04:44:40.010 --> 04:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
half of nearly half of the stabilization
 
04:44:42.170 --> 04:44:42.180 align:start position:0%
but it's still there it's still there
 
04:44:43.970 --> 04:44:43.980 align:start position:0%
and it just lives as a new Grant a whole
 
04:44:46.430 --> 04:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
harmless Grant but to get rid of all the
 
04:44:48.590 --> 04:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
stabilization in a two-year period you
 
04:44:50.150 --> 04:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
can't do that without towns losing
 
04:44:51.590 --> 04:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money which
 
04:44:53.330 --> 04:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
creates budgeting problems and I don't
 
04:44:54.230 --> 04:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
think this committee is interested in
 
04:44:54.240 --> 04:44:55.310 align:start position:0%
think this committee is interested in
that

04:44:55.310 --> 04:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:44:56.750 --> 04:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
um the other way to get rid of
 
04:44:59.208 --> 04:44:59.218 align:start position:0%
stabilization is to hyper power charge
 
04:45:01.670 --> 04:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
the other eight components so the point
 
04:45:02.990 --> 04:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
where if you take stabilization away
 
04:45:05.090 --> 04:45:05.100 align:start position:0%
they don't lose money that is likely
 
04:45:07.730 --> 04:45:07.740 align:start position:0%
very expensive that would cost we're
 
04:45:09.530 --> 04:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
talking hundreds and hundreds of
 
04:45:11.270 --> 04:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars to to design a
 
04:45:13.070 --> 04:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
formula that would be so powerful that
 
04:45:14.090 --> 04:45:14.100 align:start position:0%
it would when you take away
 
04:45:16.490 --> 04:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
stabilization no one would notice that
 
04:45:18.650 --> 04:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
would be very expensive so we're back to
 
04:45:20.628 --> 04:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
this this balancing act that we've been
 
04:45:23.270 --> 04:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
trying to do here um all afternoon
 
04:45:24.590 --> 04:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
um so there's two ways to get rid of
 
04:45:25.730 --> 04:45:25.740 align:start position:0%
stabilization there's the governor's
 
04:45:27.770 --> 04:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
proposal get rid of stabilization and
 
04:45:29.090 --> 04:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
build the hold harmless and basically
 
04:45:30.470 --> 04:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like a stabilization
 
04:45:30.480 --> 04:45:32.208 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like a stabilization
renaming

04:45:32.208 --> 04:45:32.218 align:start position:0%
renaming
 
04:45:34.430 --> 04:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
um it's it's a different it functions
 
04:45:35.810 --> 04:45:35.820 align:start position:0%
different than the current stabilization
 
04:45:38.350 --> 04:45:38.360 align:start position:0%
and it's based on
 
04:45:40.730 --> 04:45:40.740 align:start position:0%
it's just reduced stabilization then
 
04:45:41.930 --> 04:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
there's the proposal one you saw
 
04:45:44.390 --> 04:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
presented today where its stabilization
 
04:45:46.490 --> 04:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
stays as is and it reduces five five
 
04:45:46.500 --> 04:45:47.628 align:start position:0%
stays as is and it reduces five five
percent

04:45:47.628 --> 04:45:47.638 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:45:49.190 --> 04:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
proposal one
 
04:45:50.810 --> 04:45:50.820 align:start position:0%
takes about a six seven million dollar
 
04:45:52.670 --> 04:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
cut out of stabilization the governor's
 
04:45:54.170 --> 04:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
proposal takes a more substantial cut
 
04:45:55.910 --> 04:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
out of stabilization
 
04:45:57.650 --> 04:45:57.660 align:start position:0%
um there's two ways to do it it's all
 
04:45:59.270 --> 04:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
about timing you're not going to do this
 
04:46:00.288 --> 04:46:00.298 align:start position:0%
and you're not going to get rid of state
 
04:46:01.670 --> 04:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
legislatures but that's
 
04:46:03.050 --> 04:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
kind of what you're dealing with right
 
04:46:03.060 --> 04:46:04.070 align:start position:0%
kind of what you're dealing with right
now

04:46:04.070 --> 04:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:46:06.230 --> 04:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
and I'll just uh I'll just remind the
 
04:46:09.650 --> 04:46:09.660 align:start position:0%
committee that I and you know we at one
 
04:46:12.230 --> 04:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
point it was a four percent decrease and
 
04:46:13.970 --> 04:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
then two years later it was it was put
 
04:46:16.070 --> 04:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
back at 100
 
04:46:17.810 --> 04:46:17.820 align:start position:0%
um that's similar to proposal one except
 
04:46:19.788 --> 04:46:19.798 align:start position:0%
it's a 20 it's the 25 years it's 20
 
04:46:19.798 --> 04:46:22.190 align:start position:0%
it's a 20 it's the 25 years it's 20
years

04:46:22.190 --> 04:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:22.200 --> 04:46:23.690 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:46:23.690 --> 04:46:23.700 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:46:26.330 --> 04:46:26.340 align:start position:0%
there is a huge difference between the
 
04:46:29.090 --> 04:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
current stabilization grants which are
 
04:46:31.010 --> 04:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
set to a dollar amount
 
04:46:34.368 --> 04:46:34.378 align:start position:0%
and what we are doing here where we are
 
04:46:37.128 --> 04:46:37.138 align:start position:0%
moving into the appropriate formula and
 
04:46:39.410 --> 04:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
while the formula catches up with people
 
04:46:42.170 --> 04:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
they by Design on a temporary basis
 
04:46:44.330 --> 04:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
which is self-limiting and decreasing
 
04:46:45.948 --> 04:46:45.958 align:start position:0%
itself every year
 
04:46:49.010 --> 04:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
makes it go away and by the way all that
 
04:46:50.628 --> 04:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
it takes for this to go away is for
 
04:46:53.150 --> 04:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
people not to Tinker there is no there
 
04:46:54.830 --> 04:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
is a huge difference between you know
 
04:46:56.868 --> 04:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
the two approaches if we try to maintain
 
04:46:59.090 --> 04:46:59.100 align:start position:0%
the stabilization Grant people will look
 
04:47:01.010 --> 04:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
at just that part of the budget and say
 
04:47:02.510 --> 04:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
oh my God this is the money I'm losing
 
04:47:03.948 --> 04:47:03.958 align:start position:0%
every year and they will not pay
 
04:47:05.510 --> 04:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
attention to the increases in the other
 
04:47:08.990 --> 04:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
side the governor's proposal makes that
 
04:47:11.868 --> 04:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
go away nobody loses money and there is
 
04:47:13.850 --> 04:47:13.860 align:start position:0%
no stabilization Grant to look at and
 
04:47:15.470 --> 04:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
say oh my God I'm losing money you just
 
04:47:17.150 --> 04:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
decrease the amounts in the hold
 
04:47:19.788 --> 04:47:19.798 align:start position:0%
harmless but not by losing money at any
 
04:47:21.410 --> 04:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
time there is a significant difference
 
04:47:23.810 --> 04:47:23.820 align:start position:0%
Mr chair if I could just follow up with
 
04:47:26.030 --> 04:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
that I think most of your comments are
 
04:47:29.690 --> 04:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
on point but your your conclusion that
 
04:47:31.670 --> 04:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
no one is hurt by taking stabilization
 
04:47:34.970 --> 04:47:34.980 align:start position:0%
away is wrong there are towns on paper
 
04:47:36.350 --> 04:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
that we can see that will hurt
 
04:47:37.730 --> 04:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
significantly by taking away
 
04:47:39.770 --> 04:47:39.780 align:start position:0%
stabilization and only having the hold
 
04:47:42.230 --> 04:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
harmless to support them there are towns
 
04:47:44.208 --> 04:47:44.218 align:start position:0%
that will significantly be hurt could
 
04:47:46.010 --> 04:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
you define hurt in this case because I'm
 
04:47:47.628 --> 04:47:47.638 align:start position:0%
annually I want to make sure I
 
04:47:49.128 --> 04:47:49.138 align:start position:0%
understand what you are saying because
 
04:47:51.708 --> 04:47:51.718 align:start position:0%
the way the her that I'm thinking of and
 
04:47:53.090 --> 04:47:53.100 align:start position:0%
I don't want to put words in your mouth
 
04:47:54.770 --> 04:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:47:58.368 --> 04:47:58.378 align:start position:0%
they would not get as much money as they
 
04:48:00.288 --> 04:48:00.298 align:start position:0%
would get if the same formula would be
 
04:48:01.490 --> 04:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
applied without removing the
 
04:48:03.770 --> 04:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
stabilization Grant is that what you are
 
04:48:05.628 --> 04:48:05.638 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
04:48:07.368 --> 04:48:07.378 align:start position:0%
if you just want to take a look at
 
04:48:09.590 --> 04:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
Berlin in the in the two spreadsheets
 
04:48:12.770 --> 04:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
you'll see they lose a lot of money
 
04:48:15.530 --> 04:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
under the governor's proposal as
 
04:48:18.890 --> 04:48:18.900 align:start position:0%
compared to the proposal number one the
 
04:48:21.890 --> 04:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
stabilization is the key component of
 
04:48:25.190 --> 04:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
propping up that loss so the hold
 
04:48:27.350 --> 04:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
harmless while I agree with you in
 
04:48:29.750 --> 04:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
intellectual functionality of getting
 
04:48:31.550 --> 04:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
rid of the Antiquated situation under
 
04:48:34.010 --> 04:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
the governor's proposal but it is not an
 
04:48:35.990 --> 04:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
equal replacement the hold harmless is
 
04:48:37.368 --> 04:48:37.378 align:start position:0%
not an equal replacement for these
 
04:48:40.490 --> 04:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:43.070 --> 04:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
I hear you
 
04:48:45.410 --> 04:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
I agree with what you are saying in the
 
04:48:47.570 --> 04:48:47.580 align:start position:0%
sense that those Towners will have a
 
04:48:51.170 --> 04:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
lesser increase or a flat you know
 
04:48:55.190 --> 04:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
hell you know State contribution
 
04:48:56.930 --> 04:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
but very bluntly there is no other way
 
04:48:59.090 --> 04:48:59.100 align:start position:0%
to get rid of the stabilization Grant
 
04:49:01.550 --> 04:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
rather than you know
 
04:49:03.530 --> 04:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
growing them a bit more slowly while
 
04:49:05.628 --> 04:49:05.638 align:start position:0%
everybody else grows faster so that they
 
04:49:07.190 --> 04:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
catch up I want to remind you that right
 
04:49:09.470 --> 04:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
now they're getting that money you know
 
04:49:11.750 --> 04:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
essentially unfair way because they are
 
04:49:13.970 --> 04:49:13.980 align:start position:0%
getting way more help than they would
 
04:49:16.490 --> 04:49:16.500 align:start position:0%
normally get if the data that we use was
 
04:49:18.470 --> 04:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
current and that's really the unfairness
 
04:49:20.570 --> 04:49:20.580 align:start position:0%
image that we are trying to address and
 
04:49:22.970 --> 04:49:22.980 align:start position:0%
I think it is important to address it in
 
04:49:24.890 --> 04:49:24.900 align:start position:0%
a way that does not lead to them losing
 
04:49:27.110 --> 04:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
money but I don't think you can have
 
04:49:29.270 --> 04:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
your you know cake and eat it too and
 
04:49:31.850 --> 04:49:31.860 align:start position:0%
get rid of it but not decrease those I
 
04:49:34.010 --> 04:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
mean you know I think this is the best
 
04:49:37.010 --> 04:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
way to address this but yes it there is
 
04:49:39.050 --> 04:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
they don't get the same increases that
 
04:49:40.490 --> 04:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
they would get if this stabilization
 
04:49:46.750 --> 04:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:49.910 --> 04:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
I know I know and I think Mickey's
 
04:49:52.310 --> 04:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
waiting for a decision uh I I would
 
04:49:55.970 --> 04:49:55.980 align:start position:0%
suggest 41 or 4200 base and uh go from
 
04:49:55.980 --> 04:49:57.890 align:start position:0%
suggest 41 or 4200 base and uh go from
there

04:49:57.890 --> 04:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:50:02.090 --> 04:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:05.270 --> 04:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
if I may make a suggestion to
 
04:50:08.510 --> 04:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
we can choose any any amount we want but
 
04:50:10.610 --> 04:50:10.620 align:start position:0%
if we ask Mickey for just one number
 
04:50:11.750 --> 04:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:50:13.010 --> 04:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:50:14.990 --> 04:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
we won't be able to tell how in a
 
04:50:16.550 --> 04:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
slightly different scenario we may have
 
04:50:18.350 --> 04:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
done better maybe maybe have a few
 
04:50:18.360 --> 04:50:21.788 align:start position:0%
done better maybe maybe have a few
values

04:50:21.788 --> 04:50:21.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:24.650 --> 04:50:24.660 align:start position:0%
it's not a big thing to get one or two I
 
04:50:27.170 --> 04:50:27.180 align:start position:0%
mean but you can see the shift right
 
04:50:28.550 --> 04:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
that's all you're looking for you're
 
04:50:30.050 --> 04:50:30.060 align:start position:0%
looking for the shift and give them some
 
04:50:31.730 --> 04:50:31.740 align:start position:0%
direction because right now we're
 
04:50:34.850 --> 04:50:34.860 align:start position:0%
spinning the wheels yeah I think and go
 
04:50:38.150 --> 04:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
to what we need to do our work
 
04:50:41.030 --> 04:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
um for Mickey and maybe our minds will
 
04:50:43.490 --> 04:50:43.500 align:start position:0%
have a little chance to think a little
 
04:50:45.530 --> 04:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
bit more and then
 
04:50:47.750 --> 04:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
we'll also know if what kinds of money
 
04:50:51.288 --> 04:50:51.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:55.628 --> 04:50:55.638 align:start position:0%
like a recess break or just a break okay
 
04:50:59.150 --> 04:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
so so so for for me to I think come back
 
04:51:01.310 --> 04:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
with the to the committee with you know
 
04:51:04.430 --> 04:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
maybe it's five options or something I
 
04:51:05.628 --> 04:51:05.638 align:start position:0%
think a couple locking down a couple
 
04:51:07.490 --> 04:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
variables is important and get back to
 
04:51:10.190 --> 04:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
that education trust fund we are winding
 
04:51:12.170 --> 04:51:12.180 align:start position:0%
down our budget process here so not even
 
04:51:13.850 --> 04:51:13.860 align:start position:0%
talking at funding anymore we have to
 
04:51:16.490 --> 04:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
lock down our decisions on the budget so
 
04:51:18.650 --> 04:51:18.660 align:start position:0%
there's still a couple of variables with
 
04:51:20.990 --> 04:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund one being Ed
 
04:51:22.368 --> 04:51:22.378 align:start position:0%
funding we talked about the other being
 
04:51:23.930 --> 04:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
School building Aid we heard a lot about
 
04:51:25.910 --> 04:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
that this morning there are a lot of
 
04:51:27.470 --> 04:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
other the governor's budget does propose
 
04:51:30.350 --> 04:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
a few new odds got quiet in here a few
 
04:51:32.930 --> 04:51:32.940 align:start position:0%
other uh programs onto the education
 
04:51:34.970 --> 04:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
trust fund and we've more or less
 
04:51:36.530 --> 04:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
approved those
 
04:51:38.090 --> 04:51:38.100 align:start position:0%
um by not we don't have any amendments
 
04:51:40.190 --> 04:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
to do anything else to them so I don't
 
04:51:43.070 --> 04:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
know if it makes sense Mr chair to
 
04:51:45.590 --> 04:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
decide or at least discuss
 
04:51:47.570 --> 04:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
what is the committee's intent how much
 
04:51:49.010 --> 04:51:49.020 align:start position:0%
of a balance do you want to leave in the
 
04:51:50.690 --> 04:51:50.700 align:start position:0%
education trust fund at the end of the
 
04:51:53.090 --> 04:51:53.100 align:start position:0%
biennium and how much of it how much do
 
04:51:54.530 --> 04:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
you want to spend and if so and which
 
04:51:56.868 --> 04:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
programs because then if I knew for
 
04:51:58.250 --> 04:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
instance looking at adequate education
 
04:51:59.930 --> 04:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
Aid on line 22
 
04:52:02.208 --> 04:52:02.218 align:start position:0%
if you are okay with increasing those 20
 
04:52:04.010 --> 04:52:04.020 align:start position:0%
million a year for instance which would
 
04:52:05.990 --> 04:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
reduce 40 million from your bottom line
 
04:52:08.750 --> 04:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
then I can take that back and try to
 
04:52:10.550 --> 04:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
come up with options that fit within
 
04:52:12.830 --> 04:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
that budget number so that's I think
 
04:52:14.448 --> 04:52:14.458 align:start position:0%
we're getting close to needing to settle
 
04:52:15.890 --> 04:52:15.900 align:start position:0%
in on how much you want to spend in
 
04:52:18.230 --> 04:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
total on Ed funding and then backing
 
04:52:21.948 --> 04:52:21.958 align:start position:0%
into the formula
 
04:52:25.850 --> 04:52:25.860 align:start position:0%
well my idea was 36 36 million but 40 is
 
04:52:27.288 --> 04:52:27.298 align:start position:0%
just good
 
04:52:30.590 --> 04:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
and can I suggest of you know about
 
04:52:32.390 --> 04:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
backing in the other way education
 
04:52:34.070 --> 04:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
funding is probably the most significant
 
04:52:35.990 --> 04:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
thing that we're going to be doing and
 
04:52:38.150 --> 04:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
to put that first and adding that money
 
04:52:40.010 --> 04:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
into that and then if we need to back
 
04:52:41.690 --> 04:52:41.700 align:start position:0%
out some other things we have approved
 
04:52:43.730 --> 04:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
tentatively some other programs and
 
04:52:45.890 --> 04:52:45.900 align:start position:0%
maybe you're saying in light of our
 
04:52:47.868 --> 04:52:47.878 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the students of the
 
04:52:49.850 --> 04:52:49.860 align:start position:0%
state we don't do this because we want
 
04:52:52.490 --> 04:52:52.500 align:start position:0%
that money to go back in there and we
 
04:52:55.128 --> 04:52:55.138 align:start position:0%
reduce the about or we don't reduce the
 
04:52:56.628 --> 04:52:56.638 align:start position:0%
balance quite as much because it says
 
04:52:57.770 --> 04:52:57.780 align:start position:0%
well we're not going to do this for 2
 
04:52:59.570 --> 04:52:59.580 align:start position:0%
million would rather the 2 million go
 
04:53:01.250 --> 04:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
into education funding as opposed to
 
04:53:02.448 --> 04:53:02.458 align:start position:0%
this other program because we have
 
04:53:05.030 --> 04:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
approved a few of the things which in
 
04:53:06.650 --> 04:53:06.660 align:start position:0%
light of what I think is our primary
 
04:53:08.448 --> 04:53:08.458 align:start position:0%
responsibility we might want to revisit
 
04:53:10.610 --> 04:53:10.620 align:start position:0%
so I think you know I would be glad to
 
04:53:13.128 --> 04:53:13.138 align:start position:0%
go to ask him to add the 36 or out of 40
 
04:53:15.770 --> 04:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
million I'm good with that and I would
 
04:53:18.170 --> 04:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
want to go I'd go backwards looking at
 
04:53:20.628 --> 04:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
programs that we've already maybe sort
 
04:53:22.250 --> 04:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
of approved and reconsidering that
 
04:53:24.110 --> 04:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
because the education funding is our
 
04:53:27.310 --> 04:53:27.320 align:start position:0%
most important job I think
 
04:53:30.650 --> 04:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
now having said that
 
04:53:33.590 --> 04:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
is related to
 
04:53:36.730 --> 04:53:36.740 align:start position:0%
play with stabilization as opposed to
 
04:53:39.850 --> 04:53:39.860 align:start position:0%
make whole
 
04:53:42.410 --> 04:53:42.420 align:start position:0%
certainly so and this gets back to what
 
04:53:44.390 --> 04:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
I was was saying before is would this
 
04:53:45.830 --> 04:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
committee have an appetite to support
 
04:53:47.510 --> 04:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
and funding plan that perhaps reduce
 
04:53:50.030 --> 04:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
stabilization by 15 instead of five
 
04:53:53.570 --> 04:53:53.580 align:start position:0%
versus five or a hundred percent yes so
 
04:53:55.070 --> 04:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
if that's the case then I can that's
 
04:53:56.708 --> 04:53:56.718 align:start position:0%
something I can work with and come back
 
04:53:59.690 --> 04:53:59.700 align:start position:0%
with some sort of blending and we've
 
04:54:01.490 --> 04:54:01.500 align:start position:0%
talked about this between the governor's
 
04:54:03.590 --> 04:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
budget and that other proposal we walked
 
04:54:04.510 --> 04:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
through today
 
04:54:06.830 --> 04:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
can I follow up around that and maybe
 
04:54:08.090 --> 04:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
you know someone can help me here
 
04:54:09.708 --> 04:54:09.718 align:start position:0%
because it
 
04:54:09.718 --> 04:54:10.550 align:start position:0%
because it
um

04:54:10.550 --> 04:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:13.430 --> 04:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
it's almost a version of semantics that
 
04:54:15.170 --> 04:54:15.180 align:start position:0%
instead of it being stabilization we're
 
04:54:17.270 --> 04:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
going to call it hold harmless but
 
04:54:19.310 --> 04:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
there's still an and the goal seems to
 
04:54:22.250 --> 04:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
be the same is so can someone tell me
 
04:54:24.110 --> 04:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
what's not that it's just a semantic
 
04:54:25.610 --> 04:54:25.620 align:start position:0%
change we're just basically a sort of a
 
04:54:28.788 --> 04:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
shell game or I think to Mickey's point
 
04:54:31.670 --> 04:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
is there a way of achieving the end that
 
04:54:34.128 --> 04:54:34.138 align:start position:0%
we want because yes the data was bad we
 
04:54:35.810 --> 04:54:35.820 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be doing this anymore but
 
04:54:37.610 --> 04:54:37.620 align:start position:0%
people will kind of freak out and says
 
04:54:39.530 --> 04:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
oh my God stabilization is gone is there
 
04:54:41.930 --> 04:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
a way of re-messaging it
 
04:54:43.368 --> 04:54:43.378 align:start position:0%
um I think we all have the same goal but
 
04:54:44.990 --> 04:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about how this sounds to
 
04:54:46.430 --> 04:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
people going out you know the the
 
04:54:48.770 --> 04:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
knee-jerk reaction is how can you take
 
04:54:50.270 --> 04:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
away stabilization and it's like wait
 
04:54:52.010 --> 04:54:52.020 align:start position:0%
wait no you're going to be held home
 
04:54:55.490 --> 04:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
harmless instead and it's almost it's
 
04:54:55.500 --> 04:54:59.470 align:start position:0%
harmless instead and it's almost it's
it's

04:54:59.470 --> 04:54:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:02.628 --> 04:55:02.638 align:start position:0%
yeah so I we need a way of messaging
 
04:55:05.150 --> 04:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
this so people understand what the goal
 
04:55:08.990 --> 04:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
is and why stabilization is problematic
 
04:55:11.990 --> 04:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
well I can I think stabilization is
 
04:55:16.610 --> 04:55:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:16.620 --> 04:55:20.208 align:start position:0%
 
oh

04:55:20.208 --> 04:55:20.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:21.420 --> 04:55:21.430 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
04:55:21.430 --> 04:55:27.050 align:start position:0%
I mean
[Music]

04:55:27.050 --> 04:55:27.060 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:55:27.060 --> 04:55:33.250 align:start position:0%
[Music]
yes

04:55:33.250 --> 04:55:33.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:36.590 --> 04:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
156 million bucks came out of that
 
04:55:40.128 --> 04:55:40.138 align:start position:0%
formula that was developed by The Joint
 
04:55:42.708 --> 04:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
uh legislative committee for costing of
 
04:55:44.570 --> 04:55:44.580 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for an education that was
 
04:55:46.330 --> 04:55:46.340 align:start position:0%
Senator S Brooks deal
 
04:55:49.970 --> 04:55:49.980 align:start position:0%
and we had a formula That Base adequacy
 
04:55:53.930 --> 04:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
was what 3456 I believe it was uh and
 
04:55:56.470 --> 04:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
then we also had a category called
 
04:55:59.330 --> 04:55:59.340 align:start position:0%
differentiated age special education and
 
04:56:01.810 --> 04:56:01.820 align:start position:0%
it was based upon percentages of kids
 
04:56:05.330 --> 04:56:05.340 align:start position:0%
arrive at that had that qualified within
 
04:56:07.190 --> 04:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
that municipality
 
04:56:09.708 --> 04:56:09.718 align:start position:0%
and there were some really heavy weights
 
04:56:11.448 --> 04:56:11.458 align:start position:0%
there for example the district you come
 
04:56:13.490 --> 04:56:13.500 align:start position:0%
from Mary received significant because
 
04:56:16.128 --> 04:56:16.138 align:start position:0%
you're well over the 48 percent mark
 
04:56:20.330 --> 04:56:20.340 align:start position:0%
then another 100 100 million dollars was
 
04:56:23.930 --> 04:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
taken from the fiscal capacity disparity
 
04:56:25.970 --> 04:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
Aid that we once had in that formula
 
04:56:27.890 --> 04:56:27.900 align:start position:0%
that's what we came up with this 150
 
04:56:30.288 --> 04:56:30.298 align:start position:0%
million bucks now if you track back and
 
04:56:32.208 --> 04:56:32.218 align:start position:0%
say where'd it come from and now you're
 
04:56:33.948 --> 04:56:33.958 align:start position:0%
raising the base by this much you must
 
04:56:36.890 --> 04:56:36.900 align:start position:0%
be able to get some kind of a ratio for
 
04:56:39.170 --> 04:56:39.180 align:start position:0%
these categories to try to fit back in
 
04:56:41.570 --> 04:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
some of these on the grant side and on
 
04:56:43.430 --> 04:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
the left-hand side which is very
 
04:56:46.128 --> 04:56:46.138 align:start position:0%
important now due to the court cases so
 
04:56:49.788 --> 04:56:49.798 align:start position:0%
that's the historical background on it
 
04:56:51.610 --> 04:56:51.620 align:start position:0%
I think the way the message is
 
04:56:54.288 --> 04:56:54.298 align:start position:0%
stabilizations based on old data it's
 
04:56:58.910 --> 04:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
Antiquated and the the hold harmless is
 
04:57:01.250 --> 04:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
different because it's it's a lower
 
04:57:03.830 --> 04:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
Grant amount only in that you are
 
04:57:07.250 --> 04:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
increasing base and fnra to make up for
 
04:57:09.470 --> 04:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
the difference and the whole harmless
 
04:57:12.708 --> 04:57:12.718 align:start position:0%
phases out over time and so I think that
 
04:57:15.350 --> 04:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
is the fundamental difference is once
 
04:57:17.448 --> 04:57:17.458 align:start position:0%
based on old data one is fundamentally
 
04:57:19.190 --> 04:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
looking into the future to try to
 
04:57:20.990 --> 04:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
correct the formula and that's what
 
04:57:28.070 --> 04:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:34.490 --> 04:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:36.948 --> 04:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
which part specifically there was a few
 
04:57:38.628 --> 04:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
things said there I mean it sounds to me
 
04:57:40.250 --> 04:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
like you're still going to have to we'll
 
04:57:42.128 --> 04:57:42.138 align:start position:0%
call it hold harmless
 
04:57:44.330 --> 04:57:44.340 align:start position:0%
instead of stabilization but they're
 
04:57:46.190 --> 04:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
still going to have to be some some
 
04:57:46.200 --> 04:57:48.170 align:start position:0%
still going to have to be some some
funding

04:57:48.170 --> 04:57:48.180 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:57:51.070 --> 04:57:51.080 align:start position:0%
15 percent
 
04:57:54.288 --> 04:57:54.298 align:start position:0%
well if you go up to 4 200 stabilization
 
04:57:56.270 --> 04:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
will go down correct right not by much
 
04:57:58.850 --> 04:57:58.860 align:start position:0%
but yeah well I mean but so this is the
 
04:58:00.050 --> 04:58:00.060 align:start position:0%
difference that
 
04:58:02.868 --> 04:58:02.878 align:start position:0%
stabilization we've known for years and
 
04:58:04.670 --> 04:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
hold harmless as presented in House Bill
 
04:58:07.970 --> 04:58:07.980 align:start position:0%
2 are two different things it over time
 
04:58:10.010 --> 04:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
they they're two different things at the
 
04:58:12.050 --> 04:58:12.060 align:start position:0%
at the time now it's exactly the same as
 
04:58:15.470 --> 04:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
what stabilization was back in 2012. but
 
04:58:17.628 --> 04:58:17.638 align:start position:0%
comparing them today is is tough to do
 
04:58:19.550 --> 04:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
if you eliminate stabilization replace
 
04:58:21.590 --> 04:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
withhold harmless
 
04:58:24.050 --> 04:58:24.060 align:start position:0%
the additional Aid that you give to the
 
04:58:25.368 --> 04:58:25.378 align:start position:0%
property poor town some of the
 
04:58:27.708 --> 04:58:27.718 align:start position:0%
thoroughlands claremonts pittsfields it
 
04:58:29.510 --> 04:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
the hold harmless brings them up to
 
04:58:31.128 --> 04:58:31.138 align:start position:0%
current law
 
04:58:33.530 --> 04:58:33.540 align:start position:0%
if you keep stabilization as we know it
 
04:58:35.810 --> 04:58:35.820 align:start position:0%
in place then layer on some of this
 
04:58:37.490 --> 04:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
additional stuff you give those towns
 
04:58:39.590 --> 04:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
more money than current law and that's
 
04:58:42.110 --> 04:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
the difference so it's it's a matter of
 
04:58:44.510 --> 04:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
is it the policy of this committee to
 
04:58:47.090 --> 04:58:47.100 align:start position:0%
give to Target additional Aid to certain
 
04:58:49.010 --> 04:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
towns we and we've described them as
 
04:58:51.650 --> 04:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
needy towns above what they would get if
 
04:58:53.750 --> 04:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
you did nothing or do you want to change
 
04:58:56.030 --> 04:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
the formula for this biennium bring them
 
04:58:57.288 --> 04:58:57.298 align:start position:0%
up to what they would have received
 
04:58:59.448 --> 04:58:59.458 align:start position:0%
under current law with the understanding
 
04:59:01.128 --> 04:59:01.138 align:start position:0%
that this law is presented in the
 
04:59:02.750 --> 04:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget would
 
04:59:04.610 --> 04:59:04.620 align:start position:0%
change over 10 years and it would start
 
04:59:05.868 --> 04:59:05.878 align:start position:0%
to reduce the whole harmless and
 
04:59:09.050 --> 04:59:09.060 align:start position:0%
increase a targeted age so those are the
 
04:59:10.730 --> 04:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
that's essentially what's before the
 
04:59:12.650 --> 04:59:12.660 align:start position:0%
committee to decide and that's where
 
04:59:15.170 --> 04:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
it's really hard to tweak the formula to
 
04:59:16.490 --> 04:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
do everything that we've talked about
 
04:59:19.730 --> 04:59:19.740 align:start position:0%
that I think folks want to do in one in
 
04:59:22.430 --> 04:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
one swoop so if we if we take voice
 
04:59:25.010 --> 04:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
stabilization then all the other
 
04:59:27.530 --> 04:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
grants that we've given
 
04:59:29.090 --> 04:59:29.100 align:start position:0%
they're only going to go up to current
 
04:59:31.970 --> 04:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
law but if we keep stabilization they'll
 
04:59:33.770 --> 04:59:33.780 align:start position:0%
get more than the current law
 
04:59:35.810 --> 04:59:35.820 align:start position:0%
essentially what we thought we were
 
04:59:37.070 --> 04:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
doing good
 
04:59:39.110 --> 04:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
is negative and it depends it depends on
 
04:59:40.490 --> 04:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
everyone has a different definition of
 
04:59:42.708 --> 04:59:42.718 align:start position:0%
good right it's different policies so
 
04:59:44.750 --> 04:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
some folks say that stabilization
 
04:59:47.208 --> 04:59:47.218 align:start position:0%
existing is problematic because it's so
 
04:59:48.708 --> 04:59:48.718 align:start position:0%
such old data and it shouldn't be in
 
04:59:50.628 --> 04:59:50.638 align:start position:0%
there but once it's taken out now you
 
04:59:52.430 --> 04:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
have to recognize that that hold
 
04:59:54.110 --> 04:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
harmless just represents your new
 
04:59:56.090 --> 04:59:56.100 align:start position:0%
calculated Grant plus a whole harmless
 
04:59:57.288 --> 04:59:57.298 align:start position:0%
to bring them up to as if you did
 
04:59:59.030 --> 04:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
nothing for this biennium I'm not
 
05:00:00.830 --> 05:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
speaking to the O years just for this
 
05:00:03.050 --> 05:00:03.060 align:start position:0%
budget if I may
 
05:00:05.390 --> 05:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
describe this in a different way maybe
 
05:00:07.970 --> 05:00:07.980 align:start position:0%
that would help
 
05:00:10.910 --> 05:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
we have an old formula and stabilization
 
05:00:13.730 --> 05:00:13.740 align:start position:0%
right now we have a new formula which
 
05:00:16.128 --> 05:00:16.138 align:start position:0%
gives everybody more money
 
05:00:18.708 --> 05:00:18.718 align:start position:0%
but between the old formula and
 
05:00:20.750 --> 05:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
stabilization some towns were getting
 
05:00:23.270 --> 05:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
even more than the new formula and
 
05:00:25.250 --> 05:00:25.260 align:start position:0%
that's where the whole harmless comes in
 
05:00:28.610 --> 05:00:28.620 align:start position:0%
right so nobody's losing the people who
 
05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
were way over are still right there
 
05:00:35.090 --> 05:00:35.100 align:start position:0%
and as over time we'll
 
05:00:37.550 --> 05:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
this hold harmless will go away because
 
05:00:39.590 --> 05:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
the formula will increase and keep
 
05:00:41.510 --> 05:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
increasing until everybody is all caught
 
05:00:44.448 --> 05:00:44.458 align:start position:0%
up we are never gonna give a town that
 
05:00:47.090 --> 05:00:47.100 align:start position:0%
currently has stabilization less than
 
05:00:48.530 --> 05:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
they would have gotten under this
 
05:00:51.708 --> 05:00:51.718 align:start position:0%
formula we are giving them more until
 
05:00:54.170 --> 05:00:54.180 align:start position:0%
they catch up with everybody
 
05:00:55.910 --> 05:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
right we're giving them more through the
 
05:00:57.410 --> 05:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
whole tournaments until the formula
 
05:01:01.670 --> 05:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
catches up no that's not right no that's
 
05:01:04.070 --> 05:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
the way it please correct me so that
 
05:01:07.190 --> 05:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
that is true under 24 25 in a sense that
 
05:01:08.930 --> 05:01:08.940 align:start position:0%
the hold harmless stays static it's not
 
05:01:11.570 --> 05:01:11.580 align:start position:0%
static it stays in effect for 24 and 25
 
05:01:14.750 --> 05:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
so basically Berlin Claremont right
 
05:01:16.368 --> 05:01:16.378 align:start position:0%
those towns those big stabilization
 
05:01:16.378 --> 05:01:17.390 align:start position:0%
those towns those big stabilization
towns

05:01:17.390 --> 05:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
towns
 
05:01:19.910 --> 05:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
um Farmington they can't lose more than
 
05:01:21.350 --> 05:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
current law because the hold harmless
 
05:01:23.570 --> 05:01:23.580 align:start position:0%
holds them to current law under hb2 as
 
05:01:24.830 --> 05:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
proposed by the governor there is a
 
05:01:26.570 --> 05:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
phase out of the hold harmless oh right
 
05:01:29.330 --> 05:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
so that is where that is that is where
 
05:01:30.890 --> 05:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
though that is where you would lose more
 
05:01:32.390 --> 05:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
money under current law is when the
 
05:01:35.570 --> 05:01:35.580 align:start position:0%
whole harmless goes away but for 24-25
 
05:01:38.030 --> 05:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
um I was describing 24 25 I appreciate
 
05:01:39.590 --> 05:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
now I better understand what we were
 
05:01:43.740 --> 05:01:43.750 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:43.750 --> 05:01:46.730 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:01:46.730 --> 05:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:01:51.288 --> 05:01:51.298 align:start position:0%
considered problematic so I think if we
 
05:01:53.570 --> 05:01:53.580 align:start position:0%
are going to do our job correctly
 
05:01:55.190 --> 05:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
um and right if we're gonna do right for
 
05:01:57.050 --> 05:01:57.060 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire that we have
 
05:01:59.090 --> 05:01:59.100 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge that current litigation
 
05:02:01.310 --> 05:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
is happening because current law levels
 
05:02:04.788 --> 05:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
are not at meeting the need and there's
 
05:02:08.208 --> 05:02:08.218 align:start position:0%
real sufficient constitutional issues
 
05:02:11.448 --> 05:02:11.458 align:start position:0%
so knowing that if this phase out were
 
05:02:14.930 --> 05:02:14.940 align:start position:0%
to go into place we would be in this not
 
05:02:16.610 --> 05:02:16.620 align:start position:0%
only the same position that we are in
 
05:02:19.550 --> 05:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
now but in a worse position for some of
 
05:02:22.310 --> 05:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
those towns and I think our job is to
 
05:02:24.350 --> 05:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
put us in a better position for some of
 
05:02:26.510 --> 05:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
those districts you know to to
 
05:02:28.490 --> 05:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
reallocate in such a way that we are
 
05:02:31.850 --> 05:02:31.860 align:start position:0%
less in less risk of you know finding a
 
05:02:34.010 --> 05:02:34.020 align:start position:0%
court saying we did it wrong again so
 
05:02:36.708 --> 05:02:36.718 align:start position:0%
this is our chance we have you know this
 
05:02:40.128 --> 05:02:40.138 align:start position:0%
this balance in in the in the education
 
05:02:43.070 --> 05:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
trust fund we can reallocate a little
 
05:02:45.650 --> 05:02:45.660 align:start position:0%
bit of that money in such a way that
 
05:02:47.868 --> 05:02:47.878 align:start position:0%
will put us in a better position to fend
 
05:02:50.270 --> 05:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
off those charges and I you know this is
 
05:02:52.310 --> 05:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
the time we have this money
 
05:02:54.288 --> 05:02:54.298 align:start position:0%
we are talking about tweaking the
 
05:02:55.730 --> 05:02:55.740 align:start position:0%
formula in such a way that it can help
 
05:02:58.788 --> 05:02:58.798 align:start position:0%
these towns and and still increase the
 
05:03:00.350 --> 05:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
base that some of the other towns are
 
05:03:02.810 --> 05:03:02.820 align:start position:0%
also benefiting so I think you know this
 
05:03:04.490 --> 05:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
is the moment let's seize it I think we
 
05:03:07.190 --> 05:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
can solve a major problem here it's
 
05:03:09.110 --> 05:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
gonna take some tweaking like Mickey
 
05:03:11.510 --> 05:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
said but this is the opportunity I think
 
05:03:15.530 --> 05:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:19.310 --> 05:03:19.320 align:start position:0%
if I if I may ask were you the changes
 
05:03:20.690 --> 05:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
that you are suggesting are you talking
 
05:03:22.670 --> 05:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
about the moving of funds from the left
 
05:03:25.128 --> 05:03:25.138 align:start position:0%
to the right side or what are the
 
05:03:26.750 --> 05:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
changes that we were talking about you
 
05:03:28.550 --> 05:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
were suggesting so you know we're
 
05:03:29.628 --> 05:03:29.638 align:start position:0%
talking about the left side of the
 
05:03:31.910 --> 05:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
equation for at least the adequate you
 
05:03:34.610 --> 05:03:34.620 align:start position:0%
know at least increasing the base but
 
05:03:36.110 --> 05:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
when we're also talking about the right
 
05:03:37.610 --> 05:03:37.620 align:start position:0%
side I think we have to acknowledge if
 
05:03:38.628 --> 05:03:38.638 align:start position:0%
you completely get rid of the
 
05:03:40.850 --> 05:03:40.860 align:start position:0%
stabilization and only go with the whole
 
05:03:42.470 --> 05:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
harmless phase out
 
05:03:44.510 --> 05:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
we're not in a better position for these
 
05:03:47.510 --> 05:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
property needy tones so we need to
 
05:03:50.030 --> 05:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
consider heavy more heavily weighing the
 
05:03:51.770 --> 05:03:51.780 align:start position:0%
right side of the equation even if we
 
05:03:57.770 --> 05:03:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:57.780 --> 05:03:59.448 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:03:59.448 --> 05:03:59.458 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:04:00.948 --> 05:04:00.958 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to understand
 
05:04:02.868 --> 05:04:02.878 align:start position:0%
that under both these proposals there
 
05:04:04.190 --> 05:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
are going to be some towns that I think
 
05:04:06.288 --> 05:04:06.298 align:start position:0%
lose I lose money
 
05:04:08.990 --> 05:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
um over over the life of the the plan
 
05:04:12.830 --> 05:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
whether it's uh you know proposal one
 
05:04:14.448 --> 05:04:14.458 align:start position:0%
there are going to be some towns that
 
05:04:17.208 --> 05:04:17.218 align:start position:0%
lose money over the 20 years and under
 
05:04:19.788 --> 05:04:19.798 align:start position:0%
um you know the other one it is it's
 
05:04:21.708 --> 05:04:21.718 align:start position:0%
over 10 years
 
05:04:21.718 --> 05:04:22.430 align:start position:0%
over 10 years
um

05:04:22.430 --> 05:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:27.770 --> 05:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:30.288 --> 05:04:30.298 align:start position:0%
that's possible I I haven't run the
 
05:04:32.868 --> 05:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
proposal one for 10 years
 
05:04:34.190 --> 05:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
the only thing I'll say is the
 
05:04:36.410 --> 05:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
components in the that proposal the
 
05:04:37.788 --> 05:04:37.798 align:start position:0%
thresholds and the grand amounts have
 
05:04:39.770 --> 05:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
the CPI the two percent applied to those
 
05:04:39.780 --> 05:04:40.670 align:start position:0%
the CPI the two percent applied to those
so

05:04:40.670 --> 05:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:04:42.650 --> 05:04:42.660 align:start position:0%
in theory they could keep up with the
 
05:04:45.770 --> 05:04:45.780 align:start position:0%
pace of stabilization but uh I don't
 
05:04:47.090 --> 05:04:47.100 align:start position:0%
know if that's for sure I haven't run
 
05:04:49.368 --> 05:04:49.378 align:start position:0%
that that's true
 
05:04:51.650 --> 05:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mickey did you say that
 
05:04:54.010 --> 05:04:54.020 align:start position:0%
if we do away with the stabilization
 
05:04:57.230 --> 05:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
that uh what we our proposal hybrid
 
05:04:57.240 --> 05:04:58.670 align:start position:0%
that uh what we our proposal hybrid
system

05:04:58.670 --> 05:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:04:58.680 --> 05:04:59.990 align:start position:0%
system
um

05:04:59.990 --> 05:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:02.150 --> 05:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be any increase on the
 
05:05:04.670 --> 05:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
right hand side to the needier schools
 
05:05:06.708 --> 05:05:06.718 align:start position:0%
or did I misunderstand that I thought
 
05:05:09.050 --> 05:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
that we were trying to add money to the
 
05:05:11.030 --> 05:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
right hand side but then I think you
 
05:05:13.310 --> 05:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
said something we can do that you know
 
05:05:15.230 --> 05:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
um that we couldn't do that by getting
 
05:05:17.810 --> 05:05:17.820 align:start position:0%
rid of home um stabilization entirely or
 
05:05:19.490 --> 05:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
can can you just go back over 100
 
05:05:21.770 --> 05:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
reduction of stabilization I don't think
 
05:05:23.628 --> 05:05:23.638 align:start position:0%
you can come up with a target a day that
 
05:05:26.690 --> 05:05:26.700 align:start position:0%
would not require a hold harmless so it
 
05:05:28.070 --> 05:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make any impact on the right
 
05:05:29.390 --> 05:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
hand side which is it would make an
 
05:05:31.070 --> 05:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
impact just not to 100 of the
 
05:05:32.990 --> 05:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
communities for sure I I mean correct me
 
05:05:34.670 --> 05:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong I don't feel like not with
 
05:05:35.868 --> 05:05:35.878 align:start position:0%
it would it go to the needier
 
05:05:35.878 --> 05:05:37.430 align:start position:0%
it would it go to the needier
communities

05:05:37.430 --> 05:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
communities
 
05:05:39.830 --> 05:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
not probably to the extent that they'd
 
05:05:42.050 --> 05:05:42.060 align:start position:0%
lose stabilization I think the loss of
 
05:05:43.550 --> 05:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
stabilization would offset the targeted
 
05:05:43.560 --> 05:05:44.868 align:start position:0%
stabilization would offset the targeted
eight

05:05:44.868 --> 05:05:44.878 align:start position:0%
eight
 
05:05:46.670 --> 05:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
unless you spent a ton of money yeah
 
05:05:48.050 --> 05:05:48.060 align:start position:0%
there's some there are some communities
 
05:05:49.670 --> 05:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
that have such a large stabilization
 
05:05:51.110 --> 05:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
grant that there's very it's very
 
05:05:52.610 --> 05:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
difficult unless you're willing to spend
 
05:05:54.410 --> 05:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
a lot of money
 
05:05:57.288 --> 05:05:57.298 align:start position:0%
um to Eclipse that stabilization and so
 
05:05:59.530 --> 05:05:59.540 align:start position:0%
there's there's there's almost
 
05:06:03.110 --> 05:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh I think HP 701 which was the 2019
 
05:06:06.948 --> 05:06:06.958 align:start position:0%
proposal that the um the house passed I
 
05:06:08.868 --> 05:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
think had a similar got got rid of
 
05:06:10.610 --> 05:06:10.620 align:start position:0%
stabilization I believe and got that
 
05:06:12.590 --> 05:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
hold harmless down to 27 million and
 
05:06:14.570 --> 05:06:14.580 align:start position:0%
they spent a significant amount of money
 
05:06:15.890 --> 05:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
um then the Senate added restored
 
05:06:18.170 --> 05:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
stabilization but basically no matter
 
05:06:19.788 --> 05:06:19.798 align:start position:0%
how you target the aid and that that
 
05:06:21.470 --> 05:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
formula used fiscal capacity disparity
 
05:06:23.390 --> 05:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
Aid F and raid all that stuff and still
 
05:06:26.448 --> 05:06:26.458 align:start position:0%
had a 27 million dollar hold harmless so
 
05:06:29.030 --> 05:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
no matter what to keep people neutral
 
05:06:30.530 --> 05:06:30.540 align:start position:0%
you need something like old harmless
 
05:06:31.970 --> 05:06:31.980 align:start position:0%
we're also gonna have the town by town
 
05:06:38.810 --> 05:06:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:42.170 --> 05:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
so it looks like stabilization or
 
05:06:44.150 --> 05:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
do you do you think it would it be
 
05:06:45.650 --> 05:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
possible to take like a 10 minute recess
 
05:06:48.708 --> 05:06:48.718 align:start position:0%
that's a great idea
 
05:06:49.490 --> 05:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:06:53.570 --> 05:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
because my brain expanded yeah
 
05:06:55.670 --> 05:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so let's take take cam we'll see if
 
05:06:59.708 --> 05:06:59.718 align:start position:0%
20 actors she's about 300. one base
 
05:07:05.990 --> 05:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
oh yeah simple yeah hey and that helps
 
05:07:08.208 --> 05:07:08.218 align:start position:0%
stabilization at some point because
 
05:07:09.230 --> 05:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
they're going to be getting more money
 
05:07:11.750 --> 05:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
yeah you know
 
05:07:13.850 --> 05:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
they may get more money this time but
 
05:07:14.890 --> 05:07:14.900 align:start position:0%
eventually that's going to go
 
05:07:17.470 --> 05:07:17.480 align:start position:0%
stabilization is going to go away
 
05:08:24.288 --> 05:08:24.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:24.298 --> 05:22:27.350 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:22:27.350 --> 05:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:31.010 --> 05:22:31.020 align:start position:0%
let's let's address other things
 
05:22:32.868 --> 05:22:32.878 align:start position:0%
Mickey's going to run some scenarios for
 
05:22:34.730 --> 05:22:34.740 align:start position:0%
us so we'll Monday Monday morning will
 
05:22:38.330 --> 05:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
be hard at it and I I think I think the
 
05:22:40.910 --> 05:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
conclusion is that we're not going to
 
05:22:43.250 --> 05:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
make everybody happy
 
05:22:43.260 --> 05:22:45.230 align:start position:0%
make everybody happy
so

05:22:45.230 --> 05:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:22:47.868 --> 05:22:47.878 align:start position:0%
the question how do we minimize the
 
05:22:50.448 --> 05:22:50.458 align:start position:0%
unhappiness I think you know messaging
 
05:22:52.850 --> 05:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
that everybody gets an increase and
 
05:22:54.708 --> 05:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
messaging that we've made an honest
 
05:22:56.690 --> 05:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
attempt to Target the poor communities
 
05:22:59.090 --> 05:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
and you can show them the numbers I mean
 
05:23:00.590 --> 05:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
you're right no not everyone's going to
 
05:23:02.570 --> 05:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
be happy but messaging that overall
 
05:23:04.010 --> 05:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
there's an increase for everybody and
 
05:23:05.270 --> 05:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
there's an additional increase for those
 
05:23:07.368 --> 05:23:07.378 align:start position:0%
who need it the most
 
05:23:11.930 --> 05:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
okay yeah looking at item two
 
05:23:14.330 --> 05:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
on on Page Six
 
05:23:20.230 --> 05:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh no I line 23
 
05:23:23.930 --> 05:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
as we decrease the
 
05:23:26.930 --> 05:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
our the base
 
05:23:28.788 --> 05:23:28.798 align:start position:0%
we have to increase the charter school
 
05:23:30.948 --> 05:23:30.958 align:start position:0%
by the same amount
 
05:23:33.830 --> 05:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
because there this this budget is based
 
05:23:36.708 --> 05:23:36.718 align:start position:0%
on charter schools of getting nine
 
05:23:39.890 --> 05:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars which includes the base
 
05:23:42.890 --> 05:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
plus the additional Grant additional
 
05:23:47.570 --> 05:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
Grant so if you want to flip to page 25
 
05:23:50.330 --> 05:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
of this so this is representative
 
05:23:52.610 --> 05:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
Mooney's Bill if you remember we had uh
 
05:23:55.850 --> 05:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
House Bill 272 so on line eight of this
 
05:24:00.230 --> 05:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
bill we've got 46.27 right so that's the
 
05:24:00.240 --> 05:24:01.670 align:start position:0%
bill we've got 46.27 right so that's the
additional

05:24:01.670 --> 05:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
additional
 
05:24:03.410 --> 05:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
Charter School Grant that's increased
 
05:24:05.270 --> 05:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
under this bill I think what you're
 
05:24:06.948 --> 05:24:06.958 align:start position:0%
referring to Mr chairs wherever we
 
05:24:09.530 --> 05:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
settle on Ed funding or the cost of an
 
05:24:11.330 --> 05:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
adequate education base amount plus this
 
05:24:13.070 --> 05:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
you want it to be a nine grand right
 
05:24:15.590 --> 05:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
okay so what I'll do is I'll hang on to
 
05:24:17.090 --> 05:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
this amendment here and it's in here
 
05:24:19.070 --> 05:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
kind of waiting in the wings to see what
 
05:24:20.570 --> 05:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
we do with that funding
 
05:24:23.530 --> 05:24:23.540 align:start position:0%
we will adjust
 
05:24:27.170 --> 05:24:27.180 align:start position:0%
right to be to be uh the plug I guess to
 
05:24:29.750 --> 05:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
get to 9000 or thereabouts so I've got
 
05:24:31.910 --> 05:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
that tracked for us good thank you
 
05:24:34.490 --> 05:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
and the net cost of that
 
05:24:37.610 --> 05:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
will be uh we'll determine that you may
 
05:24:39.830 --> 05:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
you may achieve some savings uh because
 
05:24:41.930 --> 05:24:41.940 align:start position:0%
the governor's um
 
05:24:44.030 --> 05:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget budgeted Charter
 
05:24:45.650 --> 05:24:45.660 align:start position:0%
Schools up to forty seven hundred
 
05:24:47.448 --> 05:24:47.458 align:start position:0%
dollars of the basis so depending if you
 
05:24:48.650 --> 05:24:48.660 align:start position:0%
come down and the cost is so there's
 
05:24:49.850 --> 05:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
going to be some netting involved but
 
05:24:53.690 --> 05:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
I'll figure that out as time comes okay
 
05:24:56.390 --> 05:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
do we need to look at any other items
 
05:24:59.030 --> 05:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
here that are
 
05:24:59.040 --> 05:24:59.810 align:start position:0%
here that are
um

05:24:59.810 --> 05:24:59.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:02.708 --> 05:25:02.718 align:start position:0%
School building Aid still we haven't
 
05:25:05.690 --> 05:25:05.700 align:start position:0%
addressed that one we have not I don't
 
05:25:07.970 --> 05:25:07.980 align:start position:0%
know if you want to do that now or move
 
05:25:09.530 --> 05:25:09.540 align:start position:0%
on to anything I don't have a whole lot
 
05:25:11.868 --> 05:25:11.878 align:start position:0%
else if you want to have that discussion
 
05:25:14.750 --> 05:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
I think we ought to look at the uh
 
05:25:17.090 --> 05:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs is that the page
 
05:25:17.100 --> 05:25:24.590 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs is that the page
three

05:25:24.590 --> 05:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:27.948 --> 05:25:27.958 align:start position:0%
but I will add that uh some of those
 
05:25:29.690 --> 05:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
items that we've already
 
05:25:29.700 --> 05:25:31.910 align:start position:0%
items that we've already
decided

05:25:31.910 --> 05:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
decided
 
05:25:35.150 --> 05:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
hb2 items that we discussed and thought
 
05:25:36.730 --> 05:25:36.740 align:start position:0%
were okay
 
05:25:39.590 --> 05:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
include the
 
05:25:39.600 --> 05:25:43.430 align:start position:0%
include the
um

05:25:43.430 --> 05:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:45.288 --> 05:25:45.298 align:start position:0%
there's four mil four and a half million
 
05:25:46.788 --> 05:25:46.798 align:start position:0%
dollars for
 
05:25:50.448 --> 05:25:50.458 align:start position:0%
computer science applications
 
05:25:50.458 --> 05:25:51.310 align:start position:0%
computer science applications
okay

05:25:51.310 --> 05:25:51.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:25:56.390 --> 05:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh it's uh section 63 on page one of the
 
05:25:57.948 --> 05:25:57.958 align:start position:0%
tracking sheets so that we're in House
 
05:26:00.010 --> 05:26:00.020 align:start position:0%
Bill 2. oh yeah
 
05:26:05.930 --> 05:26:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:09.490 --> 05:26:09.500 align:start position:0%
we had we had several education items
 
05:26:12.890 --> 05:26:12.900 align:start position:0%
uh one was the teacher of the year one
 
05:26:12.900 --> 05:26:14.150 align:start position:0%
uh one was the teacher of the year one
was

05:26:14.150 --> 05:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:26:16.788 --> 05:26:16.798 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to find them right now and my
 
05:26:19.430 --> 05:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
eyes are kind of worried uh
 
05:26:22.910 --> 05:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
so 62 yeah 62 through 65 or your
 
05:26:26.270 --> 05:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
computer science related items on page
 
05:26:27.708 --> 05:26:27.718 align:start position:0%
one of uh
 
05:26:34.490 --> 05:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:34.500 --> 05:26:35.690 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:26:35.690 --> 05:26:35.700 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:26:37.730 --> 05:26:37.740 align:start position:0%
I'm saying
 
05:26:39.590 --> 05:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
there was something some of these items
 
05:26:41.390 --> 05:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
were not asked for by the Departments
 
05:26:44.090 --> 05:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
necessarily and so if we're if we're
 
05:26:45.948 --> 05:26:45.958 align:start position:0%
looking for money I'm just I'm just
 
05:26:48.948 --> 05:26:48.958 align:start position:0%
rehashing this a little bit some of
 
05:26:51.170 --> 05:26:51.180 align:start position:0%
these items we could say uh
 
05:26:54.948 --> 05:26:54.958 align:start position:0%
we need it for education or or somewhere
 
05:26:56.448 --> 05:26:56.458 align:start position:0%
else okay
 
05:26:56.458 --> 05:26:59.990 align:start position:0%
else okay
um

05:26:59.990 --> 05:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:03.550 --> 05:27:03.560 align:start position:0%
well we don't need to yet I I'm just
 
05:27:05.810 --> 05:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
throwing things in the hopper here to
 
05:27:09.890 --> 05:27:09.900 align:start position:0%
say this is a bridge we can cross
 
05:27:09.900 --> 05:27:17.288 align:start position:0%
say this is a bridge we can cross
um

05:27:17.288 --> 05:27:17.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:20.448 --> 05:27:20.458 align:start position:0%
that's no that's no money there's I mean
 
05:27:21.770 --> 05:27:21.780 align:start position:0%
there's two million for the Civics thing
 
05:27:23.090 --> 05:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
that's not a lot but it's something
 
05:27:23.100 --> 05:27:28.070 align:start position:0%
that's not a lot but it's something
right

05:27:28.070 --> 05:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:30.350 --> 05:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
my point is if we if we if we need to
 
05:27:32.628 --> 05:27:32.638 align:start position:0%
find money we'll go back and talk to the
 
05:27:35.990 --> 05:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner say how much of this can we
 
05:27:44.868 --> 05:27:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:47.448 --> 05:27:47.458 align:start position:0%
sort of sounded like
 
05:27:49.670 --> 05:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
they did okay
 
05:27:49.680 --> 05:27:52.310 align:start position:0%
they did okay
confirmed

05:27:52.310 --> 05:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
confirmed
 
05:27:52.320 --> 05:27:56.208 align:start position:0%
confirmed
okay

05:27:56.208 --> 05:27:56.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:56.218 --> 05:27:57.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:27:57.470 --> 05:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:00.830 --> 05:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
I get I'm getting the same sense on item
 
05:28:04.730 --> 05:28:04.740 align:start position:0%
on the top the interoperability lab
 
05:28:04.740 --> 05:28:06.770 align:start position:0%
on the top the interoperability lab
application

05:28:06.770 --> 05:28:06.780 align:start position:0%
application
 
05:28:08.570 --> 05:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
that was a man and a half dollars to
 
05:28:10.788 --> 05:28:10.798 align:start position:0%
hire people in the short term
 
05:28:12.230 --> 05:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
and I was I was thinking about that in
 
05:28:14.270 --> 05:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
the shower this morning of all things
 
05:28:16.850 --> 05:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if if this is like a
 
05:28:20.570 --> 05:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:24.650 --> 05:28:24.660 align:start position:0%
are we the right funding agent no
 
05:28:26.390 --> 05:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
um that's the question I asked myself I
 
05:28:30.050 --> 05:28:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:30.060 --> 05:28:31.430 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:28:31.430 --> 05:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:28:34.128 --> 05:28:34.138 align:start position:0%
now you mean 100 million yeah
 
05:28:36.350 --> 05:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
and if if they if they decide to do this
 
05:28:37.850 --> 05:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
that's up to them
 
05:28:42.970 --> 05:28:42.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:45.350 --> 05:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
and then page four is the Whittemore
 
05:28:45.360 --> 05:28:46.368 align:start position:0%
and then page four is the Whittemore
Center

05:28:46.368 --> 05:28:46.378 align:start position:0%
Center
 
05:28:49.368 --> 05:28:49.378 align:start position:0%
Arena and Mary likes that
 
05:28:56.650 --> 05:28:56.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:58.490 --> 05:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
all right yeah but that's a business
 
05:29:03.910 --> 05:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:08.150 --> 05:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
I uh I did visit with Arena and you know
 
05:29:10.368 --> 05:29:10.378 align:start position:0%
we were there and I agree there is a
 
05:29:12.530 --> 05:29:12.540 align:start position:0%
need but given that we are starting
 
05:29:14.868 --> 05:29:14.878 align:start position:0%
behind the eight ball with so much in
 
05:29:17.208 --> 05:29:17.218 align:start position:0%
terms of Revenue frankly if there is
 
05:29:18.948 --> 05:29:18.958 align:start position:0%
stuff that we do need to remove from an
 
05:29:21.110 --> 05:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
education budget I would say that's one
 
05:29:23.050 --> 05:29:23.060 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:29:26.208 --> 05:29:26.218 align:start position:0%
lesser priorities in terms of funding
 
05:29:28.070 --> 05:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
because I'd rather you know deal with
 
05:29:30.650 --> 05:29:30.660 align:start position:0%
teachers in front of kids and all that
 
05:29:33.170 --> 05:29:33.180 align:start position:0%
necessary stuff so uh
 
05:29:35.810 --> 05:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
will no need to you know decide anything
 
05:29:37.310 --> 05:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
because we still don't have a clear
 
05:29:39.948 --> 05:29:39.958 align:start position:0%
bottom line but I'm you know
 
05:29:42.410 --> 05:29:42.420 align:start position:0%
that's a candidate
 
05:29:44.990 --> 05:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
or are there any other of these items
 
05:29:46.670 --> 05:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
that we need to get to any departments
 
05:29:48.110 --> 05:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
back in for
 
05:29:51.350 --> 05:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
because I'm looking at page page two
 
05:29:51.360 --> 05:29:52.670 align:start position:0%
because I'm looking at page page two
okay

05:29:52.670 --> 05:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:29:55.070 --> 05:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of open items and we I
 
05:29:57.110 --> 05:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
don't know if we've even addressed them
 
05:29:57.120 --> 05:29:59.570 align:start position:0%
don't know if we've even addressed them
yet

05:29:59.570 --> 05:29:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:06.288 --> 05:30:06.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:08.690 --> 05:30:08.700 align:start position:0%
my understanding is public works and
 
05:30:10.490 --> 05:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
highways is considering the second
 
05:30:13.490 --> 05:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
project so the winner Squam is seven
 
05:30:16.070 --> 05:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
million correct yeah in House Bill 25
 
05:30:19.070 --> 05:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
but are not entertaining
 
05:30:23.570 --> 05:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
uh Sugar River Hill which is so I don't
 
05:30:25.310 --> 05:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
know if if the committee has heard
 
05:30:27.530 --> 05:30:27.540 align:start position:0%
testimony on that we do have 12 and a
 
05:30:29.030 --> 05:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
half million dollars factored into our
 
05:30:31.970 --> 05:30:31.980 align:start position:0%
education funding schedule now for this
 
05:30:34.670 --> 05:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
already if no one's proposing changes
 
05:30:36.170 --> 05:30:36.180 align:start position:0%
you could probably be okay with that
 
05:30:36.180 --> 05:30:38.030 align:start position:0%
you could probably be okay with that
section

05:30:38.030 --> 05:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
section
 
05:30:42.110 --> 05:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
can we agree on that one 12. no to leave
 
05:30:45.350 --> 05:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:49.690 --> 05:30:49.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:58.310 --> 05:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:58.320 --> 05:31:02.230 align:start position:0%
 
right

05:31:02.230 --> 05:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:05.690 --> 05:31:05.700 align:start position:0%
well plus if if if capital budget is
 
05:31:07.128 --> 05:31:07.138 align:start position:0%
taking care of the other one would that
 
05:31:12.050 --> 05:31:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:14.770 --> 05:31:14.780 align:start position:0%
want to take them out
 
05:31:19.430 --> 05:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
no no no no no well we I mean
 
05:31:22.128 --> 05:31:22.138 align:start position:0%
right okay I am too so okay what about
 
05:31:24.110 --> 05:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
the bottom two the change the revenue
 
05:31:26.510 --> 05:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
distribution of the BPT and the bets
 
05:31:29.208 --> 05:31:29.218 align:start position:0%
that impacts what's going to go into the
 
05:31:31.368 --> 05:31:31.378 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
05:31:33.470 --> 05:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
um we could adjust that and you know a
 
05:31:35.330 --> 05:31:35.340 align:start position:0%
small adjustment can result in a
 
05:31:37.430 --> 05:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money so I don't
 
05:31:40.970 --> 05:31:40.980 align:start position:0%
even know I was my two
 
05:31:42.948 --> 05:31:42.958 align:start position:0%
we can figure out look at what we're
 
05:31:44.448 --> 05:31:44.458 align:start position:0%
doing now look at what the governor is
 
05:31:46.010 --> 05:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
proposing in here and see if we're
 
05:31:47.448 --> 05:31:47.458 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that or adjusting that
 
05:31:48.948 --> 05:31:48.958 align:start position:0%
so we keep a little bit more money in
 
05:31:52.490 --> 05:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:56.170 --> 05:31:56.180 align:start position:0%
okay what was the amount on that dude
 
05:31:59.750 --> 05:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's about 73 million net between the
 
05:32:01.310 --> 05:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
two that would go to the general fund
 
05:32:02.930 --> 05:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
rather than the education trust fund per
 
05:32:02.940 --> 05:32:03.890 align:start position:0%
rather than the education trust fund per
year

05:32:03.890 --> 05:32:03.900 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:32:05.690 --> 05:32:05.700 align:start position:0%
so you'll see that on that uh schedule
 
05:32:07.730 --> 05:32:07.740 align:start position:0%
on page six the education trust fund
 
05:32:10.010 --> 05:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
schedule we went through earlier those
 
05:32:12.530 --> 05:32:12.540 align:start position:0%
adjustments are carried there I would
 
05:32:15.230 --> 05:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
just I would just remind you if if the
 
05:32:17.750 --> 05:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
division does go that direction
 
05:32:19.850 --> 05:32:19.860 align:start position:0%
obviously there'd be a general fund
 
05:32:21.948 --> 05:32:21.958 align:start position:0%
Revenue hit you know that would be the
 
05:32:23.150 --> 05:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
offset so
 
05:32:25.850 --> 05:32:25.860 align:start position:0%
just to keep that in mind okay
 
05:32:28.190 --> 05:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
I would like to keep that in because the
 
05:32:30.050 --> 05:32:30.060 align:start position:0%
way we are doing it right now is that we
 
05:32:31.910 --> 05:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
end up with more money in the education
 
05:32:34.970 --> 05:32:34.980 align:start position:0%
fund that's limited and you know can
 
05:32:37.550 --> 05:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
only be used for that while if money is
 
05:32:38.690 --> 05:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
sent to the general fund nothing
 
05:32:40.310 --> 05:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
prevents us from funding education
 
05:32:42.110 --> 05:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
adequately by charging through the
 
05:32:44.930 --> 05:32:44.940 align:start position:0%
general fund but there is no good reason
 
05:32:47.750 --> 05:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
to just put more money into the
 
05:32:50.750 --> 05:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
education than we spent so
 
05:32:52.730 --> 05:32:52.740 align:start position:0%
need for that right now to try to do a
 
05:32:54.230 --> 05:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
targeted schools there is a need for
 
05:32:56.510 --> 05:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
using that money now and I'm going from
 
05:33:00.830 --> 05:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
65 to 35 it's pretty hefty
 
05:33:03.650 --> 05:33:03.660 align:start position:0%
Tom I have a question
 
05:33:07.610 --> 05:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
um online on Section 169
 
05:33:09.708 --> 05:33:09.718 align:start position:0%
where it says the changing of funding
 
05:33:11.868 --> 05:33:11.878 align:start position:0%
for renovation and expansion of Career
 
05:33:13.850 --> 05:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
and Technical programs from capital
 
05:33:17.448 --> 05:33:17.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:19.810 --> 05:33:19.820 align:start position:0%
I know but I didn't understand
 
05:33:22.310 --> 05:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
there's some statutory changes where a
 
05:33:23.930 --> 05:33:23.940 align:start position:0%
references capital budget and just
 
05:33:26.690 --> 05:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
references budget process so that's what
 
05:33:29.990 --> 05:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
is the house bill 2 change behind this
 
05:33:31.490 --> 05:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
appropriation for this renovation
 
05:33:34.490 --> 05:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
construction of the CT Center is in the
 
05:33:37.010 --> 05:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
operating budget under uh or in House
 
05:33:39.470 --> 05:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 rather from the education trust
 
05:33:41.810 --> 05:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
fund versus House Bill 25 capital budget
 
05:33:46.150 --> 05:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
right and is it
 
05:33:50.708 --> 05:33:50.718 align:start position:0%
what is it is it is it a new building
 
05:33:50.718 --> 05:33:52.628 align:start position:0%
what is it is it is it a new building
renovation

05:33:52.628 --> 05:33:52.638 align:start position:0%
renovation
 
05:33:56.750 --> 05:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
of the CTE well that's that all goes
 
05:33:58.190 --> 05:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
through capital budget doesn't it no
 
05:34:00.050 --> 05:34:00.060 align:start position:0%
they they can't that's the that's the
 
05:34:01.850 --> 05:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
historical process
 
05:34:03.890 --> 05:34:03.900 align:start position:0%
I think the governor's office and Adam's
 
05:34:06.350 --> 05:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
here to verify uh recognize there was
 
05:34:08.510 --> 05:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
additional funds in the education trust
 
05:34:11.270 --> 05:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
fund to use for this and that freed up
 
05:34:14.090 --> 05:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
uh capital budget uh uses for other
 
05:34:14.100 --> 05:34:15.350 align:start position:0%
uh capital budget uh uses for other
needs

05:34:15.350 --> 05:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
needs
 
05:34:18.890 --> 05:34:18.900 align:start position:0%
but is 169 just for this biennium or
 
05:34:20.990 --> 05:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
just one year apropos representative
 
05:34:22.730 --> 05:34:22.740 align:start position:0%
Heath was saying we don't want these
 
05:34:24.470 --> 05:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
projects in the education trust fund all
 
05:34:26.330 --> 05:34:26.340 align:start position:0%
the time I don't I don't think the
 
05:34:28.070 --> 05:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
changes in House Bill 2 would be binding
 
05:34:29.750 --> 05:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
I think it'd be up to any Opera any
 
05:34:32.090 --> 05:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
budget any legislature to
 
05:34:34.670 --> 05:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
put the cap or put these in either way
 
05:34:37.310 --> 05:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
in either House Bill 25 or one and two
 
05:34:40.310 --> 05:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
operating or capital okay so let's don't
 
05:34:42.470 --> 05:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
jump around again let's raise our hands
 
05:34:46.070 --> 05:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
on 169 and 170 because they're
 
05:34:47.810 --> 05:34:47.820 align:start position:0%
they're tied to each other
 
05:34:51.350 --> 05:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
is everybody in favor of 169 or 170.
 
05:34:51.360 --> 05:34:51.930 align:start position:0%
is everybody in favor of 169 or 170.
yeah

05:34:51.930 --> 05:34:51.940 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:34:51.940 --> 05:34:53.930 align:start position:0%
yeah
[Music]

05:34:53.930 --> 05:34:53.940 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:34:53.940 --> 05:34:55.730 align:start position:0%
[Music]
yes

05:34:55.730 --> 05:34:55.740 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:34:59.330 --> 05:34:59.340 align:start position:0%
okay Miss Kate oh okay all right so see
 
05:35:03.530 --> 05:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
Mickey 69 and 70. or thumbs up okay
 
05:35:03.540 --> 05:35:07.128 align:start position:0%
Mickey 69 and 70. or thumbs up okay
excellent

05:35:07.128 --> 05:35:07.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:10.810 --> 05:35:10.820 align:start position:0%
hey we made some progress uh so uh
 
05:35:15.410 --> 05:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
171 identifies what the government is
 
05:35:15.420 --> 05:35:16.550 align:start position:0%
171 identifies what the government is
recommending

05:35:16.550 --> 05:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
recommending
 
05:35:21.170 --> 05:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
yeah so 171 uh 172 is the two percent
 
05:35:23.448 --> 05:35:23.458 align:start position:0%
annual versus the CPI I have a feeling
 
05:35:24.830 --> 05:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
this committee is probably going to
 
05:35:27.350 --> 05:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
support that based on so but it's going
 
05:35:29.270 --> 05:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
to be probably part of a bigger
 
05:35:31.190 --> 05:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment if you do an education trust
 
05:35:32.750 --> 05:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
fund anyone but that provision would
 
05:35:36.890 --> 05:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
remain so I I'm reluctant to just cherry
 
05:35:38.868 --> 05:35:38.878 align:start position:0%
pick different components here because I
 
05:35:40.070 --> 05:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
feel like there could be one Amendment
 
05:35:41.510 --> 05:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's just going to overwrite all these
 
05:35:43.310 --> 05:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
sections and we may keep some things in
 
05:35:44.930 --> 05:35:44.940 align:start position:0%
take some things out
 
05:35:47.150 --> 05:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
so you would like to know which ones
 
05:35:47.160 --> 05:35:48.230 align:start position:0%
so you would like to know which ones
where

05:35:48.230 --> 05:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:35:49.850 --> 05:35:49.860 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm not I don't know if we're in
 
05:35:51.230 --> 05:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
a place to do that
 
05:35:53.288 --> 05:35:53.298 align:start position:0%
um because so the first one 171
 
05:35:55.430 --> 05:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
increasing the per people eight amounts
 
05:35:56.750 --> 05:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
I don't think we're settled on that yet
 
05:35:58.850 --> 05:35:58.860 align:start position:0%
right the two percent I think we are
 
05:36:02.448 --> 05:36:02.458 align:start position:0%
probably okay with that yep the repeal
 
05:36:05.270 --> 05:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
of relief funding I don't think so these
 
05:36:07.310 --> 05:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
are the the
 
05:36:08.868 --> 05:36:08.878 align:start position:0%
this is the component that would be
 
05:36:10.730 --> 05:36:10.740 align:start position:0%
based on free and reduced lunch
 
05:36:13.310 --> 05:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
populations the next is the change to
 
05:36:15.410 --> 05:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary needs Grant when it
 
05:36:18.050 --> 05:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
goes out 10 years the next is where the
 
05:36:19.730 --> 05:36:19.740 align:start position:0%
hold harmless and stabilization Grant
 
05:36:21.350 --> 05:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
are edited
 
05:36:21.360 --> 05:36:22.850 align:start position:0%
are edited
um

05:36:22.850 --> 05:36:22.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:24.650 --> 05:36:24.660 align:start position:0%
I don't think we're in a place to do any
 
05:36:26.750 --> 05:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
of those three these are bridges we
 
05:36:28.550 --> 05:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
can't cross yeah I think the only one
 
05:36:32.270 --> 05:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
that is probably okay is 170 so 176 is
 
05:36:33.650 --> 05:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
relative to Charters and we're going to
 
05:36:35.030 --> 05:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
hold the representative Mooney Amendment
 
05:36:38.750 --> 05:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
until that settles 177 you probably are
 
05:36:41.330 --> 05:36:41.340 align:start position:0%
okay with this is uh repealing a
 
05:36:42.590 --> 05:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
Statewide education Improvement
 
05:36:44.208 --> 05:36:44.218 align:start position:0%
Assessment program data relative to
 
05:36:45.590 --> 05:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
third grade reading which I think was
 
05:36:47.208 --> 05:36:47.218 align:start position:0%
tied to the component that you're
 
05:36:48.350 --> 05:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
probably going to be okay with taking
 
05:36:52.070 --> 05:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
out of adequacy everybody concur no I
 
05:36:53.208 --> 05:36:53.218 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
05:36:56.030 --> 05:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm thinking of the rather
 
05:36:58.368 --> 05:36:58.378 align:start position:0%
unpleasantness around all the Amendments
 
05:37:01.010 --> 05:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
that came in with was the HB 49 that we
 
05:37:03.288 --> 05:37:03.298 align:start position:0%
had four different amendments or so
 
05:37:04.970 --> 05:37:04.980 align:start position:0%
somewhat conflicting with each other
 
05:37:06.770 --> 05:37:06.780 align:start position:0%
some that were the same with each other
 
05:37:09.948 --> 05:37:09.958 align:start position:0%
I would prefer to see us go to the full
 
05:37:12.650 --> 05:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
Finance board with one Amendment that
 
05:37:15.128 --> 05:37:15.138 align:start position:0%
deals with all of this
 
05:37:16.970 --> 05:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
but I don't know if we can take out
 
05:37:19.190 --> 05:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
these until I yeah I'm probably still
 
05:37:20.628 --> 05:37:20.638 align:start position:0%
going to keep them blank on here because
 
05:37:22.430 --> 05:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
when your final decision is made it'll
 
05:37:23.570 --> 05:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
be one Amendment that's going to
 
05:37:25.128 --> 05:37:25.138 align:start position:0%
override all these it'll just include
 
05:37:26.750 --> 05:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
some of the same Provisions as the
 
05:37:26.760 --> 05:37:29.750 align:start position:0%
some of the same Provisions as the
governor

05:37:29.750 --> 05:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:32.330 --> 05:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
same thing so education trust fund
 
05:37:35.448 --> 05:37:35.458 align:start position:0%
distribution and allowable uses this
 
05:37:37.610 --> 05:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
committee had talked for a while about
 
05:37:40.368 --> 05:37:40.378 align:start position:0%
expanding Contracting you know what what
 
05:37:41.750 --> 05:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
programs would be out of the education
 
05:37:43.310 --> 05:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
trust fund I
 
05:37:45.110 --> 05:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
don't know if we're at a point today to
 
05:37:46.788 --> 05:37:46.798 align:start position:0%
go through those or support that
 
05:37:48.170 --> 05:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
probably should just hold off for now
 
05:37:51.350 --> 05:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
okay uh which one is that uh some sorry
 
05:37:58.128 --> 05:37:58.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:00.708 --> 05:38:00.718 align:start position:0%
now down at the bottom under amendments
 
05:38:05.750 --> 05:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:07.788 --> 05:38:07.798 align:start position:0%
Department of Education data analyst
 
05:38:07.798 --> 05:38:08.930 align:start position:0%
Department of Education data analyst
position

05:38:08.930 --> 05:38:08.940 align:start position:0%
position
 
05:38:11.030 --> 05:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
is that is that another we adopted that
 
05:38:16.128 --> 05:38:16.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:18.050 --> 05:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
oh they did this was a bit yeah this was
 
05:38:21.230 --> 05:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
House Bill 542. okay and uh we had heard
 
05:38:23.390 --> 05:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
from the Department relative to that and
 
05:38:25.010 --> 05:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
we did we do have an amendment in here
 
05:38:27.770 --> 05:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
and so we'll capture that spend in
 
05:38:29.810 --> 05:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
establishing that position I don't know
 
05:38:30.948 --> 05:38:30.958 align:start position:0%
if you want to talk about Medicaid
 
05:38:32.570 --> 05:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
direct certification we have
 
05:38:34.310 --> 05:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative Heath and Petrie's
 
05:38:36.410 --> 05:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
Amendment which is uh zero eight seven
 
05:38:37.610 --> 05:38:37.620 align:start position:0%
nine h
 
05:38:52.010 --> 05:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:55.250 --> 05:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
yeah I think we approved that yep
 
05:38:56.448 --> 05:38:56.458 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:38:59.448 --> 05:38:59.458 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I I don't think we did a show
 
05:39:00.708 --> 05:39:00.718 align:start position:0%
of hands or anything on this one I think
 
05:39:01.970 --> 05:39:01.980 align:start position:0%
we discussed that this would be
 
05:39:03.110 --> 05:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
something the committee would entertain
 
05:39:05.090 --> 05:39:05.100 align:start position:0%
but I still have this as a pending
 
05:39:08.090 --> 05:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
Amendment well I think we all those that
 
05:39:10.490 --> 05:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
agree that we should get in the queue
 
05:39:11.448 --> 05:39:11.458 align:start position:0%
for this one
 
05:39:11.458 --> 05:39:14.330 align:start position:0%
for this one
yeah okay

05:39:14.330 --> 05:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:14.340 --> 05:39:21.170 align:start position:0%
 
done

05:39:21.170 --> 05:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:23.930 --> 05:39:23.940 align:start position:0%
so so the question on this also is
 
05:39:25.910 --> 05:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement you do this but
 
05:39:28.010 --> 05:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education did identify
 
05:39:28.020 --> 05:39:29.930 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education did identify
335

05:39:29.930 --> 05:39:29.940 align:start position:0%
335
 
05:39:32.570 --> 05:39:32.580 align:start position:0%
000 of related costs associated with
 
05:39:35.868 --> 05:39:35.878 align:start position:0%
pursuing the direct certification uh
 
05:39:38.208 --> 05:39:38.218 align:start position:0%
let me see I think that that was when
 
05:39:42.770 --> 05:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
when we got authorized for it no so the
 
05:39:44.930 --> 05:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
real cost the bigger cost will happen
 
05:39:47.030 --> 05:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
next budget next biennium that's when
 
05:39:48.830 --> 05:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
you'll see F and R numbers be adjusted
 
05:39:51.650 --> 05:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
for direct certification if it happens
 
05:39:53.570 --> 05:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
in order to get to that point the
 
05:39:55.368 --> 05:39:55.378 align:start position:0%
department had identified some contract
 
05:39:57.948 --> 05:39:57.958 align:start position:0%
costs and a uh
 
05:39:59.690 --> 05:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
position perhaps I think there's a
 
05:40:01.310 --> 05:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
position associated with it in their
 
05:40:05.570 --> 05:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
nutrition area as well as it could
 
05:40:09.948 --> 05:40:09.958 align:start position:0%
change the general fund match that we do
 
05:40:09.958 --> 05:40:11.448 align:start position:0%
change the general fund match that we do
for

05:40:11.448 --> 05:40:11.458 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:40:13.730 --> 05:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
um yeah thank you Mark School breakfast
 
05:40:17.030 --> 05:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
so while adequacy won't be impacted
 
05:40:19.490 --> 05:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
until fiscal 26 the free and reduced
 
05:40:21.350 --> 05:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
lunch eligible kids could happen as
 
05:40:23.448 --> 05:40:23.458 align:start position:0%
early as fiscal 25 but if you remember
 
05:40:25.670 --> 05:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
adequacies a year behind with accounts
 
05:40:27.708 --> 05:40:27.718 align:start position:0%
so if those kids are first recognized in
 
05:40:30.170 --> 05:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
25 there's a state match for breakfast
 
05:40:32.810 --> 05:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
that'll hit in 25 but adequacy won't
 
05:40:34.368 --> 05:40:34.378 align:start position:0%
happen until 26 because it's a year
 
05:40:38.990 --> 05:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
behind so that's the 335 000 relative to
 
05:40:40.490 --> 05:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
that amendment that I would add in house
 
05:40:42.890 --> 05:40:42.900 align:start position:0%
bill to if the committee was okay with
 
05:40:42.900 --> 05:40:47.570 align:start position:0%
bill to if the committee was okay with
that

05:40:47.570 --> 05:40:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:49.788 --> 05:40:49.798 align:start position:0%
I feel like that they were it was in the
 
05:40:51.410 --> 05:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
fiscal note relative to this bill it's
 
05:40:53.090 --> 05:40:53.100 align:start position:0%
it's cost the department has identified
 
05:40:56.628 --> 05:40:56.638 align:start position:0%
right along to pursue this okay
 
05:40:58.310 --> 05:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
so I'll make that change in house bill
 
05:40:58.320 --> 05:40:59.810 align:start position:0%
so I'll make that change in house bill
one

05:40:59.810 --> 05:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:41:01.970 --> 05:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
05:41:03.410 --> 05:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
we have a show of hands on that one with
 
05:41:10.448 --> 05:41:10.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:13.190 --> 05:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
I don't if you want to get that for me I
 
05:41:22.070 --> 05:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:26.810 --> 05:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
go ahead did we um cover page 56 section
 
05:41:29.570 --> 05:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
159 the suspension relative to
 
05:41:33.708 --> 05:41:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:36.288 --> 05:41:36.298 align:start position:0%
page it's like the second page in our
 
05:41:40.550 --> 05:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
packet yeah page 56 section 159.
 
05:41:42.708 --> 05:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
that's an open item yeah I'm trying to
 
05:41:45.350 --> 05:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
remember why we were holding on this one
 
05:41:47.628 --> 05:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
oh it's page to spin the packet oh oh
 
05:41:50.110 --> 05:41:50.120 align:start position:0%
sorry page um 56
 
05:41:54.350 --> 05:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
sections 159 Mickey Mouse so in in law
 
05:41:56.750 --> 05:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
there's statutory limits for what can be
 
05:41:59.030 --> 05:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
budgeted as far as Highway funds to dot
 
05:42:01.850 --> 05:42:01.860 align:start position:0%
safety and other agencies so Department
 
05:42:03.830 --> 05:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
of Safety head and House Bill 2
 
05:42:05.628 --> 05:42:05.638 align:start position:0%
requested that a suspension of their
 
05:42:07.250 --> 05:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
provision be in there I think as a belt
 
05:42:08.810 --> 05:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
and suspenders just in case their budget
 
05:42:10.788 --> 05:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
ended up being out of compliance you're
 
05:42:12.170 --> 05:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
not out of compliance as of right now
 
05:42:13.850 --> 05:42:13.860 align:start position:0%
and I'll monitor that so if we don't
 
05:42:15.310 --> 05:42:15.320 align:start position:0%
need that section we'll delete that
 
05:42:17.448 --> 05:42:17.458 align:start position:0%
we'll keep that one until we're closed
 
05:42:19.670 --> 05:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
up with the highway fund
 
05:42:22.010 --> 05:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
and uh as we're going through these and
 
05:42:23.930 --> 05:42:23.940 align:start position:0%
I know we've decided on some there's a
 
05:42:26.150 --> 05:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
couple open Adam is here too if we've
 
05:42:28.128 --> 05:42:28.138 align:start position:0%
heard from agencies on a lot of these
 
05:42:29.270 --> 05:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
things but we hadn't heard from the
 
05:42:30.830 --> 05:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
governor's office on specifically many
 
05:42:32.690 --> 05:42:32.700 align:start position:0%
of these things so if you do need him by
 
05:42:38.030 --> 05:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:40.550 --> 05:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
so I know I I think that I don't know if
 
05:42:41.690 --> 05:42:41.700 align:start position:0%
I don't think there was a consensus on
 
05:42:43.730 --> 05:42:43.740 align:start position:0%
the computer science stuff but um I just
 
05:42:46.430 --> 05:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
want to speak to that for a second that
 
05:42:47.990 --> 05:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
um I believe those are General funds our
 
05:42:50.090 --> 05:42:50.100 align:start position:0%
legal counsels back there but
 
05:42:51.650 --> 05:42:51.660 align:start position:0%
um those are I believe those are General
 
05:42:53.448 --> 05:42:53.458 align:start position:0%
funds and so I I don't think that would
 
05:42:55.670 --> 05:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
have a trust fund impact
 
05:42:57.650 --> 05:42:57.660 align:start position:0%
um I we think it's important to increase
 
05:42:59.448 --> 05:42:59.458 align:start position:0%
the number of stem and computer science
 
05:43:02.868 --> 05:43:02.878 align:start position:0%
Educators uh here in the state and what
 
05:43:06.590 --> 05:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
this does is provide grants and a new
 
05:43:09.830 --> 05:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
credentialing pathway for them so if a
 
05:43:12.010 --> 05:43:12.020 align:start position:0%
computer science teacher or a teacher
 
05:43:14.690 --> 05:43:14.700 align:start position:0%
pursues pursues a credential in computer
 
05:43:17.390 --> 05:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
science they could get some professional
 
05:43:19.670 --> 05:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh funds for that professional
 
05:43:21.890 --> 05:43:21.900 align:start position:0%
development funds as well as
 
05:43:23.930 --> 05:43:23.940 align:start position:0%
once they get that certification if they
 
05:43:26.270 --> 05:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
teach computer science for uh three
 
05:43:28.970 --> 05:43:28.980 align:start position:0%
years then they would get grants
 
05:43:31.010 --> 05:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
um or bonuses if you will so in the
 
05:43:32.390 --> 05:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
first year would be five thousand the
 
05:43:34.550 --> 05:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
following two years it would be 2500
 
05:43:37.610 --> 05:43:37.620 align:start position:0%
each year and the idea is to increase
 
05:43:39.890 --> 05:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
the number of uh stem Educators in the
 
05:43:39.900 --> 05:43:40.610 align:start position:0%
the number of uh stem Educators in the
state

05:43:40.610 --> 05:43:40.620 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:43:42.288 --> 05:43:42.298 align:start position:0%
um I know it's a it's something the
 
05:43:44.628 --> 05:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
governor wants to do so that's why that
 
05:43:47.750 --> 05:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
was included as part of it and
 
05:43:50.330 --> 05:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
um I'll take questions on that first and
 
05:43:52.128 --> 05:43:52.138 align:start position:0%
well why would it come out of General
 
05:43:52.138 --> 05:43:53.448 align:start position:0%
well why would it come out of General
funds

05:43:53.448 --> 05:43:53.458 align:start position:0%
funds
 
05:43:55.610 --> 05:43:55.620 align:start position:0%
I believe that's the way we wrote it in
 
05:43:58.368 --> 05:43:58.378 align:start position:0%
in the uh Bill itself
 
05:44:01.250 --> 05:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
it's a charge to the fiscal 23 Surplus
 
05:44:03.110 --> 05:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
if you will that's yeah oh okay it's a
 
05:44:05.090 --> 05:44:05.100 align:start position:0%
charge against 23.
 
05:44:05.100 --> 05:44:07.250 align:start position:0%
charge against 23.
correct

05:44:07.250 --> 05:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:44:11.048 --> 05:44:11.058 align:start position:0%
which one which number we want we are on
 
05:44:17.750 --> 05:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:18.948 --> 05:44:18.958 align:start position:0%
um if there are no other questions I
 
05:44:19.788 --> 05:44:19.798 align:start position:0%
just want to jump into the
 
05:44:21.590 --> 05:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
interoperability lab
 
05:44:22.910 --> 05:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
um that's a
 
05:44:24.590 --> 05:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
that's an appropriation that's a
 
05:44:26.690 --> 05:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
one-time appropriation the idea behind
 
05:44:28.430 --> 05:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
that is businesses will come in and and
 
05:44:31.070 --> 05:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
it'll be self-sustaining so I I just
 
05:44:34.010 --> 05:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
wanted to make that that plug because
 
05:44:36.110 --> 05:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
um it wouldn't be an ongoing cost so I
 
05:44:38.090 --> 05:44:38.100 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure that was no
 
05:44:41.510 --> 05:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:44.628 --> 05:44:44.638 align:start position:0%
that's also fiscal 23 Surplus
 
05:44:47.150 --> 05:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
gender it's also 23 Surplus and it was
 
05:44:52.970 --> 05:44:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:54.890 --> 05:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
that's why I wanted to get up here and
 
05:44:56.708 --> 05:44:56.718 align:start position:0%
answer questions because I know
 
05:45:00.948 --> 05:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:03.490 --> 05:45:03.500 align:start position:0%
that one's in 23 or the others
 
05:45:06.830 --> 05:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
established in 20 Surplus uh all of
 
05:45:08.810 --> 05:45:08.820 align:start position:0%
these there's all those the ones that we
 
05:45:11.150 --> 05:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
just talked about computer science and
 
05:45:12.470 --> 05:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
um interoperability lab those are all
 
05:45:12.480 --> 05:45:15.410 align:start position:0%
um interoperability lab those are all
Surplus

05:45:15.410 --> 05:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:17.030 --> 05:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
um favorite way to spend money I believe
 
05:45:19.010 --> 05:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
the way more is also yes it is that's
 
05:45:20.448 --> 05:45:20.458 align:start position:0%
right for the record James Scully a
 
05:45:21.708 --> 05:45:21.718 align:start position:0%
legal counselor of the governor's office
 
05:45:25.128 --> 05:45:25.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:26.990 --> 05:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
you do an attorney Scott doing well
 
05:45:28.788 --> 05:45:28.798 align:start position:0%
representative how are you
 
05:45:28.798 --> 05:45:30.288 align:start position:0%
representative how are you
okay

05:45:30.288 --> 05:45:30.298 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:45:32.090 --> 05:45:32.100 align:start position:0%
you're on
 
05:45:34.310 --> 05:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
and just happy that you're happy to
 
05:45:35.750 --> 05:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
answer any questions on other ones that
 
05:45:37.430 --> 05:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
you're making changes to
 
05:45:39.530 --> 05:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I wanted to just provide that
 
05:45:40.970 --> 05:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
background that some of this is Surplus
 
05:45:44.510 --> 05:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
so I it does not affect the trust fund
 
05:45:47.868 --> 05:45:47.878 align:start position:0%
um Appropriations at all uh or or the uh
 
05:45:50.390 --> 05:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
the amount in the trust fund so I'm
 
05:45:51.770 --> 05:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions on other
 
05:45:54.708 --> 05:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
ones that you that you did not get
 
05:45:59.868 --> 05:45:59.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:59.878 --> 05:46:00.948 align:start position:0%
 
I

05:46:00.948 --> 05:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:46:02.390 --> 05:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
know short people
 
05:46:02.400 --> 05:46:03.708 align:start position:0%
know short people
um

05:46:03.708 --> 05:46:03.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:04.970 --> 05:46:04.980 align:start position:0%
they're full though I love it's coming
 
05:46:06.708 --> 05:46:06.718 align:start position:0%
out of the Surplus
 
05:46:08.868 --> 05:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
um my favorite money it's not going to
 
05:46:11.208 --> 05:46:11.218 align:start position:0%
come out of the general fund though
 
05:46:13.190 --> 05:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
it is it is so it's going to take away
 
05:46:13.200 --> 05:46:14.690 align:start position:0%
it is it is so it's going to take away
from

05:46:14.690 --> 05:46:14.700 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:46:16.730 --> 05:46:16.740 align:start position:0%
the amount of general fund money we can
 
05:46:19.310 --> 05:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
spend in Surplus in Surplus yeah so we
 
05:46:21.650 --> 05:46:21.660 align:start position:0%
have a we have a surplus of a projected
 
05:46:23.868 --> 05:46:23.878 align:start position:0%
surplus of General funds this is coming
 
05:46:27.110 --> 05:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
out of the 2023 Surplus that we that we
 
05:46:30.470 --> 05:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
have so has it been established if I may
 
05:46:32.448 --> 05:46:32.458 align:start position:0%
has it been established how much
 
05:46:36.948 --> 05:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
division two has to spend in that Arena
 
05:46:39.048 --> 05:46:39.058 align:start position:0%
that is not a question for me I don't
 
05:46:39.058 --> 05:46:40.070 align:start position:0%
that is not a question for me I don't
know

05:46:40.070 --> 05:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:46:42.948 --> 05:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:45.048 --> 05:46:45.058 align:start position:0%
I think
 
05:46:46.850 --> 05:46:46.860 align:start position:0%
it's gonna be a problem I would assume
 
05:46:48.230 --> 05:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
that sure would have said something to
 
05:46:48.240 --> 05:46:50.208 align:start position:0%
that sure would have said something to
me

05:46:50.208 --> 05:46:50.218 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:46:51.948 --> 05:46:51.958 align:start position:0%
it's hard to track because I don't know
 
05:46:53.090 --> 05:46:53.100 align:start position:0%
what the other divisions have done today
 
05:46:55.070 --> 05:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
but going into today based on your
 
05:46:56.690 --> 05:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
revenues and based on the decisions to
 
05:46:58.128 --> 05:46:58.138 align:start position:0%
date across the three divisions we're
 
05:46:59.448 --> 05:46:59.458 align:start position:0%
actually dipped into the negative for
 
05:47:03.288 --> 05:47:03.298 align:start position:0%
23. so we're if everything happens with
 
05:47:04.910 --> 05:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
all the decisions made with the bills
 
05:47:06.288 --> 05:47:06.298 align:start position:0%
that are out there that are being
 
05:47:08.150 --> 05:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
supported so that that was emailed to
 
05:47:10.128 --> 05:47:10.138 align:start position:0%
everybody this morning Mike Kane sent a
 
05:47:13.490 --> 05:47:13.500 align:start position:0%
a little sheet to that so
 
05:47:16.010 --> 05:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
um but that's an ever-changing situation
 
05:47:17.390 --> 05:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
because there could be Cuts being made
 
05:47:18.770 --> 05:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
in the other divisions right now that
 
05:47:21.530 --> 05:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
change that for all I know so every
 
05:47:22.910 --> 05:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
every night at the end of each
 
05:47:25.190 --> 05:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
division's work you know Mike gain will
 
05:47:29.690 --> 05:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:34.128 --> 05:47:34.138 align:start position:0%
so uh Mick just does that change
 
05:47:36.708 --> 05:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
um the 96 million on a surplus statement
 
05:47:39.048 --> 05:47:39.058 align:start position:0%
this is general fund so under under
 
05:47:41.208 --> 05:47:41.218 align:start position:0%
current law the way it works is any any
 
05:47:43.190 --> 05:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
general fund service education trust I'm
 
05:47:45.830 --> 05:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah any any general fund Surplus
 
05:47:47.448 --> 05:47:47.458 align:start position:0%
at the end of the biennium would go to
 
05:47:50.810 --> 05:47:50.820 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund up to the cap so a
 
05:47:52.430 --> 05:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
lot of these Appropriations you see in
 
05:47:54.110 --> 05:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 are spending that money
 
05:47:55.490 --> 05:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
that otherwise would go to the rainy day
 
05:47:57.048 --> 05:47:57.058 align:start position:0%
fund so that it's above and beyond what
 
05:48:01.190 --> 05:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
was projected at the last last biennium
 
05:48:04.368 --> 05:48:04.378 align:start position:0%
the the last one that I think you um
 
05:48:06.830 --> 05:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned before we got up here was the
 
05:48:08.990 --> 05:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
Civics one that's also
 
05:48:15.650 --> 05:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:19.128 --> 05:48:19.138 align:start position:0%
looking at that email we have a surplus
 
05:48:23.030 --> 05:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
of 50 and about 160 millions of requests
 
05:48:24.948 --> 05:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
across all three divisions for the
 
05:48:26.930 --> 05:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
Surplus so um
 
05:48:30.470 --> 05:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
you know that whole Surplus thing may
 
05:48:34.128 --> 05:48:34.138 align:start position:0%
not work very well for us you know
 
05:48:37.730 --> 05:48:37.740 align:start position:0%
just while Mickey mentioned yeah
 
05:48:39.110 --> 05:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
understood I just thought it was
 
05:48:41.690 --> 05:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
important to um you know compare it to
 
05:48:42.770 --> 05:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
the other things in the right in the
 
05:48:48.350 --> 05:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:50.208 --> 05:48:50.218 align:start position:0%
hearing that
 
05:48:52.250 --> 05:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable changing uh the money
 
05:48:53.810 --> 05:48:53.820 align:start position:0%
that's going into the education trust
 
05:48:55.850 --> 05:48:55.860 align:start position:0%
fund um it seems like there's going to
 
05:48:58.850 --> 05:48:58.860 align:start position:0%
be to cover what we want to do uh we're
 
05:49:00.230 --> 05:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
going to need all that is in the trust
 
05:49:02.090 --> 05:49:02.100 align:start position:0%
fund so I'm a little concerned about the
 
05:49:03.948 --> 05:49:03.958 align:start position:0%
65 to 35
 
05:49:06.770 --> 05:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
um reappropriation of that money
 
05:49:06.780 --> 05:49:10.910 align:start position:0%
um reappropriation of that money
oh

05:49:10.910 --> 05:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:13.490 --> 05:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
well I know the chair the Chairman's is
 
05:49:15.830 --> 05:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
very interested in moving in that
 
05:49:19.010 --> 05:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
direction yeah
 
05:49:21.770 --> 05:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
so I'd be very reluctant to
 
05:49:23.750 --> 05:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
do anything on that in this group until
 
05:49:26.030 --> 05:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
I talk to him about it
 
05:49:26.040 --> 05:49:27.110 align:start position:0%
I talk to him about it
yeah

05:49:27.110 --> 05:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:49:29.750 --> 05:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure I'm sorry oh sorry no I
 
05:49:29.760 --> 05:49:30.970 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure I'm sorry oh sorry no I
think

05:49:30.970 --> 05:49:30.980 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:49:34.010 --> 05:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
it is related but all I was like gonna
 
05:49:36.530 --> 05:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
say is that changing funding from one
 
05:49:38.208 --> 05:49:38.218 align:start position:0%
pocket to another does not change the
 
05:49:40.670 --> 05:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
bottom line it just changes the way it's
 
05:49:43.670 --> 05:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
restricted that's all so yeah that's
 
05:49:47.208 --> 05:49:47.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:47.218 --> 05:49:49.730 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:49:49.730 --> 05:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:49:51.350 --> 05:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a one-way Street into the
 
05:49:51.360 --> 05:49:53.930 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a one-way Street into the
education

05:49:53.930 --> 05:49:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:56.288 --> 05:49:56.298 align:start position:0%
okay any other items
 
05:49:58.730 --> 05:49:58.740 align:start position:0%
so one item that we've been hanging on
 
05:50:00.170 --> 05:50:00.180 align:start position:0%
to here is the retirement system
 
05:50:02.570 --> 05:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
eligibility for ccsnh employees hired
 
05:50:04.128 --> 05:50:04.138 align:start position:0%
after one January I don't know if you
 
05:50:05.690 --> 05:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask the governor's office that
 
05:50:06.948 --> 05:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
because I don't think we got much of an
 
05:50:06.958 --> 05:50:11.470 align:start position:0%
because I don't think we got much of an
explanation

05:50:11.470 --> 05:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:15.288 --> 05:50:15.298 align:start position:0%
sorry section six and seven on page two
 
05:50:18.430 --> 05:50:18.440 align:start position:0%
of House Bill two right at the top under
 
05:50:22.190 --> 05:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
ccnh I was curious if um if there's the
 
05:50:23.510 --> 05:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
option of going to another retirement
 
05:50:24.770 --> 05:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
fund what that does to the current
 
05:50:26.990 --> 05:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
retirement fund does it put it more at
 
05:50:29.030 --> 05:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
risk it seems like it would
 
05:50:29.040 --> 05:50:30.410 align:start position:0%
risk it seems like it would
okay

05:50:30.410 --> 05:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:50:32.208 --> 05:50:32.218 align:start position:0%
I believe we we'd probably have to check
 
05:50:34.128 --> 05:50:34.138 align:start position:0%
out with the retirement system I I would
 
05:50:36.170 --> 05:50:36.180 align:start position:0%
assume that it would but we would have
 
05:50:37.910 --> 05:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
to check with them
 
05:50:39.530 --> 05:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
oh they they could be moving from
 
05:50:41.990 --> 05:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
retired contribution to
 
05:50:44.750 --> 05:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
move from repair
 
05:50:49.970 --> 05:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:51.708 --> 05:50:51.718 align:start position:0%
specified benefits defined benefit
 
05:50:54.770 --> 05:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
defined contribution benefit to Define
 
05:50:57.048 --> 05:50:57.058 align:start position:0%
contribution a minute
 
05:50:59.750 --> 05:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
which seem smart to do that
 
05:50:59.760 --> 05:51:00.890 align:start position:0%
which seem smart to do that
yeah

05:51:00.890 --> 05:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:51:03.650 --> 05:51:03.660 align:start position:0%
if anything that move in the long term
 
05:51:06.890 --> 05:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
will decrease the amount of fund spent
 
05:51:09.830 --> 05:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
because again defined benefit plans ends
 
05:51:11.570 --> 05:51:11.580 align:start position:0%
up costing more than the defined
 
05:51:14.990 --> 05:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
contribution plans in the short term if
 
05:51:16.910 --> 05:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
we take people who are going to end up
 
05:51:18.830 --> 05:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
in the retirement system and put them
 
05:51:21.590 --> 05:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
into a non-state retirement system then
 
05:51:23.330 --> 05:51:23.340 align:start position:0%
here's the number of people going into
 
05:51:26.090 --> 05:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
the retirement system will be lower but
 
05:51:28.548 --> 05:51:28.558 align:start position:0%
also our liability for the people we are
 
05:51:31.610 --> 05:51:31.620 align:start position:0%
putting in will be even lower than that
 
05:51:34.010 --> 05:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
so in the short term we'll have to move
 
05:51:36.530 --> 05:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
money from one pocket to another to pay
 
05:51:38.570 --> 05:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
for the retirement system but in the
 
05:51:41.270 --> 05:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
long term this will save money and also
 
05:51:44.150 --> 05:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
give those people you know a lot of
 
05:51:46.430 --> 05:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
comfort in terms of they know exactly
 
05:51:47.990 --> 05:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
what they put in and what's theirs and
 
05:51:49.368 --> 05:51:49.378 align:start position:0%
so on
 
05:51:53.628 --> 05:51:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:57.230 --> 05:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
so that we could take action on this
 
05:52:01.190 --> 05:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:04.128 --> 05:52:04.138 align:start position:0%
I don't know what it is so I'm I just
 
05:52:06.350 --> 05:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
made it up we're happy to get back to
 
05:52:08.570 --> 05:52:08.580 align:start position:0%
you with some answers on on that
 
05:52:10.548 --> 05:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
um we we have others in the office who
 
05:52:12.350 --> 05:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
who are sort of experts in this so we
 
05:52:13.610 --> 05:52:13.620 align:start position:0%
can we can get back to you with it with
 
05:52:15.288 --> 05:52:15.298 align:start position:0%
a good answer on that and we had Shannon
 
05:52:16.490 --> 05:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
in here this morning so we could have
 
05:52:20.270 --> 05:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:22.128 --> 05:52:22.138 align:start position:0%
maybe she'll be back Monday we'll we'll
 
05:52:26.628 --> 05:52:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:29.810 --> 05:52:29.820 align:start position:0%
so so doesn't doesn't this put the
 
05:52:31.970 --> 05:52:31.980 align:start position:0%
community college employees into the
 
05:52:33.470 --> 05:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
state retirement system or it's a
 
05:52:35.150 --> 05:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
completely different system
 
05:52:40.250 --> 05:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:42.650 --> 05:52:42.660 align:start position:0%
if if no it doesn't take a current
 
05:52:45.110 --> 05:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
employee out it takes people who are
 
05:52:48.170 --> 05:52:48.180 align:start position:0%
hired after this start date yeah
 
05:52:50.930 --> 05:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
yeah it says hired after January 24
 
05:52:50.940 --> 05:52:55.310 align:start position:0%
yeah it says hired after January 24
right

05:52:55.310 --> 05:52:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:55.320 --> 05:52:56.570 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:52:56.570 --> 05:52:56.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:53:00.350 --> 05:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
so we'll wait for an explanation just to
 
05:53:02.150 --> 05:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
we're all Insurance experts in
 
05:53:05.750 --> 05:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
retirement experts the next the next set
 
05:53:07.970 --> 05:53:07.980 align:start position:0%
would be page three so we do have a lot
 
05:53:10.670 --> 05:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
of open requests from agencies
 
05:53:10.680 --> 05:53:11.570 align:start position:0%
of open requests from agencies
um

05:53:11.570 --> 05:53:11.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:12.948 --> 05:53:12.958 align:start position:0%
I don't know if any of those questions
 
05:53:15.530 --> 05:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
that you'd like to present to the
 
05:53:16.850 --> 05:53:16.860 align:start position:0%
governor's office they're still all
 
05:53:19.490 --> 05:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
pending none of them are necessarily
 
05:53:21.350 --> 05:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
required or tied to House Bill 2 in any
 
05:53:24.830 --> 05:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
way these are just mainly the additional
 
05:53:26.930 --> 05:53:26.940 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs that were presented
 
05:53:37.030 --> 05:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:40.548 --> 05:53:40.558 align:start position:0%
yeah I I what I would say is you know we
 
05:53:43.368 --> 05:53:43.378 align:start position:0%
we paired we paired hp2 and HP one back
 
05:53:45.708 --> 05:53:45.718 align:start position:0%
to to what we thought was the most
 
05:53:45.718 --> 05:53:47.270 align:start position:0%
to to what we thought was the most
appropriate

05:53:47.270 --> 05:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
05:53:49.010 --> 05:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
um and if there are additional needs
 
05:53:50.810 --> 05:53:50.820 align:start position:0%
above and beyond that I think it would
 
05:53:53.270 --> 05:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
be up to the agencies to to answer those
 
05:53:55.430 --> 05:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
specific questions uh more adequately
 
05:53:57.770 --> 05:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
than than us but uh if there's something
 
05:53:59.448 --> 05:53:59.458 align:start position:0%
specific in there that you want more
 
05:54:00.890 --> 05:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
answers to I'm sure I can get an answer
 
05:54:02.208 --> 05:54:02.218 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly
 
05:54:03.708 --> 05:54:03.718 align:start position:0%
um you know within the next 24 hours or
 
05:54:03.718 --> 05:54:08.090 align:start position:0%
um you know within the next 24 hours or
so

05:54:08.090 --> 05:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:11.570 --> 05:54:11.580 align:start position:0%
well we don't know where we are so it's
 
05:54:13.250 --> 05:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
kind of tough to say we can spend this
 
05:54:15.830 --> 05:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
and we're going to spend that
 
05:54:19.730 --> 05:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
this looks to me like the 11th Hour
 
05:54:22.070 --> 05:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
consideration of all the these extra
 
05:54:24.590 --> 05:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
requests are kind of like the last dish
 
05:54:27.230 --> 05:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
yeah and it's and it's possible so the
 
05:54:29.448 --> 05:54:29.458 align:start position:0%
and I'm unsure
 
05:54:30.830 --> 05:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
I think most of these would have been
 
05:54:32.750 --> 05:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
presented to the governor governor's
 
05:54:35.090 --> 05:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
office when crafting their budget and
 
05:54:37.128 --> 05:54:37.138 align:start position:0%
didn't make it so I'd say these would be
 
05:54:38.690 --> 05:54:38.700 align:start position:0%
decisions that
 
05:54:39.948 --> 05:54:39.958 align:start position:0%
um for the most part there's a couple
 
05:54:43.310 --> 05:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
new requests uh for instance uh you know
 
05:54:44.570 --> 05:54:44.580 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the fish and game
 
05:54:46.190 --> 05:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
requests that they recently came forward
 
05:54:47.628 --> 05:54:47.638 align:start position:0%
with right
 
05:54:49.250 --> 05:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
um that would have probably been
 
05:54:50.628 --> 05:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
discussed during the governor's budget
 
05:54:52.910 --> 05:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure what happened there
 
05:54:54.288 --> 05:54:54.298 align:start position:0%
um and we did
 
05:54:56.810 --> 05:54:56.820 align:start position:0%
uh I'm trying to remember there was one
 
05:54:58.610 --> 05:54:58.620 align:start position:0%
other late request so I went for doe but
 
05:55:01.910 --> 05:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:03.288 --> 05:55:03.298 align:start position:0%
so these are The Cutting Room floor
 
05:55:03.298 --> 05:55:05.330 align:start position:0%
so these are The Cutting Room floor
items

05:55:05.330 --> 05:55:05.340 align:start position:0%
items
 
05:55:07.548 --> 05:55:07.558 align:start position:0%
uh some of them some of them we've seen
 
05:55:09.770 --> 05:55:09.780 align:start position:0%
before some of them uh you know I think
 
05:55:11.628 --> 05:55:11.638 align:start position:0%
are probably new requests making Mickey
 
05:55:11.638 --> 05:55:13.310 align:start position:0%
are probably new requests making Mickey
mention

05:55:13.310 --> 05:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
mention
 
05:55:15.830 --> 05:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
um my my sense is the the agencies would
 
05:55:18.288 --> 05:55:18.298 align:start position:0%
be best to answer those just because uh
 
05:55:19.788 --> 05:55:19.798 align:start position:0%
I don't have all the all the details
 
05:55:22.310 --> 05:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
behind all of them uh in front of me so
 
05:55:24.048 --> 05:55:24.058 align:start position:0%
but if there's again if there's a
 
05:55:25.970 --> 05:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
specific one or a few that you want
 
05:55:28.368 --> 05:55:28.378 align:start position:0%
answers to feel free to reach me I'll be
 
05:55:29.570 --> 05:55:29.580 align:start position:0%
working over the weekend and I can get
 
05:55:33.830 --> 05:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:36.770 --> 05:55:36.780 align:start position:0%
it seems right now that we can't do much
 
05:55:39.110 --> 05:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
with this unless until we know what our
 
05:55:40.970 --> 05:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
money is going to be you know this is
 
05:55:43.070 --> 05:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
with safety and transportation
 
05:55:45.530 --> 05:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
um it seems as though we've covered you
 
05:55:47.330 --> 05:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
know the basic budget of these
 
05:55:49.788 --> 05:55:49.798 align:start position:0%
organizations these agencies and this is
 
05:55:51.590 --> 05:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
the above and beyond and once we know if
 
05:55:53.810 --> 05:55:53.820 align:start position:0%
we have any above and beyond we can fill
 
05:55:56.990 --> 05:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
into here well I know we were 88 million
 
05:55:57.000 --> 05:55:58.250 align:start position:0%
into here well I know we were 88 million
dollars

05:55:58.250 --> 05:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:56:00.890 --> 05:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
under in our forecast I'm looking at
 
05:56:02.330 --> 05:56:02.340 align:start position:0%
some of these numbers they're they're
 
05:56:02.340 --> 05:56:03.350 align:start position:0%
some of these numbers they're they're
all

05:56:03.350 --> 05:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
all
 
05:56:07.910 --> 05:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
at least five digits yeah so some of
 
05:56:11.510 --> 05:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
them are six so it's like uh yeah looks
 
05:56:12.650 --> 05:56:12.660 align:start position:0%
like cutting one floor is going to win
 
05:56:12.660 --> 05:56:13.368 align:start position:0%
like cutting one floor is going to win
again

05:56:13.368 --> 05:56:13.378 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:56:15.530 --> 05:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
so we'll head until the first of the
 
05:56:17.868 --> 05:56:17.878 align:start position:0%
week hopefully uh over the weekend we'll
 
05:56:19.250 --> 05:56:19.260 align:start position:0%
have a better sense of where the three
 
05:56:21.110 --> 05:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
divisions are at after work through
 
05:56:24.048 --> 05:56:24.058 align:start position:0%
today and maybe the chair will either
 
05:56:26.208 --> 05:56:26.218 align:start position:0%
allocate targets or something for each
 
05:56:28.190 --> 05:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
division and we'll have a clear pathway
 
05:56:30.590 --> 05:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
Monday okay yeah
 
05:56:33.590 --> 05:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to check we were planning
 
05:56:35.448 --> 05:56:35.458 align:start position:0%
to meet on Saturday or not you've made
 
05:56:37.548 --> 05:56:37.558 align:start position:0%
references to meeting on Monday now so I
 
05:56:38.990 --> 05:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure I'm on the same
 
05:56:41.390 --> 05:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
page I don't know there's much we can do
 
05:56:43.030 --> 05:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
that we haven't done
 
05:56:46.190 --> 05:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
because in that go ahead yeah we don't
 
05:56:47.868 --> 05:56:47.878 align:start position:0%
have anything scheduled for tomorrow and
 
05:56:50.150 --> 05:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
I think there'd be a big coordination
 
05:56:51.708 --> 05:56:51.718 align:start position:0%
effort to get the building open with
 
05:56:54.590 --> 05:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
facilities and security and I.T to
 
05:56:56.090 --> 05:56:56.100 align:start position:0%
stream so I don't think that it was an
 
05:56:57.770 --> 05:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
option at this point so that that's even
 
05:57:00.650 --> 05:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
better so so we're we're back to Monday
 
05:57:03.230 --> 05:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
Monday at 10 o'clock and as you probably
 
05:57:05.750 --> 05:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
all saw uh we have full committee exec
 
05:57:11.628 --> 05:57:11.638 align:start position:0%
session scheduled Monday at one which uh
 
05:57:14.270 --> 05:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
is what it is so we may lose Monday
 
05:57:16.070 --> 05:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
afternoon or most uh we can recess in
 
05:57:17.448 --> 05:57:17.458 align:start position:0%
the morning with the opportunity to come
 
05:57:18.650 --> 05:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
back in the afternoon if you get done
 
05:57:21.048 --> 05:57:21.058 align:start position:0%
quick across the hall but I'm not sure
 
05:57:23.090 --> 05:57:23.100 align:start position:0%
how quick it's going to go we went
 
05:57:26.150 --> 05:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
through uh the last time we execed bills
 
05:57:27.590 --> 05:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
I don't remember how many we had but
 
05:57:30.170 --> 05:57:30.180 align:start position:0%
that that didn't take an hour but most
 
05:57:33.770 --> 05:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:36.170 --> 05:57:36.180 align:start position:0%
well these are all in this all except
 
05:57:38.390 --> 05:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
one are division one we have one one
 
05:57:41.030 --> 05:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
item in there
 
05:57:43.548 --> 05:57:43.558 align:start position:0%
just a quick thing again in terms of how
 
05:57:45.770 --> 05:57:45.780 align:start position:0%
much we are doing
 
05:57:48.110 --> 05:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
23 is in a deficit
 
05:57:51.650 --> 05:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
you know 24 25 in a surplus of 50 with
 
05:57:53.930 --> 05:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
160 million in requests
 
05:57:57.170 --> 05:57:57.180 align:start position:0%
25 sir plus 96 with over 200 million
 
05:57:59.030 --> 05:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
requests so I'm not looking anything
 
05:58:02.030 --> 05:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
that we add we'll have to cut something
 
05:58:05.510 --> 05:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
else from and more so please you know
 
05:58:07.910 --> 05:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind I mean it's we're
 
05:58:09.410 --> 05:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
gonna have to ceiling it ain't gonna be
 
05:58:09.420 --> 05:58:12.770 align:start position:0%
gonna have to ceiling it ain't gonna be
pretty

05:58:12.770 --> 05:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:18.410 --> 05:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:21.890 --> 05:58:21.900 align:start position:0%
yeah we I I think we authorized the
 
05:58:25.250 --> 05:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
General funds to make up the shortfall
 
05:58:34.690 --> 05:58:34.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:37.010 --> 05:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
they do have it for this year there's
 
05:58:39.590 --> 05:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
still a sufficient Surplus uh the
 
05:58:40.910 --> 05:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
question is you know it'd be nice to
 
05:58:42.288 --> 05:58:42.298 align:start position:0%
help them out but it's looking like we
 
05:58:43.670 --> 05:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
might not be able to but they have
 
05:58:46.368 --> 05:58:46.378 align:start position:0%
enough yeah they've got enough to cover
 
05:58:51.110 --> 05:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:54.890 --> 05:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
so so to clarify that request they have
 
05:58:57.048 --> 05:58:57.058 align:start position:0%
the authorization for the positions and
 
05:58:58.670 --> 05:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
the funding it's just they're funded
 
05:59:00.530 --> 05:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
they want to switch the funding from two
 
05:59:02.090 --> 05:59:02.100 align:start position:0%
of them from Fish and Game to General
 
05:59:04.250 --> 05:59:04.260 align:start position:0%
funds so the Surplus statement that you
 
05:59:05.810 --> 05:59:05.820 align:start position:0%
have on page eight of your packet for
 
05:59:08.090 --> 05:59:08.100 align:start position:0%
fishing game presents a four and a half
 
05:59:10.430 --> 05:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
million dollar even Gap adjusted Surplus
 
05:59:12.590 --> 05:59:12.600 align:start position:0%
at the end of the biennium which is a
 
05:59:14.868 --> 05:59:14.878 align:start position:0%
healthy position considering what it was
 
05:59:17.390 --> 05:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
a decade ago it's just you can see going
 
05:59:21.288 --> 05:59:21.298 align:start position:0%
back from 23 to the end of 25. it's uh
 
05:59:23.150 --> 05:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
significantly you know just like highway
 
05:59:24.830 --> 05:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
just like education there's an operating
 
05:59:26.868 --> 05:59:26.878 align:start position:0%
deficit there so we're chipping into the
 
05:59:28.730 --> 05:59:28.740 align:start position:0%
the fund balance to balance this budget
 
05:59:30.650 --> 05:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
they can absorb it they will just say
 
05:59:32.628 --> 05:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
that it probably creates issues moving
 
05:59:32.638 --> 05:59:38.570 align:start position:0%
that it probably creates issues moving
forward

05:59:38.570 --> 05:59:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:40.490 --> 05:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
so they start flying close to the plane
 
05:59:42.910 --> 05:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
but the end of the next way
 
05:59:44.750 --> 05:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
based on the revenues how they're
 
05:59:46.430 --> 05:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
tracking and their expenditures yes I
 
05:59:56.570 --> 05:59:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:00.190 --> 06:00:00.200 align:start position:0%
so I I guess that's about it
 
06:00:02.990 --> 06:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
so we'll recess
 
06:00:04.970 --> 06:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
I'd say at this point recess just in
 
06:00:07.070 --> 06:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
case but we're probably
 
06:00:09.110 --> 06:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
10 o'clock Monday at 10 o'clock but
 
06:00:38.750 --> 06:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:38.760 --> 06:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
foreign
