pieces of information I am a pharmacist

legislature I'm also president of the
 
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Board of Pharmacy um the
 
00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 align:start position:0%
Board of Pharmacy actually this the bill
 
00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 align:start position:0%
that you have before you is actually has
 
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
been requested by the board so I'm
 
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
coming here um uh on behalf of them to
 
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 align:start position:0%
hb142 and uh probably to to to give you
 
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
a little background history of 1042 I've
 
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
Been On The Board of Pharmacy since 2017
 
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
and I'd say it was probably
 
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
201 uh um 19 or so that this bill was
 
00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 align:start position:0%
put in place
 
00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
and to give the premise of what the
 
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
board of Pharmacy does the Board of
 
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy regulates the profession of
 
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy on behalf of the citizens of
 
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we we we regulate the
 
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
profession of Pharmacy to protect the
 
00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 align:start position:0%
public safety of the people of New
 
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so back in 2019 very early in
 
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
my my my tenure on the board um the idea
 
00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
of implementing a mandated continuous
 
00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:28.439 align:start position:0%
quality improvement program um required
 
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
by law for pharmac
 
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 align:start position:0%
was was put forward uh this was put
 
00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:35.439 align:start position:0%
forward by a former board member and a
 
00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
member of the community and it sounded
 
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
great it uh who wouldn't think that
 
00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 align:start position:0%
continuous quality improvement would be
 
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
a good thing and you know just to
 
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
reiterate that's our goal is quality in
 
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy it's our goal to to to to
 
00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 align:start position:0%
improve and protect safety uh in the
 
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 align:start position:0%
state however as the program has rolled
 
00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 align:start position:0%
out and and been
 
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
implemented we at theard board have uh
 
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
understood that there are many problems
 
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
the way the bill is written um the
 
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
reality is this is really a best
 
00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 align:start position:0%
practices function uh as a as as a
 
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 align:start position:0%
health care professional we're always
 
00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
looking to improve our our quality we're
 
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
all are always looking to improve the
 
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
the way we deliver our quality um but
 
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
when you stick something in legislature
 
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 align:start position:0%
in black and white in in law that can't
 
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 align:start position:0%
evolve the way a best practices can
 
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
evolve and that's what we're finding now
 
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
that the law says you have to do
 
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
something a certain way but the reality
 
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
is we're all doing this in our practice
 
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
but we're doing it in the form that fits
 
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 align:start position:0%
best in 2014 2024 not 2019 so the uh the
 
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
law is
 
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
Antiquated um furthermore it puts it
 
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
codifies something again that we are
 
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
doing anyway I think there's a lot of
 
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
healthc Care Professionals around this
 
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
table right now uh there there's not one
 
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
of us I venture to say that has not been
 
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
involved in a quality related event uh
 
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
we're human we we there's there's
 
00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 align:start position:0%
there's variables that happen every day
 
00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 align:start position:0%
that we can't predict and things happen
 
00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 align:start position:0%
but I venture to say that no one has
 
00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 align:start position:0%
ever found themselves an a quality
 
00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
related event and then continued on as
 
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
if nothing happened and bowled through
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh that's just not what we do it's not
 
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
we as health professionals don't do that
 
00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 align:start position:0%
we look to improve we look to to to make
 
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
things better but if you look at the law
 
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.189 align:start position:0%
things better but if you look at the law
is

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
written people partaking in this cqi
 
00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
program could wait up to three months to
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
do something about some about a quality
 
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
related event so it just doesn't reflect
 
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
what's going on in uh in practice um add
 
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
this to the fact that the the current
 
00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
law is very granular it it steps out it
 
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
it puts
 
00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 align:start position:0%
forward a stepbystep manual on how this
 
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
process is supposed to uh take place and
 
00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
again that is not I think I've
 
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
highlighted the point that's just not
 
00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
practical in today's um delivery of
 
00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy the reality is Pharmacy in New
 
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and and this is this is
 
00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 align:start position:0%
not an extens exhaustive list but we
 
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 align:start position:0%
have Community retail pharmacies which
 
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
we all see on every corner we have
 
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 align:start position:0%
Hospital pharmacies we have long-term
 
00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
care pharmacies we have home infusion
 
00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 align:start position:0%
pharmacies we have specialty pharmacies
 
00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:30.039 align:start position:0%
which was my background we have uh
 
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
um nuclear pharmacies we have mail order
 
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
pharmacies and we have pharmacies that
 
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
are in freestanding emergency rooms
 
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
that's just in New Hampshire so to say
 
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 align:start position:0%
one size fits all for a quality
 
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
continuous quality improvement uh um uh
 
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
program it's just not it's just not
 
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
practical um I'm going to coming to the
 
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
end of my my discussion here but when
 
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
looking at how our profession compares
 
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
to others because I as I mentioned we
 
00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
have nurses we have Physicians around
 
00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:02.199 align:start position:0%
this table we have EMTs in our in our
 
00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:04.599 align:start position:0%
legislature and I wanted to see how
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy compares to other uh
 
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
professions as far as safety and quality
 
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.070 align:start position:0%
professions as far as safety and quality
improvement

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
improvement
 
00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
um I counted on the oplc website which
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
oplc these professions are under uh oplc
 
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360 align:start position:0%
21 professions everything from
 
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.360 align:start position:0%
acupuncture to dentists to nurses to
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
naturopathic doctors podiatrists even
 
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
veterinarians 21 pract professions do
 
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
not have something as prescriptive as as
 
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
we have in our law um medicine has
 
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800 align:start position:0%
something uh it looked like but it
 
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
looked like that was more of an
 
00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:38.919 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary approach to Quality
 
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
whereas this is so going out extending
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
my search a little bit further I said
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
well maybe healthc care is not the only
 
00:07:46.749 --> 00:07:46.759 align:start position:0%
thing that has to do with safety I mean
 
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
nobody would want to be in a in a
 
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
building that was structurally unsafe so
 
00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919 align:start position:0%
I looked at Str Engineers electricians
 
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
and architext nothing nothing like like
 
00:07:57.869 --> 00:07:57.879 align:start position:0%
this in their laws
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
um pharmac y if you added up the rules
 
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:04.360 align:start position:0%
and laws in Pharmacy Pharmacy has more
 
00:08:06.749 --> 00:08:06.759 align:start position:0%
rules and laws than nursing and Medicine
 
00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
combined and although they're
 
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned in this case it gets in
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
the way we're finding pharmacies that
 
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
are you know having to to to to stop
 
00:08:17.149 --> 00:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
doing what they're doing in order to
 
00:08:19.149 --> 00:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
comply with the law even though they may
 
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
have a better system that their company
 
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
provides them but in order to maintain
 
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:24.280 align:start position:0%
the the essence of the law they have to
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
to to interrupt what they're doing
 
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.830 align:start position:0%
to to interrupt what they're doing
um

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
I did send a letter around this is from
 
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
the Board of Pharmacy kind of highlights
 
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
what we have here uh I think there's a
 
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
lot of people here that have um you know
 
00:08:40.029 --> 00:08:40.039 align:start position:0%
will speak either either will speak or
 
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
or sign in to support uh and uh oh I
 
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
might add when the Board of Pharmacy
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
originally approached me to do this they
 
00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
asked me to strike the entire law off
 
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
the books and um you know and I and I
 
00:08:54.829 --> 00:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
believe in that I I I I I don't think we
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
need that I don't think we need the law
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
because like I said we're doing it as is
 
00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
um every practice site is different
 
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
they're doing it as it fits their
 
00:09:03.949 --> 00:09:03.959 align:start position:0%
practice but I did you know make a
 
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
compromise because I did want to um um
 
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
you know at least recognize the fact
 
00:09:12.069 --> 00:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
that safety is important I don't think
 
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:15.320 align:start position:0%
we need a law to do that so um you know
 
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:17.240 align:start position:0%
I I put in that first paragraph to keep
 
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
the first paragraph but it was the
 
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
board's original intent to strike
 
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
everything so if there's any questions
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer those at this
 
00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:27.320 align:start position:0%
point representative
 
00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:29.480 align:start position:0%
McLean thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so let's say
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
that this were to go away um are
 
00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
pharmacies right now audited by the
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
board as part of maintaining their
 
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
license and do you know if continuous
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
quality improvement is part of that
 
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
audit structure so this log goes away
 
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
there's still something in place with
 
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
the board that contains a quality
 
00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
improvement component yeah that's a
 
00:09:52.829 --> 00:09:52.839 align:start position:0%
that's a good question I appreciate that
 
00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
question and yes pharmacies in the state
 
00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire are are inspected
 
00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
routinely um and and uh up to depending
 
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
on it's risk-based but up to depending
 
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
what they're doing twice a year uh
 
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
depending on the risk based my Pharmacy
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
was always visited once a year um um you
 
00:10:12.269 --> 00:10:12.279 align:start position:0%
know and and I think it's important to
 
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:15.160 align:start position:0%
understand how New Hampshire treats that
 
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
I've got colleagues in Vermont
 
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania New York that have never
 
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
seen an inspector ever once and we're in
 
00:10:26.829 --> 00:10:26.839 align:start position:0%
our we're in the stores routinely
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
regularly um and that is part of the the
 
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to also tell you something too
 
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.069 align:start position:0%
I'm going to also tell you something too
and

00:10:33.069 --> 00:10:33.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:35.720 align:start position:0%
uh reluctant to maybe admit this but I
 
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
will so this continuous quality
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
improvement is part of the inspection so
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
if you look at the law and I and I the
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
whole law it's pretty it's pretty bland
 
00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
it's pretty vanilla so um you know if
 
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
there's a mistake the board can't take
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's caught in the cqi program the
 
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
board can't uh um uh take an action on
 
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
the mistake stake that's in within the
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
cqi program they're protected from that
 
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
you don't want to punish somebody for
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
for being truthful uh that's our and
 
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's consistent along around
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
the industry so really what the
 
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:13.240 align:start position:0%
inspectors are looking at is are you
 
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
doing it and that really is all they
 
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
have really to look at is and it have
 
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
you have you taken minutes or is there
 
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
an agenda um to do that so it's really
 
00:11:23.629 --> 00:11:23.639 align:start position:0%
do you have a piece of paper that says
 
00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
you've done it and anybody could reality
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
is could check off you know a paper that
 
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
that that shows compliance and that
 
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
really is they could comply with that um
 
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
so and and yeah
 
00:11:39.389 --> 00:11:39.399 align:start position:0%
so that's a two-part of question yes
 
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
we're being inspected regularly
 
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
routinely more than any other states and
 
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh they are being checked on that
 
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
followup so and just to qu and just to
 
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
confirm that that cqi auditing is
 
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
happened even before the law so that's
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
not that's being done by the regulatory
 
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
body not by the state State like ISO we
 
00:12:01.949 --> 00:12:01.959 align:start position:0%
have independent Auditors independent
 
00:12:02.829 --> 00:12:02.839 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
law so this is something even without
 
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
the law this would be happening so even
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
without the law there are certain
 
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
standards that have to be followed is
 
00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
your you know do you have a clean are
 
00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
you recordkeeping are you training are
 
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
you are you cleaning are you making sure
 
00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:19.839 align:start position:0%
the drugs are not outdated that you have
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
on on the on the shelves are the people
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
who you hire adequately trained and
 
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
certified into they meet that yes that's
 
00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
been going on since the Advent of uh but
 
00:12:33.069 --> 00:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
this is you know tracking and tracing
 
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
and things that uh a little bit but I
 
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
want to add most companies if not all
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
companies have a cqi program outside of
 
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
the law that is specific to their
 
00:12:46.509 --> 00:12:46.519 align:start position:0%
company into their training not only do
 
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
companies have it but many insurers
 
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
require payers require this as well but
 
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
the difference is it's Unique to their
 
00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
practice setting so you know a CVS to
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
use their on on the corner is not going
 
00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:03.079 align:start position:0%
to be required to do sterile compounding
 
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
cqi program U because it's not Germaine
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
to their practice so it's it's the
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
things that are out there in 2024 are
 
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:11.320 align:start position:0%
much better than than than the
 
00:13:13.389 --> 00:13:13.399 align:start position:0%
law representative
 
00:13:15.629 --> 00:13:15.639 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:13:17.189 --> 00:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and I'm hoping
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
for a very short answer to this question
 
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
because we're almost behind I'm already
 
00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:24.839 align:start position:0%
and there other people waiting to talk
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
but what I want to know it's sort of the
 
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
flip side of Representative cl's
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
question uh you talked about the number
 
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
of rules that are promulgated with
 
00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:37.399 align:start position:0%
respect to pharmacies do you know of any
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
rules that are operate that are
 
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
connected directly to this statute which
 
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
might then be rescinded because of the
 
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
statute if you know and if that's not
 
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
your field that's fine so no it is our
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
it is we do have so there are rules that
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
are directly related to this that will
 
00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
be rescinded to this but there are other
 
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:01.240 align:start position:0%
quality related rules that are not
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
related to this that will remain that's
 
00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
exactly what I wanted to know thank you
 
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant and then
 
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
representative Sho thank you Mr chairman
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
also thank you representative roach for
 
00:14:16.749 --> 00:14:16.759 align:start position:0%
being here to testify um I would like to
 
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
have you look at the letter from the
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
Board of Pharmacy in bold italics on the
 
00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:25.839 align:start position:0%
third paragraph furthermore the New
 
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Board of Pharmacy has not
 
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
documented one case where the say has
 
00:14:31.389 --> 00:14:31.399 align:start position:0%
improved quality of prevented
 
00:14:34.829 --> 00:14:34.839 align:start position:0%
errors is that I appreciate you pointing
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
that out that was on my notes to talk
 
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
about and I didn't but absolutely that's
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
then that's that's the that's the the
 
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
Nexus of this is the far Board of
 
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy can't prove or show that this
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
program has improved quality or
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
prevented errors or or made things more
 
00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
safe than than than they were prior to
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Shapiro
 
00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:01.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
taking this question can you for those
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
of us who are not involved in Pharmacy
 
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
can you give an example of a situation
 
00:15:11.949 --> 00:15:11.959 align:start position:0%
that might arise where this statute
 
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:15.519 align:start position:0%
being overly prescriptive caused a
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
problem yeah I can
 
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
so uh a patient comes in for a blood
 
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
pressure medicine and it gets filled um
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
with a blood thinner big problem I mean
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
huge you know the Physicians here
 
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
understand that could be a big problem
 
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
or or or so the wrong drug in the wrong
 
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
bottle the way the law is written I mean
 
00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:37.519 align:start position:0%
that that's something that should be
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
rectified immediately and that's
 
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
something that the root cause should be
 
00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:43.160 align:start position:0%
determined at the moment that it is
 
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
discovered as the law is written you
 
00:15:47.069 --> 00:15:47.079 align:start position:0%
could wait three months to look into
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
that so I don't think that the the law
 
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
is reflective of the practice um so
 
00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's one of the problems
 
00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
that we have the other problem that we
 
00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
have is is you know Define what is a cqi
 
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
is it a near miss so so the the drong
 
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
got drug got in the bottle but the
 
00:16:08.189 --> 00:16:08.199 align:start position:0%
pharmacist found it before it went out
 
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
is that well obviously that's depending
 
00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
that it could be it's it's not really
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
clear in the law of what that you know
 
00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
is that does that qualify because
 
00:16:18.749 --> 00:16:18.759 align:start position:0%
clearly the pharmacist did their job and
 
00:16:21.309 --> 00:16:21.319 align:start position:0%
stopped it but somebody could say well
 
00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:23.759 align:start position:0%
there was a problem up up above but the
 
00:16:28.749 --> 00:16:28.759 align:start position:0%
reality is all this we have a duty as a
 
00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
professional to ensure that mistakes are
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
fixed and followed up and we have a duty
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
to to to do quality work um regardless
 
00:16:39.629 --> 00:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
of what the law says so to make us do
 
00:16:41.949 --> 00:16:41.959 align:start position:0%
our duty and then follow this rigid
 
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
thing that may not be germine to to how
 
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to that's that's why we're
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
here representative
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
TZ thank you and uh thank you for taking
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
my question um in healthc care uh
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
hospitals and Medical Practice settings
 
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:01.240 align:start position:0%
right now CMS is issuing a lot of
 
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
mandates that are really incentivizing
 
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
or you know creating Behavior change and
 
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
practice change as far as um uh the
 
00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
these kinds of things you know
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
regulatory things uh is there anything
 
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
similar in the pharmacy world that maybe
 
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:20.959 align:start position:0%
an accreditor or a funer is uh requiring
 
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:25.480 align:start position:0%
quality improvement yes so um CMS you
 
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
know Joint Commission you know the the
 
00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:28.919 align:start position:0%
crediting body
 
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
all you in the reality is in order to
 
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
get paid now for pharmacy it's becoming
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
more and more likely you're going to
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
have to be accredited by somebody um uh
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
and that's the whole point of
 
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:41.240 align:start position:0%
accreditation is quality and and quality
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
assurance and the benefit of
 
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
accreditation is they can move their
 
00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:47.799 align:start position:0%
standards much more quickly than if you
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
try to put something in law I mean we
 
00:17:51.789 --> 00:17:51.799 align:start position:0%
all know that we're always chasing that
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
as as legislators are always chasing
 
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:55.240 align:start position:0%
something the accrediting body that
 
00:17:56.669 --> 00:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to go through this process
 
00:17:59.230 --> 00:17:59.240 align:start position:0%
can can move much quicker respond much
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
more nimbly and do a better job at
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
addressing really issues in
 
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
safety other questions representative
 
00:18:09.549 --> 00:18:09.559 align:start position:0%
Lon thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
for presenting this um if so my question
 
00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
is in the Remain the part that's
 
00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
retained it continues to say that this
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
program is non-ua and seeks to identify
 
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
weaknesses and processes and systems um
 
00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:23.480 align:start position:0%
my question would be if it actually be
 
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
more beneficial to repeal thatc the
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
entire chapter because while the intent
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
is not to be punitive um doesn't that
 
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
tie your hands if there is some Pharmacy
 
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
that continues operating and is just
 
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:37.240 align:start position:0%
throwing caution to the wind and not
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
doing it appropriately would it make
 
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
more sense to repeal the whole thing
 
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
well as I said that was the initial
 
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
desire of the Board of Pharmacy is to
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
real peel the whole thing uh we don't
 
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
feel that you know I felt like uh um
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
going forward I just want to underscore
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
our point of Pharmacy Board is safety so
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
I don't want to misre represent or
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
represent that we are not concerned
 
00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:03.799 align:start position:0%
about safety however if we repealed
 
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
paragraph one I don't think the safety
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire would be compromised at
 
00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:12.039 align:start position:0%
all other
 
00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none thank you
 
00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:23.430 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none thank you
thank

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
minutes good morning Mr chairman and
 
00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:51.559 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
my name is Kathy bizar thumberg I'm the

Executive Vice President New Hampshire
 
00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association representing the
 
00:19:58.909 --> 00:19:58.919 align:start position:0%
state's cute care hospitals and specialy
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
hospitals in the state I am here today
 
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
to testify in support of House Bill 1042
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
our hospitals take great pride in the
 
00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
work that they do every day in support
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
of the patients that they serve part of
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
that work is continuously reviewing
 
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
their quality of care and services
 
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
provided and that they are delivered
 
00:20:18.909 --> 00:20:18.919 align:start position:0%
consistently consistently accurately and
 
00:20:21.149 --> 00:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
professionally Hospital pharmacies do
 
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
utilize continuous quality improvement
 
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799 align:start position:0%
or cqi protocols that are integrated
 
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
with our Hospital's overall quality
 
00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:30.039 align:start position:0%
improvement programs we support the
 
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
removal of the specific requirements of
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
Hospital uh Pharmacy specific cqi
 
00:20:37.149 --> 00:20:37.159 align:start position:0%
program and the reporting of summarized
 
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
reports to the Board of
 
00:20:41.149 --> 00:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy these details of the program
 
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
and the statute were redundant and
 
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
unnecessary since Hospital pharmacies
 
00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
already incorporate their work in
 
00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
hospital operations and overall cqi
 
00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
programs I would suggest however that if
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
the first part of the statute remains
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
that another part of the statute should
 
00:20:58.510 --> 00:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
also stay in place to ensure sure that
 
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:00.440 align:start position:0%
these types of programs remain
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
confidential and then in my handout in
 
00:21:07.149 --> 00:21:07.159 align:start position:0%
my testimony I did note um for RSA 318
 
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:11.480 align:start position:0%
45a paragraph 6 cqi programs shall be
 
00:21:13.549 --> 00:21:13.559 align:start position:0%
confidential and continuous quality
 
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
improvement records shall be considered
 
00:21:17.549 --> 00:21:17.559 align:start position:0%
peer-review documents and not subject to
 
00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799 align:start position:0%
Discovery in civil or administrative
 
00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:22.360 align:start position:0%
actions the reason for this is because
 
00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
CQ programs are important because they
 
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
promote a culture of openness and Trust
 
00:21:29.549 --> 00:21:29.559 align:start position:0%
in reporting errors near misses or other
 
00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:32.039 align:start position:0%
issues with the goal of finding areas of
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
improvement without fear of reprisal cqi
 
00:21:37.269 --> 00:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
programs often must include sensitive
 
00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
information related to Patient Care and
 
00:21:41.789 --> 00:21:41.799 align:start position:0%
keeping this information confidential is
 
00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799 align:start position:0%
essential to the privacy and security of
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
the individual overall C cry programs
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
focus on Improvement and not blame so
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
for that um consideration I do wish that
 
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
the committee support 1042 with the
 
00:21:58.029 --> 00:21:58.039 align:start position:0%
consideration of this uh proposed amend
 
00:22:00.669 --> 00:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment be happy to answer any
 
00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you representative
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
Weber just to be clear I I understand
 
00:22:09.789 --> 00:22:09.799 align:start position:0%
your concerns about keeping the
 
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
confidentiality issues um am I to
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
understand from your testimony that you
 
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
would be equally okay if we repealed the
 
00:22:18.669 --> 00:22:18.679 align:start position:0%
whole thing so I did speak to the
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor about that um I think it does
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
make sense that if they do repeal the
 
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
entire statute that um we're okay with
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
that um because Hospital pharmacies as I
 
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned do integrate their cqi
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
programs within Hospital overall
 
00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:35.720 align:start position:0%
operations they do also have
 
00:22:38.269 --> 00:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
confidentiality Provisions there as well
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
but if we were going to keep something
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
separate for pharmacy in the pharmacy
 
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039 align:start position:0%
statute I think it would have been
 
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate to keep it there as well but
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
I think we're okay with the overall
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
repeal and and just as a followup to
 
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
that and and the hospitals have
 
00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
accreditation in programs and and many
 
00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
compliance overseers Absolut that will
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
require this is that correct absolutely
 
00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:01.559 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Leon um thank
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:23:05.549 --> 00:23:05.559 align:start position:0%
bringing this issue to our attention um
 
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:07.400 align:start position:0%
without this law at all is there a
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
challenge that any um other regulatory
 
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:11.480 align:start position:0%
bers bodies the payers the federal
 
00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
government may try and violate that try
 
00:23:15.549 --> 00:23:15.559 align:start position:0%
and uh reach through that
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
confidentiality and would we need to
 
00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:19.640 align:start position:0%
proactively protect um these programs
 
00:23:20.909 --> 00:23:20.919 align:start position:0%
whether through this bill or something
 
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
else I don't believe so I think we
 
00:23:24.029 --> 00:23:24.039 align:start position:0%
already have that current
 
00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:26.039 align:start position:0%
confidentiality in place for other uh
 
00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:28.919 align:start position:0%
cqi programs so as long as pharmacies
 
00:23:31.549 --> 00:23:31.559 align:start position:0%
fold in uh with other um existing
 
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
programs I think we're okay I will
 
00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
verify that but I think we're fine thank
 
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:38.440 align:start position:0%
you other
 
00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:40.919 align:start position:0%
questions okay I'm saying none thank you
 
00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:43.070 align:start position:0%

act which is uh relative to the
 
00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
commission on the primary care Workforce
 
00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:51.320 align:start position:0%
in the State Office of rural Health um I
 
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
believe I gave everybody a copy of my
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
written testimony so I am not going to
 
00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
read the entire thing I'll probably try
 
00:25:00.269 --> 00:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
to summarize um the first page entirely
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
goes over the um uh alphabet soup word
 
00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:06.200 align:start position:0%
acronym of all the various entities in
 
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
play here uh and I just wanted to try to
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
Briefly summarize some of the historical
 
00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
timetable behind each of these uh back
 
00:25:14.799 --> 00:25:16.990 align:start position:0%
timetable behind each of these uh back
in

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
2008 the State Office of rural Health s
 
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:23.240 align:start position:0%
o r was created it sits under the
 
00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
section of rural health and primary care
 
00:25:30.269 --> 00:25:30.279 align:start position:0%
rhpc which is also Al part of
 
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
DHHS um the the intent of the um State
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
Office of rural Health was really to
 
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
seek long-term solutions to the
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
challenge of rural Health Care
 
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
particularly in um uh undeserved areas
 
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
and with a focus on Primary Care
 
00:25:49.389 --> 00:25:49.399 align:start position:0%
specifically um subsequently back in
 
00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
2010 House Bill 1692 then authorized the
 
00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
S the State Office of rural Health to
 
00:25:58.389 --> 00:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
create the
 
00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
uh professional Data Center
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
hpdc and that was to collect uh data
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
organizing and regarding the state's
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
Primary Care
 
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
Workforce uh it was with the intent of
 
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
not only understanding the primary care
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
force today uh but also to understand
 
00:26:17.149 --> 00:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
and try to predict what would be needed
 
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
in the future and to basically try to um
 
00:26:24.029 --> 00:26:24.039 align:start position:0%
um uh serve as a bellweather of what
 
00:26:25.389 --> 00:26:25.399 align:start position:0%
primary care would look like in the
 
00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
state particularly in Rural and
 
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
undeserved areas
 
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
that statute also
 
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
created the commission on Primary Care
 
00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
Workforce uh of which I'm a member and
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
um uh and it's uh and it's their duty to
 
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
basically take the information and try
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
to understand Primary Care uh in the
 
00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:47.240 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire so if you go to
 
00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:49.159 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the first page it also
 
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
speaks to the oplc I think we all know
 
00:26:53.549 --> 00:26:53.559 align:start position:0%
that is the office of professional
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
license insurance certification which uh
 
00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
was um uh first brought brought onto the
 
00:27:00.269 --> 00:27:00.279 align:start position:0%
scene about 10 years ago and they
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
basically provide the administrative
 
00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
support for over 50 uh Professional
 
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
Licensing boards councils and
 
00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
commissions um they can oplc collects
 
00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
data regularly um for from the
 
00:27:16.029 --> 00:27:16.039 align:start position:0%
applicants for these um surveys and for
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
the lure and is directly uh reports to
 
00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:21.320 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy could I interrupt
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
a moment you seem to be microphone sorry
 
00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
you seem to be referencing your
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
testimony and I don't have a copy of
 
00:27:30.909 --> 00:27:30.919 align:start position:0%
your testimony has that been handed out
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
it was I gave you one handed out
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
yesterday oh okay sorry I'll give you
 
00:27:36.029 --> 00:27:36.039 align:start position:0%
one tomorrow I'll give you one I have
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
another one for you sure I have and if
 
00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
anybody else does not have what I
 
00:27:40.669 --> 00:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
thought I gave them to most people as
 
00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039 align:start position:0%
well so so that's the first page and
 
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
it's really the acronyms and all the
 
00:27:46.029 --> 00:27:46.039 align:start position:0%
historical background to all the
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
different players um regarding this so
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
what is why this bill that we need today
 
00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
first it's to as we regularly do we um
 
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
extend the commission so we want to
 
00:27:59.070 --> 00:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
extend the role of the commission for
 
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
Primary Care um Workforce to continue to
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
do their work it's also to um help oplc
 
00:28:11.789 --> 00:28:11.799 align:start position:0%
and the um office of um uh rural Health
 
00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:15.039 align:start position:0%
um share information so that they can
 
00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
basically dig deep into the into the
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
information and really understand
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
through this information what the
 
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
primary care Force looks
 
00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:26.430 align:start position:0%
primary care Force looks
like

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
the and why why are we doing this it's
 
00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
because as we all know Primary Care is
 
00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:34.120 align:start position:0%
taking a terrible spiral uh throughout
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
the country and regionally um we have
 
00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
members in our committee that are in
 
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
primary care and I think all of us
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
recognize that Primary Care is um
 
00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
really the the number of primary care
 
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
providers is dropping off substantially
 
00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
such that you see regularly articles in
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
the paper on the news about people that
 
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
can't access uh or get access to good
 
00:28:56.909 --> 00:28:56.919 align:start position:0%
health care because they don't have a
 
00:28:59.389 --> 00:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
primary care care provider what is your
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
alternative if they don't have a primary
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
care provider they can either not get
 
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
care we know that's not good or they can
 
00:29:06.269 --> 00:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
go to emergency room which is very
 
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
expensive care and it's usually when
 
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
it's um an issue that's failly far down
 
00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.430 align:start position:0%
it's um an issue that's failly far down
the

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
road that doesn't really help with um
 
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
the continuity or the quality of
 
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
healthare and actually increases
 
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
morbidity mortality and cost throughout
 
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.070 align:start position:0%
morbidity mortality and cost throughout
the

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
system why do I care so much about this
 
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
because access is such an important part
 
00:29:28.269 --> 00:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
of healthcare access access to Primary
 
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
Care to Specialists to whomever but
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
access is important access can be
 
00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
compromised in a number of ways it can
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
be compromised by a pandemic people just
 
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
don't get go to see anybody in
 
00:29:41.509 --> 00:29:41.519 align:start position:0%
healthcare Health Care can be or access
 
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
can be compromised by insurances well
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
that's another subject altogether but
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
Primary Care access or the lack of
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
primary care access is really what we're
 
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
talking about today and trying to
 
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
understand Primary Care access in the
 
00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
state is critical itical to
 
00:29:59.470 --> 00:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
understanding healthare as is delivered
 
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
in the state so probably nothing serves
 
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
better than a good clinical examples you
 
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
know um why is access important if
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
somebody is having chronic headaches and
 
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:13.640 align:start position:0%
they're severe headaches and they don't
 
00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
seek care they may just have a migraine
 
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
or they may just have a headache from
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
stresses of the day but they also may be
 
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
in a hypertensive crisis and what is
 
00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
that if they're not treated if they
 
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
don't go to see somebody if they they
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
end up in an emergency maybe too late
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
maybe the only once they stroke or they
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
have a stroke that they actually do
 
00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
present so Primary Care access is very
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
important most of people's interactions
 
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
with the healthc care profession are
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
oftentimes through their primary care
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
provider um I I don't know the exact
 
00:30:45.149 --> 00:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
percentage I would anticipate that's a
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
huge number or a large percentage of
 
00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:51.640 align:start position:0%
visits um that patients have are to
 
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
their Primary Care to get their
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
medication straightened out to get their
 
00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
um referrals for uh preventative care so
 
00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
without Primary Care who's going to make
 
00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
the referral for their routine mamogram
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
who's going to determine when their next
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
colonoscopy is do who's going to do the
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
paps mere for them who is going to send
 
00:31:10.509 --> 00:31:10.519 align:start position:0%
them to the dermatologist for a skin
 
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
lesion who is going to um do any number
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
of the preventative Services that we do
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
blood work for PSA that usually all
 
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
centers and comes through the primary
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
care office if they're not there that is
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
not getting done and patients are not
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
being served very
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
well I had the example or an experience
 
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
not quite a while ago now probably about
 
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
15 or 20 years ago um a nice man
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
probably M mid to late 50s comes in with
 
00:31:43.149 --> 00:31:43.159 align:start position:0%
what he called a
 
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
bunch on his thigh I had no idea what a
 
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
bunch was and I came to realize the
 
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
common vernacular in Northern New
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
England is a mass I didn't know what
 
00:31:56.629 --> 00:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
that was I also didn't know what a shock
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
was a shock is a stroke so there's a lot
 
00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:01.559 align:start position:0%
of the terminology that I was not aware
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
of but in any event nice man comes in
 
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
with a bunch and he's got a gown on and
 
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at his
 
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
leg and there is a bunch a mask probably
 
00:32:14.509 --> 00:32:14.519 align:start position:0%
the size of a cantaloupe or a small
 
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
watermelon on his
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
thigh and my question was how long has
 
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
this been here that would be our first
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
question and I was told it was well over
 
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
a year and I said why didn't you see
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
anybody he says well I don't have
 
00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
Primary Care
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm in the rural area of the state
 
00:32:32.629 --> 00:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
North Country somewhere I don't have any
 
00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
access to Primary Care and to go to the
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
hospital would cost me too much money
 
00:32:39.029 --> 00:32:39.039 align:start position:0%
and really the nearest hospital is 20 30
 
00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:41.720 align:start position:0%
miles away and I said so what brings you
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
in today and he says I just couldn't put
 
00:32:47.549 --> 00:32:47.559 align:start position:0%
my pants on anymore and the the problem
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
with that is obviously this was
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
diagnosed well too
 
00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
late had we seen this person from as a
 
00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
referral from his primary care provider
 
00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
provider when it first happened he could
 
00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
saved um so in any event these are these
 
00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
are just small not small these are just
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
a few examples of why Primary Care is so
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
important Primary Care numbers are
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
dwindling right now we need to
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
understand what our primary care for
 
00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
Workforce looks like we have to try to
 
00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
anticipate what the f the workforce will
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
look like in the future the work of the
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
um um the commission on um uh Primary
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
Care Workforce working with you know the
 
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
oplc gaining the information that's
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
necessary to understand where these
 
00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
providers are how old they are when are
 
00:33:42.509 --> 00:33:42.519 align:start position:0%
they going to retire what is their
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
specialty are they Internal Medicine
 
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
Family Practice Pediatrics OBGYN we need
 
00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
to understand this if we don't have the
 
00:33:51.389 --> 00:33:51.399 align:start position:0%
information we can't understand the
 
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
practice of primary care in the state
 
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
and patients will you know and many of
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
us who have trouble find finding Primary
 
00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
Care will not get the care we need in a
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
timely manner so um there's a lot of
 
00:34:05.629 --> 00:34:05.639 align:start position:0%
other issues regarding you know um
 
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
previous laws and stuff like that and we
 
00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
have people here that will speak to um
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh exactly what is their needs um but I
 
00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
would urge us to at least um extend the
 
00:34:21.629 --> 00:34:21.639 align:start position:0%
commission and allow um information to
 
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
be shared with oplc and with the uh
 
00:34:27.149 --> 00:34:27.159 align:start position:0%
State Office of rural health so that we
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
can uh better serve our patients and
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to take any questions
 
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
Weber so basically after all that what
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
you're asking us to do is simply
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
continue the work of two bodies that are
 
00:34:43.869 --> 00:34:43.879 align:start position:0%
already established for another five six
 
00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
years till 2029 right and so that any of
 
00:34:50.589 --> 00:34:50.599 align:start position:0%
us who were already concerned as I
 
00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:52.919 align:start position:0%
suspect we all are about the state of
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
the primary care Workforce this would be
 
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
one way of helping to understand where
 
00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:02.200 align:start position:0%
we are and where we may need to be in
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
the future I couldn't have said it any
 
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
better okay you know when you think of
 
00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:07.480 align:start position:0%
it you know if we don't understand our
 
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
Primary Care Workforce you know how many
 
00:35:11.589 --> 00:35:11.599 align:start position:0%
are going to age out in the next five
 
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:13.079 align:start position:0%
years how many are going to be coming
 
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
into the state how do we not only
 
00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
understand where we are today where
 
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
we're in the future and how do we
 
00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:21.160 align:start position:0%
encourage Recruitment and retainment of
 
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
primary care that's the scope of this
 
00:35:26.829 --> 00:35:26.839 align:start position:0%
body of this commission thank you Rob
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King thank you thank
 
00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
questions uh could you maybe call my
 
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
skepticism a little bit about the
 
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
commission um how long has it been
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
around and what has it really achieved
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
um and I ask that
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
because I think we kind of already know
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
all of us why there's a shortage of
 
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
primary care of Physicians I mean who
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
wants to go hundreds of thousands of
 
00:35:56.309 --> 00:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
dollar there's less incentive to become
 
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
a doctor hundreds of thousands of
 
00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
dollars in student loan debt you work
 
00:36:01.309 --> 00:36:01.319 align:start position:0%
terrible hours you're constantly
 
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
battling with bureaucracy and Medicaid
 
00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
and the insurance companies I mean we we
 
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
know what the problems are and but we as
 
00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
legislators clearly aren't fixing it and
 
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
we create these commissions I think to
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
Plate our our guilt and I'm not sure if
 
00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
they're coming up with any solutions
 
00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
we're willing to implement so I'm just
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what the point is of
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
keeping something like that going alive
 
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
and then also can you explain a little
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
bit um I'm still not 100% sure what the
 
00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
um new paragraph is um where it inserts
 
00:36:37.069 --> 00:36:37.079 align:start position:0%
where it talks about the light what oplc
 
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
is going to do are they going to create
 
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
new rules and regulations or are they
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
just giving information that already
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
exists I'm I'm I'm just a little
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
confused on that so if you could answer
 
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
those two questions multi multiple
 
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for the question and
 
00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:51.319 align:start position:0%
I I would totally agree with you
 
00:36:54.829 --> 00:36:54.839 align:start position:0%
representative King that it's not that
 
00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
um your your reference in the the
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
question is Healthcare broken that's why
 
00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:01.640 align:start position:0%
we don't have Primary Care Providers
 
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
though Primary Care is probably one of
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
the most gratifying Specialties in all
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
of medicine they're the ones that
 
00:37:09.309 --> 00:37:09.319 align:start position:0%
actually make the contact with the
 
00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:11.599 align:start position:0%
patient they developed the relationships
 
00:37:14.309 --> 00:37:14.319 align:start position:0%
I was a specialist I had episodic care
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
yes I had patients that came back for
 
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
another broken bone but I didn't see
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
them on a weekly monthly or yearly basis
 
00:37:23.309 --> 00:37:23.319 align:start position:0%
like a primary care provider does so
 
00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
it's an time-honored profession in fact
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
when those of us that went to medical
 
00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
school there on the committee would tell
 
00:37:31.069 --> 00:37:31.079 align:start position:0%
you that back in the day probably the
 
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
most revered position in the hospital
 
00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
was the chief medicine uh or the uh
 
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
Chief the chief resident of internal
 
00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
medicine and that's because they were
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
probably considered the smartest they
 
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
were considered the brightest and so I
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
don't know if I totally fully understand
 
00:37:49.309 --> 00:37:49.319 align:start position:0%
all of the the reasons why you know
 
00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
Primary Care is dwindling I have my
 
00:37:53.069 --> 00:37:53.079 align:start position:0%
ideas and I would ask others on the
 
00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
committee they can share it as well is
 
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
it a reimbursement you know when we went
 
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
to um uh a uh reimbursement model in the
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
90s where you were paid for procedures
 
00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
um versus you know time spent quality
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
time spent with the patient that's when
 
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
we saw a number of the uh people going
 
00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
to the primary care diminish um and it's
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
difficult to practice rural you know
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
Primary Care in rural Health settings
 
00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:18.200 align:start position:0%
when you don't have you know a hospital
 
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
setting nearby that you can rely on
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
comfortably and reliably on a day-to-day
 
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
basis there's a lot of issues in primary
 
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:25.720 align:start position:0%
care and I would not speak to them only
 
00:38:27.069 --> 00:38:27.079 align:start position:0%
because I think there's others in our
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
committee that can do that uh as far as
 
00:38:34.589 --> 00:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
what has been done with the um um uh the
 
00:38:38.589 --> 00:38:38.599 align:start position:0%
um uh State Office of um rural Health um
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
we have them we have representatives
 
00:38:42.309 --> 00:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
from that office here today they can
 
00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
actually better than I tell you exactly
 
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
what they have done since it started it
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
was when you asked me before it said
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
when did it when was it first uh created
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
that was in 2008 um and so when that was
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
created in um RSA say 126-a colon 5
 
00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
that's when it was started in 2008 and
 
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
that has been their goal since then for
 
00:39:06.309 --> 00:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
the past 15 years and it's also in
 
00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:08.079 align:start position:0%
statute that that has to be re-upped
 
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
every four to five years whatever it is
 
00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:11.720 align:start position:0%
so they can continue the work but I
 
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
would bet you and I'll let them speak to
 
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
that because they can do that better
 
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
than I that their work has been
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
substantial and if nothing else to
 
00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:22.280 align:start position:0%
understand why what where we have
 
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
deficiencies and gaps in our care that's
 
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
critical when you're trying to work with
 
00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
um in trying to recruit people where do
 
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:31.480 align:start position:0%
you recruit them what specials do we
 
00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:33.880 align:start position:0%
need that sort of thing so otherwise
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
we're working blindly when you don't
 
00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
understand the demographics of a certain
 
00:39:40.349 --> 00:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
you know profession like primary care we
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
don't know where to fill the holes we
 
00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
don't know how to you know do we need
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
more Primary Care and Family Practice up
 
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
north do we need internal medicine do we
 
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
need Pediatrics what is it that we need
 
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
what do we need lacking and but I will
 
00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:54.079 align:start position:0%
let them speak to that one
 
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative kushman and then
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
representative pero thank you Mr
 
00:39:59.589 --> 00:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for bringing this
 
00:40:03.309 --> 00:40:03.319 align:start position:0%
bill um my question is with your
 
00:40:06.309 --> 00:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
experience on the commission um
 
00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
specifically talking about gaps in care
 
00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
um I've had very good experiences with
 
00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
direct primary care and I I've run into
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of people who may not have
 
00:40:19.069 --> 00:40:19.079 align:start position:0%
insurance or they find their insurance
 
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
lacking they don't like the network um
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
or whatever reasons uh and they need
 
00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
some semi-urgent care but not enough to
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
rise the level of going urgent to urgent
 
00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
care and they can some of these gaps can
 
00:40:35.309 --> 00:40:35.319 align:start position:0%
be filled in by direct Primary Care
 
00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:37.640 align:start position:0%
Workforce and I was just wondering what
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
the general attitude is of the
 
00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
commission toward um that particular uh
 
00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
flavor of primary care and if there's
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
any representation for the direct
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
Primary Care
 
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
um uh providers on the commission great
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a great question because it
 
00:40:57.069 --> 00:40:57.079 align:start position:0%
also speaks to the fact that there are
 
00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
multiple um points of entry into the
 
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
Health Care system that if we utilize
 
00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:02.990 align:start position:0%
Health Care system that if we utilize
them

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
correctly um it is effective and it's
 
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
it's good quality care and it's also you
 
00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:09.800 align:start position:0%
know cost effective so going to the
 
00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
emergency room for what you were talking
 
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
about is really not cost effective um I
 
00:41:15.309 --> 00:41:15.319 align:start position:0%
have to admit that I've only been on
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
this commission for less than six months
 
00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:21.400 align:start position:0%
I was asked to be on it as the um House
 
00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
of Representatives uh representative on
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
the committee but I think the folks
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
behind me that uh are in the commission
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
can speak to that better than I uh
 
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
specifically regarding that question but
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you great thank you representative
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
chaparo thank you Mr chairman um I'm not
 
00:41:41.069 --> 00:41:41.079 align:start position:0%
sure you can answer this now that I know
 
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
you've only been on the commission for
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
six months but um to piggyback on uh
 
00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
representative King's question um in in
 
00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
Keen at chesher Medical Center we now
 
00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:55.839 align:start position:0%
have a new um Family Medicine Residency
 
00:41:55.839 --> 00:41:56.990 align:start position:0%
have a new um Family Medicine Residency
program

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:41:58.270 --> 00:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
um which will
 
00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
bring um residents to the Keen area to
 
00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
be trained with the hope that they'll
 
00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
stick around after they're trained um is
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
this and I know it's very expensive and
 
00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
um tremendous amount of work to start
 
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
something like this so I'm wondering if
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
this is the kind of project that
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
potentially or in fact comes out of um
 
00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
the commission's
 
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
work um one of the the charges of the
 
00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
commission and the the state office for
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
Rural health is specifically for
 
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and retainment of
 
00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:37.640 align:start position:0%
professionals um in Rural and in
 
00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
underserved areas and that's a perfect
 
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
example is why that residency I know I'm
 
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
familiar with that Family Practice
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
residency when it was started and that
 
00:42:49.829 --> 00:42:49.839 align:start position:0%
was exactly the reason we we did that
 
00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
and the reason that's important and
 
00:42:53.309 --> 00:42:53.319 align:start position:0%
that's the focus also because that is
 
00:42:56.349 --> 00:42:56.359 align:start position:0%
also understood when you understand when
 
00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
you get more information about the the
 
00:42:59.950 --> 00:42:59.960 align:start position:0%
demographics in the state where are
 
00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:01.839 align:start position:0%
people coming from where are primary
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
care doctors coming from well that's a
 
00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
great resource so what is really notable
 
00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:09.800 align:start position:0%
is in residency programs in in you know
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
whether it was in Orthopedics or in
 
00:43:11.599 --> 00:43:12.870 align:start position:0%
whether it was in Orthopedics or in
primary

00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
primary
 
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
care it's if you train in an area the
 
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
likelihood of you staying in that area
 
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
is substantially greater so when you
 
00:43:23.069 --> 00:43:23.079 align:start position:0%
start a you know we had residents that
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
came from Texas to our Orthopedic
 
00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
program and they said no way I'll be
 
00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
here for 4 years get educated and get
 
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
out of this God awful you know you know
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
snow belt up here and half of them if if
 
00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
not most of them all requested to stay
 
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
on staff after they were done and so if
 
00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:43.839 align:start position:0%
you get them in the door um when you get
 
00:43:45.549 --> 00:43:45.559 align:start position:0%
them in the door and they see the place
 
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:47.839 align:start position:0%
they understand the place that's exactly
 
00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
what we would be looking at that's
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
exactly the type of feeder programs that
 
00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
we need when I was a chief medical
 
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:55.839 align:start position:0%
officer at New London Hospital we would
 
00:43:59.309 --> 00:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
have some of the um um osteopathic
 
00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:01.960 align:start position:0%
Physicians come over from uh Maine in
 
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
their program and I would say one and
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
two would actually stay and request to
 
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
stay on staff after they graduated so
 
00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
this is exactly what we're trying to do
 
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
but we need to understand where these
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
Avenue where these opportunities are
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
what are the potential uh inroads to
 
00:44:19.549 --> 00:44:19.559 align:start position:0%
Primary Care that we can cultivate and
 
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
then try to recruit and then M maintain
 
00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
them in in the practice of primary care
 
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
in the state thank you for that
 
00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:27.589 align:start position:0%
in the state thank you for that
representative

00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chairman and also
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Murphy for
 
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:33.400 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
question given the time you're putting
 
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
into the commission can you tell me how
 
00:44:39.549 --> 00:44:39.559 align:start position:0%
you're compensated is this volunteer
 
00:44:40.589 --> 00:44:40.599 align:start position:0%
work or is this something that you're
 
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
for this is New Hampshire remember that
 
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
I that's the point I'm trying to make I
 
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
I have so I will say that since I
 
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
retired from my practice having been on
 
00:44:57.870 --> 00:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
Hospital boards fiscal policy boards um
 
00:44:59.470 --> 00:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
in the House of Representatives and on
 
00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:01.640 align:start position:0%
this commission I have not generated a
 
00:45:04.829 --> 00:45:04.839 align:start position:0%
W2 form at all I get paid well we all
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
get paid what we get paid for the house
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
for the house beyond that I do not get
 
00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:11.480 align:start position:0%
any extra pay for this commission at all
 
00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
um but I'm happy to serve on it because
 
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
frankly access to Primary Care is one of
 
00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:19.960 align:start position:0%
my passions despite being a specialist
 
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
it is one of my
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
passions thank you representative navel
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman this is really
 
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
more of a comment and since we've gone
 
00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
down into levity um I would ask that we
 
00:45:34.589 --> 00:45:34.599 align:start position:0%
put into permanent record the comment
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
that a surgeon stated very publicly that
 
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
the smartest person in the hospital is
 
00:45:42.829 --> 00:45:42.839 align:start position:0%
the chief resident in Internal
 
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
Medicine would you not agree with me I
 
00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
totally other
 
00:45:54.549 --> 00:45:54.559 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
Palmer um
 
00:45:58.510 --> 00:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
so obviously this this is near and dear
 
00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:01.240 align:start position:0%
to my heart because um I'm working a lot
 
00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
more this year because there aren't
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
enough people coming in um but the
 
00:46:12.349 --> 00:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
pipeline is is important and I'm asking
 
00:46:14.109 --> 00:46:14.119 align:start position:0%
this now and other people hopefully will
 
00:46:16.109 --> 00:46:16.119 align:start position:0%
comment on this is we have one medical
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
school in in New Hampshire there are a
 
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:20.440 align:start position:0%
couple of there a couple of residency
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
programs that have started the one in
 
00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:25.240 align:start position:0%
Keane there's one in oh shoot Portsmouth
 
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
um which is great great but we have one
 
00:46:28.549 --> 00:46:28.559 align:start position:0%
medical school which is a private
 
00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:32.200 align:start position:0%
medical school and it it's expensive and
 
00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the people that go to that
 
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
medical school are planning to go into
 
00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
Specialties and not necessarily focus on
 
00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
um primary
 
00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
care um is the commission looking at all
 
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
at trying to figure out how to get you
 
00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
know another medical school or medical
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
students here because that well thank
 
00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
you for that question and I I'm totally
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh sympathetic and empathetic with with
 
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
that um question and that concern um the
 
00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:03.640 align:start position:0%
short answer is no I for my
 
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
understanding uh again I'm a six-month
 
00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
veteran on the service here um without
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
pay but having said that I think that
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
the primary focus is to to understand
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
the the the the gaps in health care and
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
Primary Care in the state where they
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
exist what Specialties exist in Primary
 
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
Care being you know multiple Specialties
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
as you know um and then how to uh
 
00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:31.160 align:start position:0%
recruit and retain if they are doing
 
00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:32.559 align:start position:0%
work on trying to build another Medical
 
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
School here in the state I'm not aware
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
of it if they're if if we're working to
 
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
try to incentivize medical students to
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
go into Primary Care in some way or
 
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
another I'm not aware of it though that
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
would certainly be an offshoot and I can
 
00:47:47.549 --> 00:47:47.559 align:start position:0%
let them speak to that as far as the
 
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and retaining um but
 
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
um as as those have been here for a
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
while in medicine understand the the mid
 
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
90s when we instituted what they call an
 
00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:01.480 align:start position:0%
rvu a relative value unit for
 
00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
reimbursement that dramatically changed
 
00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
the landscape of uh healthc care and the
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
professions that people went into so
 
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
that proceduralist were getting paid
 
00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
more but the people that spend more
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
quality time like Dr Palmer with
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
patients daytoday were were not being
 
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursed adequately enough I think
 
00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
that's beyond the scope of the
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
commission though we can actually try to
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
recognize it as a concern and try to
 
00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
then promotee through the legislature
 
00:48:32.349 --> 00:48:32.359 align:start position:0%
potentially you know programs that would
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
um en enhance Recruitment and retainment
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
of of um primary care providers but
 
00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
thank you other
 
00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:46.400 align:start position:0%

00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:31.160 align:start position:0%
at uh
 
00:49:34.109 --> 00:49:34.119 align:start position:0%
HHS and we we are here in support of the
 
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
entirety of the bill but specifically
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
want to thank the commission because
 
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
part of their charge also includes the
 
00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
collaboration between our agency and
 
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
Miss Hernandez and and her crew at the
 
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
State Office of rural health and keeping
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
to the three minute time limit I just
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to let you know the good works we
 
00:49:50.549 --> 00:49:50.559 align:start position:0%
did on section three of the bill
 
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
starting on lines 13 uh through the
 
00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
remainder down to 18 prior to the enact
 
00:49:59.870 --> 00:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
the effective date so um we have a very
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
good collaborative relationship with the
 
00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
office of professional Li Insurance
 
00:50:05.309 --> 00:50:05.319 align:start position:0%
certification and we have under our
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
statute under RSA
 
00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:11.960 align:start position:0%
126-a colon 5 Roman 18 lower
 
00:50:15.549 --> 00:50:15.559 align:start position:0%
case-a the ability to receive and to
 
00:50:17.549 --> 00:50:17.559 align:start position:0%
collect certain information that is
 
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
helpful to us to provide uh information
 
00:50:22.109 --> 00:50:22.119 align:start position:0%
to the commission to the legislature as
 
00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
it relates to the licensed individuals
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
whether they're dentist whether they're
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
doctors and a whole salute that you'll
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
see in our enabling legislation for uh
 
00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
targeting the information uh for those
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
folks I just want to remind it is a
 
00:50:37.789 --> 00:50:37.799 align:start position:0%
voluntary uh uh process there is an opt
 
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
out provision we have the wonderful um
 
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor again I can't believe it
 
00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
today is deja vu from uh from represent
 
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
Lori Harding who's in the audience who
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
actually helped and worked
 
00:50:48.829 --> 00:50:48.839 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with Senator Carson at
 
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
the time around very thoughtful
 
00:50:53.549 --> 00:50:53.559 align:start position:0%
provisions and legislation so we're
 
00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:55.480 align:start position:0%
entering into what they call a memor
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
random of agreement with our other
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
agency working collaboratively with the
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure and
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
certification and they very thoughtfully
 
00:51:04.589 --> 00:51:04.599 align:start position:0%
identified that we and the department
 
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
already have this Authority and have
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
been exercising it and we've been
 
00:51:09.069 --> 00:51:09.079 align:start position:0%
protecting data and we've been giving
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
good information but they identified and
 
00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
you'll see on line um 14 of the bill
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
that it amends RSA uh
 
00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:21.640 align:start position:0%
3105 that essentially is their enabling
 
00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:23.720 align:start position:0%
legislation for their Authority for
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
doing certain things and so this would
 
00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
be an additional item to mirror to
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
provide them with the same reciprocal
 
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
Authority uh in a cross cross references
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
back specifically to the RSA that I
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
quoted and because of three minutes I
 
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
won't quote it again uh but it is in the
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
bill itself um and that is exactly what
 
00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:43.640 align:start position:0%
we're we're doing so this language was
 
00:51:45.309 --> 00:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
worked on in collaboration of both
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
agencies and we're here today to
 
00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
represent that it's a wonderful thing
 
00:51:50.589 --> 00:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
putting belts and suspenders and to
 
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
include in their their um provision of
 
00:51:55.069 --> 00:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
law that reciprocal Authority so with
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
that I do know we have a brief amount of
 
00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
time so I do want to turn it over to
 
00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
Miss Hernandez because she really has a
 
00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
volume of information in terms of the
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
Merit and the um work that's been done
 
00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
not only by the commission but
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
specifically by the State Office of
 
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
rural Health which she serves in that
 
00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:11.720 align:start position:0%
capacity does a wonderful job and also
 
00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:13.640 align:start position:0%
to respond to various questions by the
 
00:52:15.069 --> 00:52:15.079 align:start position:0%
committee members that have been raised
 
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll turn it over to Miss
 
00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
Hernandez and then to questions from the
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
committee reveres McDonald thank you so
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
much thank you so hbdc the Health
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
Professions data center was developing
 
00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
under the sword to receive available
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
data as John had said and collect data
 
00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:31.400 align:start position:0%
through provider surveying during
 
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
license renewal to assess the current
 
00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:36.280 align:start position:0%
and anticipated um primary care
 
00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:38.200 align:start position:0%
landscape in New Hampshire this
 
00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
initiative was codified in 2019 with the
 
00:52:45.789 --> 00:52:45.799 align:start position:0%
requirement for hpdc to report to HHS
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
oversight and uh to inform the work of
 
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
the legislative Commission on the
 
00:52:52.829 --> 00:52:52.839 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary Primary Care Workforce
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
so this data really has significant
 
00:52:58.349 --> 00:52:58.359 align:start position:0%
impact and value it helps to support and
 
00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
strengthen Federal shortage designation
 
00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh performed by our office which brings
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
Primary Care Providers and grant funding
 
00:53:08.549 --> 00:53:08.559 align:start position:0%
to Rural and underserved areas of the
 
00:53:10.829 --> 00:53:10.839 align:start position:0%
state it supports Recruitment and
 
00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
Retention initiatives including among
 
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
others the state loan repayment program
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire recruitment center it
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
supports the development and expansion
 
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
of existing um educational and
 
00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
employment training programs most recent
 
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
L coas County's Family Medicine
 
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
Residency in Berlin um and as was
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier cheshire's Family
 
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
Medicine Residency in keen and of course
 
00:53:37.549 --> 00:53:37.559 align:start position:0%
it supports and strengthens emergency
 
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
preparedness so oplc collects and
 
00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
maintains a number of Licensing Fields
 
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
fundamental to provider surveying
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
shortage designation and Workforce
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
assessment without access to these
 
00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
fields hpdc effectively loses its
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
ability to fulfill our statutory and
 
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
Federal Grant
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
requirements we have been receiving this
 
00:54:01.150 --> 00:54:01.160 align:start position:0%
data through a data sharing agreement
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
until August 2023 just recently when it
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
was determined by oplc that they would
 
00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
need the statutory authority to share
 
00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
data um and this bill does exactly that
 
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
right it grants statutory authority to
 
00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:17.720 align:start position:0%
oplc to share Workforce uh data related
 
00:54:20.589 --> 00:54:20.599 align:start position:0%
fields with the sore which already has
 
00:54:23.309 --> 00:54:23.319 align:start position:0%
uh the statutory authority to receive it
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
effectively just closing a legisl
 
00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
discrepancy all but one licensing field
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
is public data the one non-public data
 
00:54:34.589 --> 00:54:34.599 align:start position:0%
field provider email is essential and
 
00:54:37.829 --> 00:54:37.839 align:start position:0%
used for provider uh compliance followup
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
to increase response rates so um as is
 
00:54:44.829 --> 00:54:44.839 align:start position:0%
the case with all lure requirements the
 
00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:47.720 align:start position:0%
survey requirement is verified through
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
provider attestation on the licensed
 
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
renewal form unfortunately we still see
 
00:54:55.829 --> 00:54:55.839 align:start position:0%
even three years after the survey was
 
00:54:58.510 --> 00:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
implemented as a condition of renewal uh
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
non-compliance rates between 15 and
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
25% when our program hpdc sends out that
 
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh reminder email to Providers it's
 
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
reduced to about 1 to 4% so without our
 
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
hand in the compliance office what would
 
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
happen is the final non-compliance uh
 
00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:19.400 align:start position:0%
list sent to opl's enforcement division
 
00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
would increase significantly and we risk
 
00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:26.680 align:start position:0%
losing reliable representative data that
 
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
can only come with higher responses um
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
and is also you know critical and
 
00:55:33.789 --> 00:55:33.799 align:start position:0%
necessary for shortage designation work
 
00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
and uh provider to population analysis
 
00:55:38.029 --> 00:55:38.039 align:start position:0%
to determine need we could start
 
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
wrapping up please yep um and that's
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
really it just to continue this valuable
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
work uh around Workforce and and to
 
00:55:48.589 --> 00:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
inform policy we DHHS is in support of
 
00:55:48.599 --> 00:55:49.829 align:start position:0%
inform policy we DHHS is in support of

00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
1609 thank you representative kushman
 
00:55:54.510 --> 00:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you um
 
00:55:58.029 --> 00:55:58.039 align:start position:0%
for speaking um to how you see this bill
 
00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
um Bill's value um I am wondering you
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned a voluntary process for opt
 
00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
out of something or actually it was um
 
00:56:09.309 --> 00:56:09.319 align:start position:0%
Mr Williams I believe can you I I didn't
 
00:56:11.309 --> 00:56:11.319 align:start position:0%
catch what exactly you were uh
 
00:56:14.029 --> 00:56:14.039 align:start position:0%
referencing so when the survey was
 
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
implemented as a condition of renewal we
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to ensure that you know uh
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
quality practicing clinicians weren't at
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
risk of losing their license based on a
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
survey and so it was important to us to
 
00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:29.480 align:start position:0%
also Implement um uh the completion of
 
00:56:32.069 --> 00:56:32.079 align:start position:0%
either the survey or the opt out form
 
00:56:35.109 --> 00:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
they exist on the same page on DHHS and
 
00:56:37.029 --> 00:56:37.039 align:start position:0%
and providers can certainly choose the
 
00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
opt out form to say you know this is my
 
00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
name like minimum data points for
 
00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
shortage designation use name uh
 
00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
specialty um if they practice in New
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and that fulfills the
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
requirement H
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
up okay um thank you that is very
 
00:56:58.589 --> 00:56:58.599 align:start position:0%
helpful um so now I'm just trying to
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
weigh that against what you said about
 
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
um you know you're you're chasing after
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
compliance so you need their email
 
00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
address because you you need those
 
00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
answers and when you were saying that it
 
00:57:11.069 --> 00:57:11.079 align:start position:0%
was interesting to me because I didn't
 
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
know that there was this opt out because
 
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
as a nurse I have to fill out the survey
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
during my renewal process on the oplc
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
website every two years before I can
 
00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
even finish it so um I'm just trying to
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
kind of square that how you know where
 
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
we have the opt out but now we're kind
 
00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
of um want to make it that it's
 
00:57:33.069 --> 00:57:33.079 align:start position:0%
involuntary or that there's more
 
00:57:35.029 --> 00:57:35.039 align:start position:0%
pressure more ability for there to be
 
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
more pressure to fill out the survey for
 
00:57:39.029 --> 00:57:39.039 align:start position:0%
lack of a better phrasing sorry for
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
clarity uh the compliance follow-up is
 
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
for providers to complete either the
 
00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:45.640 align:start position:0%
survey or the opt out form and that's
 
00:57:48.029 --> 00:57:48.039 align:start position:0%
made clear in the email Communications
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
out other
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
questions representative L on um thank
 
00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman it sounds like the Board
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
of Nursing has a more streamlined
 
00:58:02.109 --> 00:58:02.119 align:start position:0%
process through the oplc do you know if
 
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
all the other relevant licensing boards
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
are moving to that same process where we
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
won't have that same compliance because
 
00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
you can't complete it without the optin
 
00:58:12.349 --> 00:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
or the survey going forward the way the
 
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
survey is implemented um for all
 
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
participating provider types is uh
 
00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:19.640 align:start position:0%
consistent so every yep clinician that
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
participates under their respective
 
00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
boards has the opportunity to complete
 
00:58:26.029 --> 00:58:26.039 align:start position:0%
either the survey or the opt out form
 
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
and it was a recent move in The Last 5
 
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
Years that um all Health Professions
 
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
boards have um have transitioned from
 
00:58:36.589 --> 00:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
paper renewals to online renewals just
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
to streamline that process thank you
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative palazov thank you Mr
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
so without this commission are there
 
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
other ways to get a federal shortage
 
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
designation and receive uh the
 
00:58:57.630 --> 00:58:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry can you repeat like uh if not
 
00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
for this commission are there other ways
 
00:59:06.589 --> 00:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
to receive federal shortage
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
designation what the commission has done
 
00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:13.880 align:start position:0%
for um this portion of the work is um it
 
00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:15.400 align:start position:0%
was really through the commission
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
through recommendations that the St
 
00:59:20.349 --> 00:59:20.359 align:start position:0%
Source Health Professions data center
 
00:59:23.029 --> 00:59:23.039 align:start position:0%
was established through legislation so
 
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
that's really um and through that
 
00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
legislation we also have the rec
 
00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement to inform their
 
00:59:32.589 --> 00:59:32.599 align:start position:0%
work which we do throughout the
 
00:59:35.309 --> 00:59:35.319 align:start position:0%

that relate to our community health
 
01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
centers so by state is an advocacy
 
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
organization that works to expand
 
01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
Primary Care access to all New Hampshire
 
01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
residents including in uh the districts

community health centers including
 
01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
federally qualified Health Centers which
 
01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
can only be established in the country
 
01:00:30.029 --> 01:00:30.039 align:start position:0%
using the data that is collected by um
 
01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:32.799 align:start position:0%
departments like and divisions like the
 
01:00:36.349 --> 01:00:36.359 align:start position:0%
sore we could not Access Federal
 
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
programming without the data that their
 
01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.230 align:start position:0%
programming without the data that their
organization

01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
collects in 2022 our community health
 
01:00:48.990 --> 01:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
centers um served or had over 48,000
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
visits so these are primary care visits
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
that include substance use disorder
 
01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:54.799 align:start position:0%
treatment we use a very Broad broad
 
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
definition of primary care substance use
 
01:00:59.870 --> 01:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
disorder treatment oral health services
 
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
um what you would typically think of
 
01:01:03.029 --> 01:01:03.039 align:start position:0%
when you think of primary and preventive
 
01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
care including reproductive Health Care
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
Services we rely on the data that is
 
01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
collected by SAR and the conversations
 
01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
that happen at the commission to
 
01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
Advocate at the federal level for
 
01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
funding that directly benefits your
 
01:01:20.670 --> 01:01:20.680 align:start position:0%
constituents and the districts that you
 
01:01:23.829 --> 01:01:23.839 align:start position:0%
serve and um representative Seth King to
 
01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:25.640 align:start position:0%
answer one of your questions that you
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
asked there are community health centers
 
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
that serve your district there are four
 
01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:31.640 align:start position:0%
clinicians benefiting from the state
 
01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
loaner payment program in your your
 
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
District alone and um they wouldn't be
 
01:01:38.829 --> 01:01:38.839 align:start position:0%
able to do that if we didn't have the
 
01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:41.240 align:start position:0%
information collected by sore and the
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
work of the commission so it is very
 
01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
important we do support house bill 16009
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
because of its work and I can't
 
01:01:50.349 --> 01:01:50.359 align:start position:0%
overstate the importance of the
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
commission it did help as Danielle noted
 
01:01:55.069 --> 01:01:55.079 align:start position:0%
um us to establish estblished a teaching
 
01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:57.160 align:start position:0%
Health Center residency program at Coos
 
01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
County family health services and that
 
01:02:01.589 --> 01:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
was done in partnership with un and gel
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
school of medicine they are also
 
01:02:05.230 --> 01:02:05.240 align:start position:0%
partnering with the hospitals in their
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
area to ensure that the four residents
 
01:02:10.589 --> 01:02:10.599 align:start position:0%
that they plan on bringing in 2025 can
 
01:02:13.549 --> 01:02:13.559 align:start position:0%
serve the North Country in a a
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
culturally appropriate way and we do our
 
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
best to retain those residents once they
 
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
complete their Residency program uh just
 
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
the fqhcs alone have 131 vacancies
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
and and that's 10
 
01:02:29.069 --> 01:02:29.079 align:start position:0%
organizations so being able to access
 
01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
the data that SAR collects and as I
 
01:02:34.349 --> 01:02:34.359 align:start position:0%
noted the work of the commission is very
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
important to our ability to decrease
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
those vacancies and also recruit and
 
01:02:42.029 --> 01:02:42.039 align:start position:0%
retain additional clinicians um
 
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the
 
01:02:47.309 --> 01:02:47.319 align:start position:0%
state I think most other um speakers
 
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
have have answered a number of your
 
01:02:51.069 --> 01:02:51.079 align:start position:0%
questions that you've had so I'm happy
 
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
to answer any more if you have them but
 
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
um I know you're already backed up so
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative N

01:03:15.309 --> 01:03:15.319 align:start position:0%
so that includes front desk staff Mas

so that includes front desk staff Mas
RNs

01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:00.279 align:start position:0%
minutes I think I can do it in less than
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
that you have my written um testimony
 
01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
and so instead of highlighting points
 
01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
from that I just wanted to answer some
 
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
questions I'm a family nurse
 
01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
practitioner and a certified nurse
 
01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
Midwife I've practiced in New Hampshire
 
01:04:15.789 --> 01:04:15.799 align:start position:0%
for about 40 years in The Lakes Region
 
01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:18.200 align:start position:0%
and um I'm the chair of the legislative
 
01:04:20.309 --> 01:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
commission so the commission was
 
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
established in 2010 was someone's
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
question um in response to your question
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
about direct Primary Care um we have had
 
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
a short presentation regarding it and
 
01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
one of the direct primary care nurse
 
01:04:36.269 --> 01:04:36.279 align:start position:0%
participants in the state is now
 
01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
attending the meetings as a guest and
 
01:04:38.559 --> 01:04:39.470 align:start position:0%
attending the meetings as a guest and
hoping

01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
hoping
 
01:04:43.269 --> 01:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
to uh make that more broadly integrated
 
01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
into our interdisciplinary committee we
 
01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
worked um very closely with un over the
 
01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
last five to six years two of their
 
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
faculty members are now um guests almost
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
every month at our meetings and we've
 
01:05:00.829 --> 01:05:00.839 align:start position:0%
established clinical rotations for those
 
01:05:03.069 --> 01:05:03.079 align:start position:0%
medical students in New Hampshire again
 
01:05:05.269 --> 01:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
underscoring if you train them here
 
01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
they'll stay here um we worked very hard
 
01:05:11.069 --> 01:05:11.079 align:start position:0%
in the to De development of the three
 
01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
residency programs the North Country
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
which is unique in that it is a rural
 
01:05:18.589 --> 01:05:18.599 align:start position:0%
Residency program and then the first
 
01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
class that's graduating from Portsmith
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
this year they graduated in July and
 
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:25.640 align:start position:0%
then the first class that will be
 
01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:29.480 align:start position:0%
starting in chesher um this June and um
 
01:05:32.309 --> 01:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
we worked uh very hard with the a new
 
01:05:35.549 --> 01:05:35.559 align:start position:0%
project UNH which um is for advanced
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
practice registered nurses and the
 
01:05:40.349 --> 01:05:40.359 align:start position:0%
statistics there are about 85% of them
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
stay in state um after graduating from
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
the program and we worked um with
 
01:05:49.710 --> 01:05:49.720 align:start position:0%
helping to validate and extend the ahac
 
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
federal program so I think those were
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
most of the questions that I
 
01:05:58.109 --> 01:05:58.119 align:start position:0%
heard thank you any
 
01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative kushman thank
 
01:06:02.549 --> 01:06:02.559 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you just a
 
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
quick question thank you for answering
 
01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
that question about the direct Primary
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
Care it sounds like they they are kind
 
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
of able to come and and have the
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
conversation but do you think it would
 
01:06:12.109 --> 01:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
be appropriate to put in an amendment
 
01:06:14.789 --> 01:06:14.799 align:start position:0%
since they are an expanding um branch of
 
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
the primary care Workforce to add a
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
position for a representative of that
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
particular brand of Provider yes we try
 
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
to really be very inclusive and very
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary and it um I did a
 
01:06:31.950 --> 01:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
short presentation on this last fall and
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
many people think it is the wave of the
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
future that people especially with the
 
01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
huge deductibles that people have that
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
um it is it for healthy young families
 
01:06:43.269 --> 01:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
it is a way for them to access Primary
 
01:06:47.309 --> 01:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
Care in a affordable but very um
 
01:06:47.319 --> 01:06:49.150 align:start position:0%
Care in a affordable but very um
comprehensive

01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
way other questions representative TZ I
 
01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
have a question actually it's followup
 
01:06:57.309 --> 01:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
to your question so um would you say the
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
membership is employers or sort of um
 
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:05.480 align:start position:0%
representatives of disciplines and then
 
01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
to follow on if you were to have um uh
 
01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
like what would you call the category of
 
01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
of entities that uh what is it prob
 
01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
direct MD or whatever she called it the
 
01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
um direct primary care direct Primary
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
Care would be yeah um I don't know if
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
they have a official group that meets or
 
01:07:29.589 --> 01:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
not I guess I would need to explore that
 
01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:31.640 align:start position:0%
um but certainly having them come as a
 
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
guest has been valuable um the rest of
 
01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
the commission you know what kind of
 
01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
runs the gamut from the New Hampshire

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:47.669 align:start position:0%
end by 12 is that correct yeah because
we

01:08:47.669 --> 01:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:51.239 align:start position:0%

gra the other one support for repealing
 
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
the autism registry because it seems to
 
01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
me that once you deal with all the
 
01:09:26.189 --> 01:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
things that can be
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
withdrawn the data is no longer good
 
01:09:30.990 --> 01:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
data and the only person who supported
 
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
keeping it was great Ms who established

01:22:52.629 --> 01:22:52.639 align:start position:0%
yesterday basically all this does is it
 
01:22:55.310 --> 01:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
changes what was line8 in the original
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
bill it's now line three in the
 
01:23:00.790 --> 01:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
amendment um to basically limiting this
 
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
provision to any health carrier um that
 
01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
operates in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
not any federal um insures so in other
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
words it doesn't apply to Medicare
 
01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid which we knew going into this
 
01:23:15.470 --> 01:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
um now we're putting it in writing um
 
01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
there were concerns um from another of a
 
01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
number of stakeholders that that might
 
01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
be a problem we believe that this line
 
01:23:25.470 --> 01:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
fixes that okay other than that it's the
 
01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
same bill anyone else wish to speak to
 
01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:28.669 align:start position:0%
same bill anyone else wish to speak to
this

01:23:28.669 --> 01:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:23:30.990 --> 01:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
amendment representative kofalt then
 
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
representative Weber uh yes thank you Mr
 
01:23:35.790 --> 01:23:35.800 align:start position:0%
chairman uh so I just want to make sure
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
that I understand clearly um based on
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
what I see in line one this would
 
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
effectively delete section three from
 
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
the original Bill thank you yes and that
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
that was part of
 
01:23:51.229 --> 01:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
oops top down yeah that was our
 
01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
discussion yesterday as well I mean I I
 
01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not in my world it's not ideal but
 
01:23:58.149 --> 01:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
that's a a fight for another day okay
 
01:23:58.159 --> 01:24:04.470 align:start position:0%
that's a a fight for another day okay
representative

01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
Weber and following on to representative
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
kof's question I just the amendment we
 
01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
had yesterday would have deleted three
 
01:24:17.189 --> 01:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
in its entirety is that right okay so we
 
01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
were referring to section three
 
01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
yesterday not one or two one or two
 
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
stand this is the replacement
 
01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:23.870 align:start position:0%
stand this is the replacement
thank

01:24:23.870 --> 01:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:24:29.470 --> 01:24:29.480 align:start position:0%
you on the original bill um um the first
 
01:24:31.790 --> 01:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
um section one which just defines
 
01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
electronic medical record that still
 
01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
exists section two is changed as is here
 
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
section three is eliminated and um the
 
01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
last two effective dates still
 
01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
present got you should all make sure I'm
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
correct on that because when I got this
 
01:24:50.669 --> 01:24:50.679 align:start position:0%
it confused me to death um other
 
01:24:53.149 --> 01:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
questions and and and if I'm following
 
01:24:55.550 --> 01:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
on yeah and this does because it says
 
01:24:58.430 --> 01:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
amend two and three is inserted by
 
01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
section one of the bill by replacing it
 
01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
with the following so three is gone two
 
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
is amended one is still the same and yes
 
01:25:10.669 --> 01:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
we're all good thank you thanks other
 
01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
questions other discussion seeing none
 
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:16.440 align:start position:0%

seconded by representative Merchant is
 
01:26:42.629 --> 01:26:42.639 align:start position:0%
there any further discussion on this
 
01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative King Seth King thank you
 
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh I'm not going to spend too
 
01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
much time on this um I am opposing the
 
01:26:53.629 --> 01:26:53.639 align:start position:0%
bill as amended um I agree with the
 
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
general sentiment of not liking the
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
electronic medical records
 
01:27:01.709 --> 01:27:01.719 align:start position:0%
um I don't you can see here I don't have
 
01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
a computer I like to keep my paper
 
01:27:05.669 --> 01:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
records and and I definitely think that
 
01:27:07.629 --> 01:27:07.639 align:start position:0%
um there there have been a lot of
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
problems with electronic medical records
 
01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
that's that's a given um however
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
generally speaking as I've mentioned
 
01:27:17.229 --> 01:27:17.239 align:start position:0%
times in the past if there's some sort
 
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
of problem in the code that's
 
01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
incentivizing Health carriers to require
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
it because maybe they have to meet
 
01:27:26.229 --> 01:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
deadlines or something then we should
 
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
look to remove that code I don't really
 
01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
like adding new code um generally
 
01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
speaking I I do believe that most
 
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
problems we experience in society are
 
01:27:36.109 --> 01:27:36.119 align:start position:0%
government caused and we should be
 
01:27:38.990 --> 01:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
looking to remove that cause not adding
 
01:27:41.629 --> 01:27:41.639 align:start position:0%
new lines of code that's going to take
 
01:27:44.590 --> 01:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
away Freedom even more so a bill like
 
01:27:46.590 --> 01:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
this sort of presumes
 
01:27:49.790 --> 01:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
to it presumes that there's never any
 
01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
conceivable reason why a health provider
 
01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
would or yeah a health carrier would
 
01:27:59.950 --> 01:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
would would really need EMR and and I
 
01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:02.719 align:start position:0%
don't believe that I think that um you
 
01:28:05.109 --> 01:28:05.119 align:start position:0%
know in a free market system competition
 
01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
would dictate what what is really
 
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
demanded and there might be some there
 
01:28:13.390 --> 01:28:13.400 align:start position:0%
might be some who some healthc care
 
01:28:16.270 --> 01:28:16.280 align:start position:0%
carriers who um you know they they
 
01:28:20.189 --> 01:28:20.199 align:start position:0%
totally um um work towards helping
 
01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
people stick to you know paper Rec
 
01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
records and then there might be others
 
01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
that um are really geared towards people
 
01:28:30.270 --> 01:28:30.280 align:start position:0%
that are perfectly happy with um with
 
01:28:33.709 --> 01:28:33.719 align:start position:0%
electronic medical records and you know
 
01:28:35.550 --> 01:28:35.560 align:start position:0%
if if we had a bill like this in there
 
01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
then they wouldn't be able to just serve
 
01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:40.280 align:start position:0%
that clientele so I I don't like the
 
01:28:43.109 --> 01:28:43.119 align:start position:0%
one-size fits-all approach overall it's
 
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
not the end of the world but it's just
 
01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
another one of these little bits of code
 
01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:49.400 align:start position:0%
that just makes it a little bit more
 
01:28:52.430 --> 01:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
difficult to comply and it it it makes
 
01:28:54.189 --> 01:28:54.199 align:start position:0%
the whole process just a little bit more
 
01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
sclerotic and I just prefer competition
 
01:28:59.149 --> 01:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
and letting the market decide which is
 
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
best I'm old school I like my paper too
 
01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
and I definitely see there's been a lot
 
01:29:06.109 --> 01:29:06.119 align:start position:0%
of problems but I I'm not ready to ban
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
it completely so that's why I oppose it
 
01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:09.990 align:start position:0%
it completely so that's why I oppose it
thank

01:29:09.990 --> 01:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:29:12.149 --> 01:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
you representative L did you have your
 
01:29:16.270 --> 01:29:16.280 align:start position:0%
hand up sure um thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:29:17.950 --> 01:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
to me I just see this as something
 
01:29:19.550 --> 01:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
that's empowering doctors who don't want
 
01:29:21.550 --> 01:29:21.560 align:start position:0%
to have a electronic medical record to
 
01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
do so um that's why I'm supporting it
 
01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
but um I I understand sometimes we look
 
01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
at the same bill and see it from
 
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
different perspectives and I absolutely
 
01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
understand that and respect that opinion
 
01:29:32.750 --> 01:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to say I think that
 
01:29:34.350 --> 01:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
this provides the doctors more more
 
01:29:37.470 --> 01:29:37.480 align:start position:0%
choice and I I think that uh I think we
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
probably all know where we stand on this
 
01:29:41.310 --> 01:29:41.320 align:start position:0%
one but I thank you for sharing that
 
01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:42.669 align:start position:0%
one but I thank you for sharing that

yes 19
 
01:30:56.790 --> 01:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
to1 you know that can't be on consent
 
01:30:58.030 --> 01:30:58.040 align:start position:0%
because it's got a fiscal note
 
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative we is that
 
01:31:03.390 --> 01:31:03.400 align:start position:0%
correct I believe it has a fiscal note
 
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
but it has no appropriation in it so
 
01:31:07.950 --> 01:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
because it has no appropriation it need
 
01:31:10.830 --> 01:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
not go it's and it's it's not going to
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
finance so I I think it's okay there's
 
01:31:15.550 --> 01:31:15.560 align:start position:0%
no objection then we'll put that on the
 
01:31:18.550 --> 01:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
consent calendar I'm sure that the
 
01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
upstairs review will let us know if
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
we've done that wrong
 
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
sure and representative Nagel if you can
 
01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
get that report to me sometime this
 
01:31:28.669 --> 01:31:28.679 align:start position:0%

I don't care to no okay all right uh
 
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
then we're jumping around a little bit
 
01:31:52.709 --> 01:31:52.719 align:start position:0%
more uh we're going to go to hb6 60 FN
 
01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
next do I have a
 
01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
motion Mr chair I move a to pass
 
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
motion's been made ought to pass on 1660
 
01:32:02.910 --> 01:32:02.920 align:start position:0%
FN is there a second representative
 
01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
kushman seconds would you like to speak
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
to your motion representative
 
01:32:10.709 --> 01:32:10.719 align:start position:0%
kofalt uh yes I'll be quick uh as I said
 
01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:18.109 --> 01:32:18.119 align:start position:0%
um gender reassignment surgery for
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
minors is um is something that many
 
01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers think is um is a bad idea it
 
01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:28.719 align:start position:0%
is medically not necessary and um we
 
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
ought not to be covering it with
 
01:32:35.470 --> 01:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:37.830 --> 01:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
Weber you just shut your mic off by the
 
01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
way sorry thank you um and I would just
 
01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
say that I take the opposite position I
 
01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
believe that um first of all these
 
01:32:50.030 --> 01:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
surgeries are necessary and life saving
 
01:32:53.629 --> 01:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
I also believe that they're very rare uh
 
01:32:56.430 --> 01:32:56.440 align:start position:0%
but this bill is more far-reaching than
 
01:32:58.270 --> 01:32:58.280 align:start position:0%
the bill we already passed which was a
 
01:33:02.229 --> 01:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
ban so it has the potential in the case
 
01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
of the surgery still covered by it of
 
01:33:09.870 --> 01:33:09.880 align:start position:0%
creating a two-tiered s um two- tiered
 
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
um standard of care and treatment and I
 
01:33:15.109 --> 01:33:15.119 align:start position:0%
think that that we have recognized in
 
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
other cases that that's inappropriate so
 
01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
um for those reasons I will be voting
 
01:33:22.510 --> 01:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
against the octopath and hoping for a
 
01:33:26.270 --> 01:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
different motion okay other discussion
 
01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:28.030 align:start position:0%
different motion okay other discussion
representative

01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:28.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:37.790 --> 01:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm not comfortable with um miners
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
having these kind of surgeries whether
 
01:33:42.109 --> 01:33:42.119 align:start position:0%
it's bottom surgery or Top surgery and
 
01:33:45.629 --> 01:33:45.639 align:start position:0%
if it was someone who was in my circle
 
01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
in my life and my family I would try to
 
01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
encourage them to do everything I could
 
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
to wait until they were older to make a
 
01:33:59.350 --> 01:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
um some of us might have noticed that
 
01:34:04.229 --> 01:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
there were about 20 bills limiting what
 
01:34:07.070 --> 01:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
transgender people can do or can't do
 
01:34:09.109 --> 01:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
and we're not talking about other kinds
 
01:34:13.149 --> 01:34:13.159 align:start position:0%
of surgeries that are
 
01:34:17.070 --> 01:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
um that miners have and so I just think
 
01:34:19.990 --> 01:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
that this is discriminatory and so I
 
01:34:21.790 --> 01:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
will vote against it because don't want
 
01:34:24.109 --> 01:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
to discriminate against transgender
 
01:34:27.310 --> 01:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
people okay thank you representative
 
01:34:29.390 --> 01:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
Leon and then representative kof um
 
01:34:32.270 --> 01:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I am not aware
 
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
of Medicaid covering uh breast surgeries
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
for minors unless there's a malignancy
 
01:34:39.550 --> 01:34:39.560 align:start position:0%
or um that they're so heavy that there's
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
back problems if there is in fact a
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
disparity between this be where um where
 
01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
transgender CH transgender children
 
01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to have a Top surgery
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
that would be paid for as an augment
 
01:34:53.790 --> 01:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
ation or removal for somebody who's not
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
transgender um I hope that you would all
 
01:34:57.550 --> 01:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor a bill with me next year in
 
01:35:00.030 --> 01:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
order to remove that Medicaid funding uh
 
01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
for anything other than a malignancy
 
01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
something that's back pain let's figure
 
01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
out where are those ones where any any
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
child can't wait until they're 18 for
 
01:35:10.990 --> 01:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
that for payment and um make sure that
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
there is actually a true equity on this
 
01:35:15.310 --> 01:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
but um as far as I'm I I don't know that
 
01:35:17.709 --> 01:35:17.719 align:start position:0%
we cover that for any anybody other than
 
01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
potentially transgender children
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative kofalt
 
01:35:23.709 --> 01:35:23.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so with respect to
 
01:35:25.629 --> 01:35:25.639 align:start position:0%
the uh concern expressed about a
 
01:35:29.149 --> 01:35:29.159 align:start position:0%
two-tier system um I will read from the
 
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
healthcare.gov website many health plans
 
01:35:33.990 --> 01:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
are using exclusions such as Services
 
01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
related to sex change um so there is not
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
a uh single uh standard across the board
 
01:35:45.510 --> 01:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
for uh private insurance either um and I
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
would assert that this does not create a
 
01:35:49.189 --> 01:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
two-tiered system in which Medicaid
 
01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
recipients don't have access to
 
01:35:52.109 --> 01:35:52.119 align:start position:0%
something that every everybody else does
 
01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
have access to okay thank you other
 
01:35:58.149 --> 01:35:58.159 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Shapero and
 
01:35:59.830 --> 01:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
01:36:02.990 --> 01:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
Canon thank you Mr chair I just want to
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
respond to representative Leon um and
 
01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
because I research this with um
 
01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Medicaid um you are
 
01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
accurate that um breast augmentation and
 
01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:17.510 align:start position:0%
accurate that um breast augmentation and
breast

01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
breast
 
01:36:21.870 --> 01:36:21.880 align:start position:0%
reduction and um limb lengthening and
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
those jobs are not covered if they're
 
01:36:26.830 --> 01:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
purely cosmetic so I just want to say
 
01:36:29.790 --> 01:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
that that is accurate I still think that
 
01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
the reason that we're constantly talking
 
01:36:35.149 --> 01:36:35.159 align:start position:0%
about what transgender people can or
 
01:36:37.910 --> 01:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
can't do or what can be reimbursed and
 
01:36:39.390 --> 01:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
what can't be
 
01:36:44.070 --> 01:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
reimbursed in my mind is because we are
 
01:36:46.510 --> 01:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
discriminating against one particular
 
01:36:48.550 --> 01:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
group of people and I don't want to be
 
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
doing that just response and was
 
01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
directing that towards me all right very
 
01:36:56.030 --> 01:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
quick um thank you um I I take issue
 
01:36:57.910 --> 01:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
with you saying that it's discriminatory
 
01:37:00.229 --> 01:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
I think that um I think that treating
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
children equally that there's certain
 
01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
medical procedures that simply aren't
 
01:37:05.669 --> 01:37:05.679 align:start position:0%
available to you reach a certain age
 
01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
should be the same for all children and
 
01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
I think that it sets a false expectation
 
01:37:13.149 --> 01:37:13.159 align:start position:0%
of these surgeries being available I
 
01:37:14.709 --> 01:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
view this out of compassion because it
 
01:37:17.709 --> 01:37:17.719 align:start position:0%
sucks to be a teenager for everybody um
 
01:37:19.390 --> 01:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
let's let's focus on the fact that being
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
a teenager is really really hard and
 
01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:23.679 align:start position:0%
support people while not necessarily
 
01:37:26.350 --> 01:37:26.360 align:start position:0%
making it uh making it seem like early
 
01:37:28.510 --> 01:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
surgery is the solution to problems
 
01:37:30.790 --> 01:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
because it's only one factor there we
 
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
have to look at the whole child not just
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
the part that involves a scalpel
 
01:37:36.030 --> 01:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
representative Canon and then
 
01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:38.270 align:start position:0%
representative Canon and then
representative

01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
Murphy if I understand our
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility as a legislature is uh
 
01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
that we're here to protect the the
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
public and our constituents from uh uh
 
01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
problems um and
 
01:37:56.109 --> 01:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
um our charges to put controls in place
 
01:37:59.589 --> 01:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
where none exist uh I contend in in this
 
01:38:02.589 --> 01:38:02.599 align:start position:0%
situation there are um in the medical
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
field there are controls and that part
 
01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
of that is from the world professional
 
01:38:09.589 --> 01:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
association for transgender Health um
 
01:38:12.550 --> 01:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
they don't recommend surgery for anyone
 
01:38:14.270 --> 01:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18 and they would
 
01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
rather that people get to the age to uh
 
01:38:20.750 --> 01:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
of consent of of uh of adults over the
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
age of 18 um that said um I did some
 
01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
investigation on my own and the National
 
01:38:30.629 --> 01:38:30.639 align:start position:0%
Institute for held did uh uh a study it
 
01:38:35.149 --> 01:38:35.159 align:start position:0%
it uh it dates back from uh 2013 to 2020
 
01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
they uh identified 209 surgeries that
 
01:38:41.390 --> 01:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
were done uh out of that uh breast
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
surgeries no genital surgeries the um uh
 
01:38:48.629 --> 01:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
out of that they uh identified one
 
01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
complication and two were post operative
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
regret and neither of those people went
 
01:38:58.030 --> 01:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
um uh un underwent reversal surgery so
 
01:39:00.350 --> 01:39:00.360 align:start position:0%
in those cases um there was there was no
 
01:39:02.430 --> 01:39:02.440 align:start position:0%
Pro no problem that we would have to
 
01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
deal with that this legislation would
 
01:39:07.709 --> 01:39:07.719 align:start position:0%
catch so I I believe that this
 
01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:11.679 align:start position:0%
legislation only puts um government in
 
01:39:14.910 --> 01:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
the way of of the general public and I
 
01:39:16.149 --> 01:39:16.159 align:start position:0%
don't believe it's
 
01:39:19.270 --> 01:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
needed thank you representative Murphy
 
01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll be brief and I I suspect
 
01:39:22.350 --> 01:39:22.360 align:start position:0%
we all know where this is going to fall
 
01:39:24.350 --> 01:39:24.360 align:start position:0%
out in in the vote but I just wanted to
 
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
make a a couple two very um small points
 
01:39:31.629 --> 01:39:31.639 align:start position:0%
basically um this is amazing to me that
 
01:39:34.229 --> 01:39:34.239 align:start position:0%
this is a procedure that gets probably
 
01:39:37.070 --> 01:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
more pre-operative evaluation than any
 
01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
elective procedure I know about so
 
01:39:40.430 --> 01:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
number one I think it's done with
 
01:39:42.350 --> 01:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
thoughtful care for the patient and
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
those in need for it um and number two
 
01:39:48.390 --> 01:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
um I was asking um in when this was
 
01:39:51.149 --> 01:39:51.159 align:start position:0%
presented by uh representative kofalt uh
 
01:39:53.669 --> 01:39:53.679 align:start position:0%
um week or two ago does this include all
 
01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%
surgeries and he said yes I talked to
 
01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
the folks at DH and um they
 
01:40:00.510 --> 01:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
categorically told me that they do not
 
01:40:03.510 --> 01:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
do these surgeries at DH so um I I think
 
01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand that
 
01:40:06.589 --> 01:40:06.599 align:start position:0%
there's sometimes misinformation about
 
01:40:08.350 --> 01:40:08.360 align:start position:0%
what is done and what is not done and
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
they categorically as a tertiary care
 
01:40:12.430 --> 01:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
quary care referral center do not do
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
these procedures thank you thank you
 
01:40:18.350 --> 01:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
other discussion representative Missour
 
01:40:21.390 --> 01:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair I also sorry
 
01:40:24.510 --> 01:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
respectfully take offense to these bills
 
01:40:27.189 --> 01:40:27.199 align:start position:0%
being called discriminatory
 
01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
because the
 
01:40:31.629 --> 01:40:31.639 align:start position:0%
words it was said that we are not
 
01:40:34.149 --> 01:40:34.159 align:start position:0%
talking about that we're talking about
 
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
trans people but this bill is specific
 
01:40:38.990 --> 01:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
to children and we are talking about
 
01:40:42.270 --> 01:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
irreversible procedures on children so
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
this isn't a discriminatory bill on
 
01:40:48.070 --> 01:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
trans people this is a bill protecting
 
01:40:49.629 --> 01:40:49.639 align:start position:0%
children from things that can't be
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
undone so so that's my statement on that
 
01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:55.830 align:start position:0%
undone so so that's my statement on that
other

01:40:55.830 --> 01:40:55.840 align:start position:0%

01:42:28.030 --> 01:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
Canon is there any other discussion on
 
01:42:31.709 --> 01:42:31.719 align:start position:0%
this suspect we've kind of talked it out
 
01:42:32.990 --> 01:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh so when the clerk is ready uh
 
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
representative TZ yeah I um I I just
 
01:42:37.990 --> 01:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
want to follow on with what
 
01:42:40.350 --> 01:42:40.360 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy said that uh in
 
01:42:42.109 --> 01:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
fact we have no evidence that this is
 
01:42:43.950 --> 01:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
happening in children and the only place
 
01:42:45.589 --> 01:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
that does it in New Hampshire says they
 
01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
do not do it it's on their website and
 
01:42:50.510 --> 01:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative Murphy followed that
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
up with with his own inquiry um and then
 
01:42:55.149 --> 01:42:55.159 align:start position:0%
I would say I think it's discriminatory
 
01:42:58.510 --> 01:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
to not provide equal coverage uh to
 
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
people who may happen to be on Medicaid
 
01:43:03.950 --> 01:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason that's a um you know
 
01:43:06.189 --> 01:43:06.199 align:start position:0%
many people can end up on Medicaid for
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
very different reasons in their life and
 
01:43:10.390 --> 01:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
we should not be uh creating barriers
 
01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
for people who may be experiencing
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
harder times at a certain point in their
 
01:43:18.750 --> 01:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
life um so that would be my
 
01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
add-on okay thank you other discussion
 
01:43:24.350 --> 01:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
on motion representative
 
01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
kushman thank you Mr chairman um to that
 
01:43:31.510 --> 01:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
discussion about Dartmouth Hitchcock um
 
01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
respectfully we did hear from them here
 
01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
in the committee and they did not say
 
01:43:38.189 --> 01:43:38.199 align:start position:0%
that it never happens they said it's
 
01:43:40.510 --> 01:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
rare and I'd be interested to know if
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
they would you know State on the record
 
01:43:45.189 --> 01:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
in a legislative hearing that no it's
 
01:43:47.669 --> 01:43:47.679 align:start position:0%
never happened and additionally I
 
01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
requested their policies and procedures
 
01:43:54.990 --> 01:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
and the um body of uh medical literature
 
01:43:58.669 --> 01:43:58.679 align:start position:0%
that they rely on for performing such
 
01:44:02.510 --> 01:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
procedures um and they sent me back
 
01:44:06.669 --> 01:44:06.679 align:start position:0%
two um surveys Behavioral Science
 
01:44:10.070 --> 01:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
surveys um that talked about suicide
 
01:44:14.229 --> 01:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
ideation before and after hormones um
 
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
so I with that I I'm going to
 
01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
respectfully say that I don't have much
 
01:44:22.830 --> 01:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
confidence that this expert organization
 
01:44:26.430 --> 01:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
is providing us a full picture of what's
 
01:44:29.790 --> 01:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
going on with these surgeries and um
 
01:44:31.589 --> 01:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
they have not demonstrated that there's
 
01:44:34.709 --> 01:44:34.719 align:start position:0%
clear uh scientific body of evidence
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
that they're relying for them so um and
 
01:44:39.870 --> 01:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
the main point that I feel for this bill
 
01:44:41.470 --> 01:44:41.480 align:start position:0%
is that it's inappropriate for taxpayers
 
01:44:44.270 --> 01:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
to be paying for elective surgeries like
 
01:44:45.709 --> 01:44:45.719 align:start position:0%
this so thank
 
01:44:48.189 --> 01:44:48.199 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
01:44:50.910 --> 01:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
