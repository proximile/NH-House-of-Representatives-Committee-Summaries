00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
presenter mode um now i i wanted to to
 
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:16.950 align:start position:0%
presenter mode um now i i wanted to to
launch

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
launch
 
00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
into arca but i also wanted to lay a
 
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
little bit of groundwork
 
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
um for getting us to where we are today
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
as we know
 
00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
uh president biden and vice president
 
00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:28.070 align:start position:0%
uh president biden and vice president
harris's

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
harris's
 
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
um uh uh our american rescue plan
 
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
um came on the tales of some other
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
stimulus legislation that happened
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
during the trump administration
 
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
and so some of your cities and towns may
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
actually have
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh some derivative effects from
 
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
previously enacted legislation that i
 
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
thought maybe it'd be good to talk about
 
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
just for a quick moment
 
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
and this is um specifically i'm i'm
 
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
going to move beyond the cares act the
 
00:08:59.430 --> 00:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
cares act passed congress last year on
 
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
march 23rd was enacted on march 23rd and
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
there was coronavirus relief funds that
 
00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
were distributed as
 
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
um the paris act was passed of course
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
now there are there is an extension on
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
the coronavirus relief funds that kind
 
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
of leads us
 
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
into today but also at the end of last
 
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:18.870 align:start position:0%
into today but also at the end of last
year

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
there was an omnibus plan that passed
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
and it's called the coronavirus response
 
00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:25.519 align:start position:0%
and relief supplemental appropriations
 
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
act and if
 
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
if you recall that actually is an
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
extension of
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
the omnibus so it was the budget that
 
00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
had to pass last year
 
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
um uh in in washington but in addition
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
there was a 900
 
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh billion dollar stimulus uh plan that
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
was attached to that
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
and some of those things um are actually
 
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
relevant for your cities counties and
 
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.030 align:start position:0%
relevant for your cities counties and
towns

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
you know but also the state of new
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire so um
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
in the in in the in the plan that passed
 
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of last year the chronovirus
 
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
relief fund
 
00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
funds were were extended so basically
 
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
you can spend those crf
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
funds beyond december 31st 2021
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
another thing that's really important
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
for your cities um and your counties
 
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
is an extension and a re-up of what we
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
call the emergency rental assistance
 
00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
program so
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
25 billion dollars for
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
cities and counties of above a certain
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
threshold in population
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
will receive 25 billion dollars for
 
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
emergency rental assistance
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
um in addition there was education
 
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
stabilization and as we all
 
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
know um an extension of unemployment
 
00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.389 align:start position:0%
know um an extension of unemployment
insurance

00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
another thing that's probably less well
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
known that
 
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
um that a lot of my membership is is
 
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
asking about right now
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
is there was a a low income utility
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
assistance program that was in
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
that act as well 638 million dollars
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
that's kind of sitting right now with
 
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:54.790 align:start position:0%
that's kind of sitting right now with
the

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
um department of health and human
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
services or hhs
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
um and they're still crafting a plan
 
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
about what are the what
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
what are the parameters there how do
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
low-income qualified
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh recipients apply for that but the
 
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
most important thing to your cities
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
counties and towns is that that utility
 
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:12.949 align:start position:0%
counties and towns is that that utility
assistance

00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
could go directly to your um
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
your water programs um or others
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
so so that's an important part of kind
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
of what we're dealing
 
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
now right now with the emergency with
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
with arpa is that there's still some
 
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519 align:start position:0%
legacy or derivative effects of the
 
00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:32.230 align:start position:0%
legacy or derivative effects of the
previous

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
previous
 
00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:35.839 align:start position:0%
two um the previous two stimulus plans
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
that passed in the trump administration
 
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
and so we're still kind of massaging
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
that information out for our membership
 
00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
so they know
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
where that money is coming from and
 
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:45.750 align:start position:0%
where that money is coming from and
where

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
it possibly can go um
 
00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:50.959 align:start position:0%
so let's jump right into it the american
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
rescue plan
 
00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:55.839 align:start position:0%
of 2021 passed on march 11 2021 it was
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
signed by
 
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh president biden um what happens in
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
um in in federal legislative efforts
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
is that um there's there's a timing or a
 
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
clock that's set
 
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
in legislation that says post enactment
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
then uh there's a clock that starts for
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
distribution of those funds so
 
00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:19.839 align:start position:0%
in the american rescue plan act 2021
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
signed on march 11
 
00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:22.839 align:start position:0%
they have 60 days post-enact
 
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
post-enactment to distribute those funds
 
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
um and and the act itself is very very
 
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
large we all know that
 
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
um it's nearly two trillion dollars
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
a very important critical feature i
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
think of it
 
00:12:38.949 --> 00:12:38.959 align:start position:0%
is that it was able to pass with
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
relative ease but it
 
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
very narrow margins so um it was only
 
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
the democrats in the senate that voted
 
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
for the bill but nevertheless they used
 
00:12:48.079 --> 00:12:48.310 align:start position:0%
for the bill but nevertheless they used
a

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
budget tool called reconciliation that
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
allowed for them to pass that bill at a
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
very narrow margin
 
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
and um it was quickly funded and here we
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
are so we're waiting right now
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
during the 60 days post enactment period
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
to understand what the distribution of
 
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
the funds look like
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
um of that 1.9 trillion dollars
 
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh 350 billion dollars is dedicated to
 
00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.670 align:start position:0%
uh 350 billion dollars is dedicated to
states

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
and local governments as you all know
 
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
portion of the funding is 195 billion
 
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.430 align:start position:0%
portion of the funding is 195 billion
dollars

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
and in the act there is a minimum
 
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
threshold distributed equally among the
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
50 states so the 50 states get
 
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
at least 500 million dollars and the
 
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
district of columbia gets 1.25 billion
 
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
now the remaining amount will be
 
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
distributed according to a formula that
 
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
takes into account each shares state
 
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:44.389 align:start position:0%
takes into account each shares state
each

00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
each
 
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
each state's share of the national
 
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
figure of
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
unemployed individuals now probably were
 
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:51.430 align:start position:0%
unemployed individuals now probably were
aware

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
aware
 
00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
um in early march there was a fair
 
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
amount of conversations between
 
00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.230 align:start position:0%
amount of conversations between
governors

00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
governors
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
and the administration to say why are we
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
distributing it according to unemployed
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
individuals as opposed to population
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
um and most of those states uh were
 
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
states that had
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
um had local and regional economies that
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
could withstand the pandemic so they
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
were saying it's not
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
fair we we would prefer for it to be um
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
according to population but nevertheless
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
the way that the
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
final bill was wrote written out um
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
it is actually based on unemployed
 
00:14:29.199 --> 00:14:29.990 align:start position:0%
it is actually based on unemployed
individuals

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh compared to the national share of
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
unemployed individuals um now the
 
00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:38.959 align:start position:0%
one of the most important things about
 
00:14:38.959 --> 00:14:39.910 align:start position:0%
one of the most important things about
um

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
making sure that the money gets to where
 
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
it needs to be
 
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
is that the bill has written into it um
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
a certification
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
process um so for states
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
for example um each state
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
has to certify like for example new
 
00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire has to certify
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
to the united states treasury that they
 
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
will be using that 1.9 billion dollars
 
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
that they've been allocated
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
same thing goes for
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
communities for cities and counties each
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
one of those jurisdictions
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
has to certify with the united states
 
00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.590 align:start position:0%
has to certify with the united states
treasury

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
treasury
 
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
that they will be using those funds
 
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
that's an important part because
 
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
there currently are a lot of gfoa
 
00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:26.959 align:start position:0%
members i can tell you that
 
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
who are asking me when can we certify
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
how do we certify where do we where do
 
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
we send the letter
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
um everybody's ready to certify for
 
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
their funding
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
but yet um there really hasn't been
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
anything yet
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
determining um exactly what
 
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
communities are going to be getting um
 
00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
really very interesting part of a sort
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
of sort of a speed bump along the way
 
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
and the speed bump is of course that you
 
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
can't certify
 
00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
if you don't know what you can spend the
 
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
money on
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
so but there's a lot of heart carts and
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of horses
 
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to make sure that we
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
situate it so that communities
 
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
understand um what they can spend the
 
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
money on
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
another element of section 602
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
of 9901 so this is the state
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
distribution section
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
that i thought was very interesting is
 
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
that in the bill
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh the uh congress passed they give the
 
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
secretary of the treasury so secretary
 
00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:30.629 align:start position:0%
secretary of the treasury so secretary
yellen

00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
yellen
 
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
the authority to split payments to state
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
um she has the authority to distribute
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
the first 50
 
00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
in the first year and if she so decides
 
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
she can
 
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
split that in half and create it another
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
payment 50 percent
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
of of the state's allocation a year
 
00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.509 align:start position:0%
of of the state's allocation a year
later

00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
um though reading it and of course
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
talking with the united states treasury
 
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
and talking with the white house
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
we don't get the sense that secretary
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
ellen intends to do that for the state
 
00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:03.759 align:start position:0%
um we think that that was written into
 
00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
the bill simply to mirror
 
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
um local distribution the way that the
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
local distribution acts
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
um but we don't think that secretary
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
ellen will split those payments but
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
nevertheless i think paul should be
 
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.789 align:start position:0%
nevertheless i think paul should be
aware

00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
aware
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
that the legislative text gives
 
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
secretary yellen permission to split
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
those payments
 
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
12 months apart um
 
00:17:27.669 --> 00:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
one of the really important things about
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
this is that
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
about the legislation itself is that
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
there is a specific clause for
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
recruitment of proceeds um just like in
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
the coronavirus relief fund in this one
 
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
they say
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
should you spend the money outside of
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
the eligible expenditures articulated in
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
then the united states treasury has the
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
authority to recoup those funds so
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
another really important critical
 
00:17:52.559 --> 00:17:53.430 align:start position:0%
another really important critical
feature

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
feature
 
00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:55.039 align:start position:0%
it's not that the treasury is kind of
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
releasing those funds and not auditing
 
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
there will be a specific and a measured
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
approach to auditing those funds how
 
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
states are spending them
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
how local governments are spending them
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
and that's an important feature of the
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
legislative text
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
i want to move on to section 603 so this
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
section 603
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
is an articulation of how cities and
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
counties will be getting
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
their money um so obviously as you know
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
states are going to certify for that 195
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
 
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
they will get a distribution of the
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
proceeds no later than
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
60 days post-enactment now the
 
00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:33.669 align:start position:0%
60 days post-enactment now the
derivative

00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
derivative
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
of the 350 billion dollars the part that
 
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:37.430 align:start position:0%
of the 350 billion dollars the part that
not

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
that is not going to the states is 130
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
billion dollars 130.4
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
and it's it's distributed equally
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
between cities and counties so
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
cities will get 65 billion dollars
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
and counties will get 65 billion dollars
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna go to counties first the
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
distribution to the county source
 
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
because it's actually
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
easier the way that they've written uh
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
counties into the bill is that all
 
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.310 align:start position:0%
counties into the bill is that all
counties

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
counties
 
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
across the united states will receive 65
 
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
 
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
and the distribution of it is based on
 
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
the community development block formula
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
for counties and if they are
 
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
not entitlements counties that is they
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
are not cdbg
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
recipients they will
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
receive a distribution based on the
 
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.630 align:start position:0%
receive a distribution based on the
population

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
and in the in the legislative text
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
congress was really careful to say
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
you know what um if you do have a cdbg
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
formula you fall in a cdbg formula but
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
yet we look at your population and your
 
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.470 align:start position:0%
yet we look at your population and your
population

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
puts you at a larger amount than your cd
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
share your pro rate of share is greater
 
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
than your cdb share
 
00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
will grow with we'll go with the greater
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
of the two
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
and so that's a relatively easy um
 
00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
figure because if you look at the
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
counties across the country i think
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
there are 84
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
000 counties across the country or i'm
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
sorry 8 400 counties
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
across the country um and so the
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
distribution is relatively easy
 
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
cities get a little bit more complicated
 
00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.070 align:start position:0%
cities get a little bit more complicated
because

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
there are cities uh there are
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of cities that are
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
not cdbg recipients
 
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
and so what congress has done is they
 
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.710 align:start position:0%
and so what congress has done is they
said

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
um the larger of the counties so we're
 
00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
taking that 65 billion dollars and for
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
the larger of the cities those that have
 
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
a population
 
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
over 50 000 they'll receive
 
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
45.5 billion according to their cdbg
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
allocation so a very easy number that
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
they can pluck from
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
housing and urban development or hud
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
they can just
 
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
pull out that cdbg formula and use that
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
formula to distribute that 45.5 billion
 
00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.390 align:start position:0%
formula to distribute that 45.5 billion
dollars

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit more complicated when
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
we talk about
 
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
towns in smaller cities whose population
 
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:09.990 align:start position:0%
towns in smaller cities whose population
is

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
underneath that 50 000 threshold i have
 
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
to be very
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
clear here though um 50
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
000 in population is not necessarily a
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
bright line
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
for cdbg recipients a town can be
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
45 000 in population and still be a cbbg
 
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.430 align:start position:0%
45 000 in population and still be a cbbg
recipient

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
recipient
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
so if that city or town
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
is a cdbg recipient they will be in that
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
first formula
 
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
they'll get 45.5 billion dollars
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
if they are not then they will receive
 
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
a distribution uh based on their
 
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
population share
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
and i would imagine in new hampshire
 
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
there's probably a fair amount of
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions that fall in that category
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
one of the most important elements of
 
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
this middle
 
00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
bullet point the smaller jurisdictions i
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
think for you
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
in particular is that those monies
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
will flow through the state in the
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
legislative text
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
they said that money that is reserved
 
00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
for those smaller jurisdictions
 
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
will flow through the state the state
 
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
will get the allocation
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
for the smaller jurisdictions and then
 
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
the state will be responsible
 
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
for distribution of those funds to the
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
smaller jurisdictions
 
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
they also put another restriction on it
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
they say
 
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
state you must take that money and
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
distribute it to the
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
smaller jurisdictions but in addition
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
qualifier is that you can't give more
 
00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:48.559 align:start position:0%
than 75 of their most recent budget
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
and that's baffled a fair amount of
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
states i've got to be honest with you
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
i'm talking with you know obviously
 
00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
virginia wisconsin uh nebraska
 
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
texas a lot of the states across the
 
00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:00.630 align:start position:0%
texas a lot of the states across the
country

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:03.039 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily collect their local
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
communities budget
 
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
and so in order to ensure that the
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
distribution does not
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
exceed 75 of the smaller community's
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
most recent budget
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
that will require some homework some
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
extra work on behalf of the states to
 
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
ensure that
 
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
the distribution to those smaller
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
communities does not exceed 75 percent
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
of their most recent budget
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
and and another important thing of
 
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
course is that
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
um there is a time parameter based on
 
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.909 align:start position:0%
um there is a time parameter based on
this

00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
so in the legislative text obviously
 
00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:44.799 align:start position:0%
you have so march 11 the president
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
signed the bill
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
he has 60 days to distribute the funds
 
00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
but because states are responsible for
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
distributing the money to those smaller
 
00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.870 align:start position:0%
distributing the money to those smaller
jurisdictions

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
there's actually another claw that's
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
built into the legislation so
 
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:02.799 align:start position:0%
60 days post enactment and then inside
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
the legislative text they say for states
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
that have to redistribute to smaller
 
00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.070 align:start position:0%
that have to redistribute to smaller
jurisdictions

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
you have another 30 days to make that
 
00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.269 align:start position:0%
you have another 30 days to make that
happen

00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
they're giving you another 30 days so
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
technically 90 days
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
post march 11th then
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
additionally in the legislative text
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
they've given you the opportunity
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
to appeal for more time
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
so you have two different periods of
 
00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:30.559 align:start position:0%
time where you can appeal for another 30
 
00:24:30.559 --> 00:24:31.510 align:start position:0%
time where you can appeal for another 30
days

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
in order to get those funds out and the
 
00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:35.190 align:start position:0%
in order to get those funds out and the
appeal

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
basically is the state the state
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
executive uh calling
 
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
calling the treasury saying we need
 
00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
another 60 days and here's why we need
 
00:24:42.159 --> 00:24:42.870 align:start position:0%
another 60 days and here's why we need
another

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
we need another 30 days and another 30
 
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
days we need another 60 days
 
00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
distributes funds and it's very likely
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
what i anticipate from other states
 
00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.549 align:start position:0%
what i anticipate from other states
certainly

00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
it's very likely that they will be
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
trying to make ensure
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
that they comply with the legislative um
 
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
text um condition
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
that the distribution cannot exceed 75
 
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
of their most recent budget again
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
so that's just a really important
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
qualifier for states
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
um one one thing that my members have
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
brought up to me of course
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
is um with the single audit act
 
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh the smaller communities are wondering
 
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
if in fact they are sub-recipients of
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
the state and therefore have to comply
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
with the state requirements as opposed
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
to the local requirements so we're
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking with treasury about that
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
for section 603 uh which is again the
 
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
distribution to the localities
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
the legislative text is very specific
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
payments to local
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
governments will absolutely be made in
 
00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
two tranches so
 
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
unlike the state where they've said
 
00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:48.710 align:start position:0%
unlike the state where they've said
secretary

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
secretary
 
00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
ellen has the option of sending out the
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
money into
 
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
tranches in the local government section
 
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
they're very clear to say that payments
 
00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
to local governments
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
will be made in two tranches by the
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
united states treasury
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
the first half those localities will get
 
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
60 days after enactment
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
and the second half will come exactly
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
one year later so if let's say they
 
00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
um aren't able to distribute the funds
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
by may 11th
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh local governments will receive their
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
first tranche on may 11
 
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
2021 and their second tranche on may 11
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
2022. so important sort of qualifying
 
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
factors of when the money goes out the
 
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.350 align:start position:0%
factors of when the money goes out the
timing

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
timing
 
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
um and the parameters on those monies um
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
is definitely articulated in the
 
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
legislative text
 
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
now what's a little bit more ambiguous
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to sit on the slide for
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
just a minute
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
is how uh jurisdictions can spend the
 
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:43.669 align:start position:0%
is how uh jurisdictions can spend the
money

00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
and as i understand this conversation
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
today is to try to take to the bottom
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
of that um so so let me let me first
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
talk about each one of the eligible uses
 
00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
and eligible use a looks very familiar
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
to coronavirus relief fund recipients
 
00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
so in the cares act the crf funds they
 
00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.029 align:start position:0%
so in the cares act the crf funds they
were

00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
very um very specific about the fact
 
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
that you could only use the money
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
to respond to public health emergency
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
with respect to covet 19. so the current
 
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
awareness relief fund or the crf funds
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
were subject to that restriction
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
but in this legislation they take that
 
00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:26.630 align:start position:0%
but in this legislation they take that
restriction

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
restriction
 
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
and then they expand on it substantially
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
um one thing that they do in eligible
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
use a and i
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
i i'll point it out to you in line two
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
of the first bullet
 
00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
they add on three words for its negative
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
economic impacts so that is something
 
00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
that's totally different than the cares
 
00:27:47.679 --> 00:27:48.630 align:start position:0%
that's totally different than the cares
act

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
act
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
negative economic impacts could be
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
interpreted many different ways but
 
00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:55.039 align:start position:0%
a lot of your finance officers who are
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
my members um
 
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
you know obviously if this is a federal
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
grant we want to make sure that we're
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
using the money according to the
 
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
to legislative intent so what we need
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
is a better definition of the negative
 
00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:08.549 align:start position:0%
is a better definition of the negative
economic

00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
economic
 
00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
impacts of the public health emergency
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
for example some of my jurisdictions
 
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
have called and said well what if we had
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance
 
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
during covid19 and we need to
 
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
patch up roadways is that a negative
 
00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:23.909 align:start position:0%
patch up roadways is that a negative
economic

00:28:23.909 --> 00:28:23.919 align:start position:0%
economic
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
impact of the public health emergency um
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
we do not have any more definition on
 
00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
what negative economic impacts means but
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
if you look at the rest of the eligible
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
use a
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
they give you an idea maybe you're
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh assistance to small businesses that
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
was certainly something that the
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
coronavirus relief fund was being used
 
00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:45.909 align:start position:0%
coronavirus relief fund was being used
for

00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:49.039 align:start position:0%
what about assistance to non-profit or
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
impacted industries in areas that depend
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
on tourism and hospitality revenues
 
00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
so they give you an idea in the rest of
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
that eligible you say
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
that that that possibly some negative
 
00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:02.799 align:start position:0%
economic impacts could be that but it's
 
00:29:02.799 --> 00:29:03.110 align:start position:0%
economic impacts could be that but it's
not

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
limited to that so a very important
 
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
element of lgbt
 
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
in eligible use b this is entirely new
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
something totally different from
 
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
the coronavirus relief fund what an
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
eligible usb
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
is saying is that states and local
 
00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.350 align:start position:0%
is saying is that states and local
governments

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
governments
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
can use the arpa funds to respond to
 
00:29:25.039 --> 00:29:25.750 align:start position:0%
can use the arpa funds to respond to
workers

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
workers
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
performing essential work during the 19
 
00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.549 align:start position:0%
performing essential work during the 19
emergency

00:29:30.549 --> 00:29:30.559 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
and the states and local governments can
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
provide them premium pay
 
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
to eligible workers
 
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
what's a great thing about this clause
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
is that there's a lot of definitions of
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
each one of these words
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
inside of the legislative text so we
 
00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
have a little bit more understanding and
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
eligible usb
 
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
of what qualifies so first of all they
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
define the word
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
premium pay they say
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
you can provide up to thirteen dollars
 
00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
per hour
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
additional pay uh to these employees not
 
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
to exceed
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand dollars in the in
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
the calendar year
 
00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
then they also define eligible workers
 
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
they say eligible workers are an
 
00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.149 align:start position:0%
they say eligible workers are an
employee

00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
employee
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
of the state or local government
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
who are deemed essential by the
 
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.149 align:start position:0%
who are deemed essential by the
executive

00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
executive
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
so essentially if we're talking about
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire it would be
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
the executive of the state determines
 
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
who is an eligible worker
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
and who is not an eligible worker i've
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
talked to several communities across the
 
00:30:35.279 --> 00:30:36.310 align:start position:0%
talked to several communities across the
country

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
that their executives let's say it's a
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
county administrator executive
 
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
who are saying well all of my employees
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
performed essential work
 
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
and all of them are eligible workers
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
nowhere in the legislative text is that
 
00:30:50.399 --> 00:30:51.590 align:start position:0%
nowhere in the legislative text is that
limiting

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
limiting
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
so you kind of think about that if an
 
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
executive determines that
 
00:30:57.029 --> 00:30:57.039 align:start position:0%
all of his or her employees are
 
00:30:57.039 --> 00:30:58.389 align:start position:0%
all of his or her employees are
essential

00:30:58.389 --> 00:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
essential
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
that is absolutely allowed in this in
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
the legislative text given the
 
00:31:02.159 --> 00:31:03.430 align:start position:0%
the legislative text given the
parameters

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
parameters
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
so again that's thirteen dollars per
 
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
hour not to exceed twenty five thousand
 
00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
or an eligible worker that's determined
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
four eligible you see now this is a
 
00:31:18.149 --> 00:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
little bit more complicated
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
um a little bit more complicated to
 
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
measure at this point because we don't
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
have a whole lot of definition
 
00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:27.039 align:start position:0%
in in eligible uc so what eligible you
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
see is getting at
 
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
before we start in the in the words what
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
it's getting at is it's saying
 
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of communities across the country
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
have lost revenue
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
due to the pandemic now for communities
 
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
that could mean
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
for lots of communities across the
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
country it could mean sales taxes it
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
could mean property taxes and it could
 
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
mean income taxes obviously new
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
hampshire is unique
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
florida is unique in that there's no
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
income tax so there's you know some
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
communities have one of
 
00:31:57.669 --> 00:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
two of three of those some of them have
 
00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
all three
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
and many of them have have had to dip
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
into reserves
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
in order to provide the vaccine or in
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
order to
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
provide for coronavirus uh the
 
00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
coronavirus pandemic to their
 
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.789 align:start position:0%
coronavirus pandemic to their
communities

00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
and so what congress is telling us about
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
eligible you see
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
is that they're saying you can claim
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
that loss of revenue
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
and use it for the provision of
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
government services
 
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
so let's say the town of emily has lost
 
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
10 percent of her sales tax revenue
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
um what i can do according to eligible
 
00:32:37.919 --> 00:32:39.029 align:start position:0%
um what i can do according to eligible
uc

00:32:39.029 --> 00:32:39.039 align:start position:0%
uc
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
is i can look at the loss that i
 
00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.310 align:start position:0%
is i can look at the loss that i
incurred

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
incurred
 
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
back in 2020 and i can account for that
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
even though i booked the loss back in
 
00:32:46.399 --> 00:32:47.750 align:start position:0%
even though i booked the loss back in
2020

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
2020
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
i can claim that as an eligible use in
 
00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.310 align:start position:0%
i can claim that as an eligible use in
2021.

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
2021.
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
so if i had say an 8 reduction in my
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
sales tax revenue collection
 
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
i could theoretically take eight percent
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
those expected revenues and use that as
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
an eligible use
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
now it gets complicated let's say
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
you have a community who owns and
 
00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
operates a municipal zoo
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
obviously you haven't had revenue from
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
that municipal zoo operations in quite
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
some time
 
00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:21.919 align:start position:0%
because there hasn't been a community
 
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
going there paying revenues to get in so
 
00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:24.470 align:start position:0%
going there paying revenues to get in so
there's

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
there's been there's been an actual loss
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
in an enterprise
 
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
in your community and that's the zoo the
 
00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
question for eligible uc
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
is can i book that loss from the zoo
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
and then recoup those funds and put them
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
back into my general fund
 
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
in eligible uc there's no there doesn't
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
appear to be any restrictions
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
on the fact that you've lost revenue in
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
one category and you can take that
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
eligible use and put it in another
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
category of the government
 
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of conversation right
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
now for communities saying
 
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
can i take a book loss on my port
 
00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
or on my zoo or on an other um
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
enterprise of the government and then
 
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
use that money to replenish my rainy day
 
00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.470 align:start position:0%
use that money to replenish my rainy day
funds

00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
so that's certainly a question for the
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
treasury that we're hoping to get more
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
clarity on
 
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
in the future certainly within 60 days
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
the last eligible use category is very
 
00:34:23.919 --> 00:34:24.950 align:start position:0%
the last eligible use category is very
explicit

00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
explicit
 
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
it's very it's almost painfully explicit
 
00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
um what they say is you can use this
 
00:34:34.069 --> 00:34:34.079 align:start position:0%
money an eligible use of arpa is that
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
you can make
 
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
necessary investments in water sewer or
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
broadband infrastructure
 
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
for a lot of communities across the
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
country they're saying well that's kind
 
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
of limiting
 
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
what if i have school repairs or hvac
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
systems that i need to
 
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
to do what if there are parks and
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
recreation facilities that need upkeep
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
what if there's
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
other capital projects that i need to
 
00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:01.599 align:start position:0%
invest in is is eligible use d
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
limiting my possibilities of using this
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
money for
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
capital improvements or capital plans
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
so i mean i think for most of us as
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the eligible use
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
category d we're saying well that's a
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
good suggestion but
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
where else can capital projects fit
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
in these eligible uses could i
 
00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.710 align:start position:0%
in these eligible uses could i
conceivably

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
conceivably
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
use the loss of revenue in eligible use
 
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
c and spend that on say a fire station
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
so i booked a loss of the zoo it happens
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
to be the exact amount of money that i
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
need for a police station
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
could i use that and then therefore i
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
have those capital projects that i can
 
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:41.599 align:start position:0%
take up
 
00:35:43.829 --> 00:35:43.839 align:start position:0%
that i can use this money on that will
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
help me to
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
both receive rescue and look forward to
 
00:35:47.359 --> 00:35:49.510 align:start position:0%
both receive rescue and look forward to
recovery

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
recovery
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
um so but really quickly let me touch on
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
so those those are what you can spend
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
the money on
 
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
they're also very explicit about two
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
things that you cannot
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
spend the money on can not
 
00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh in the state section 602 you
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
cannot be used to directly or indirectly
 
00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:09.829 align:start position:0%
cannot be used to directly or indirectly
offset

00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
offset
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
tax reductions or delay a tax
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
increase which is very
 
00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
complicating for a lot of states and
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
their plans for this money
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine if you're looking at
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
all of those eligible use categories
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
they're easier in some cases for local
 
00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
governments to implement for example
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
premium pay easier for local governments
 
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
to implement
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
um the elevate the public health
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
emergency and boots on the ground that's
 
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
those are easier to implement for local
 
00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:41.510 align:start position:0%
those are easier to implement for local
governments

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
governments
 
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
so you look at the restrictions and you
 
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
say yourself okay well
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
states actually you know there's a lot
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
of things that states are trying to do
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
to keep up with the tax credits that
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
were built into the current legislation
 
00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
but also yeah you know that's what
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
states are
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
they they are they they collect the
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
taxes they spend the taxes this is this
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
is how
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
states operate and so when that
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
restriction was put in at the last
 
00:37:05.839 --> 00:37:06.630 align:start position:0%
restriction was put in at the last
minute

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
minute
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of states that kind of
 
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
seized up and said okay
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
um now i need a little bit more clarity
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
on what i can spend the money on
 
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
and so um a lot of state governors
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
called secretary ellen and said what
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
exactly do you mean by that restriction
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
and what secretary ellen said what she
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
said was
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know funds are fungible i think i
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of people who've
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
been using that term over the past two
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
weeks funds are fungible
 
00:37:36.069 --> 00:37:36.079 align:start position:0%
and what she means is you can kind of
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
take that money
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
and put it elsewhere in the government
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
where you have general fund revenue that
 
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
then would allow you to
 
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
directly or indirectly offset tax
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
reductions or delay taxes so
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
um she's kind of saying don't take that
 
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
pot of money and put it directly
 
00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:54.079 align:start position:0%
into tax reduction put it elsewhere in
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
the government so that the government
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
then using fund accounting can figure
 
00:37:57.599 --> 00:37:57.910 align:start position:0%
then using fund accounting can figure
out

00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
sort of those big chess pieces and allow
 
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
for the state to
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
efficiently use their 195 billion dollar
 
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
distribution the other restriction that
 
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
was very clear and was in there from the
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
very beginning
 
00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
both in the house bill and the senate
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
bill was that funds cannot be deposited
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
into any pension fund and again um
 
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
that it's very explicit that's that
 
00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
that's exactly in the ledge text
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
funds cannot be deposited into any
 
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
pension funds so in theory
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
um it would be that you can't take the
 
00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.430 align:start position:0%
um it would be that you can't take the
1.9

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
1.9
 
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
trillion or a billion dollars you can't
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
take that and just put it directly over
 
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
into the pension fund
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
but a lot of your local governments are
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
looking at that restriction and saying
 
00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:44.470 align:start position:0%
looking at that restriction and saying
well

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
what if i wanted to cover payroll does
 
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
that mean that i have to explicitly
 
00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.790 align:start position:0%
that mean that i have to explicitly
separate

00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
separate
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
compensation from benefits and
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
specifically for those who are earning
 
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
pension benefits
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
do i have to explicitly separate the two
 
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
so we're asking treasury again for
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
clarification on that
 
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
and the last restriction on the funds is
 
00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:06.870 align:start position:0%
and the last restriction on the funds is
that

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
funding has to be um available through
 
00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:13.839 align:start position:0%
and must be spent by the end of calendar
 
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
year 2024 so the clock is ticking
 
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
starting now through the end of 2024 to
 
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
um recently we got a call from the white
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
house and the treasury
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
and they said um they said do your
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
members have any questions about the way
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
that this money can be spent
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
and we said yes lots and we have lots of
 
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.390 align:start position:0%
and we said yes lots and we have lots of
questions

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
and what they did is they sent us sort
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
of categorically what they wanted to
 
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
know they were saying
 
00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
um okay so do your people have any
 
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
questions about
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
the eligible use categories do you know
 
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
what they want to spend it on already
 
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:55.839 align:start position:0%
and what have you learned
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
from the coronavirus relief fund
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
and so a couple of a couple of big
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
categories of course
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
fall within that permissible use
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
category we want to make sure
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
that when you're looking at revenue
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
replacement that you can look
 
00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:12.309 align:start position:0%
replacement that you can look
retroactively

00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
retroactively
 
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
or if you're talking about premium pay
 
00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
that you can look retroactively
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
one of the greatest challenges with the
 
00:40:19.829 --> 00:40:19.839 align:start position:0%
ledge text the literal
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the ledge text is
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
there's not very good interpretations of
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
the covered period
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
are we looking backwards are we looking
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
forward if we are talking about revenue
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
replacement are we talking about revenue
 
00:40:31.599 --> 00:40:32.630 align:start position:0%
replacement are we talking about revenue
replacement

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
in 2023 if so what am i comparing that
 
00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.349 align:start position:0%
in 2023 if so what am i comparing that
to

00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
so a lot of questions for the treasury
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
about can you help us define what the
 
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
covered periods are
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
so we know how we can certify these
 
00:40:45.359 --> 00:40:47.190 align:start position:0%
so we know how we can certify these
funds

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we mentioned to
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
treasury and and the white house as we
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
were talking to them
 
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
is that the qualifications of the
 
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
restrictions on the use of revenue
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
we really wanted for states to better
 
00:40:59.119 --> 00:41:00.230 align:start position:0%
we really wanted for states to better
understand

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
what that meant directly or indirectly
 
00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:03.510 align:start position:0%
what that meant directly or indirectly
offset

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
offset
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
the tax increases um
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
the the last thing i wanted to mention
 
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
when talking with the treasury
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
um we made it clear that there's a lot
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
of urgency
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
in our membership a lot of folks are
 
00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079 align:start position:0%
ready to certify those proceeds
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
but we don't have an idea about how they
 
00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
can certify the proceeds or what the
 
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
eligible expenditures are
 
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
and so we asked treasury is there any
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
way to speed up
 
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
or get us more information about
 
00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
specifically maybe maybe
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
examples of what the eligible uses
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
are give us a couple examples so we can
 
00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
start building out those certifications
 
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
and what they told us and i think it's
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
important to share with you is that they
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
getting out the guidance might take the
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
full 60 days
 
00:41:50.069 --> 00:41:50.079 align:start position:0%
that they're not ready to put out the
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
guidance yet on
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
um the arp of funds so we have to be
 
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
patient in some ways
 
00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
but also understand as we're talking
 
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
with treasury and as you all are talking
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
with treasury and as there's
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
conversations happening
 
00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
that i think treasury is learning that
 
00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:07.839 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of learning that has
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
occurred since the use of the
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
coronavirus relief funds
 
00:42:13.109 --> 00:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
and we do we do have a treasury that's
 
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
listening to our concern so i think that
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
that's a really good sign here that we
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
can teach them
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
what's happening how what our concerns
 
00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
are and that how they can clarify those
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
eligibility to proceed
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
better giveaway
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
uh came together my membership came
 
00:42:29.599 --> 00:42:29.990 align:start position:0%
uh came together my membership came
together

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
and said there's a lot of ambiguity in
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
these funds and there's a lot of
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of plans already being
 
00:42:36.319 --> 00:42:37.430 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of plans already being
made

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
um so your finance directors your budget
 
00:42:42.069 --> 00:42:42.079 align:start position:0%
officers your tax assessors and
 
00:42:42.079 --> 00:42:43.349 align:start position:0%
officers your tax assessors and
collectors

00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
collectors
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
um who are my members came together and
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
said can we set up some principles
 
00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
some core principles for the finance
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
officers having conversations with their
 
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
elected officials
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
and these are things that you probably
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
have already thought about yourself and
 
00:42:59.910 --> 00:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
your committees
 
00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
um certainly something that's being
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
articulated every day in city and
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
town and county councils but the fact is
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
um these arpa funds are temporary
 
00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
they have to be spent by 2024.
 
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
and so there are some communities across
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
the country i think what we're trying to
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
do is sort of
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
balance the logic of the fact that there
 
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
are some communities that were
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
significantly harder
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
hit by the pandemic who had to dip into
 
00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:29.910 align:start position:0%
hit by the pandemic who had to dip into
reserves

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
reserves
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
and so ensuring that those communities
 
00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:33.589 align:start position:0%
and so ensuring that those communities
understand

00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
replenishment of reserves should be a
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
high priority and the reason for that is
 
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
so that they can
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
rebuild that they can recover that they
 
00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:44.230 align:start position:0%
rebuild that they can recover that they
can

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
be rescued from the pandemic so a
 
00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
a clear guidance from gfoa saying
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
make sure that you prioritize that
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
replenishment of reserves
 
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
on the other hand if you have money left
 
00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:57.670 align:start position:0%
on the other hand if you have money left
over

00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
or if you didn't have to dip into
 
00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:02.079 align:start position:0%
reserves and you are thinking about
 
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
either critical infrastructure or
 
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
in a creation of new programs we offered
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
a couple sort of cautionary statements
 
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
they said if you're
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
if you're thinking about critical
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
infrastructure consider that you may
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
already have a list
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
you may have a capital improvement plan
 
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
or a structural budget that
 
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
allows for investment in critical
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructure this would be a unique
 
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity for you to be able to do
 
00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:27.270 align:start position:0%
opportunity for you to be able to do
that

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
to use those funds on that um
 
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
last but not least a cautionary
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
cautionary statement to those who are
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
programs or add-ons to programs is that
 
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
if they do require an ongoing financial
 
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
commitment that's something that should
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
be documented because you need to be
 
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
sustain that program through 2024. if
 
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
you use the grant funds to create a new
 
00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:50.870 align:start position:0%
you use the grant funds to create a new
program

00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
consider that those are going to have to
 
00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
be ongoing concerns
 
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
throughout and beyond that 2024 time
 
00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:59.109 align:start position:0%
throughout and beyond that 2024 time
frame

00:44:59.109 --> 00:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
frame
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
another thing we wanted to make sure
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
that local jurisdictions
 
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
and i think this is especially important
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
for you all as you're thinking about the
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
relationship between the state and the
 
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
local governments
 
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
we wanted to get to the local government
 
00:45:14.309 --> 00:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
level and say listen
 
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
local governments states are going to
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
have a lot of initiatives
 
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
based on their their receipt of these
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
arpa funds
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
so make sure there is that communication
 
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
between the local government and the
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
state government
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
so everybody understands how those funds
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
are being used
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
but it's not just state local
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
governments that are receiving
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
arpa rescue funds there are
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
pk 12 there's economic development
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
there's transportation money going out
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
there and so we told the local
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
governments you know
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
as you're considering and you're talking
 
00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
with your county councils and your town
 
00:45:49.359 --> 00:45:50.630 align:start position:0%
with your county councils and your town
councils

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
councils
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
consider that there may be other
 
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
recipients in your community
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
and if you can partner or maybe even
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
create cooperative spending programs
 
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
then you can augment the rescue on
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
behalf of the community so
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
another consideration for local
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
and then last but not least one thing we
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure
 
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
that gfoa members understood and i i
 
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
think they have a very
 
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
strong understanding of this um is is
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
sort of the concept of patience and time
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
um yes the funds have to be spent by
 
00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:27.589 align:start position:0%
um yes the funds have to be spent by
2024

00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
2024
 
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
but also consider you have until 2024
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
and the local governments as
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
as you all you can see local governments
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
are particularly um sort of staged
 
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
because they have that two
 
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
tranche distribution they only get half
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
the first year and they
 
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
only get half the second year so there's
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
a natural governor
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
built in to the local spending programs
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
so it allows for the finance director to
 
00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:56.230 align:start position:0%
so it allows for the finance director to
say

00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:46:59.589 --> 00:46:59.599 align:start position:0%
hang on a second should we solicit
 
00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:01.839 align:start position:0%
you know um information back from our
 
00:47:01.839 --> 00:47:02.950 align:start position:0%
you know um information back from our
communities

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:05.839 align:start position:0%
should we take a second to look at what
 
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
the first tranche did
 
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
and then reassess how we can utilize
 
00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
that second tranche
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
before 2024 so that timing element was
 
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
something that our membership thought
 
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
was really important for
 
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
local finance officers to have that
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
conversation with their
 
00:47:24.549 --> 00:47:24.559 align:start position:0%
uh with their decision-making bodies
 
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
um those of course are are sort of key
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
things those aren't the only things
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
um one of the other major things of
 
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
course that communities are thinking
 
00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:33.990 align:start position:0%
course that communities are thinking
about

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
is um capital infrastructure and
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
physical infrastructure and investment
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
and um we just wanted four communities
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
to better understand that structural
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
integrity of what you're about to spend
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
it on
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
is a structural integrity that will lead
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
to recovery so
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
again just trying to make sure that the
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
gfoa members
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
and that communities across the country
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
understand what this should be used for
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
and how it should be used
 
00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
um that's the conclusion of my written
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
statement or my
 
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
rather the powerpoint slides as i have
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
it but i'm certainly happy to take
 
00:48:07.119 --> 00:48:09.030 align:start position:0%
it but i'm certainly happy to take
questions

00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
well thank you that was excellent
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
it raises a lot of questions
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
but it also gives us more understanding
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
of what's happening
 
00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
so questions from the committee
 
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
or the joining senators
 
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i've got a couple of
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
questions on that um
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
previously um uh what do you call it
 
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
critical workers
 
00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
had been defined by the secretary of
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
treasury does
 
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
the previous definition of who was a uh
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
worker go by the boards and there's now
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
a new one being developed by the new
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
secretary of treasury
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
so the definition of essential workers
 
00:48:57.839 --> 00:48:58.230 align:start position:0%
so the definition of essential workers
is

00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
now given to the executive of the entity
 
00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:02.390 align:start position:0%
now given to the executive of the entity
so

00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
the local government executive or the
 
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
state government executive or tribal or
 
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
territorial uh or territory executive
 
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
you make the definition about who is
 
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
performing the essential work
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
and determine those eligible workers
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's a definition that was included in
 
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
the legislative text
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
well to follow up on that miss brock
 
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you mr uh mr chair um
 
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
previously uh banking institutions uh
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
um financial operations were considered
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
essential workers
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
i don't think that a local um executive
 
00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:41.270 align:start position:0%
i don't think that a local um executive
uh

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
understands the breadth and width of
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
definition are are banks no longer
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
essential under this
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
that's correct so essential workers are
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
defined as
 
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
workers of the state local government
 
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
territory or tribal government so
 
00:49:59.670 --> 00:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
um it would not extend so if for example
 
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
if a
 
00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
community is working with a contractor
 
00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:04.559 align:start position:0%
for example that's outside of the
 
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
employment of the jurisdiction and so
 
00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:06.950 align:start position:0%
employment of the jurisdiction and so
therefore

00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
can't be determined to be um that that
 
00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:10.710 align:start position:0%
can't be determined to be um that that
ele

00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
ele
 
00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:12.559 align:start position:0%
ineligible for being the essential
 
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
worker having that definition
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
i would like to get as many participants
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
asking questions
 
00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
one more okay um
 
00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:30.559 align:start position:0%
this would be for example uh county
 
00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:31.839 align:start position:0%
nursing homes uh
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
here we have county nursing homes which
 
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
are operated by the
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
county governments which the budget is
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
set up by
 
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
the representatives uh in the county
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
commissioners of the county so could
 
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
this money be used for example
 
00:50:56.069 --> 00:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
to pay for air filtering systems that
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
were installed
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
and extra staff and paying for sick
 
00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:01.750 align:start position:0%
and extra staff and paying for sick
leave

00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
leave
 
00:51:05.589 --> 00:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
and such like so in terms of the
 
00:51:05.599 --> 00:51:06.470 align:start position:0%
and such like so in terms of the
employment

00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
employment
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
of the individuals at the nursing
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
facility it does
 
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
it what really matters is how those
 
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities are incorporated if
 
00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:15.589 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities are incorporated if
they

00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
if they are a governmental entity then
 
00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:19.109 align:start position:0%
if they are a governmental entity then
they

00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
fall underneath the governmental entity
 
00:51:21.119 --> 00:51:22.309 align:start position:0%
fall underneath the governmental entity
classification

00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
classification
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
um and so therefore fall underneath the
 
00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:26.950 align:start position:0%
um and so therefore fall underneath the
um

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
the executive's definition um so that
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
executive then would make the
 
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
determination whether it's of the county
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
or of the state
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
if they are performing essential work um
 
00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:37.510 align:start position:0%
if they are performing essential work um
but

00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
with regard to i think your second
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
question which is let's say we need to
 
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
revamp these um infrastructure
 
00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:44.710 align:start position:0%
revamp these um infrastructure
facilities

00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:51:47.589 --> 00:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
um is that an eligible expenditure
 
00:51:47.599 --> 00:51:48.150 align:start position:0%
um is that an eligible expenditure
listed

00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
listed
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
in um the eligible use categories a
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
through d
 
00:51:53.309 --> 00:51:53.319 align:start position:0%
so no nursing facilities are not
 
00:51:53.319 --> 00:51:54.549 align:start position:0%
so no nursing facilities are not
explicitly

00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
explicitly
 
00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
um identified in subcategories it
 
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
through d
 
00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
however on the other hand if there was
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
revenue loss or if there was specific
 
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
expenditures occurred as a result of the
 
00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:07.910 align:start position:0%
expenditures occurred as a result of the
pandemic

00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
then those categories fall underneath
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
eligible use category a
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
those covid 19 expenditures do fall
 
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
within that eligible use category a so
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
that was what i would lean heavily on
 
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
if you're considering infrastructure
 
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
upkeep for
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
things that um that that
 
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
that were down that were run down as a
 
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
negative economic impact of covet 19. so
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
i think that falls clearly within
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
eligible use category a thank you it's
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
very timely emily how much time do you
 
00:52:39.599 --> 00:52:40.069 align:start position:0%
very timely emily how much time do you
have

00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
so um i i have 30 more minutes
 
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um next is
 
00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
going to be tactic of romney followed by
 
00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
representative almy
 
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
senator ryder and representative elliot
 
00:52:56.790 --> 00:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
one question and one follow-up
 
00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative bromley
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh thank you miss
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
brook uh nice presentation
 
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is that uh treasury
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
secretary yellen hasn't finalized her
 
00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
rules at the same time the 60-day clock
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
is ticking
 
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
i'm having trouble reconciling those uh
 
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
how do how does how do town cities the
 
00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:19.829 align:start position:0%
how do how does how do town cities the
state

00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:19.839 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
counties do that there are a lot of
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
um plans being plans being made
 
00:53:29.349 --> 00:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
without uh official guidance out from
 
00:53:31.109 --> 00:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
the treasury yet and what towns
 
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
and cities and counties and states are
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
are doing is they're
 
00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
interpreting the the literal
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the legislative texts
 
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
so they're starting to write plans based
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
on the literal interpretation of the
 
00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:43.750 align:start position:0%
on the literal interpretation of the
text

00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
text
 
00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
of course i think the most important
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
point of our our
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
of our considerations piece for gfoa and
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
our membership is
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
to take a little bit of time
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest challenges
 
00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
represented is that
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
um you know the 60-day clock is ticking
 
00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
and what we fear
 
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
is that the certification and the
 
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
eligible uses
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
come out at day 58 and then you have to
 
00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
scramble in two days to make a
 
00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.030 align:start position:0%
scramble in two days to make a
certification

00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
get a plan together and receive that
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
money on
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
day 60. um so that's why the urgency has
 
00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
been communicated to treasury uh
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
secretary yellen
 
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
um and of course i'd urge that um that
 
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
folks uh
 
00:54:26.549 --> 00:54:26.559 align:start position:0%
provide her office as much as as much
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
information as she can in order to
 
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
help create that guidance swiftly
 
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
because our communities need that
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
oh just a quick follow-up mr chair
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
any any chance to realize that uh
 
00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
they're boxing
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
everybody in and that to to add to the
 
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
60 days
 
00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
i think there is a lot of concern
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
for both of the recipients of arpa and
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
also for those folks inside treasury
 
00:54:55.109 --> 00:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
pulling that information together i
 
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
think that there is um
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
significant outreach and they're
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
certainly trying to make sure that they
 
00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
work as quickly as they can to get that
 
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:02.559 align:start position:0%
guidance out
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman on two things
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up on that one is
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
there any effort to get the congress to
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
pass something really quickly that would
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
add another
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
month or two uh to that
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
yeah you know asking congress to like
 
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
act within 60 days this
 
00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
might be asking for an impossible feat
 
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
we we have been talking with uh senate
 
00:55:36.069 --> 00:55:36.079 align:start position:0%
finance um
 
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
and with the ways and news committee
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
about the urgency here and we've been of
 
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
course sharing our information with
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
congress so they understand
 
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
the national league of cities the
 
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
national association council state
 
00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:46.230 align:start position:0%
national association council state
governments

00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
governments
 
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
we're all kind of talking with congress
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they understand
 
00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
there's great urgency here and that
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
anything that we can do to help speed up
 
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
is much appreciated yeah and and
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
as part of that could you just tell me
 
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
when does this 60-day clock ring
 
00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
so it started on march 11 and the 60
 
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and if if i could have
 
00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
my follow-up on is
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
ineligible uses it only refers
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
to state territory or tribal government
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
are you saying that somewhere else there
 
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
isn't a definition that says
 
00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
that that also includes towns and
 
00:56:31.359 --> 00:56:32.309 align:start position:0%
that that also includes towns and
counties

00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
counties
 
00:56:36.069 --> 00:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
and cities so that's a great question
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
i feel like maybe you've read the text
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
so in
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
section 602 that is the section
 
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
so subtitle m section 9 to 901
 
00:56:50.069 --> 00:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
um their section 602 specifically refers
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
to how states can spend their money
 
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
section 603 is specifically how local
 
00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:56.230 align:start position:0%
section 603 is specifically how local
governments

00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
governments
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
spend their money the restriction to
 
00:57:01.829 --> 00:57:01.839 align:start position:0%
directly or indirectly offset tax
 
00:57:01.839 --> 00:57:02.630 align:start position:0%
directly or indirectly offset tax
increases

00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
increases
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
only shows up in section 602
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
it does not show up in section 603
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
so you do have a lot of local
 
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
governments looking at that saying well
 
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
the restriction is only for the states
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
in the local government section um so
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
that that that
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
i think is a curiosity um and we
 
00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
certainly need some clarity from the
 
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
treasury on that
 
00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
if i could just get clarity sections b
 
00:57:29.119 --> 00:57:29.510 align:start position:0%
if i could just get clarity sections b
and

00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
c only mention state territory or tribal
 
00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:34.069 align:start position:0%
c only mention state territory or tribal
government

00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
but that does elsewhere in the text
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
include the counties county center
 
00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
that's correct yes yep
 
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:51.030 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
presentation

00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
uh miss brock two quick questions uh
 
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
will there be a document that provides a
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
a layout of the review
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
of the timelines for distribution and
 
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
the appeal process for local communities
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
yes i think treasury was very specific
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
when they were created the cares act
 
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
fund the coronavirus relief fund
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
of what money was owed to what entities
 
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
and then additionally the sequences of
 
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
audit that were required
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
based on the receipt of those money so
 
00:58:22.079 --> 00:58:22.950 align:start position:0%
based on the receipt of those money so
um

00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
what we learned from the coronavirus
 
00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
relief fund is that
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
the sequences of audit have to allow
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
for states and local governments get the
 
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
information together
 
00:58:35.349 --> 00:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
electronically submit the information
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
and for the treasury to process that
 
00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:37.990 align:start position:0%
and for the treasury to process that
information

00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:58:41.829 --> 00:58:41.839 align:start position:0%
so um what we've asked is for timing and
 
00:58:44.069 --> 00:58:44.079 align:start position:0%
specific dates on when that audit will
 
00:58:44.079 --> 00:58:45.190 align:start position:0%
specific dates on when that audit will
occur

00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
occur
 
00:58:47.589 --> 00:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
obviously the recruitment of funds will
 
00:58:47.599 --> 00:58:48.230 align:start position:0%
obviously the recruitment of funds will
occur

00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
occur
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
after the close so december 31st
 
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
2024 they're going to make a
 
00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:54.559 align:start position:0%
determination that
 
00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
all of those funds were used for
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
eligible use categories
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
and then that's when the recruitment of
 
00:59:02.829 --> 00:59:02.839 align:start position:0%
funds clock will start ticking
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh the second question if
 
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799 align:start position:0%
i may mr chair
 
00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:10.480 align:start position:0%

um i i absolutely i believe the staff of
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
can distribute that to you mr chairman
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
we've distributed that but we'll redis
 
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
distribute it again okay representative
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
madame brock i want to thank you for
 
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
your exhaustive
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
report you did a wonderful job
 
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
and my question was the same as the
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
senators uh
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
where will we be able to get copies of
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
this plan
 
00:59:55.349 --> 00:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
off of our computers you're sending
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
something out
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr chairman i want to
 
01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
remind the
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
members that this has been recorded
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
and so you'll be able to uh
 
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to show it to my county
 
01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.950 align:start position:0%
i'm going to show it to my county
commissioners

01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
and to my local offices
 
01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
and selectmen and that because it's
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
important to all of them
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
and we thank you mrs brock
 
01:00:25.829 --> 01:00:25.839 align:start position:0%
okay next is representative ames
 
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and first i just want to
 
01:00:30.789 --> 01:00:30.799 align:start position:0%
echo the
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
appreciation for your comprehensive
 
01:00:33.599 --> 01:00:34.470 align:start position:0%
appreciation for your comprehensive
report

01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is in the process of
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
working through
 
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
a budget um a budget for the next two
 
01:00:47.589 --> 01:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
years we call it the biennium
 
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
and um that's a comprehensive budget
 
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:00:55.829 --> 01:00:55.839 align:start position:0%
that has spanning items that depend on
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
spending sources that are state revenue
 
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
as well as federal revenue
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
and and so
 
01:01:05.349 --> 01:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
what we're going to get federally of
 
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
course matters
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
to the decision i'm aware of
 
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
i've read that vermont has factored into
 
01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
their budget they're working on it too
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
they're a little ahead of us i think
 
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
um an anticipated receipt of
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
our money and um
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
i guess the appropriations related to
 
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
that would be conditional
 
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
on you know the money coming through and
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
on the guidance that we're all waiting
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
for and so forth
 
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
um and it seems like a smart thing to do
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about
 
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
an estimated maybe 960 million dollars
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
that's the number i've heard for
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire um it's a lot of money
 
01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
we're a small state
 
01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
and uh so my question is uh
 
01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
whether other states are doing
 
01:02:01.029 --> 01:02:01.039 align:start position:0%
as i think vermont is doing um
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
what are sort of the limitations on
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
doing something like that
 
01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
um you know that we could just leave it
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
all to the executive
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
some feeling the legislature needs to be
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
involved and that's how the
 
01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation process works
 
01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
so there's definitely a
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
a desire i think i think probably all
 
01:02:23.029 --> 01:02:23.039 align:start position:0%
legislators on this call
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
share in it to set up a process
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
all branches of government in making
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
these decisions not just the chief
 
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
executive officer so maybe you could
 
01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
speak to that
 
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
01:02:43.589 --> 01:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
representative so um
 
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
some states um have uh processes
 
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
that are inclusive of all
 
01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
branches um some states
 
01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
do largely set
 
01:03:01.109 --> 01:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
um appropriations conversations are in
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
and around the executive and then the
 
01:03:02.559 --> 01:03:03.270 align:start position:0%
and around the executive and then the
legislative

01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
the legislative body kind of concurs
 
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
um one of the biggest challenges i would
 
01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:09.670 align:start position:0%
um one of the biggest challenges i would
say

01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
about these funds and to i think to your
 
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
point here
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
is that um should are we accounting for
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
these funds
 
01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
with a with a decent understanding of
 
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
how much we're going to get
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
um so i think it's important to ensure
 
01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
that the secretary
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
of the treasury yellen um that she gives
 
01:03:33.359 --> 01:03:33.750 align:start position:0%
of the treasury yellen um that she gives
us

01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:03:35.829 --> 01:03:35.839 align:start position:0%
an understanding of exactly how much is
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
going to the states
 
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
so that the decision making that happens
 
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
based on the biennium budget which is
 
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
happening right now in many states
 
01:03:47.029 --> 01:03:47.039 align:start position:0%
almost all states and in counties where
 
01:03:47.039 --> 01:03:47.349 align:start position:0%
almost all states and in counties where
we

01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
don't know so secretary ellen has been
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
afforded the opportunity to split the
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
money between two years i don't think
 
01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
she's going to do that
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
but that's written into the legislative
 
01:03:58.309 --> 01:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
text so that's maybe one thing that um
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
that the executive and legislatures need
 
01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
to consider
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
is the fact that maybe half of it will
 
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
come now and half of it will come later
 
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
i think until we better understand
 
01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
exactly how that distribution is going
 
01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
to occur
 
01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
um it's it's very important to be as
 
01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.150 align:start position:0%
um it's it's very important to be as
inclusive

01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
inclusive
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
in the decision making as you possibly
 
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
can because of the
 
01:04:20.309 --> 01:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
abundance of opportunities that may be
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
provided by the loose interpretations of
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
the eligible use category so
 
01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
um i think again you have a significant
 
01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:29.839 align:start position:0%
amount of work ahead of you
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
and not a whole lot of clarity um so the
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
more clarity that comes along of course
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
we'll be pushing it out to our
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
membership and
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
and i know csg will be pushing it out to
 
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
you all um but
 
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
just to be sure it's important to not
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
set the cart before the horse
 
01:04:48.549 --> 01:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm going to sneak a question
 
01:04:48.559 --> 01:04:51.750 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm going to sneak a question
in

01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
on the small jurisdictions where
 
01:04:58.870 --> 01:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
they say the funds should not exceed
 
01:05:01.829 --> 01:05:01.839 align:start position:0%
75 percent of their most recent budget
 
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
like in new hampshire the towns
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
when they handle their budget and have
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
to raise its
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
local taxes it deals with
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
the municipal part the school part and
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
the county part
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
does this indicate it's just the
 
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
municipal part
 
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
at 75 or the total budget for that
 
01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.510 align:start position:0%
at 75 or the total budget for that
community

01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
it says exactly what the ledge text says
 
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
in the bullet point so it says 75 of
 
01:05:36.150 --> 01:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
their budget which
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine mr chairman has
 
01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
created a lot of confusion
 
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
across the country because are we
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
talking about the general government
 
01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
or maybe just the general fund of the
 
01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:47.190 align:start position:0%
or maybe just the general fund of the
government

01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
or are we more inclusive like you said
 
01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
if you have a pk-12 system
 
01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
and you have other enterprises that
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
you're operating under let's say you're
 
01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
operating a parking facility or
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
something else
 
01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
are we including all of those figures
 
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
into the 75
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
of budget figure or are we just looking
 
01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
at general funds so we've asked
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
treasury for clarity on that because
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
obviously the more that you include
 
01:06:14.789 --> 01:06:14.799 align:start position:0%
in that budget figure the better off for
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
those smaller entities
 
01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
but there's no clarity at this point
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
they just say 75 percent of budget
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
they don't say of what budget so
 
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
so we don't know yet because in our
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
most of our communities 90 of our budget
 
01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
well thank you uh representative nunes
 
01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you miss
 
01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
brock for coming in to speak with us
 
01:06:42.559 --> 01:06:43.270 align:start position:0%
brock for coming in to speak with us
today

01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh my my question's a little bit more
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
granular i hope that i hope that uh i'm
 
01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
on a good track with this
 
01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
um it's about the essential workers
 
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
portion of what you were talking about
 
01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
are the decisions about essential
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
workers in in these
 
01:07:01.109 --> 01:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
uh appropriations is this is this
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
only going to be made at our top
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
executive level or will this be made
 
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
at the executive levels of all the
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
different at the state of the county of
 
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
the town
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
because i think there were discrepancies
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
in the past around the pandemic about
 
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
what the governor said was essential to
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
what the town said was
 
01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
essential so there i know that my town
 
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
is going to ask me about this
 
01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
um so thankfully in the in the
 
01:07:26.789 --> 01:07:26.799 align:start position:0%
legislation um
 
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
because there's two different sections
 
01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
section 602 deals with the state
 
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
section 603 deals with the local
 
01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:33.750 align:start position:0%
section 603 deals with the local
governments

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
governments
 
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
there is um the payment of essential
 
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
workers in the state section
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
and then there's an additional payment
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
of the premium pay in the
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
local section as well so the state
 
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
executive will make a determinant of
 
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
essential workers
 
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
the executive of the state will make a
 
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
determination of the
 
01:07:56.069 --> 01:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
workers of the state in that section
 
01:07:58.230 --> 01:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
local governments have the authority
 
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
their executive can determine
 
01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
their essential workers as well so
 
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
thank you that cleared that up for me
 
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
okay representative al uh almi
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
followed by representative spillsbury
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
representative elmi
 
01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you on i was
 
01:08:25.349 --> 01:08:25.359 align:start position:0%
on i just wanted to sorry let uh
 
01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
ms brock uh know that we are uh
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
in in new hampshire in most
 
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
of the towns all of the towns i think
 
01:08:35.199 --> 01:08:36.070 align:start position:0%
of the towns all of the towns i think
and

01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
some of the cities on the school
 
01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:39.759 align:start position:0%
district is totally
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
independent from the municipal
 
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.189 align:start position:0%
independent from the municipal
government

01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
so does the mute does this do the school
 
01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:47.430 align:start position:0%
so does the mute does this do the school
districts

01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
get a share of this and
 
01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
if not are they supposed to somehow
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh be merged in this document
 
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
and work together to figure out
 
01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.430 align:start position:0%
and work together to figure out
everything

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
my school district is incredibly
 
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
independent from
 
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
our city government you right understood
 
01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:11.189 align:start position:0%
our city government you right understood
so

01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:13.829 --> 01:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
similar to oregon similar to texas those
 
01:09:13.839 --> 01:09:14.550 align:start position:0%
similar to oregon similar to texas those
isd

01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
isd
 
01:09:17.669 --> 01:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
programs are are definitely um a
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
consideration here because
 
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
the isd the reason that they are
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
independent is because they
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
have their own capital projects they
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
have their own systematic planning
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
um and there's a reason that their isd
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
so completely understand that
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
that separation there um but
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
and i think this this might muddy the
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
water a little bit from
 
01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh the chairman's question um so if if
 
01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
that if it is
 
01:09:45.269 --> 01:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
an independent school district uh
 
01:09:45.279 --> 01:09:46.470 align:start position:0%
an independent school district uh
structure

01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
structure
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
but yet those schools um let's say they
 
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
are funded by property taxes so the
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
property tax that right flows to the
 
01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over to the operations of
 
01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
the k-12 system
 
01:10:00.310 --> 01:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
the city then will have to determine
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
the the property tax decline
 
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
um as an eligible use category c
 
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
and then make a determination of whether
 
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
or not that replenishment of that money
 
01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
could then spend over into the isds
 
01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
what i would say um in arpa
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
there is an entirely separate section i
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
36 billion dollars that's going to
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
school systems
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
and it's through what's called the
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
education stabilization fund
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
so it's sep so so yes schools are
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
schools are
 
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
a benefactor of the arpa funds
 
01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
in a separate category than the 350
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
oh representative spellsbury thank you
 
01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
ms brock this has been extremely
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
informative i appreciate it
 
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
very much obviously we're focusing our
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
attention here on the 350 billion
 
01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:02.070 align:start position:0%
attention here on the 350 billion
dollars

01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
allocated to states a lot of mystery in
 
01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
the remaining
 
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
1.9 trillion so i'm focused particularly
 
01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.430 align:start position:0%
1.9 trillion so i'm focused particularly
on

01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
my community's plans for a
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
water interconnect project about 4.6
 
01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:19.510 align:start position:0%
water interconnect project about 4.6
million

01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
and a broadband uh infrastructure
 
01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:23.110 align:start position:0%
and a broadband uh infrastructure
project

01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
about 2.1 a million
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
and separately my counties considering
 
01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
a major renovation of the county run
 
01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
nursing home so with those three
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
projects in mind
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
water and nursing home
 
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
they all seem like they may benefit from
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
some portion of this
 
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
pool of funds what i'm interested in is
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
are you aware of other funds
 
01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
outside of this 365 that would be
 
01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:57.590 align:start position:0%
outside of this 365 that would be
targeted

01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
targeted
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
specifically to that kind of project or
 
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
should we expect we have to find the
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
funds to support those
 
01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
from this pool only well thinking about
 
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
those three projects
 
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
in particular um the two the first two
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
the broadband
 
01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
and the water program seemed to fall
 
01:12:16.630 --> 01:12:16.640 align:start position:0%
squarely in lgbt's category d
 
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
of the uh of these funds um
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
so and and then in addition um as
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
as as i was discussing earlier the
 
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
the nursing facility if that is a
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
negative economic impact of covid19 that
 
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
is there was maybe rundown of the
 
01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
facility and you needed to
 
01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
upkeep the facility or create hvac um
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
all of those things then would would
 
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
categorically be
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
an eligible use category a now on the
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
other hand
 
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
they are unique programs so broadband um
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
in and of itself
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
is um it is explicitly listed in these
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
proceeds and it is not explicitly listed
 
01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in arpa
 
01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
water though is a little bit different
 
01:13:01.199 --> 01:13:01.990 align:start position:0%
water though is a little bit different
um

01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
there is a portion of the 1.9 trillion
 
01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:06.310 align:start position:0%
there is a portion of the 1.9 trillion
dollars

01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
that's dedicated to if they're calling
 
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
it low income water assistance program
 
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
so if there has been um a decrease in
 
01:13:16.630 --> 01:13:16.640 align:start position:0%
revenues or rate paying
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
um revenues received in the water
 
01:13:19.199 --> 01:13:20.149 align:start position:0%
um revenues received in the water
facility

01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
that possibly could be recouped in the
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
low-income water facility that's been
 
01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:25.189 align:start position:0%
low-income water facility that's been
created

01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
created
 
01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
through arpa um so there are other
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
circumstances where you may want to
 
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
consider i don't know how um
 
01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:34.640 align:start position:0%
how the water authority might be set up
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
and if it is a political subdivision of
 
01:13:38.709 --> 01:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
the community or if it's run by the
 
01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
community itself um
 
01:13:44.229 --> 01:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
yeah that system might be eligible for
 
01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
the for the rate replacement
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
in that lei he program i i i used an
 
01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:50.070 align:start position:0%
in that lei he program i i i used an
acronym

01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
acronym
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
the low income water assistance program
 
01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:53.669 align:start position:0%
the low income water assistance program
um

01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
so i think there's a lot of reasons to
 
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
kind of start moving down the path of
 
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
what else is there because you sure
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
free up these funds to be used for other
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
things right
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
i think that's the key thing here is
 
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
that you're looking outside of that 350
 
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
billion dollars and that
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
that that low income water assistance
 
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
program might actually be covered
 
01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
in 1.9 trillion dollars in addition what
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
i would say too
 
01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
there is a fair amount of money for
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
hospitals and health care facilities
 
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
inside of the 1.9 trillion dollars it
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
flows through another secretariat by hhs
 
01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:28.070 align:start position:0%
flows through another secretariat by hhs
secretary

01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
secretary
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
at um so the nursing facility may also
 
01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
receive some some kind of assistance
 
01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
through other parts of this program
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
so definitely worth thinking about um
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
and maybe um
 
01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
what i can do is point you out point
 
01:14:44.709 --> 01:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
point out those specific areas
 
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh for you and send that through miss
 
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
floor as well for distribution to this
 
01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:50.390 align:start position:0%
floor as well for distribution to this
committee

01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and again miss
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
brock thank you very much for this great
 
01:14:58.560 --> 01:14:59.430 align:start position:0%
brock thank you very much for this great
presentation

01:14:59.430 --> 01:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
my question goes back to the eligibility
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
usage that you talked about
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine the state of new
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire's uh
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
meals and roads tax has taken a
 
01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
significant revenue hit because of the
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
lack of tourism
 
01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
and travel in the state are you saying
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
that that some of that might be
 
01:15:14.159 --> 01:15:14.950 align:start position:0%
that that some of that might be
recoverable

01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
recoverable
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
through this act yes um so
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
so one of the things is um obviously an
 
01:15:23.189 --> 01:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
eligible use category a
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
they say very specifically that um these
 
01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:26.790 align:start position:0%
they say very specifically that um these
expenditures

01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
can be based specifically on kovid 19 or
 
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
a negative economic impact of covet 19.
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
for example in communities where
 
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
housing i'm sorry hospitality and
 
01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:37.590 align:start position:0%
housing i'm sorry hospitality and
tourism

01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
tourism
 
01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:40.640 align:start position:0%
are relied on so so it could be
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
specifically that you are using these
 
01:15:43.199 --> 01:15:43.669 align:start position:0%
specifically that you are using these
funds

01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
for those communities purposes
 
01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:46.950 align:start position:0%
for those communities purposes
specifically

01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
but then you're also kind of talking
 
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
about eligible use category c
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
which is that revenue replacement
 
01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:53.910 align:start position:0%
which is that revenue replacement
category

01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
category
 
01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
if in those communities they had a
 
01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
booked loss of revenue
 
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
based on let's say it's meal taxes or
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
hotel taxes
 
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
um there was a booked loss in 2020
 
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
what they're trying to say in eligible
 
01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
use category c is that you
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
recognize that book loss and you
 
01:16:12.239 --> 01:16:13.110 align:start position:0%
recognize that book loss and you
replenish

01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
replenish
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
those revenues with these monies
 
01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
and so that that is a that is um
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
congress trying to satisfy one of the
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
biggest challenges that all the
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
communities across the country were
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
saying is
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
we lost a lot of revenue we need to be
 
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
able to use these funds to replace those
 
01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:30.310 align:start position:0%
able to use these funds to replace those
revenues

01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:16:32.149 --> 01:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
um and we fully expect for the
 
01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
communities especially
 
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
in the housing and hospitality i'm sorry
 
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
the hospitality and tourism areas
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
to be leaning heavily on the eligible
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
use category c
 
01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
to recoup those revenues from the book
 
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
loss last year
 
01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much uh
 
01:16:50.719 --> 01:16:53.189 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much uh
representative

01:16:53.189 --> 01:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:16:56.229 --> 01:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
thank you just a clarification of that
 
01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
uh our rooms and mules tax is state
 
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
level and the communities
 
01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
only gets a little of it back in revenue
 
01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.070 align:start position:0%
only gets a little of it back in revenue
sharing

01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
sharing
 
01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
on and it's not according to whether you
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
you need it or not in terms of tourism
 
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
or generated it on
 
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
if we have at the state level uh is this
 
01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
revenue replenishment based on the the
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
net loss across the state budget or
 
01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
is it based on on
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
you lost money in travel and tourism
 
01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
but you gained money back in high-level
 
01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
business taxes yeah i think that's that
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
that yes that's the question that
 
01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
um we're trying to press treasury to be
 
01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
very specific on
 
01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
and and i use the metaphor of the zoo
 
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
so let's say um instead of the zoo let's
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
use it on
 
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
on yields taxes um that goes to the
 
01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:55.189 align:start position:0%
on yields taxes um that goes to the
state

01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:17:57.189 --> 01:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's important that new hampshire
 
01:17:59.350 --> 01:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't have just one number you're not
 
01:18:00.630 --> 01:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
a monolith
 
01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
you have you have what's called fund
 
01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:03.669 align:start position:0%
you have you have what's called fund
accounting

01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
accounting
 
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
you have a booked loss over in the meals
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
taxes while you may not have
 
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
incurred a loss over in property tax
 
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
collection for example
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
we want for the treasury to allow for
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
that booked loss
 
01:18:19.470 --> 01:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
in the meals taxes to be be
 
01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
exclusively a number that you can report
 
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
back to treasury
 
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
so that you can use that to replenish
 
01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
whatever else
 
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
is going on across the enterprise it's
 
01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
like the zoo
 
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
or like the port those types of
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
facilities lost a lot of money last year
 
01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
but you may not have lost money in other
 
01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:37.750 align:start position:0%
but you may not have lost money in other
categories

01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
categories
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that we can
 
01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
classify that look loss
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
specifically in its own operation to
 
01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's complicated but i i
 
01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
you know we're we're hoping for more
 
01:18:56.709 --> 01:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
clarity as quickly
 
01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
as possible and
 
01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
when you get this clarity uh would you
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
be willing to
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
come back to us of course i'd be
 
01:19:07.679 --> 01:19:08.310 align:start position:0%
come back to us of course i'd be
delighted

01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
delighted
 
01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
yes well thank you and i thank you we've
 
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
run out of time
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
because it is now 20 after 10. and we
 
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
scheduled for
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
an hour and we certainly thank you uh
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
miss brock's excellent presentation
 
01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
my pleasure thank you for having me
 
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
for tomorrow i had put a placeholder in
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
but it looks like at this point in time
 
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
we won't need to use that placeholder
 
01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:44.470 align:start position:0%
we won't need to use that placeholder
tomorrow

01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
so we will not be meeting in the morning
 
01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
at nine o'clock
 
01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh for the republicans we're going to
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:19:57.990 --> 01:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
caucus at 1 30 today
 
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
because of i told you yesterday a
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
different time but
 
01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
because we have to jump off on this and
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
get into the
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
chair vice chair meeting that's going on
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
right now and so
 
01:20:16.629 --> 01:20:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:20.229 --> 01:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
all right any for the question represent
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
all me
 
01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
i think represent tucker had her hand up
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
first represent tucker
 
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much yes i just would
 
01:20:30.550 --> 01:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
like to know how we can
 
01:20:32.629 --> 01:20:32.639 align:start position:0%
make it possible for people in our
 
01:20:32.639 --> 01:20:33.590 align:start position:0%
make it possible for people in our
county

01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
county
 
01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
to see the recording could jennifer four
 
01:20:40.629 --> 01:20:40.639 align:start position:0%
send us the way that someone could link
 
01:20:40.639 --> 01:20:41.030 align:start position:0%
send us the way that someone could link
in

01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
to the recording of this meeting
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
and that's what i was going to ask jen
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely i'll send the youtube link um
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
which will be generated
 
01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
after the meeting concludes so i'll
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
follow up um
 
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
later this morning with the link that
 
01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
you can share that would be great and i
 
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
think that the people will probably also
 
01:21:04.709 --> 01:21:04.719 align:start position:0%
want to be able to print the
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh slides so if you could have a
 
01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:10.470 align:start position:0%
uh slides so if you could have a
separate

01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
way to those same people we could send
 
01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
that on to them that would be great
 
01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay put them both in one
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
email and we can just forward it
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
i will do that i would recommend that
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
you encourage your board of selectmen or
 
01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
city councils
 
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
or county commissioners to watch this
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
yes i think probably some of the most
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
useful work we
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
do for them this year thank you
 
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
but now representative
 
01:21:44.550 --> 01:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
thank you my question got answered so
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
now all i have to do is
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh remind the the democrats
 
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
on we have a caucus right after this
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
on if uh reps of gourd can
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
send out the link again to the people
 
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
that tend to lose it
 
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh that would be great i don't think we
 
01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:04.390 align:start position:0%
uh that would be great i don't think we
should

01:22:04.390 --> 01:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
have to take very much time for it but
 
01:22:08.709 --> 01:22:08.719 align:start position:0%
we got something from
 
01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
representative ames this morning
 
01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh we did is that for a different link
 
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
that was a mistake
 
01:22:22.830 --> 01:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
ignored i have mine red flagged and
 
01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:24.070 align:start position:0%
ignored i have mine red flagged and
everything

01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:30.629 --> 01:22:30.639 align:start position:0%
thanks everybody i thought this morning
 
01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
was very beneficial
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
for us and for our state and thank you
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
miss four
