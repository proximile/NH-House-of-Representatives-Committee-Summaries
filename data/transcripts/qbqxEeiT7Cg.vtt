Senate Bill uh 534 relative to campaign
 
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
Finance thank you senator gray for
 
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
joining us for the purpose of here
 
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill um Senator gray
 
00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
welcome uh thank you my name is James
 
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
Gray I represent Senate District 6 which
 
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
starts up in Halton and gilmington and
 
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
comes down Route 11 to
 
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
Rochester um certainly campaign finance
 
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
that you see in
 
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
534 uh as a basis for this bill we took
 
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
some of the work that you guys have done
 
00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh in this committee
 
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
um but since uh the Senators seem to uh
 
00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
get involved much much more in campaign
 
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
Finance than many of the house members
 
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh there were things that we thought uh
 
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
would be better served if uh it had our
 
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
input and so that's what you've got in
 
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 align:start position:0%
front of you uh certainly uh yesterday
 
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
at 11:30 uh there was going to be a
 
00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 align:start position:0%
meeting uh between uh representative
 
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
Lane uh representative bar myself and
 
00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 align:start position:0%
the minority leader in the Senate um to
 
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
go over the things especially the things
 
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
that representative Lane put together um
 
00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
talking about the bills and uh uh that
 
00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:16.599 align:start position:0%
didn't happen because of uh a particular
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
bill that seemed everybody wanted to
 
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 align:start position:0%
talk about uh so right now uh my
 
00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
assistant uh my Aid is trying to
 
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
reschedule that I believe that she has
 
00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
sent uh invitations out to you two uh
 
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
she's gotten a response from uh uh
 
00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
Senator Susi uh and I think that uh
 
00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:41.479 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to uh uh resolve those
 
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
and at least come to to some kind of an
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
agreement to to move forward the bill uh
 
00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 align:start position:0%
and it uh uh looking at your schedule I
 
00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
don't know that that's going to happen
 
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh along your timeline in enough time to
 
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh make it so that the next meeting
 
00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:02.879 align:start position:0%
is your last meeting but we'll give it
 
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
that good old uh legislative
 
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
try uh so if you have any questions
 
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
certainly I'd be willing to answer them
 
00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh but uh campaign Finance reform is
 
00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:20.759 align:start position:0%
needed um certainly you know reports
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
that people can file right now that uh
 
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
people can't read don't do anybody any
 
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:30.280 align:start position:0%
good um and uh other changes that we put
 
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
in there combining groups together so
 
00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:35.479 align:start position:0%
you don't have a candidate or a
 
00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
candidate committee and they combine
 
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
those together and a few of the other
 
00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
things that are done in these bills uh
 
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879 align:start position:0%
certainly will have uh advantages to
 
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
people okay will you be taking questions
 
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
Senator whatever okay are there uh
 
00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee on Senate
 
00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:56.510 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee on Senate
Bill

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
534 oh yes uh representative l
 
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um Senator gray I know
 
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to have that meeting but my
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
my question is one of the differences is
 
00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
that we have a mandatory F you know
 
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:15.560 align:start position:0%
online file filing for the after 2004
 
00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:18.039 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that's in the Senate
 
00:08:20.909 --> 00:08:20.919 align:start position:0%
bill was that one of the concerns that
 
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
the Senators
 
00:08:28.189 --> 00:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
had um when I look at campaign filing um
 
00:08:31.869 --> 00:08:31.879 align:start position:0%
it is uh interesting that uh uh more
 
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
people of one party file electronically
 
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
than the people of the other party and
 
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:41.560 align:start position:0%
I'll let you figure out who that is um I
 
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
have no objection to
 
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:49.720 align:start position:0%
filing um electronically except that uh
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
you know some of the people will find it
 
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
much more difficult uh at least the
 
00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
first time they
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
file um to do it that way um it does
 
00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:02.959 align:start position:0%
provide a level of
 
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
readability uh and the question as to
 
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not you can attach documents
 
00:09:13.949 --> 00:09:13.959 align:start position:0%
to it um the uh my last opponent in the
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
senate race
 
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
um she was very
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
um concerned that I would tell her that
 
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
you know that she could do different
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
things differently uh one of the things
 
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
that in her first filing is that uh she
 
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
provided her campaign $5,000 and her
 
00:09:37.389 --> 00:09:37.399 align:start position:0%
husband provided her campaign
 
00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
$55,000 and listed it as a contribution
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
and I says well you know if you really
 
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to do that if you listed it as a
 
00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
loan and you received more funds
 
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
afterward than you know you could uh uh
 
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
recoup some of that money um and she was
 
00:10:00.069 --> 00:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
kind of you know taken back fact that
 
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
her opponent would actually help her in
 
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
trying to do this uh but I don't know
 
00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
how many of you have uh you know listed
 
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
your your contributions and had the AG
 
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
come back and saying hey uh raise your
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
hand I'm going to slap it because you
 
00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:16.839 align:start position:0%
didn't put your uh donors in
 
00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:20.839 align:start position:0%
alphabetical order okay um you know
 
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
people don't understand that you know in
 
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
the the receipt section you can have
 
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
loans you can have different things in
 
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
different categories Ries um which you
 
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
know makes it much
 
00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
more um financially
 
00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
uh sensitive okay to to to what you need
 
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
to do um and the online system helps you
 
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
through that and some of the new
 
00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
features that they've got uh so I you
 
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
know I went to them and I says okay now
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know the interest rates are up now I
 
00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
have to worry about uh the the funds
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
that I have in my campaign account
 
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
accruing interest and you know how do I
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
put that in there and it
 
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
says you know and again you know some of
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
those things are taken care of in the
 
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
new system so I look forward to to using
 
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
the new system I haven't logged in I've
 
00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:21.399 align:start position:0%
told that some people have had great
 
00:11:25.389 --> 00:11:25.399 align:start position:0%
difficulty in doing that um but uh the
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
next report isn't due until June so I
 
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
further questions from the
 
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:35.720 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing none thank you Senator
 
00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
gray um only other pink card I have is
 
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh deputy secretary of state Aaron
 
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
Hennessy is the the only other person in
 
00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
friends good morning aarin Hennessy
 
00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary estate good to see all
 
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
of you um we are in support of this bill
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
we are also in support of the houses
 
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:02.120 align:start position:0%
version ideally what we would like to
 
00:12:04.269 --> 00:12:04.279 align:start position:0%
see is just kind of a combination of the
 
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
great things that both of them have in
 
00:12:09.629 --> 00:12:09.639 align:start position:0%
them to um Senator Gray's talking and
 
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative Lane's question um the
 
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
requirement that it be filed through the
 
00:12:17.629 --> 00:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
new campaign Finance system I think is a
 
00:12:21.069 --> 00:12:21.079 align:start position:0%
good thing and one of the reasons why
 
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
other than for transparency purposes is
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
that um when we take a document and scan
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
it up and put it online it is not ad
 
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
compliant um and it's not accessible on
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
our website and um the US doj has come
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
out with um the eternal general has come
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
out with uh a new ruling and the
 
00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:42.839 align:start position:0%
requirement um by a certain amount of
 
00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:45.399 align:start position:0%
time that everything like that document
 
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:49.240 align:start position:0%
needs to be accessible so um we our
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
office would if somebody doesn't file it
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
online would have to manually type in
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
everything so that it would be
 
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
accessible um which we just don't have
 
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
the staff to do um so that is is one
 
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
thing we like about um The house's
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
version we also like some some of the
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
definitions um that are in The house's
 
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
version um we like the some of the
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
things that are in the Senate's version
 
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
the the political
 
00:13:19.189 --> 00:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
action Pao um uh advocacy organizations
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
the definition maintaining that
 
00:13:22.509 --> 00:13:22.519 align:start position:0%
definition in there makes it clear that
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
they still have to register and file
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
with our office
 
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
um trying to think several other things
 
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to I'm right now I'm going
 
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
through and kind of combining the two um
 
00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
together um another thing might be the
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
definition of of the size that needs to
 
00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
be have the um disclaimer on it the
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
Senate kept the I think it's 72 square
 
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
inches which is the size of a um bumper
 
00:13:52.829 --> 00:13:52.839 align:start position:0%
sticker in there our office does get a
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
lot of calls about the the language
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
currently in statute of what what's a
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
button what do I need to put a
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
disclaimer on if I do give out little
 
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
magnets do I have to put the disclaimer
 
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
on that and um buttons can be various
 
00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:10.519 align:start position:0%
sizes it right now it includes cars does
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
wrapping a campaign bus not mean to be
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
disclosed or a big box car that goes
 
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
down the street so we would like to see
 
00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:20.959 align:start position:0%
that a size be put in there just so
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
users like yourselves um don't have to
 
00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:25.959 align:start position:0%
